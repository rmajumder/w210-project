  "<p>Dave Bassett was still waiting for his first victory as Leicester City's caretaker manager last night after his temporary charges conceded a late own-goal for the second game in succession.</p> <p>Just as Chris Makin had deflected a cross into Kevin Pressman's goal at Coventry City on Saturday, Matt Heath followed suit with a header past the veteran keeper. </p> <p>Yet, while the equaliser was fortuitous, it was no more than Joe Royle's watchable collection of youngsters and free transfers deserved, not least because they were denied what appeared a perfectly good goal shortly before the bizarre denouement. </p> <p>Much to the amazement of many inside the Walkers Stadium, including Royle, the referee Tony Leake ruled that the Ipswich striker Shefki Kuqi had kicked the ball out of Pressman's hands before prodding it over the goalline. </p> <p>\"I was puzzled by his decision,\" I've got a lot of time for the referee - he's one of the better officials. But I think he'll be embarrassed when he looks at a replay of the incident. It was obvious from where I was that the keeper had dropped the ball; it was a bar of soap job. There was no one near him. And you do not often see my players bother referees but they became quite animated.\" </p> <p>Heath's gaffe, however, not only defused the controversy but also earned him the unenviable distinction of scoring at both ends. </p> <p>Earlier his right-footed volley that dispatched Jamie Scowcroft's headed knock-down past Lewis Price looked to have sealed a spirited comeback from the Foxes. </p> <p>That followed an inauspicious start which saw the visitors score from their first attack when Ian Westlake chipped the ball home after Pressman had blocked a shot by Darren Bent. </p> <p>Bent, another of Ipswich's youngsters, came within a whisker of adding a second when his left-foot shot deflected off Heath and just wide of Pressman's right-hand post. </p> <p>Yet come half-time, the visitors were indebted to Price, their least experienced player, for remaining on level terms. Lewis, who was making only his fourth league start, made three superb saves but was helpless to intervene when David Connolly equalised - courtesy of yet another Scowcroft knockdown. Danny Tiatto and Connolly twice were also thwarted before Heath ended his resistance. </p> <p>Pressman, meanwhile, was similarly inspired as Ipswich produced the menacing football that made them the Championship's joint-leading scorers before kick off. Heath's effort, however, proved unstoppable but, predictably, did not leave the garrulous Bassett lost for words. </p> <p>Neither did it subdue his optimism for Leicester City's future but whether it will be under his control remains uncertain. </p> <p>\"I saw enough there to know there is scope for improvement,\" he said. \"I expect to be in charge of the side against Stoke on Saturday. After that things will depend on the board's strategy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Michael Owen's first Real Madrid goal could not have been more crucial as it secured a second Group B win for the nine times champions and went some way to reviving the campaign after that crushing defeat at Bayer Lerverkusen. </p> <p>However Real were also indebted to their goalkeeper Iker Casillas for several fine saves, while Kiev contributed to the defeat with some poor shooting Zinedine Zidane and Raul also hit posts. Real now lie third on goal difference from Kiev and Leverkusen, who stay top. All three have six points. </p> <p>\"It's been a fantastic night,\" Owen said later. \"Going away with the England team probably helped me; being back with my mates has given me a lot of confidence. I've come back with a fresh spring in my step. </p> <p>\"I wasn't expecting to come here and play in every game; I knew I was going to have to bide my time. I've always been one to back myself and I can't think of anyone who would turn down the chance to play at a club like this.\" </p> <p>Owen's goal owed much to to the efforts of Ronaldo and the substitute Santiago Solari, who had just come on for Luis Figo. He made an excellent break down the right and laid the ball off to the Brazilian, who ran at the defence. </p> <p>He, in turn, left Tiberiu Ghioane on the edge of the box before crossing to Owen, who beat the goalkeeper to give Real their deserved lead. </p> <p>\"I knew I would have to fight to get minutes on the pitch,\" Owen added. \"The first few months have been difficult but it's all starting to come together now.\" </p> <p>It is looking increasingly likely that Europe may be Real's only chance of major success this season. At the weekend they dropped into the bottom half of the table thanks to a 1-1 draw at Real Betis and they trail the unbeaten leaders, Barcelona, by nine points after seven matches. </p> <p>Bayer Leverkusen won 3-1 against Roma, still without a point and who finished the game with nine men after first Cristian Panucci and then Daniele De Rossi were sent off. </p> <p>The match had begun promisingly enough for Roma, Dimitar Berbatov giving them the lead by putting through his own goal. But Roque Junior levelled it after the interval, Jacek Krzynowek put them ahead and Franca completed the scoring in injury time. </p>",
  "<p>Andre Agassi still has a few appointments left on the tour that he wants to keep. One is with Jim McIngvale, the Texas furniture businessman who last year seemed to think that the $27m he had invested in the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston entitled him to cheer his fellow American even if the way in which he did it upset the other players. </p> <p>If Agassi is again to receive the benefits of Mattress Mac's adulation next month it would help if the 34-year-old prevented Tim Henman from justifying his top-seed status at the Masters Series here this week. That would earn Agassi 100 points and move him into the top eight who qualify for the year-end finals.</p> <p>On the evidence of a difficult 7-6, 6-4 win over Max Mirnyi, Agassi is still capable of doing that. He had not competed for six weeks since the US Open and had to cope with conditions that suited the big-serving Belarussian, the ball whipping through the thinner air so sharply that it took 19 tries before the best returner of serve in the world could win a point against Mirnyi's delivery.</p> <p>But after going a mini-break down in the tie-break and still sneaking it by seven points to five, Agassi changed to a different string tension and acquired more ball control. Eventually he even found time to lecture the umpire on how to calm down and to glare at one of the model-come-ball-girls who had incorrectly taken up a position alongside a colleague at the back of the court instead of at the net.</p> <p>\"It was difficult, to say the least, to concentrate on the ball but I suppose I had an advantage; I'm used to playing with my wife,\" Agassi said tongue in cheek but changing to serious mode immediately. \"You know I think it's important for our sport to understand its product clearly. And I'm not quite convinced it's part of our product.\"</p> <p>Henman makes his bow today, by which time he will not have competed for 24 days since the Davis Cup in Austria after which he was complaining of a bad back and shoulder. Such things make his form a little bit of an unknown quantity and could turn his opening match against the former French Open champion Albert Costa before a partisan crowd into an ordeal.</p> <p>Costa admits Henman is currently in a richer vein of form than he is. \"We have played each other a lot. I've beaten him and he's beaten me. He's in better form than I am but I can go out with nothing to lose.\"</p> <p>At the Zurich Challenge Venus Williams avenged her controversial exit from this year's Wimbledon with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Karolina Sprem. Williams's win marked the first meeting between the two players since that June encounter when Sprem was helped to victory by a mistake by the umpire Ted Watts, who awarded the 19-year-old Croatian an extra point during a second-set tie-break.</p> <p>At the Madrid Masters Spain's teenage Davis Cup hero Rafael Nadal cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Davide Sanguinetti. The German Tommy Haas, too, took advantage of the fast indoor court to claim a 6-4, 6-1 victory over the Belgian Xavier Malisse. Spain's Fernando Verdasco beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman 6-1, 6-2 and Taylor Dent of America beat Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2.</p>",
  "<p>This is not the kind of suspense to make nerve ends crackle at Anfield. No one is galvanised by the recognition that Liverpool could as easily finish bottom of Group A as win it. Rafael Ben\u00edtez's team, with a single home fixture left, are now two points behind the Monaco club whom they overcame so easily last month. </p> <p>Whether one looks at Europe or the Premiership, the prospects remain obscure. Liverpool's manager is instilling his methods and there were periods of domination over a lacklustre Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a but Ben\u00edtez's side could not capitalise on the good fortune that implored them to put the ball in the net. </p> <p>Despite the \u00a314.1m Djibril Ciss\u00e9, who bridled at his eventual substitution, the prospect of new investment at Liverpool will be seen by the fans primarily as a means to secure a top-class striker. Any newcomer dropped into the scene, though, would be crash-landing in a stressful environment. </p> <p>Liverpool are the one English side to have lost a match in this season's Champions League. The squad is thin and so, too, is the confidence of the players. The syndrome was apparent in Milan Baros and the golden boot winner of Euro 2004 turned into the ditherer of Anfield after 28 minutes. </p> <p>The build-up was unusually acute as Ciss\u00e9 made a slippery turn and Dietmar Hamann's pass sprang the offside trap for the Czech attacker. After rounding the goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Molina, though, Baros still wanted to check his position and so gave hope to Manuel Pablo, who made one of several good challenges. </p> <p>Despite the involvement of the two forwards in that move, the suspicion is great that Ciss\u00e9 and Baros are alternatives rather than partners. It says much for the magnanimity of the audience that there were cheers for the news of Michael Owen's first goal for Real Madrid rather than curses at the loss of his talent. </p> <p>Not even Deportivo's vulnerability could provoke Liverpool to ruthlessness. There were lengthy passages of authority in midfield but the passing could not turn into a chain reaction, while the attackers failed to pierce the Deportivo back four regularly enough. </p> <p>Javier Irureta's team stay bottom of the group and it was easy to spot that they dread elimination from the Champions League. By and large, though, it was pieces of good fortune that invited Liverpool to put the visitors out of their misery. </p> <p>The ball ran kindly to Ciss\u00e9 after a run by Luis Garcia in the 19th minute but the alert Manuel Pablo came up with a tackle before the Frenchman could produce a shot. Eleven minutes before the interval a ricochet again cosseted Liverpool as Xabi Alonso's shot deflected to Luis Garcia only for his unsatisfactory finish to be tipped over by Molina. </p> <p>The goalkeeper had earlier parried a drive that Ciss\u00e9 hit on the turn from a Garcia cut-back. Preoccupied as Liverpool are with the problem of rejoining the elite, they should have made short work of Deportivo, as Monaco had done. </p> <p>The little that last season's semi-finalists had to offer could have hurt Liverpool, however. After quarter of an hour Alberto Luque's corner was met by the brow of Cesar and John Arne Riise had to react well to head off the line at the far post. </p> <p>Anfield is, nonetheless, still a reservoir of trust and faith where fans, well aware of a heritage frittered, still see encouragement as the starting point of resurgence. These are lucky players, whose good intentions get cheered as if they were solid achievements. </p> <p>Liverpool were at least to manoeuvre more confidently once their path was smoothed by the injury that ensured the substitution of Deportivo's World Cup winner Mauro Silva. </p> <p>The revivalist mood, however, had still not reached the strikers and it was the unambitious Deportivo who had the first good chance following the interval. After an hour Victor put an inswinging cross behind the defence and, if the rushing Juan Carlos Valeron could have made solid contact, Liverpool would have been behind. </p> <p>Something had to change, with Ben\u00edtez's forwards waning to the extent that the manager even preferred to replace Ciss\u00e9 with the midfielder-cum-full-back, Steve Finnan. In an increasingly fragmented fixture the team were looking for a scrap of luck. </p> <p>Anfield was eventually reduced to hoping that Anders Frisk would send off one of the Deportivo players who had already been booked. All that angry beseeching was further proof that Liverpool, at present, cannot be the masters of their own fate. </p>",

  "At last! We can walk west along the track on Broomhead Moor Side without a care in the world; without the need for a glance over our shoulders. Until late September this jewel of the sporting shooting world - Broomhead Moor - was totally forbidden ground. A century ago it was the most productive grouse ground in Britain, if not Europe, and between the wars Hermann Goering promised to come here and show his superior eye to mere north countrymen. He never arrived. <p>Many's the time I've gone up and down this drive to creep past the substantial cabin overlooking Side Head Beck and only once did I meet opposition. We were following the bank of the Ewden Beck in a thick, dark mist and suddenly came face to face with the landowner as he popped over a wall. He was generous enough and sent us on our way towards the watershed of Howden Edge and Open Country. </p> <p>The other day we had the run of the moorsides, lit by a brilliant autumn sun. From the Fox Stones we pulled up through the dried and faded heather blooms to skirt Candlerush Edge and so to the summit of Pike Low. Here, at almost 1,570 feet, is the largest prehistoric cairn in the south Pennines - a great dome of gathered stones covering the sacred site of some long forgotten burial. It's easy to see why this place was chosen: it has a dominating viewpoint of the Midhope Moors and is not much lower than the high points on the watershed to the west - Outer Edge, Margery Hill and High Stones - that separates the Derwent and tributaries of the Don. Away to the north, beyond Langsett, the blades of the Royd Moor wind-farm turbines turned gently against a pallid blue sky.</p>",
  "<p>The furniture group MFI is believed to be close to forcing a settlement in a bitter trademark feud with Homebase that stems from secret takeover talks between the two companies two years ago, the Guardian has learned. </p> <p>MFI alleges that the home improvements chain is rolling out copycat branding throughout its new in-store home furnishings shops, known as MI Home. But Homebase has so far resolutely rebuffed MFI protestations, promising investors that MI Home outlets would be in all of its stores by next Easter. </p> <p>MFI has struggled in recent years against intense competition from a wave of new furniture retailing competitors, including Homebase, Argos, Marks &amp; Spencer, and B&amp;Q. </p> <p>MFI quietly filed its claim against Homebase at the high court in June after nine months of furious legal correspondence. It is seeking unspecified damages and radical changes to the MI Home branding. </p> <p>The claim states: \"The defendant has made it clear that it intends to ignore [MFI's] objections.\" But a source familiar with the dispute said it could be settled imminently. </p> <p>In the claim, MFI reveals that for six months in 2002 it had been in secret talks with the Homebase board about a possible takeover of the DIY chain. The talks, never disclosed to the market, petered out in June that year. Five months later, GUS, the owner of Argos, acquired Homebase for \u00a3900m. </p> <p>Lawyers for MFI point out that during the fruitless takeover talks Homebase had suggested featuring MFI outlets within its stores. </p> <p>Mock-up floor plans were drawn up by Conran Design Group, a consultancy firm hired by MFI a year earlier to help to reposition the furniture group's image. Central to the consultancy's new look for MFI was ditching the \"MFI Homeworks\" logo in favour of \"mfi\", written in lower case, pale blue letters against a white background. </p> <p>Homebase has since enraged MFI's chief executive, John Hancock, by branding its home furnishing departments \"mi HOME\", using white lettering against a pale blue background as well as similar lower-case lettering. </p> <p>Homebase refused to give the Guardian permission to photograph its MI Home in-store shops. </p> <p>Papers filed with the court reveal that MFI has spent almost \u00a3220m carrying out the branding recommendations from CDG - established by Sir Terence Conran, though no longer linked to him. </p> <p>They included store refit specifications and an advertising campaign featuring Martine McCutcheon and Lenny Henry proclaiming: \"All the big names, under one roof.\" </p> <p>Last June MFI told investors that sales at its refitted stores had, on average, increased by a quarter.</p>",
  "<b> Matters of dispute</b> <br> <p><b> Fatboy grim</b><br> </p> <p>For someone who specialises in parties of the apolitical variety, Norman Cook, better known as Fatboy Slim, can't seem to shake off the politicians. His anthem Praise You was unofficially adopted by both Tony Blair in 1999 and Al Gore in 2000. Now Labour are at it again, playing his 1998 hit Right Here, Right Now at their recent conference in Brighton, and blasting it from campaign buses at the Hartlepool byelection. </p> <p>\"I want people to know I had no choice,\" responded an aggrieved Cook, an opponent of the war in Iraq. \"Apparently as long as they pay the performing royalties, we have no say in it.\" So it proves. According to Jill Drew of the song-licensing body Phonographic Performance Ltd, Labour exploited a copyright grey area; the artist's permission is required if a political party wants a song as its official campaign tune, but not if it's played informally. </p> <p>Cook's frustration is understandable: he wasn't given the chance to do what any sensible musician should do if ever a politician hoves into view - run like the wind. It's impossible to think of the dance duo D:Ream without picturing John Prescott dancing to Things Can Only Get Better at Labour's 1997 post-election shindig with all the genuine enthusiasm of someone with a gun held to his back. The devoutly socialist Primal Scream were apoplectic when Labour shortlisted Moving On Up for their 2001 election theme tune (they eventually opted for the Lighthouse Family's blandly reassuring Lifted). In America, Bruce Springsteen famously declined Ronald Reagan's request to use Born in the USA as his campaign anthem, and Tom Petty had to stop George W Bush from coopting I Won't Back Down. </p> <p>Baby-kissers are usually drawn to big, bumper-sticker choruses (hence Right Here, Right Now), while ignoring everything else. Reagan missed Born in the USA's anti-war message despite the giveaway couplet \"Sent me off to Vietnam/To go and kill the yellow man\", and Labour adopted the Farm's All Together Now for the 1999 Scottish elections, ignoring the crucial fact that the song is set in the killing fields of Flanders. </p> <p>Perhaps the most curious collision of band and politician occurred at the 2000 Conservative party conference, when someone randomly chose a Massive Attack album to fill time until a technical hitch was overcome. TV cameras accidentally showed William Hague soundtracked by the skulking reggae of Man Next Door. Of course, Hague would never have intentionally selected a suffocating, paranoid rant about a threatening character who lives next door. Tony Blair might consider it, though. <br><b>Dorian Lynskey</b> </p> <p><b> Tricks of the trade</b><br> </p> <p><b> The K2 of window cleaning </b><br> </p> <p>The modern equivalent of painting the Forth Bridge must be cleaning the windows of 30 St Mary Axe, aka the Gherkin, the Norman Foster-designed building which this week won the \u00a320,000 Riba Stirling Prize. The 180m-high tower is, of course, a wonder - a beautiful addition to the London skyline, an instant icon, a modern-day St Paul's. But did the architects never pause to think about the job they were giving those poor window cleaners? </p> <p>The building has 24,000 square metres of external glass, equivalent to five football pitches (or one-14,000th the size of Wales). No one seems to know how many panes of glass there are, preferring to quote the fact that, despite appearances, only one of them is curved - the one, weighing 250kg, at the very top of the tower. </p> <p>The company with the onerous task of cleaning them is Lancaster Cleaning, which is based in Bromley, Kent. Lancaster is the ne plus ultra of the window-cleaning world - it does the NatWest Tower (now, inexplicably, rebranded Tower 42 - where are the other 41?) and large chunks of Canary Wharf. But the Gherkin is its greatest challenge. \"It is an iconic building,\" says Lancaster's deputy managing director, Andy Deeker, and the windows have to be cleaned to an exceptionally high standard. It's a 24/7 job and we have a resident manager on the site.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, so far (and this is a Guardian world exclusive!) the outsides of the windows have not been cleaned at all. Lancaster's full-time, five-person team are still getting training on how to use the cradle that gives them access to the 40 floors of the building. (They have managed to reach the windows at ground level, but that's another storey.) </p> <p>\"Because of the shape of the tower, the cradle doesn't just move straight down,\" Deeker explains. \"It edges out.\" (A diagram would be useful here.) It is, says Deeker, a much trickier proposition than the taller Tower 42. The latter may be the Everest of window cleaning, but the Gherkin is the K2 - the test for the true window-cleaning connoisseur. And, as on K2, wind is a problem: the cradle cannot be used at speeds higher than 21mph. Forget the bloke with a ladder and a bucket; this is extreme window cleaning.

There was no question of finding a replacement. The boiler-suited lads munching Yorkie bars in the local Kwik-Fit had no suggestions. But, I seized on their empty cans of Fanta and chocolate-flavoured Nurishment. With one bound, I cut these open, rolled them flat and wrapped them around the fractures in the exhaust pipe. A couple of Jubilee clips clamped this right royal ensemble together, and, hey presto, the Jag was off again burbling purposefully towards the Cornish Riviera. Tin cans had come to my rescue. They stayed in place for at least the next year. </p> <p>This week, though, Sainsbury's has sounded the death knell for the domestic tin can: its premium chopped tomatoes, the first to go, are now stacked on shelves in Tetra Pak cartons. As time munches on, shoppers can expect chopped spinach, petits pois and corn segments to be sold the same way. Will baked beans and condensed soup follow? Nurishment and Fanta? </p> <p>Made of layers of paperboard, polymers and aluminium foil, cartons, it is claimed, are lighter and easier to stack than tin cans and less greedy for hard-won space in the kitchen fridge. They are also safer, if sometimes splashier, to open. Fine. But, will we find a place in our hearts, art and classic cars for them as we have for the tin can? </p> <p>Forty-two years ago, when my Jag was on the production line at Browns Lane, Coventry, and schoolchildren made toy telephones from pieces of string threaded through tin cans, Andy Warhol transformed the can into a work of art. The artist's first show at the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles featured his 32 Campbell's Soup Cans, a deadpan, silk-screen commentary on mass-produced branded goods. </p> <p>I have seen tins of canned soup, cabbage, baked beans, corned beef and pemmican stacked, like a 3-D Warhol print, in Captain Scott's Antarctic cabin at Cape Evans. I have eaten bully beef from a tin dug up from a trench on the Somme and lived to tell the digestible tale. Perhaps it is potty to be soft on tin cans and hard on paperboard containers, yet, I can't imagine how a Tetra Pak would ever get an old Jaguar to Cornwall, much less bully beef to a French lunch table 80 years on.<br> <b>Jonathan Glancey</b></p>",
  "I complain a lot (in my own time ...) about the proliferation of stories concerning IVF and fertility in general, since I can generally detect a conservative and/or misogynistic subtext to them, a niggling \"you can't have it all, girls\" message in every anecdotal conception trauma dressed up as news. But at the very least, you can find a correlation between the rising prominence of IVF in the news agenda and its increasing occurrence in the health service. <p>The number of women having IVF each year has reached the region of 30,000. Regardless of the spin you put on their individual stories (selfish, NHS-draining feminist hellcats or regular people having a medical procedure?), their number is substantial enough to warrant a place in cultural debate. </p> <p>The same couldn't be said for \"the young career women who are putting motherhood on ice\", a story from the weekend papers about women who are freezing their eggs so they have time to have a career and find a perfect mate, rather than getting a career, then settling for the first chap who comes along with passable motility. </p> <p>This was trumpeted with remarkable prominence in the Independent on Sunday. Clinics \"around the country\" were reporting \"increasing numbers\" of women who chose the freezing for \"lifestyle\", rather than medical, reasons. It sounds like a bit of a trend, doesn't it, something to maybe keep an eye on, if only from an anthropological point of view. You have to dive in a really committed way into the text before you get to any figures. </p> <p> By \"around the country\" they mean that nine clinics are offering this treatment. By \"increasing numbers\", they mean that eight out of 26 women, in the instance they gave, were undergoing it for lifestyle reasons. If each clinic has the same number of ball-busting, career-loving lifestyle-seekers, that is still only 72 women. In the whole of Great Britain. I bet there are more women who practise fish taxidermy, who go naked curling, who re-enact famous battles of the English civil war every weekend. </p> <p>The egg-freezing business might lack the spontaneity that some fondly attach to the miracle of birth, but if this is a trend, then so is a polyester bed-jacket with puppies appliqued on to the collar. You can do this with practically any birth-based \"craze\" you come across in the media - the women who leave it too late to find a partner and then engage in \"sperm banditry\" (conceiving without checking whether it's OK with the sperm manufacturer); the women who leave it a little bit late, then have a premature menopause and find it's suddenly way too late. Always skip to the figures: most of the time, they barely count as a handful. </p> <p>If you file the nuts and bolts of conception under \"personal choice\", it all seems very strange. Personal choices obviously do make the news, but only if a lot of people are making the same ones. If, on the other hand, you file unusual conception methods under \"crime or misdemeanour\", their status in the agenda suddenly makes sense. Aberrant behaviour doesn't need the meat of numbers to make it interesting, it's interesting all on its own. These stories can only loom so large on the landscape if the subtext exists that they are unnatural, wrong and, crucially, a matter of public rather than private interest. </p> <p>The boundary between public and private can't get any more blurred than it does in childbirth. The law takes it as given that, at a certain point in gestation, the foetus has rights distinct from those of its parents and at that point, any choices made by said parents could no longer be called \"personal\". But the law at least has the grace to formalise that boundary: to determine a time at which abortion is no longer permissible, to establish the furthest acceptable limits of genetic engineering, and so on. </p> <p>The media has no such compunction. It simply decides, according to nothing more rigorous than whim, the point at which a woman's choice becomes a matter of public interest. It then magnifies those choices until they seem ludicrously prevalent to avoid the obvious question we might otherwise ask: \"Why are you banging on about this so much?\" </p> <p>The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that, for all the lip service paid to a woman's right to choose, there is still deep-seated reluctance to cede fertility control to the individual. Unless, of course, that individual happens to be male. In that case, he could be laying down sperm for the future in the freezers of his local KwikSave. Not until it was such a trend that there was no room for the fishfingers would you hear a squeak about it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:zoe_williams @ntlworld.com\">zoe_williams @ntlworld.com</a></p>",
  "Tim Binyon, who has died of heart failure aged 68, won the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2002 for his biography of Aleksander Pushkin. That triumph, at the end of his Oxford teaching career, inaugurated a retirement filled by happiness with Helen, his wife since 2000, a new house and garden, a lecture tour to America planned for later this year, and the prospect of new research for a biography of Lermontov ahead of him. From 1965 he was tutor in Russian at Wadham College, of which he was a fellow from 1968 until last year. <p>Tim's career in Russian was formed alongside that of a generation of fellow-intellectuals - Michael Frayn, Alan Bennett, Dennis Potter - in the last years of national service, when the Joint Services School of Linguists trained the brightest young men as Russian speakers to enhance cold-war intelligence resources. The fearsome weekly vocabulary tests left them all with a lifelong ability to reel off, in Russian, the parts of a machine-gun or a submarine. </p> <p>For Tim, it also provided a first, seductive encounter with Russian literature and culture, and led him to change his plan to read history at Exeter College, Oxford, and study Russian and German instead. His first university job teaching Russian was in his home city of Leeds, but then, in 1965, came the return to Oxford. </p> <p>After writing his doctorate on the symbolist poet Valery Bryusov, Tim's academic focus remained on poetry for the rest of his career. His earliest publication, with Ronald Hingley, was Russian: A Beginners' Course, but this was swiftly followed by A Soviet Verse Reader (1964), an introduction to officially published poets which opened a new world to students of the day. In Mayakovsky, on whom he was to lecture throughout his career, he found \"robust humour and a startling poetic technique\", even if Mayakovsky's reputation had been grossly inflated by Soviet propaganda. In 1973 a substantial article on Lermontov, Tiutchev and Fet gave most attention to the last - and relatively neglected - of these three mid-19th-century poets, and demonstrated Fet's importance to Russian symbolism. </p> <p>In 1974, Tim married Felicity Butterwick, and the north Oxford household including her four daughters, and then their own daughter Polly, on whom Tim doted, became the scene for wonderful parties. Many will remember him for his attractive voice, and for his deep chuckle. Such occasions would find Tim in expansive mood, particularly when presiding over his good food and exceptional wines. </p> <p>The next phase of his life marked a broadening of his interests away from Russian and Oxford towards the metropolis, and a different readership. His first thriller, Swan Song (1982), is an erudite, well-crafted novel rich with details of Russian life and history, deriving its contexts from Mussorgsky's opera Khovanshchina. At the same time, Tim was establishing himself as an outstanding reviewer of crime fiction for the London papers; his regular work for the Times Literary Supplement caught the attention of the poet Joseph Brodsky, who described him as a \"genius of the prose poem\". The admiration was mutual. Tim's second thriller, Greek Gifts (1988), reflected summers holidaying and windsurfing in the Greek islands, and was followed by his academic study of the detective novel, Murder Will Out (1989). </p> <p>\"Do you really think so?... Hmmm\" - the quizzical, slightly mocking and challenging glance was a typical response from Tim to any opinion ventured without sufficient grounds for one's views. Tim could be difficult to talk to if he was in unforthcoming mood; former students recall tutorials with him when he would say almost nothing after the weekly essay had been read out. You could be left feeling frustrated and ill-at-ease, since there was no doubt of his formidable critical intelligence. Yet his scorn for inaccuracy in translation classes, or woolliness in critical writing, was an excellent pedagogical weapon and helped to bring the best out in students. Not surprisingly, Tim was also an excellent member to have on college or university committees - not keen to become absorbed in administration, but incisive and brisk. </p> <p>Tim's biography of Pushkin was a labour of many years - he was not one to be rushed by the pressure of research assessment exercise deadlines - and much was owed to the encouragement of his second wife, Helen Ellis, at Harper Collins. The book is beautifully produced and illustrated. No new archival sources were sought out - Tim never went back to Russia after his student days - but the work draws on all the new Russian scholarship, and reads vividly and dynamically with its numerous extracts from letters and diaries. Tim speaks relatively little about the poetry, except as a reflection of lived experience. It is a compelling recreation of Pushkin's world - the gossip, the squabbles, the publishing plans, the parties, the pretty women. Like his protagonist Pushkin, Tim has now been cut off in his prime, but he has left a monument to himself in his wonderful introduction to Russia's greatest poet. </p> <p>His first marriage ended in divorce - although Tim remained on good terms with Felicity. He is survived by Helen and his daughter. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Timothy John Binyon, writer and teacher, born February 18 1936; died October 8 2004</p>",

  "<p>A ferocious battle to control South Africa's Gold Fields company looks certain after its management last night rejected an $8bn (\u00a34.4bn) takeover bid from rival Harmony Gold. </p> <p>The all-share offer - at a near 30% premium to last Thursday's share price - was dismissed as \"inadequate\" by the Gold Fields board which said it wanted to press ahead with an alternative merger involving Iamgold of Canada. </p> <p>There was speculation that the Harmony move might trigger rival bids for Gold Fields from other large companies in the industry such as Newmont or Barrick. </p> <p>Harmony launched its offensive with the backing of the Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin, whose Norilsk Nickel has a 20% shareholding in Gold Fields. </p> <p>He has supported the offer to create the biggest gold producer in the world partly to derail the $2bn planned merger with Iamgold. </p> <p>Bernard Swanepoel, chief executive of Harmony, said his company had a strong track record of acquiring assets with good turnaround potential and turning them into major moneyspinners. </p> <p>\"We calculate that we need a 15% cost reduction on Gold Fields' South Africa assets to justify our premium from this source alone,\" he explained. Harmony advisers made clear last night that it would not be put off easily. </p> <p>But the Gold Fields board was scathing about the proposal, saying it \"significantly undervalues Gold Fields' high quality portfolio of assets and completely disregards the significant value that will be created from the Iamgold transaction\". </p> <p>It said the premium to the closing price of Gold Fields shares in New York on Friday was 7%. </p> <p>The Harmony offer is contingent on the tie-up with Iamgold being abandoned and the South African move led to the Canadian company's shares plunging 12% to C$8.78 in Toronto yesterday. </p> <p>The London-based stockbroker Numis Securities believed that Gold Fields was now \"in play\" and the stage was set for further action. </p> <p>\"The existing top three gold producers in the world - Newmont, AngloGold and Barrick - may not necessarily welcome an enlarged Harmony leap-frogging ahead of them. </p> <p>\"We would not rule out a response from one of them to protect their position.\" </p> <p>Numis also raised questions about Harmony's boast that it had increased output from 650,000 ounces in 1995 to 3.3m a year. </p> <p>Production at Harmony came at a cash cost of $360 per ounce which was \"significantly higher\" than the production costs at Gold Fields, which produced 4.2m ounces a year, Numis analysts said. </p> <p>Mikail Prokhorov, chief executive of Norilsk, confirmed that his company - ultimately controlled by Mr Potanin - favoured the Harmony deal over Iamgold's and had provided Harmony with an undertaking to support it. </p> <p>Attempts by Harmony to propel itself to the top of the world league via a tie-up with Gold Fields is just the latest upheaval to hit a South African mining sector struggling to cope with the rising value of the rand against the dollar. </p> <p>Harmony merged last year with ARMgold while AngloGold teamed up with Ashanti in Ghana.

  "An inquest jury yesterday saw the spot where an unarmed man was shot by police yards from his home. <p>Harry Stanley was shot dead in 1999 by armed officers who mistook a table leg he was carrying for a shotgun. </p> <p>Coroner Andrew Reid showed the jury damage to a garden fence and a brick wall caused by bullets fired by police which had first passed through Mr Stanley's hand and head, killing him. </p> <p>The jury of four men and six women retraced the last steps of Mr Stanley, 46, as he walked from a pub to his home in Hackney, east London. </p> <p>Standing yards from the house where Mr Stanley's widow Irene still lives, Dr Reid told the jury not to prejudge any of the issues in the case and not to draw any conclusions until they had heard all the evidence. </p> <p>Armed police challenged Mr Stanley after a man in a pub called 999. Inspector Neil Sharman and PC Kevin Fagan, who fired the fatal shots on September 22 1999, are expected to give evidence later at the two week hearing. </p> <p>Dr Reid told the jury: \"There was an armed police response in relation to a telephone call made by a member of the public. At the end of the armed response, Mr Stanley and the police officers were involved in an exchange here. </p> <p>\"We will hear evidence about that.\" </p> <p>At the spot Mr Stanley was killed, a bouquet of red and purple roses was tied to a bollard bearing the slogan \"Justice for Harry Stanley\". </p> <p>The inquest which opened yesterday is the second into the death. </p> <p>Dr Reid told the jury the first verdict was quashed by the high court because of procedural errors made by an earlier coroner hearing the case, who had also failed to give any reasons for his decisions. </p> <p>Irene Stanley told the court that her late husband had undergone an operation for cancer shortly before his death. </p> <p>She told the jury Mr Stanley was in such pain that he could not bend down. </p> <p>Mrs Stanley, 51, said: \"He couldn't do his shoelaces. He couldn't bend down, his stomach was still tender because of the wound and the stitches.\" </p> <p>On the day he was shot, Mr Stanley had taken a leg from a damaged table to be repaired at his brother's house.

  "Lynne Stewart has been coming to court 110 in Manhattan's federal district court almost every weekday since mid-June. As a practicing defence lawyer with a long career representing unpopular and politically radical defendants, including members of the infamous Weather Underground, she knows the building and its imposing atmosphere of jurisprudence well. <p>This time, though, her position here is different. She's in the dock as the accused. </p> <p>In late 2002, in a well-crafted display of television showmanship, attorney general John Ashcroft himself came to New York to announce the arrest of 65-year-old Stewart and her co-defendants, a Staten Island taxi driver named Mohamed Yousry and a legal aide, Ahmed Abdel Sattar, on charges of conspiracy and abetting terrorism. </p> <p>Specifically, Ashcroft's prosecutors accused Stewart of helping to pass messages from her most prominent client, the imprisoned blind Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman to his spiritual followers in the Islamic Group, an Egyptian fundamentalist group held responsible for deadly attacks on western tourists. </p> <p>To the Justice Department, the case is proof that it is fighting hard against the forces of terrorism. Abdel Rahman, after all, had been convicted of plotting to blow up Manhattan's bridges and tunnels in 1995, and inciting followers to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and carry out the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. The sheik, currently held in the super-max prison in Florence, Colorado is considered a special threat by the US authorities. </p> <p>Stewart represented him at trial and through his appeal process. Since his conviction he's been held in solitary confinement and has been barred from communicating with anyone but his immediate family and lawyers. The government alleged that Stewart passed the message that the sheik had withdrawn his support for a ceasefire between terrorist followers and the Egyptian government. </p> <p>Stewart does not deny that she passed the message. She called a Reuters reporter in Cairo to tell the news agency that the sheik did not support the ceasefire. The question at her trial is whether the civil rights veteran intended to aid terrorism or simply give her client the best representation she could. \"She believed it's her duty as a lawyer to stand up for the client, no matter how hated they may be and what they have done,\" her defence lawyer Michael Tigar told the jury at the start of the trial. </p> <p>Further, Stewart's colleagues point out that she is being prosecuted in an atmosphere of paranoia, and the events in question took place in May 2000 when George W Bush and his global war on terror were still in the future. </p> <p>\"The government has proven everything that Lynne Stewart acknowledges she did,\" says her friend and fellow civil rights attorney Ron Kuby. \"She did give the sheik the news of the outside world, and she did communicate his views to news media. The question that remains open is did she do it with the intent of zealously representing her client or did she do it to aid and abet terrorism? </p> <p>\"The argument she aided terrorism is untrue, malicious and wrong, but the accusation she articulated her client's views in public is completely true.\" </p> <p>In their complaint, government prosecutors called Stewart \"an indispensable and active facilitator of the terrorist communication network\", and said her actions were akin to an accomplice in a bank robbery who distracts security guards while others pinch the money. Specifically, the government says Stewart allowed Yousry to communicate with Rahman in Arabic about the ceasefire, and that she purposely made comments in English to mask the Arabic conversation. </p> <p>The evidence was obtained under a warrant that permits the authorities to secretly monitor and tape generally privileged conversations between inmates and their lawyers in terrorist cases. Whether or not Stewart's actions crossed the line of responsibility (she had specifically agreed in writing to the special rules banning the sheik from communicating with anyone but his family and lawyers), the apparent challenge to the relationship between counsel and client has implications for the practice of US criminal law. </p> <p>Prosecutors accuse her of \"calculated conduct\" in the way she abused her rights as a lawyer. For her supporters, and even for many members of the bar who may not approve of her actions, her case sends a clear warning to the legal profession: don't represent accused terrorists or any public enemy or you, too, could become a suspect. Stewart herself says her case is a test. </p> <p>\"This fight is not about the sheikh, let's get that clear,\" she said before her trial. \"This fight is about America. About whether we want to change our system of criminal justice to the extent that nobody - and probably high on that list, the left in this country - can feel secure talking to a lawyer.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the trial is infused with the misgivings that have characterised American life since 9/11. The Bush administration argues that the war on terror justifies the tightening up of civil liberties as part of what Ashcroft calls the \"paradigm of prevention\". Opponents believe that it is a pretext for government to further accrue power and control over the individual. While the case has been brought not under the controversial USA Patriot Act, but under earlier legislation that permits the US to conduct counter-intelligence on people it thinks are engaging in terrorism or secret intelligence activities, the outcome may come to define the limits of what lawyers can do. </p> <p>\"There are so many lawyers already reluctant to take on controversial cases, they will become even more reluctant,\" says Kuby. \"If something this small results in Lynne going to prison for a decade, they're not going to want to take the case.\" </p> <p>While she may not relish being imprisoned, there's no doubt Stewart recognises that she has become, in her words, the \"poster child of Ashcroft's assault on the Bill of Rights.\" Her lawyer, Michael Tigar, who has called the case \"an opportunity to confront the Bush/Cheney/Ashcroft effort to destroy human rights and scare the country into lurching to the right,\" is also a veteran of the left-leaning civil rights circuit whose clients have ranged from the family of the murdered Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier to the Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols. </p> <p>So arduous has the lengthy trial proved for the jury that the judge gave them permission to take longer lunches and to eat outside because they were falling asleep, but it has produced some intriguing moments. In one wire-tapped exchange, Abdel Rahman, his Arabic interpreter Mohamed Yousry and Stewart are heard wondering if Yusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens, could be persuaded to join the defence committee. On the tape, the sheik instructs the singer to be added to the list but no one can remember his real, pre-Muslim, name. Yousry suggests he was a Beatle. \"Oh yeah, he was the most famous,\" the sheik concurs in Arabic. </p> <p>Some see Stewart's case as typical of the kind of over-prosecution the justice department under Ashcroft has pursued in the name of domestic security. Under his predecessor, Janet Reno, the department declined the opportunity to prosecute her. </p> <p>Critics of the department say it has been singularly unsuccessful in prosecuting allegedly terrorist-related individuals and plots since 9/11. Of the 301 terrorist convictions the government claims, almost all are for giving \"material support\" and have little directly to do with terrorism. </p> <p>This weekend, a New York Times editorial endorsing John Kerry for president noted that Ashcroft has \"appeared on TV time and again to announce sensational arrests of people who turned out to be either innocent, harmless braggarts or extremely low-level sympathisers of Osama bin Laden who, while perhaps wishing to do something terrible, lacked the means.\" </p> <p>Kuby says: \"The amazing thing about the criminal justice process in America is that none of the schmucks they've been prosecuting poses any danger to anybody.\" </p> <p>The Lackawanna Six, a group of young Muslim men from upstate New York, were effectively prosecuted for sending sleeping bags to the Taliban. \"We may all want the Taliban to be cold and uncomfortable, but the notion that sending them sleeping bags earns you 15 years in prison is striking,\" Kuby says. </p> <p>\"And that is true for almost all of the terrorist prosecutions in the US since 9/11. They have been for bit-players and non-players, prosecuted for obscure and innocuous activities in most cases, none of which that would ordinarily appear on anybody's radar.\" </p> <p>Two weeks ago the case against four Muslim immigrants once accused of having foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks abruptly collapsed in Detroit. In bringing the case, the government had relied on a single informant who prosecutors now concede told them what they wanted to hear in return for having fraud charges against him dropped. Far from being a \"sleeper operational combat cell\", the four seem to have had no links to terrorism and the government has now repudiated its own case, discredited its own witnesses and found fault with virtually every part of its prosecution. </p> <p>In charging the men, a justice department memorandum revealed, prosecutors hoped they would find out what the four were up to. \"We can charge this case with the hope that the case might get better,\" wrote counterterrorism chief Barry Sabin, \"and the certainty that it will not get much worse.\" </p> <p>But as Stewart's lawyer begins presentation of her defence this week, it is unlikely she relishes being the accused. \"It's good to vindicate causes and work to fight injustice,\" says Kuby. \"It's not necessarily desirable to be the cause that people are working to vindicate.\"</p>",
  "Just as we thought he was on the verge of permanent retirement, after several hundred years of stalwart service, up he pops again, rejuvenated and triumphant, his demise postponed into eternity. I refer, of course, to the lord chancellor. <p>You'll remember that in the botched reshuffle of June 2003, the prime minister tried to abolish the ancient office by way of a press release, until it was pointed out that several hundred statutes first had to be amended before the old retainer could finally be chucked into the dustbin of history. So Lord Falconer had to stay on as lord chancellor, with instructions to get rid of himself. Only, when he presented his brilliant scheme for self-destruction to the House of Lords, they would have none of it. </p> <p>Last week, Lord Falconer formally conceded that the job of lord chancellor would continue. And that meant that the title of lord chancellor had to be re-instated into the constitutional reform bill that was supposed to put an end to him. </p> <p>I've been reading Hansard on the bill's committee stage in the House of Lords last Monday, and the whole thing has become chaotic. Their lordships spent many hours trying to work out what kind of lord chancellor he (or she) would be. They accepted that he couldn't sit as a judge any longer, nor appoint new judges, nor be head of the judiciary. But then what would be left? Would he still be speaker of the House of Lords? Perhaps. Would he need to be a lawyer? Opinions divided sharply. Would he need to be in the House of Lords? No agreement on that. What would his status in Cabinet be? And so on. It all seemed so simple that June day last year. What a mess it is now. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A few months ago, a highly respected Kent solicitor was judged to have committed contempt of court when, for laudable motives, she passed papers about her client's case to her sister. The solicitor, with the consent of her client, was trying to draw attention to a possible miscarriage of justice - her client's child was taken into care on the allegedly dubious evidence of medical experts - but in doing so, passed on confidential information without the court's consent. Hence the contempt. Cut to last week. The government announces that the law is too restrictive and that it would be changed so that, in effect, what the solicitor did wouldn't in future amount to contempt. The government person making that announcement was Harriet Harman, solicitor general - the recipient of the papers in question from her sister, lawyer Sarah Harman. No, I'm not suggesting anything improper, just drawing your attention to unusual circumstances. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I've uncovered something worse than the wrong, egregious but proliferating use of \"minority ethnic\" instead of \"ethnic minority\". In his speech to the Law Society's annual conference a few days ago, its president, Ed Nally, revealed that one in six new solicitors was \"from an ethnic background.\" Wrong. Six out of six were. Every person on this earth has an ethnic background. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Please believe me when I say that I have nothing against Dino. On the contrary, to judge from his photographs, he seems to be a fine upstanding German shepherd, a credit to his breed. He does, however, have a conviction, dating back to 2001, for biting a woman - a capital offence for which he was duly sentenced to death. </p> <p>Last week, following a strenuous and expensive campaign by his owner, the shadow of the gallows was lifted. Dino is now a free dog, held by an appeal judge to be a reformed non-biting canine. </p> <p>I don't question the decision. I am happy for Dino and his owner. But I do question the manner of his acquittal. He was able to appeal because the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred his \"destruction order\" back to the court. This is the same CCRC that was set up, in 1995, to be an independent body investigating suspected miscarriages of justice, following a spate of scandals in which innocents were jailed for crimes they had not committed. </p> <p>The CCRC's efforts have resulted in many wrongfully convicted prisoners being set free, sometimes after many years in jail, as well as achieving posthumous justice for some wrongfully executed. So the CCRC is a good thing. But does it not have stronger and more urgent miscarriages of justice to investigate than the fate of dogs who bite? Are there not people at this moment languishing in our prisons, guiltless of the crimes of which they were convicted? To put it crudely, has the CCRC not got better things to do with its time and taxpayers' money?</p>",

Will he make any difference if he does? Your thoughts please.</p> <p>Deportivo, who have made a pretty dreadful start to the competition all in all, are without Sergio, who's serving a one-match ban.

Subs: Dudek, Finnan, Kewell, Diao, Sinama Pongolle, Biscan, Warnock. </p> <p><strong>D Coruna: </strong> Molina, Manuel Pablo, Cesar, Andrade, Capdevila, Victor, Mauro Silva, Duscher, Luque, Valeron, Pandiani. Subs: Munua, Romero, Tristan, Fran, Munitis, Scaloni, Pablo Amo. </p> <p><strong>Scouse stereotypes</strong> Apparently the Deportivo team have been delayed by 15 minutes due to the police having to close off an area of Liverpool because of an armed robbery. At this point we would normally make some supposedly witty, if slightly regionalist comment about cultural distinctions in certain parts of the north west. However, following recent GuardianUnlimited guideline changes, we'll just have to satisfy ourselves with a slightly snide snigger. </p> <p><strong>Matters for concern</strong> Could anyone please tell us why we have started writing this minute-by-minute as if there are more than one of us? And while we're at it, where are all your emails? Is it 'cos I is not a witty if slightly misanthropic Irishman?</p> <p>Saul in Pittsburgh asks: \"Are you not a full time employee, or does the Guardian ration e-mail addresses in some kind of 'save the planet' plan?\" You've guessed it Saul, I'm on the lower rungs of the ladder, a pikey freelancer not fit to shine the shoes of Glendenning and co. Then again if I did have a Guardian email I'd have to put up with thousands of emails from pituary retards in the US complaining about the paper's supposedly biased coverage of the US election (ie we occasionally express the sentiment that George Bush may not be a particularly nice man.) </p> <p>So it's not all bad, eh?</p> <p><strong>And they're off</strong> From a free-kick on the left Traore knocks it forward to Cisse who has a free header inside the box. It flies past the left-hand upright. </p> <p><strong>2 mins</strong> Alonso is already causing problems with some incisive passing. Liverpool get their first corner but it flies over everyones' heads and comes to nothing. Emmett Williams in New York writes: \"I have nothing clever nor interesting to write, but you should know that you are being read.\" It's good to know I have some support Emmett. By the way did I say how much I love American people? </p> <p><strong>6 mins</strong> Not a lot happening of note, but Milan Baros is looking sharp and Liverpool have plenty of possession. \"I'm with Paula Willow (see the Man. Utd coverage next door),\" says Robi Polgar, somewhat nonsensically. \"Where's grumpy Barry for our LFC trial? Who are you?\" An imposter, clearly. </p> <p><strong>9mins:</strong> Alberto Luque phaffs about on the left wing and eventually gets himself trapped in amongst two Liverpool players. The ball goes out, Luque complains and ends up with a yellow card. Some more Deportivo pressure down the left however, and things are looking more promising for the Spanish side.</p> <p><strong>12mins</strong> Alonso clips in a free kick from the right, and Cisse connects, but it's way over the bar.</p> <p><strong>13mins</strong> Cisse to Luis Garcia just inside the box but the referee's assistant raises the offside flag.</p> <p><strong>14mins</strong> A Deportivo corner and Hamann completely loses Cesar at the back post. The latter's strong header is headed off the line by Riise. A narrow escape for the home side.</p> <p><strong>23mins</strong> You've missed another good attempt by Cisse after I decided to return this report around after a few peeps complained. Thanks to Alex Hill in LA for pointing out my error.</p> <p><strong>25 mins</strong> Traore to Garcia to Baros on the right, who finds Cisse unmarked in the centre. Molina just about spoons a save. Quick sharp passing from Liverpool and its looking positive right now.</p> <p><strong> 29mins</strong> Hamann through the centre to Baros, who slaloms round Molina but is denied at the end by Manuel Pablo just as the open net awaits. The resulting corner comes to nothing and a second a few moments later is also wasted. \"Based on my theory that footballers with names ending in vowels are generally better than their consonated counterparts, we should be in for a draw,\" says Mark Brownlow in Vienna.\"But if Benitez replaces Baros and Hamann with Diao and Sinama Pongolle, Liverpool should romp to victory.\" Slightly abstract, I have to admit, but it makes a change from all the emails telling me how much better Barry Glendenning is than I am. And no Paula Willow I am not an \"intern\". Harumph!</p> <p><strong>33mins</strong> Another disappointing miss for the Reds. Garcia's strike is palmed behind by Molina and the resulting corner is wasted. Hamann gets a yellow card for a foul on Victor.</p> <p><strong>36mins</strong> An outswinging Garcia corner comes to Riise, whose fine strike hits the crowd of Deportivo players and falls to Baros near the left hand goal post. The angle is too narrow for him to find the goal, however, and Liverpool have still failed to score despite having almost a quarter of an hour of pretty solid pressure.</p> <p><strong>38mins</strong> Jorge Andrade is given a yellow card for a late tackle on Carragher. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has scored his first goal for Real Madrid against Kiev at the Bernabeu; how Liverpool may wish they could still rely on his talents.</p> <p><strong>40mins</strong> Baros through the centre hits another strike narrowly wide of the left-hand upright from just outside the box.</p> <p><strong>43mins</strong> Deportivo have a few moments or possession in Liverpool's half, but they're not getting anywhere near the goal. Liverpool are containing their counter-attacks well, if only they could finish their own forward moves.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Still goalless, but Liverpool look by far the better side. If it hadn't been for a couple of excellent saves by Molina Baros would have had a couple on the scoresheet already. He looks fresh. Cisse, meanwhile, has had his moments, but needs to learn to use his pace to beat opponents to the ball rather than risking being caught offside by trying to grab an extra yard's advantage.</p> <p>\"So what's Barry doing this evening?\" asks Richard Maxey. \"I thought he was contractually obliged to cover all Liverpool games. Does this mean there's half a chance of a decent game tonight?\" It's certainly looking that way, Richard. This is one of the most exciting scoreless games I've seen in a long while. Meanwhile, at least two or three of people have emailed in to say I'm much better than Barry. And only one of them was my mum.</p> <p><strong>46mins</strong> Welcome back, and it's Liverpool straight at it again. Cisse to Garcia, to Baros, who's offside.</p> <p><strong>49mins</strong> Baros is cynically brought down by Cesar whilst on another lively run in dangerous territory and Liverpool have a free-kick from a central position just to the left of the box. Hamann is over it, but his strike is deflected to safety off a Liverpool player for a goal kick.</p> <p><strong>53mins</strong> Luis Garcia looks like he's twisted an ankle. On the touchline Harry Kewell begins to stretch hopefully but that's all he'll be doing for a while if the Liverpool backroom staff have anything to do with it. They want Garcia back on, and no wonder. Apparently over in Spain, Ronaldo has just taken one full in the swingers. Emmett Williams wonders why European sportsmen don't wear boxes to protect themselves from such painful eventualities, when Americans are so keen on them. Ever heard of the phrase \"balls of steel\" Emmett? Besides, the birth rate over here is far too high as it is.</p> <p><strong>56mins</strong> Liverpool are knocking it around nicely from left to right, 10 yards or so back from the box. It's like watching a Reds game from yesteryear, but there's no final ball into the box at the moment, despite the pressure.</p> <p><strong>58mins</strong> Scaloni comes on for Deportivo's Brazilian captain Silva, who's injured.</p> <p><strong>61mins</strong> Valeron almost connects with a curling long pass from the left wing. Deportivo are having their occasional moments and they could still pinch on the counter. \"Do you think Liverpool can take this one? I have seen all of Depos games this season except this one and they have not been the Depo of old (5-1 thrashing by Valencia comes to mind),\" says, umm, someone who hasn't put their name on the email. I reckon so, nameless one, especially as that incredibly good buy HARRY KEWELL IS ABOUT TO COME ON! Yay!</p> <p><strong>65mins</strong> \"Well I must say Barry strangely resembles Rob Lowe!\" writes Andy Myers. Funny you should say that Andy. I believe he has been told that in the past. You'd be amazed at various sportsdesk members' similarities in looks to famous celebrities. Rob Smyth, for instance, is a dead ringer for the young Mark Hamill, he of Star Wars fame, while Georgina Turner bears an uncanny resemblance to Demi Moore. Meanwhile Cisse fluffs another chance from the right hand side of the box, and Alonso tries a Beckham from behind the half way line. The Kop is shouting his name.</p> <p><strong>72mins</strong> A draw here just isn't enough for Liverpool, but Deportivo have been a tighter unit in the second half. Unless the generally ineffective Kewell can conjure something, this is heading for stalemate, because Alonso and Garcia are looking tired.</p> <p><strong>73mins</strong> I only really said that because it's sod's law that one of them will score if I write them off, natually.</p> <p><strong>77mins</strong> Steve Finnan is on for Cisse. Garcia presumably will now push up front with Baros. Cisse is no great loss, to be frank. He's found some nice positions but looked off the pace and lacking confidence, which is little surprise given his three goals in 13 games since arriving.</p> <p><strong>78mins</strong> Alonso to Kewell on the left. The Australian cuts inside and ignores two Liverpool players to his right, choosing to go it alone. His shot to the left post is easily held by Molina.</p> <p><strong>82mins</strong> Kewell skips past a couple of players and wins a throw out on the left. He's actually looking like Liverpool's best hope of creating something effective. </p> <p><strong>85mins</strong> More Kewell mischief down the left. Liverpool have plenty of players in the box. Florent Sinama-Pongolle, on for Garcia goes down under a challenge from Capdevila inside the box but referee Anders Frisk waves away the Liverpool protests. \"I've been watching <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/news/matchreport/0,9752,1330841,00.html\">Smyth's commentary</a> on the MUFC game and I can confirm you are just slightly more entertaining than him,\" writes Mark in Vancouver, one of a number of Canadians who have emailed in, generally slagging off the Americans who've been emailing in. </p> <p><strong>89mins</strong> Andrade should have gone for a second bookable offence after a blatant lunge at Baros, but Frisk won't listen to Liverpool's protests.</p> <p><strong>90mins</strong> A Kewell free-kick from outside the box but the Deportivo wall is too close. Frisk moves the ball forward and a second effort from Kewell flies just wide of the left-hand upright. If that had gone in he might have been (temporarily) forgiven for everything.</p> <p><strong>93mins</strong> With Deportivo putting their feet in, Hamann has a free-kick from 30 yards out, but it's over the bar. Liverpool have done enough to win tonight, but the ball just won't go in the net for them. Baros gets a yellow card for a frustrated tackle on Pablo.</p> <p><strong>Full-time</strong> It ends scoreless and Liverpool will now need to win in Spain or at Monaco to get through the group stages; not something you'd put your money on. Nevertheless it's been an entertaining Anfield evening with the Reds looking stylish and lively. Thanks for all your emails, have a great evening. Ben. P.S. Vote Kerry!</p>",
  "Gordon Sasser first got the feeling that something strange was going on when the telephone pierced the silence of a weekday afternoon at his house on the swampy fringes of Tallahassee, northern Florida. <p>An automated voice had some surprising news: did he know that he could now cast his presidential vote by phone, and could do so right now, using the keypad? Mr Sasser's suspicion that somebody was trying to trick him into thinking he was casting a vote - presumably so that he wouldn't cast a real one - was far from unique. </p> <p>James Scruggs, another Tallahassee resident, remembers a similar unease about the young woman who phoned him at home, insistently offering to collect his absentee ballot to ensure its safe delivery. </p> <p>Then there was the elderly woman who called the local elections office last week to register her husband for an absentee vote. According to office staff, as she hung up she made a point of thanking them: she wouldn't have thought to get in touch about her husband, she said, if it hadn't been for their helpful call the night before, when someone had taken her own details, assuring her that she was now registered and would receive a ballot. </p> <p>But the elections office makes no such calls. </p> <p>\"It's Alice in Wonderland here now,\" sighed Ion Sancho, elections supervisor for Leon County, which includes Tallahassee, Florida's capital. \"Up is down, and down is up ... My feeling is that someone has essentially conned her into believing that she's going to be voting.\" </p> <p>Mr Sancho is a longstanding thorn in the side of Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, who presides from a building across the street. But even he seems astonished by the reports reaching his office these days. </p> <p>\"I've been an elections supervisor for 16 years now, and nobody has ever called me with this kind of activity occurring,\" he said. </p> <p>The mysterious calls are only the most vivid symptoms of broader problems in Florida which critics fear could leave thousands of citizens disenfranchised on November 2. </p> <p>New electronic voting machines have proven error-prone, and may not be capable of accurate recounts. State authorities are threatening to withhold votes from people who forget to tick a box confirming that they are US citizens, even though they signed a statement to the same effect on the same form. And among several legal feuds, Florida Democrats are accusing the state of failing properly to implement measures designed to prevent a repeat of the 2000 fiasco, when thousands of African-Americans were wrongly prevented from voting. </p> <p>The US election officially began in Florida yesterday, as early voting sites opened across the state - though in Duval County, a Republican-run area with a large African-American population, that too is a subject of dispute. Only one early voting site, far from densely populated neighbourhoods, has been made available for the entire county. </p> <p>\"One location for a county of almost 500,000 acres - that's the most asinine thing I've ever heard,\" said the Rev William Bolden, a Jacksonville pastor who is among many to detect a pattern in the controversies. </p> <p>Though voters have been affected across the spectrum of race and politics - Mr Sasser, for one, is white and a Republican - they will have the effect, Democrats say, of limiting turnout among minorities, poor and less educated voters, all of whom traditionally vote Democrat. They have been registered in record numbers this year, so the stakes are higher than ever. \"Certainly, somebody is afraid,\" Mr Bolden said. </p> <p>Florida faded from international headlines after the dramas of 2000, but on the broad, tree-lined streets of the state capital, things have rarely been more fraught. </p> <p>Katherine Harris, the elected Republican secretary of state widely seen as a key fighter in the effort to make sure George Bush won the 2000 recount process, is gone. But in her place is Glenda Hood, a former Republican office-holder who, thanks to a change in state law, was not elected but appointed directly by Governor Bush, the president's brother. </p> <p>Ms Hood has found herself embroiled in a sequence of rows. First, there was the attempt to undertake a new purge of alleged ex-felons from Florida's voter lists - the same practice that left up to 22,000 people, mainly African-Americans, wrongly denied a vote in 2000. That was discontinued after it was revealed that the new list contained 22,000 blacks and only 61 Hispanics, who traditionally vote Republican in Florida. </p> <p>Now her office is instructing county officials to reject registration forms from thousands of Floridians who did not check a box answering \"yes\" to the question \"Are you a US citizen?\" - even though, in signing the form, applicants agree with the statement \"I do solemnly swear ... [that] I am a US citizen.\" </p> <p>She is also fighting a courtroom battle over Florida's new system of \"provision ballots\", introduced after the 2000 fiasco so that people who arrived at the polls to discover they were not on the register could vote anyway, then have their case considered by officials. Ms Hood has decreed that the facility will not be available to anybody who turns up at the wrong precinct within their county. </p> <p>\"But in most cases, the errors in the precinct information are made by the elections office, not by the voter,\" said Jerry Traynham, a lawyer fighting Ms Hood on a number of cases. \"Everything they're doing seems to be designed to exclude people from the democratic process, rather than including them.\" </p> <p>Mr Traynham's other major case involves the touch-screen voting machines on which almost a third of Americans will be voting the week after next. Ms Hood had originally sought to have the machines excluded from any manual recounts - a decision overturned in court - but now her critics argue that the machines leave an insufficient audit trail: no individual paper receipt is produced when a citizen votes. </p> <p>\"They certified technology in Florida which probably can't actually do a real recount,\" Mr Traynham said. \"The real danger is that if something goes wrong, you'll never know.\" </p> <p>In earlier primary elections in Florida in 2002, according to a recent Vanity Fair investigation, one precinct using the machines recorded no votes, several others had their voter records wiped, 24 polling places opened late, and dozens of poll workers resigned. </p> <p>Ms Hood has consistently denied allegations of bias, suggesting that the eleventh-hour nature of the lawsuits shows they are motivated by partisanship. \"It is ridiculous to suggest that Secretary Hood is doing anything other than reaching out to all voters in the state,\" her spokeswoman, Alia Faraj, told the Tampa Tribune. \"Our goal is to get as many people as possible to participate in the process.\" </p> <p>Ion Sancho is beginning to sound exasperated by it all - though he insists that, in Leon County at least, he will do all he can to make sure all who are legally entitled to vote are actually able to do so. </p> <p>\"What I learned in 2000 was that Florida is not committed to ensuring that all citizens have equal access to voting,\" he said. \"I saw how this movie went the first time. I don't want to watch it a second time.\"</p>",
  "The US-led coalition may need to spend another five years in Iraq before the country's own security forces are able to take over and guarantee security, a London thinktank said today. <p>And even then, success in Iraq is not a foregone conclusion, the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in its annual report. </p> <p>The IISS said that bringing peace to Iraq will depend on the Iraqi interim government taking control of the country's security and winning public confidence. The report highlighted efforts to build up Iraqi government forces, but said the task was still in a very early stage. </p> <p>It will take some time before Iraqi forces are ready to take the lead in controlling Iraq and defeating insurgents, it added. The report said that US-trained government forces currently number 36,000.</p> <p>\"It is essential that Iraqi security forces become the primary instrument of law and order,\" the institute said in its annual publication, The Military Balance. \"It may take five years for them to obtain the aptitude necessary to guarantee stability.\" </p> <p>The institute's director, John Chipman, added: \"The outcome of the US-led international effort to bring stability to the country is far from certain as the most powerful military power in the world struggles with a multifaceted insurgency.\" </p> <p>The study said US commanders are trying to create stability and clear the way for January elections by using air and artillery attacks to hit insurgents, while the Iraqi authorities offer talks and aid to insurgents who abandon their struggle. Iraqi officials need to build up the civil administration to help restore peace, it added. </p> <p>The editor of the publication, Christopher Langton, said that the British government, the second largest contributor of coalition forces, has said its troops could stay until at least the end of 2006. He said there were not enough coalition troops in Iraq to ensure security, adding to the need to build up Iraqi government forces.</p> <p>\"The elections, if handled in an efficient and transparent manner and accompanied by the imposition of order, could play a crucial part in this process,\" it said.</p> <p>Mr Chipman said that while the US remains al-Qaida's primary target, Europe may be at a higher risk of attack because of weaker security and its proximity to the Middle East.</p> <p>The report also said that up to 1,000 foreign fighters had infiltrated Iraq and were working alongside Sunni Muslims loyal to Saddam Hussein to target US troops. </p> <p>\"The substantially exposed US military deployment in Iraq presents al-Qaida with perhaps its most attractive 'iconic' target outside US territory,\" the report said. </p> <p>The institute estimated that there are 18,000 potential terrorists plus many more sympathisers around the globe. Both that estimate and the figure for foreign fighters inside Iraq are unchanged from last year's report. </p> <p>The institute is considered the most important security thinktank outside the US. It's annual report, The Military Balance, is an authoritative inventory to the world's armed forces.</p>",
  "<p>Taking the temperature of the more right wing blogs, you cannot help but wonder if they would rather the US was fighting its war on terror against France or Spain. The foiling this week of a suspected bomb plot in Madrid led to another round of <a href=\"http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/002800.php\">anti-Spanish outbursts</a>. \"Perhaps the Spanish electorate will understand now that appeasing terrorists only leads to more terrorism, a lesson that Europeans learned the hard way 60 years ago,\" writes Captain Ed on <strong>Captain's Quarters</strong>. \"Maybe this will wake the Spaniards to the dangers of withdrawal and appeasement.\"</p> <p>The background here is that Spain's conservatives lost the general election held immediately after the Madrid train bombings to the opposition socialists, who then pulled troops out of Iraq. Why the party of US ally Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar lost is a good question. Certainly the Iraq deployment was unpopular, but there was also widespread anger that it tried to save its electoral skin by <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1168989,00.html\">pinning blame for the attack on the armed Basque separatists Eta</a>. The orthodox view among the right wingers, however, is that Spain \"capitulated\" to terrorism.</p> <p>What riles is the policy shift instead of the country but the same cannot be said for France, it just riles on its own. In this context John Kerry's French relatives and command of the spoken language are something of a rallying point for Republicans - a \"Barneycam\" at the party's New York convention showed the president's dog in debate with a beret-wearing poodle sock puppet. There is therefore some surprise that the senator dared to speak French to Haitians in Florida. \"Let's see: Your opponent is characterising you as an effete internationalist willing to 'turn America's national security decisions over to international bodies or leaders of other countries',\" <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/id/2108379/\">observes</a> Chris Suellentrop at <strong>Slate</strong>. \"In particular, he suggests, in all seriousness, that you want to call up Jacques Chirac for permission before deploying the military [\u2026] How should you defend yourself against these slanders? By speaking French on the stump, of course.\"</p> <p>If you are now fuming that a man who can speak French is vying for the leadership of the world's only superpower then take solace in <strong>No Pasar\u00e1n</strong>'s <a href=\"http://no-pasaran.blogspot.com/2004/10/operation-rooster-crow-infiltrating.html\">Operation Rooster Crow</a>. On hearing the French chapter of Democrats Abroad was to stage a rally under the Eiffel Tower it pulled on its best \"Communists for Kerry\" t-shirts and signs that read \"NO TO WAR; yes to collaboration\". But with polls suggesting the French lead the world in anti-Bush opinion, you can only conclude that the feeling is mutual.</p>",
  "<p>Home Office spending on public relations consultants and advertising increased four-fold in 2000-2004 compared with the previous four years, it was revealed today. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, said that from 1996 to 2000, the department spent a total of \u00a325,974,000 on communications - amounting to an average of 0.9% of its annual budget. </p> <p>But in 2000-2004, spending soared to \u00a3101,120,000 - or an average of 0.24% of annual expenditure. </p> <p>The highest-spending year was 2000-2001, when \u00a335.6m was spent on communications. </p> <p>Increased spending on hiring PR gurus and launching campaigns was largely due to the government's push to recruit more police officers, which has resulted in record numbers of police. </p> <p>There has also been the launch of the government's restyled drugs advice service, known as Frank, with controversial commercials deploying humour for the first time in anti-drug campaigns. </p> <p>The Home Office has also funded a chilling TV campaign on internet child grooming, which features a child's voice-over describing his favourite hobbies as the camera pans down to reveal a grown man sitting next to a computer. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The Home Office makes no apology for investing in publicity campaigns which have helped recruit a record number of police officers, alert children to the dangers of grooming on the internet and provide advice to young people on the risks of class A drugs. </p> <p>\"That spending amounts to less than 1% of the Home Office overall budget.\" </p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, accused Mr Blunkett of trying to \"spin his way out of trouble\". </p> <p>\"Crime in Britain is out of control,\" he said. \"Instead of solving the problem the home secretary is trying to spin his way out of trouble. </p> <p>\"After three years as home secretary, crime is up, asylum is a shambles and no amount of professional communication advice can hide this from the electorate.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Conservatives have a timetable for action in the fight against crime which will cut crime during the first parliament of a Conservative government.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>We had noticed these weird shudders for some time. First as a baby, when Henry was snuggling next to his twin, George. Henry's eyes would roll, his arms jerk up and he seemed to be shivering down one side. We'd pluck him out of his cot, put his toy rabbit up to his face, give him a cuddle and his shudders would seem to subside. Like you do, we tried very hard to believe there was nothing wrong. </p> <p>At three, we couldn't ignore it any longer. Henry's limb jerks and eye rolls were getting more frequent, and there were other strange things too. He developed an urgent attachment to his toy rabbit. He took against a lane where the sunlight glittered through the trees, refusing to open his eyes. He was extremely accident-prone, sporting the entire range of Boots Winnie the Pooh plasters. The health visitor listened to my description of the tree business, the rabbit situation and asked about the wobbles. How many a day? </p> <p>Henry was sent for an EEG - an electroencephalogram. Electrodes were pinned on his head whilst he clutched bunny and a printer churned out a zig-zag picture of his brain. The results came back showing he had a severe form of epilepsy. </p> <p>Talking to other parents about their reaction when their child is diagnosed with a serious medical condition, they describe an emotional trajectory that may range from denial, to anger, despair and then acceptance, the 'Dada' theory. Apart from anger, we went through all of these. Then we got journalistic. My partner, Alex Thomson, is chief correspondent on Channel Four News, and I'm a television reporter. We opened files, got out notebooks, and insisted on a second opinion. </p> <p>There was worse news. The Addenbrooke's neurologist told us Henry had a comparatively rare form of epilepsy, early onset myoclonic absence seizures. The prognosis was uncertain. The condition may be resistant to medication. He told us to go home, give Henry his drugs and look up myoclonic absence epilepsy on the internet. We went home and started the first in a long line of seizure diaries, a record of Henry's fits. We were soon into double figures. Some days we counted 20 or more \"absences\". Most would last just three or four seconds. Then, when Henry was ill with flu, he had his first, full-blown seizure, losing consciousness for several terrifying minutes, his small body in spasm. Henry's drug intake was edged up until he was on the maximum dose of the anticonvulsant sodium valproate. </p> <p>Henry was also a very confused little boy. His body was doing things he didn't understand. His mouth got a sicky taste, and then the world went funny. \"Want the world to change so Henry won't wobble,\" he said. The aftermath of wobbles were particularly scary. Injuries - cuts, bruises and scars. </p> <p>It was after one such episode, last Christmas, that we decided there must be more than drugs to help Henry. We were coming back from a festive trip to A&amp;E, Henry's face stitched up after another seizure and a fall. We'd stopped for mince pies in a supermarket. Henry saw a flickering light, his eyes rolled and he began crying, tearing at his plaster stitches. An elderly shopper started berating us. A tantrum! The little brat needed a good smack! My partner exchanged some brisk Anglo-Saxon. </p> <p>When we got home I got on the net, this time searching for alternative therapies, trawling through the weird, the wacky, and the faintly plausible. Among them was G-Therapy, a treatment of vegetable extracts and biochemical salts, administered in pill form and apparently only available from Poona in India, and EEG neurofeedback, video games based on electroencephalograms; neuro-respiratory therapy, a course of exercises boldly promising \"seizure elimination\". I explored cranial osteopathy, intensive physiotherapy, and conductive education. I finally went down the food route, additive-free diets, and evening-primrose-free fish oil. </p> <p>Getting out the chequebook was the best therapy I'd had in months. By the end of the evening I'd ordered a large trolley of additive-free food, and a quantity of evening primrose-free fish oil. Henry was signed up for cranial osteopathy in Cambridge, neuro-respiratory therapy in East Grinstead, conductive education in the New Forest and EEG neurofeedback in St Albans. </p> <p>Drugs, though, continued to play a large part in controlling Henry's condition. An anticonvulsant called Lamotrigine was added to Henry's drug regime. At our next meeting with the neurologist we told him the cocktail of pills and syringes seemed to be reducing Henry's seizures, but he had developed a hand tremor, which it emerged might be one of the many side effects of sodium valproate. The neurologist floated a plan. Slowly reduce the dose of valproate and introduce a third drug, Clonazepam. </p> <p>We were reassured that initially at least, the dose would be tiny. We duly ordered supplies and started reducing the syringes of pink medicine. Events then overtook us. Henry got flu and had another racking seizure. The advice from the hospital was to go back to the original regime. </p> <p>Disappointed, we embarked on a series of alternative treatments. First we tried conductive education. It wouldn't stop Henry's seizures, but it helped him control his hand tremor, improved his balance and concentration. Next we went down to the neuro-respiratory therapy centre in East Grinstead armed with six flannels, two towels, a telly and Percy the Park-keeper. As Henry lay on a couch watching Percy, the therapists positioned our hands on rolled flannels. </p> <p>The idea was to exert very gentle pressure in specific areas around Henry's diaphragm. The theory was that by helping improve Henry's respiratory system, blood flow would be restored to the brain which might encourage the development of new neural structures, and generally improve his metabolism. Neuro respiratory therapy, or NRT, is a treatment primarily aimed at children with cerebral palsy. Parents are taught the techniques, and given exercises to do at home. Apparently after around 200 hours of flannel work \"abnormal bodily structures\" might begin to reverse. By 1,000 hours there could be substantial changes. </p> <p>After his treatment Henry farted exuberantly and slept like a log, the night-time seizures apparently reducing. There was much the same result after weekly sessions with the cranial osteopath. More expulsions of wind, more deep sleeps. Then as the summer ended, there was a turning point. We were on our way to St Albans for the EEG neurofeedback consultation. The lightning started as we turned off the motorway. Henry shielded his face with angry fists and began to recite The Wild Things as the thunder rolled. By the time we arrived Henry was inconsolable. He hadn't had a full seizure, but there was a lot of what they call \"epileptic activity\". He was drumming his tongue on the roof of his mouth, tears trickling from his closed eyes. Whatever the possible benefits of EEG neurofeedback, it was clear this wasn't the time. </p> <p>We drove home, the sun came out and Henry started burbling about bunnies. I watched him in the mirror, happy and secure, and I saw something staring us both in the face. I was in danger of losing the plot. I'd stopped seeing Henry my son; I only saw his condition. I was terrified of his seizures. I'd researched it, been in chatrooms on the net, I'd tried to put myself in his place - dammit, one night I'd even tried his medicine. (Fleeting high, knocked out). </p> <p>I should have listened. Henry had told me about the taste in his mouth before things went funny - what I now know is an epileptic \"aura\". He didn't like shocks, loud things, certain kinds of light. Being ill, tired or upset were all likely to trigger seizures. He couldn't be without rabbit because it meant much more than a cuddly toy. It had seen him through those early baby shudders. We couldn't avoid storms, flickering light, upset, but we could try and construct a calmer life. </p> <p>Henry had his fourth birthday recently, a year since diagnosis. He's slowly reaching his developmental milestones, catching up with his brother. The seizures are much less frequent. We're keeping up with all the therapies, conductive education, NRT, the cranial osteopathy, the fish oil. </p> <p>Henry has started at school - an extraordinary school, where he gets the help he needs. Our home life is less busy. So far we've managed to steer clear of bugs and colds. We try not to drive in thunderstorms. We never go down the glittery lane. But the difficulty of all this is that without reducing Henry's drugs, we don't know what's working. </p> <p>This autumn we started tackling that too. We started talking cold turkey to the medics. And, funnily enough, that proved therapeutic too. Henry might be eligible for a clinical trial at Great Ormond Street hospital of the recently publicised Ketogenic diet - a high-fat, low-carb diet, which has been successful with children whose epilepsy is resistant to medication. Already underway are studies of something called Vagus nerve stimulation, a treatment that aims to prevent seizures by sending mild pulses of electrical energy to the brain via a device like a pacemaker. </p> <p>For the time being though, all this is in the future. We now know many parents whose children cope with huge challenges. We know anticonvulsant medication can be a lifeline. And I'm not knocking drugs. I just want to believe there's more for families like us. Not least hope. </p> <p>Like Henry, I want the world to change, I don't want him to have wobbles. I want that miracle cure. But whatever happens, Henry's Henry. Adorable. Wobbles and all.</p>",
  "<p>Fretting about your long-term health prospects? Worried about whether you are going to succumb to heart disease and cancer? According to new advice from scientists, the answers to your questions could be as close as your nearest full-length mirror. Take a long, hard look at your body shape, they say, because it could reveal a whole host of clues about your longevity and your risk of serious illness. </p> <p>Here's why: for more than a century, doctors have been aware that there is a correlation between certain body shapes and an individual's health prospects. Much of what they have discovered isn't fully understood: but the evidence is clearer than ever that the data they have collected isn't just down to epidemiological chance, but to real issues that require much deeper investigation. </p> <p>Most of the doctors' work focuses on two areas: height and the distribution of body fat. \"We've known for a long time that the taller you are, the higher your risk of breast cancer, prostate cancer, colo-rectal cancer, leukaemia and lymphomas,\" says David Gunnell, professor of epidemiology at Bristol University. \"If you're short, on the other hand, we know you are more at risk of cardiovascular disease and strokes - that has been shown in many studies, including one published earlier this year that looked at 4,000 women and found those with short legs had more chance of getting heart disease than those with longer legs. And we know short men are at greater risk, too.\" </p> <p>For a long time, says Gunnell, these statistical link-ups were merely puzzled over by scientists: but over the past decade or so clues have been found that may explain the findings, and that could in turn provide exciting new ways of screening and even treating disease in the future. What seems to be most significant, says Gunnell, is that being tall is an overall healthier shape to be - you might be more prone to cancer, but part of the reason for that is precisely that you are going to live longer and so are more likely to succumb to what remains, after all, mostly a disease of old age. </p> <p>It has long been known that factors such as not being breastfed, having a poor childhood diet and being born into a less-affluent family influence growth negatively: what doctors now believe is that issues in early life - especially dietary issues - that affect height then go on to affect an individual's susceptibility to conditions such as heart disease and strokes. But, says Gunnell, what is also interesting is the role of blood-carried hormones called insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). High levels of these hormones, which are known to be an important determinant of childhood growth but which are also present in the adult bloodstream, have been strongly linked with prostate cancer and may also be related to breast and colon cancer; meanwhile, a study from Denmark has also found people with high concentrations of IGFs have a lower-than-average risk of heart disease. </p> <p>The chemistry is still being unravelled but what is emerging on the cancer front is that, while IGFs are designed to boost cell turnover and so make a person taller, they also - as an unfortunate side-effect - seem to dampen the body's self-defence mechanism which is primed to force damaged cells to self-destruct. If these cells fail to bump themselves off, because of the influence of the IGFs, they may go on to become malignant. And it follows that a person with a high level of IGFs swishing around their bloodstream will have a greater risk of this interference happening and so a greater risk of cancer eventually developing. </p> <p>What doctors are now starting to look at, says Gunnell, is the possibility of screening IGF levels in the bloodstream to pinpoint those who might be at higher risk of cancer; because of the effect of other factors, such as early nutrition, it isn't the case that only tall people have a higher proportion of IGFs, although they are more likely to have them than short people. Even more exciting than the screening, for the future, is the chance that IGF-blocking agents could be developed to counteract the hormone's effect on the body's defence mechanism, and so prevent some malignancies developing. </p> <p>Some studies have shown it isn't just adult height that is significant: research published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine linked a higher risk of breast cancer with girls who were heavier at birth and taller aged 14. The reason isn't clear, but again IGFs could be involved: it may be that the amount of IGFs in the bloodstream during puberty is a significant factor in turning off one of the body's defence mechanisms at a crucial time. </p> <p>But let's get back to your reflection, because it's not just height that's significant. A few days ago, the National Obesity Forum conference heard a bleak warning over the association between fat distribution and the risk of heart disease and diabetes: in a nutshell, the message is that being round and apple-shaped is not just bad, it's very, very bad. Get that tape measure out and check your vital statistics, says diabetes expert Professor Anthony Barnett of the University of Birmingham. If you're a woman with a bigger than 32 inch waistline, or a man with a bigger than 37 inch measurement, you could be heading for trouble: and if your waist circumference is even bigger - more than 35 inches for a woman, 40 inches for a man - you could be at four times the normal risk of developing diabetes and heart disease. </p> <p>The health profession, it seems, is closely monitoring our changing body shape. Another survey, reported in today's papers, suggests that the average British male is now the not-so-proud owner of a beer belly of varying proportions, depending on which area of the country he lives in. According to the health and fitness website <a href=\"http://www.dailydiettracker.co.uk\">DailyDietTracker.co.uk</a>, which surveyed 38,000 adults, the average male is now a distinctive \"apple\" shape, rather than, say, celery or leek shaped, with a worrying build-up of fat concentrated around the waist. Overall, women, the survey found, are still largely retaining their far healthier pear shape, with fat concentrated on the hips rather than the belly, though women in Northern Ireland, north east England, East Anglia and Wales are the most likely to be apples. </p> <p>The problem, says Barnett, is that the waist is a bad area to lay down fat: far better to be big on your bottom and hips - the classic pear-shape - than thick-waisted. \"What some people call big-belly obesity is usually because you're eating more food than you need and not burning it off by taking enough exercise,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We're not sure exactly why waist fat is so damaging, but we think it's because fat cells around the waist tend to be very active. Fat cells around the waist don't just sit there, they produce chemicals, and some of these chemicals seem to produce an imbalance of proteins and hormones that can damage the body's insulin system, putting you at risk of type 2 diabetes. </p> <p>\"It's especially bad news for women, because what we are seeing is that younger women - who traditionally lay down fat on their thighs and bottoms - are getting bigger tummies, as men have always tended to do.\" That, says Barnett, overrides the protection from heart disease and diabetes that women have tended to get from oestrogen before the menopause. In other words, if women go on getting bigger around the waist, the rates of heart disease among pre-menopausal females may soon be as high as those among men, rather than being significantly lower as they currently are. At the moment, 28% of men and 20% of women have waistlines that are way too big, and obesity forecasters warn those figures are likely to rise. </p> <p>As well as indicating your risk of illness, your body shape can sometimes alert you to a condition you already have. People with Marfan's Syndrome, for example, are often not diagnosed until their illness, which causes a problem of the connective tissues, affects the heart and becomes life-threatening. But they may for many years have exhibited the tell-tale features of the condition, which affects one in 5,000 people in the UK: long limbs, a slim build, very long fingers and toes. \"We hear tales of young people who go along to accident and emergency saying they have a bad chest ache, and they are sent home with painkillers and then die of an aneurysm the following day,\" says Marion Mason of Marfan Association UK. \"But the signs will always have been there - they will be very tall, lanky individuals ... we need to make health professionals, as well as the rest of the population, a lot more aware of this.\" </p> <p>Sometimes it is a change in body shape that can alert you to a problem. \"We get lots of people who phone us because they have noticed a change in their body shape,\" says Sarah Leyland of the National Osteoporosis Society. \"Typically, they would be older, post menopausal women, and what they have seen is that their shoulders have become more rounded and their height has shrunk - in some cases they think they have got bigger round the waist but that is actually because they are more stooped than they used to be. </p> <p>\"We advise them to go to their GP, who will be able to refer them for X-rays, because it may be that they have got osteoporatic fractures in their spine.\" What that means, says Leyland, is that the usually rectangular-shaped vertebrae in the neck and upper back become crushed into wedge-shaped structures, forcing the head forward and causing the shoulders to hunch. </p> <p>\"It tends to happen very gradually, but sometimes you just suddenly become aware of it,\" says Leyland. \"Typically, we hear from women who have caught sight of themselves in the mirror and been really shocked at how they look - that's what prompts them to investigate what has gone wrong, because it can seem very dramatic.\"</p>",
  "Indian security forces last night shot dead Koose Muniswamy Veerappan, the leader of an ivory smuggling gang who is thought to have killed as many as 150 people. <p>Veerappan, 60, had been on the run since the late 1960s when he started a smuggling career that saw thousands of elephants killed for their tusks and countless tons of sandalwood taken from the jungle.</p> <p>Over the years, he attained an almost mythic status. Famous for his elaborate handlebar moustache, he went into hiding in the vast rainforests of India's southern states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, earning himself the nickname Jungle Cat.</p> <p>He was revered by some as a Robin Hood-style hero who gave money to impoverished locals, and they in return helped him evade capture on several occasions. </p> <p>At least two Bollywood movies have been inspired by his story.</p> <p>But Veerappan was also a ruthless criminal who was said to have carried out his first murder at the age of 17. Among the atrocities he committed was the beheading of a forestry official in the mid-1980s.</p> <p>As well as carrying out kidnappings, his gang ambushed police patrols with bombs and landmines and stole equipment from the armed forces. Police said he terrorised locals by stringing up the bodies of suspected police informants from trees.</p> <p>Veerappan made headlines around the world in 2000 when his gang kidnapped 71-year-old Bollywood movie star Rajkumar and held him hostage for 108 days. Efforts to arrest the bandit were stepped up, but he still managed to kidnap a regional politician who was later found dead in the forest in 2002.</p> <p>\"It is like the killing of a demon,\" said Rajkumar's son Raghvendra in reaction to the news of the bandit's demise.</p> <p> He finally met his end when paramilitary task force caught up with him outside a small village 200 miles south of Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu.</p> <p>Veerappen and some of his gang were travelling in a vehicle - reportedly disguised as an ambulance - when they were challenged by police. After twice refusing to give himself up, he reportedly opened fire and was killed in the ensuing gun battle along with three other gang members.</p> <p>Reports that his body had been taken to the nearby city of Dharmapuri did not initially stop conspiracy theories from emerging. A <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/890902.cms\">report</a> in today's Times of India said there was speculation about whether it was really Veerappan that was inside the vehicle when it was fired upon.</p> <p>Despite the vehicle being riddled with bullets, the paper also noted that Veerappan's body had only two head wounds, prompting speculation he may have been captured and killed by police at the weekend who then needed to stage the encounter with the vehicle. </p> <p>There were also reports that the body was missing the famous moustache and did not look like his photographs, but those and any other rumours were dispelled today when his body was shown in public. </p> <p>Political intrigue also surrounds Veerappan, with claims that some politicians were in his pay. </p> <p>\"The political connections have to be investigated,\" said Abdul Kareem, a retired police official from the southern city of Mysore whose son, a policeman, was killed by Veerappan's gang in a 1992 ambush. \"If they had caught him alive, lots of secrets would have tumbled out.\"</p> <p>Despite his brutal treatment of those who double-crossed him, the Associated Press quoted an intelligence source as saying that an associate of Veerappan's had given away his position before last night's gunbattle. </p> <p>\"This was the easternmost point he has ever come ... in the last 15-20 years,\" task force chief K Vijaykumar said today. \"It became more and more easy for us to monitor him. We watched him for several days.\" Veerappan was born in Gopinatham, a village in Karnataka, in 1952. He started smuggling in 1969 and was arrested for the first time in 1972. </p> <p>In 1996 he offered to surrender in exchange for an amnesty. But none was forthcoming, and in 1997 he kidnapped nine forestry service officials and held them for 44 days. Later that year he again offered to surrender in exchange for a two-year sentence and a cash pay-off. </p> <p>In July 1993, Veerappan - who had a 20 million rupee (\u00a3243,000) bounty on his head - was said to have strangled his newly born female baby because she was the third girl in a row born to him. </p> <p>When asked what she saw in him, Veerappan's shepherdess wife Muthulakshmi reportedly replied: \"His moustache and notoriety.\"</p>",

  "<p>Care International is one of the only international relief organisations to maintain a continuous presence in Iraq, and currently has nine expat staff working on relief operations alongside hundreds of Iraqi staff members.</p> <p>It is one of the UK's biggest international aid agencies, working in more than 70 countries throughout the world.</p> <p>Margaret Hassan is one of its most experienced members of staff, having worked as an aid worker in Iraq for more than 30 years. </p> <p>The charity started running programmes in the country in 1991, and was the only international aid agency to work in the country prior to the first Gulf war.</p> <p>After that war the Iraq office initially assisted Kurdish refugees after moving into the south and central regions of Iraq and setting up water, sanitation and health programmes.</p> <p>Before the most recent conflict, Care worked with more than 80 hospitals, distributing food and providing medical supplies. It is now working with Iraqi civilians affected by the fighting, providing emergency medical supplies and helping restore access to clean water.</p> <p>Like other aid agencies, the charity has been concerned that for some militant groups the distinction between emergency relief organisations and coalition military forces is becoming increasingly blurred.</p> <p>In May 2003, Ms Hassan was quoted as saying that charities should be careful not to undermine Iraqi health services by setting up parallel medical relief programmes.</p> <p>The charity has been vocal in its dismay at the increasingly violent and chaotic security situation in Iraq. Last November it said it was reviewing security \"hour by hour\", but has stopped short of withdrawing staff.</p> <p>As the security threat has increased, coalition forces have struggled to control violence in Iraq and western aid agencies have increasingly been targeted for attacks. Last month, two Italian aid workers were taken from their offices in Baghdad and held for two weeks by a terrorist group after being released unharmed.</p> <p>The bombing of the Baghdad headquarters of the Red Cross in July 2003, which killed 14 Iraqis and two Red Cross workers, sent shockwaves through the international aid community. It prompted the Red Cross to withdraw its 80 international staff and many frontline agencies, including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Save The Children, to evacuate foreign staff and scale down relief operations.</p> <p>Iraq is not the only country where aid workers have been targeted. In Afghanistan, five M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res staff were shot and killed in Kabul in June, and nine aid workers were killed in one month alone.</p>",
  "Ministers are considering changing the rules of the new Freedom of Information Act before it has even come into force, it emerged today. <p>Under the Act, public bodies including hospitals, schools and police will have 20 working days to reply to questions from the public about their spending and policies.</p> <p>But a watchdog revealed today that central government departments had been asked whether that deadline should be extended under special powers granted to the constitutional affairs secretary.</p> <p>MPs heard there was widespread concern that some of the 100,000 public bodies covered by the legislation were unprepared for its commencement on January 1.</p> <p>Deputy information commissioner Graham Smith told the all-party constitutional affairs select committee: \"There are provisions under the Act for the secretary of state to vary up to the maximum permitted of 60 working days.</p> <p>\"I understand there has been consultation within Whitehall just in the last six months asking departments whether they wanted to suggest that in certain circumstances the 20 working days should be extended.</p> <p>\"I understand that a submission has been put forward to the minister and some draft regulations are being formulated.\"</p> <p>A Department for Constitutional Affairs spokeswoman said she was unable to discuss details of the parliamentary statutory instrument being prepared in connection with the Act.</p> <p>It was understood that any change to the 20-working-day rule would only be allowed in very limited circumstances.</p> <p>For example, there were concerns that schools could fall foul of the legislation if a request was made at the beginning of the summer holiday, and answers were not provided until six weeks later. </p> <p>It was understood that the constitutional affairs secretary, Lord Falconer, would not allow public bodies to use an extended time limit to avoid their responsibilities under the Act. </p> <p>Yesterday Lord Falconer revealed that there will be no charge for the \"vast majority\" of requests under the new freedom of information rights.</p> <p>But central government departments will be able to impose a fee where their costs rise above \u00a3600, which Lord Falconer said amounted to about three-and-a-half days' work.</p> <p>For other public bodies, the cut-off point will be \u00a3450 - about two-and-a-half days' work. </p> <p>Above those limits, the organisations will be able to refuse to answer the query on cost grounds, impose a charge or answer it for free at their own discretion. </p> <p>The rights, brought in under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, cover a range of organisations including Whitehall departments, schools, NHS trusts, police forces and town halls. </p> <p>Anyone of any nationality living anywhere in the world will be able to make a written request for information although there are a number of exemptions for reasons such as national security, commercial confidentiality and personal data. </p> <p>The law is fully retrospective and applies to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>A Department for Constitutional Affairs spokeswoman said: \"The great majority of information requests will be dealt with within the 20 day time limit and will be provided free of charge. </p> <p>\"The DCA and the information commissioner are working hard with all public bodies to ensure that we are ready for implementation on January 1. </p> <p>\"We are producing guidance to assist officials in dealing with freedom of information requests, raising awareness of its implementation, and ensuring that officials are trained in the specifics of the Act.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Public bodies already make a huge amount of information available to the public, and so the burden of information requests should not increase greatly.\" </p> <p>The director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, Maurice Frankel, said: \"We have been expecting a time limit of 20 working days with an extension where it is in the public interest. </p> <p>\"I'm worried about the way that extension will be formulated. </p> <p>\"I certainly would not want to see some form of across the board extension. </p> <p>\"It may be that such a move is appropriate for some public bodies in some cases but I would not want to see this end up as a general principle.\"</p>",
  "<p>The confusion over whether proposals for a new diploma would mean the scrapping of A-levels and GCSEs increased today as the author of the new plans admitted that even if his recommendations went ahead, people would still insist on calling their qualifications GCSEs and A-levels. </p> <p>Mike Tomlinson, who yesterday published his proposals for the biggest overhaul of secondary education in 60 years - including the introduction of a new four-level diploma and a new programme of basic literacy and numeracy skills - today told a conference in London that traditional qualifications would remain, but not by name.</p> <p>\"A-levels, AS and GCSEs are not going to disappear, but their contents will migrate into the new diploma,\" he told the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) conference on 14-19 reform.</p> <p>But later, in response to a question from the audience about whether losing the GCSE and A-level title was fundamental to the new diploma's success, he said: \"I believe it is right that they do disappear to form components [in the new diploma].</p> <p>\"I suspect that even with the diploma, if it were introduced, people will still talk about GCSE and A-levels. People still talk about O-levels.\"</p> <p>The careful line Mr Tomlinson is treading was made more apparent last night when the prime minister, Tony Blair, insisted that GCSE and A-levels would remain in the new diploma. </p> <p>He and the education secretary, Charles Clarke, both said that the current qualifications would be \"strengthened\" following any reform in comments which appeared to reject Mr Tomlinson's calls for them to be lost by name.</p> <p>The schools minister, David Miliband, standing in for Mr Clarke at the Hepi conference at the last minute, refused to be drawn about what the government's response to the report would be, promising only that it would be a \"serious\" response in a white paper in January.</p> <p>\"What we are serious about is giving a positive and detailed response to Mike [Tomlinson]'s work,\" he said. </p> <p>Ministers are now working on the white paper response to the reforms, which would lead to legislation later next year assuming the Labour government wins a third term in office with a general election expected in May 2005. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills is believed to already be working on an implementation plan. </p> <p>Mr Tomlinson has recommended that the overall process will take 10 years, but some \"quick wins\" have been suggested in a shorter timeframe, such as the development of a viable basic literacy and numeracy \"core\".</p>",
  "<p>The health secretary, John Reid, today announced the appointment of a new chief nursing officer to lead the health service's running battle to rid hospital wards of the MRSA superbug.</p> <p>Chris Beasley, previously the interim head of the NHS Modernisation Agency, will prioritise improving hospital cleanliness and tackling hospital acquired infections such as MRSA, estimated to cause at least 5,000 deaths a year.</p> <p>To coincide with her appointment, Mr Reid also published a Matron's Charter, a \"no nonsense\" guide that outlines the role that all hospital staff should play in improving hospital hygiene. </p> <p>Ms Beasley, who has been nursing since 1962, said she relished the challenge of ensuring that all staff put hospital cleanliness at the top of the agenda.</p> <p>\"Matrons must lead by example and by making changes when things aren't up to scratch,\" she said. \"This charter gives a common sense approach to improving the environment in hospitals.\"</p> <p>A joint collaboration between the Department of Health and a group of health agencies including the Royal College of Nursing, Royal College of Midwives and Infection Control Nurses Association, the charter sets out demands each matron will make of her ward staff. These include:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Before you buy new equipment, do you have a system in place to ensure it can be cleaned?<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Do you have a rapid reliable way of responding to patient comments?<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Does your trust involve infection control nurses in refurbishment and new build projects?</p> <p>The charter also sets out guidelines for new matrons such as ensuring all staff receive training in infection control and setting out the process by which matrons withhold payment for cleaning services that fail to come up to scratch.</p> <p>Plans for a Matron's Charter were first mooted in the Towards Cleaner Hospitals and Lower Rates of Infection report in July as part of an effort to gain control of the spread of hospital superbugs, which strike at least 100,000 people a year.</p> <p>On a visit to Middlesex hospital, Mr Reid said that fighting hospital-acquired infections would be the chief nursing officer's \"first concern\".</p> <p>\"Nurses, doctors and other staff are in the frontline of this struggle, and I am determined hospital managers and my department give them the support that they need,\" said Mr Reid.</p> <p>Ms Beasley's appointment comes a month after the previous chief nursing officer, Sarah Mullally, left the NHS to join the Church of England.</p> <p>The charter includes a 10-point priority plan for ensuring that hospitals are kept clean, including involving nurses and infection control teams in negotiating and drawing up cleaning contracts with external agencies. </p> <p>\"I have made it clear that cheapness is not a substitute for cleanliness,\" said Mr Reid.</p> <p>Matrons already have the right to withhold payment of contract cleaners if they feel the work is not up to standard.</p> <p>The health secretary said that there were no plans to ban contract cleaners \"at the moment\", but laid the blame for poor hygiene in hospitals on the previous government's policy of requiring health managers to contract out hospital cleaning to external agencies. </p> <p>He called Conservative criticism of his plans to fight MRSA as \"one of the most hypocritical positions I have ever heard the Conservatives take\". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said, \"The contracting-out system has left the control of cleaning out of the hands of the nurses, matrons and sisters and in some cases it has led to those doing the cleaning not feeling part of the team.\"</p> <p>The Matron's Charter attempts to tackle this problem by asking hospital staff to include cleaners in recreational activities and ensuring that cleaners' photographs are displayed alongside those of the staff on ward notice boards.</p>",
  "<b>British troops in Iraq</b> <br> The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, confirmed the US had asked for British troops to provide assistance outside the UK-controlled southern sector of Iraq. But he insisted that no decision had yet been made in response. A final recommendation from the chief of defence staff was expected by the middle of the week. <p>Mr Hoon told MPs the request did not ask for troops to be deployed to Baghdad City or Falluja. He denied it was political and had anything to do with the timing of the US presidential election. \"Although it is linked to elections - it is not the US elections but with efforts to create the best possible security situation in which to hold the Iraqi elections in January.\" </p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, warned any such deployment would leave \"a big capability gap\" in the British sector and would represent \"a fundamental change\" in UK operations in Iraq. </p> <p>Robin Cook, who quit the cabinet over Iraq, said restraint shown by British troops in peacekeeping had earned them respect among the Iraqis. \"Is it really possible for them to retain that restraint if they are deployed to a US sector which has been policed for over a year by US forces which have not been showing the same level of restraint?\" </p> <p>Mr Hoon said British forces were able to adjust their approach and tactics in the light of the threat that they faced. \"They will have to be less restrained if there is a direct physical threat to them.\" </p> <p><b>Schooling shake-up</b><br> A blueprint for the biggest schooling shake-up in 60 years offers a \"cogently argued, challenging and compelling vision for the future\", the education secretary, Charles Clarke, said. He told MPs proposals by former chief inspector of schools Mike Tomlinson would provide the base on which to build a broad consensus for reform. </p> <p>Mr Clarke said the \"biggest single reform of qualifications in any of our lifetimes\" would present huge challenges and would take at least 10 years to introduce. </p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said any changes would have to be backed with \"substantial new resources\". Scrapping all existing exams would be an \"unwelcome and unnecessary diversion\" from the priority of improving \"unacceptably poor\" literacy and numeracy among school leavers. </p> <p><b>Gun culture</b><br> The home secretary David Blunkett called for concerted action to tackle \"unacceptable\" levels of gun crime as he led MPs in remembering 14-year-old shooting victim Danielle Beccan from Nottingham. He said new five-year minimum sentences for firearm possession were \"a starting point, not an end point\" in getting guns off the streets but warned pretending the situation was \"out of control\" would encourage a gun culture. </p> <p><b>Gun crime</b><br> One gun crime is committed every hour of every day in a Britain where a rising tide of firearms offences threatens to become \"an epidemic that afflicts the whole country\", the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said. He described the shooting in Nottingham as \"reminiscent of Chicago in the 1930s, not an historic English town\". </p> <p>The home secretary said that the government \"does not dispute at all\" the link between gun crime, hard drugs and criminal gangs. He said the supply and price of drugs in the UK was influenced by a wider global situation and that \"there has never been a tighter border control outside wartime than there is at the moment\". </p> <p><b>Climate change</b><br> Tories dropped plans for a debate on climate change after government statements on Iraq and exam reforms left them short of time. Tory chiefs had planned to spend half the time debating the \"rising tide\" of gun crime and the rest urging action to curb carbon dioxide emissions. But business managers pulled the second debate after the statements. </p> <p><b>Grave desecration</b><br> Mr Blunkett condemned the desecration of a grave by suspected animal rights extremists and said he believed a proposed crackdown would be successful. </p> <p>He told MPs: \"The house would want all of us to join together in condemning the bestial extremists who 10 days ago desecrated a grave in Staffordshire and to send our sympathy to the family. We have the strongest licensing laws in this area in the world. We now need the strongest action to ensure that people can go about their lawful business and can do so free from intimidation.\" </p> <p><b>Sex offenders</b><br> Labour's Huw Edwards demanded a policy u-turn on housing sex offenders at Prescoed open prison after convicted paedophile Robert Stokes absconded this month for almost 24 hours. </p> <p>Home Office minister Paul Goggins said: \"The decision to place a limited number of sex offenders who are coming towards the end of their prison sentence in Prescoed Prison was not the result of overcrowding but was part of a planned programme where suitable risk assessment is taking place.\" He would be monitoring the programme carefully. </p> <p><b>Fireworks</b><br> Loopholes in legislation to tackle misuse of fireworks could be exploited by unscrupulous traders, Labour's John Cryer warned. He said they could allow traders to \"get through\" the net and urged ministers to reconsider a universal licensing system for all firework outlets. Home Office minister Hazel Blears insisted the Fireworks Act was \"robust\" and would make a significant difference. </p> <p><b>Fake colleges</b><br> More than 250 bogus colleges have been uncovered by a Home Office crackdown on illegal immigration, it emerged. Minister Des Browne said more than a quarter of 1,050 suspect institutions inspected so far had proved to be fake and a further 250 would be subjected to more rigorous investigation. </p> <p><b>Darfur crisis</b><br> The World Health Organisation has estimated that since March between 35,000 and 70,000 displaced people have died in Darfur, Sudan from violence, disease and malnutrition, Lords leader Lady Amos said. She also told peers the UN had estimated that 1.45 million had been displaced in the region and a further 200,000 had fled to Chad. </p> <p>Lady Amos gave the figures in response to crossbencher Lord Alton, a former Liberal Democrat MP, who spoke of \"the harrowing first-hand accounts of ethnically motivated killings, rapes, burnings and lootings\" in Darfur. </p> <p><b>Supreme court plans</b><br> The government was urged to postpone its planned constitutional shake-up until the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, makes a statement about the location and cost of the planned supreme court. </p> <p>Former Law Lord Lord Lloyd urged him to spell out plans for a new home for Law Lords who are to be removed from Westminster as part of the changes. </p> <p>Junior constitutional affairs minister Lady Ashton said during the constitutional reform bill's committee stage: \"The notion that anyone would want to see the Law Lords - who are held in the highest esteem - being bundled anywhere would be an anathema to all of us.\" There was \"no question\" of the court being housed in an inappropriate building. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, and his ministers and Cabinet Office minister Douglas Alexander face the Commons at question time. The companies (audit, investigations and community enterprise) bill is set to clear its remaining stages. Topics of backbench debates in Westminster Hall include the EU's relationship with Iran and protection of employees in private sector pension schemes. </p> <p>The Lords debates the housing bill's report stage and the civil contingencies bill's committee stage.</p>",
  "<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,1330892,00.html\">Map: where the attack happened</a> <p>A mortar attack on an Iraqi national guard headquarters north of Baghdad today killed or wounded at least 100 Iraqis, officials said.</p> <p>Six mortar rounds fell on national guard offices in an early morning attack in Mashahidan, 25 miles north of Baghdad, Iraqi police and national guard officers told the Associated Press. </p> <p>Reuters quoted a US military spokesman as saying four Iraqi national guards were killed and up to 80 wounded.</p> <p>The Iraqi national guard has been a target of insurgents trying to undermine US-led security efforts ahead of November national elections.</p> <p>In Ramadi, 70 miles west of Baghdad, US troops clashed with militants in the city's centre with fierce fighting taking place near City Hall, witnesses said. </p> <p>A Humvee was damaged when it was hit by a home-made bomb and rocket fire, according to witness Hatif Mahmoud. It was uncertain whether there were any US casualties. </p> <p>In nearby Falluja, the US command said it destroyed several weapons storage sites and safe houses of terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi last night.</p> <p>The operations in Ramadi and Fallujah were part of a stepped up campaign to curb Sunni Islamist insurgents before January's national elections and bring the volatile region west of the capital under government control. </p> <p>In Baghdad, the US command said the late night attacks in Falluja occurred around midnight but did not specify whether they were air strikes. </p> <p>\"Multiple secondary explosions indicate a significant amount of explosives or ammunition inside the houses,\" the statement said. </p> <p>It said recent attacks had forced leadership changes in al-Zarqawi's Tawhid and Jihad movement, and last night's strikes had targeted possible replacement leaders. Tawhid and Jihad has claimed responsibility for many car bombings and the beheading of hostages. </p> <p>The strikes came shortly after Falluja's chief negotiator, Sheik Khaled al-Jumeili, ruled out any quick resumption of talks to find a peaceful solution to the standoff in the city, 40 miles west of Baghdad. </p> <p><b>Oil pipeline attacked</b></p> <p>In northern Iraq, saboteurs attacked and set on fire a key oil pipeline that connects the Beiji oil refinery with Turkey, police said Tuesday. </p> <p>The pipeline was hit with explosives late yesterday, said a Beiji police officer on condition of anonymity. The attack happened about eight miles from the refinery. Beiji is 155 miles north of Baghdad. </p> <p>An official at the state-run Northern Oil Company also confirmed the attack but did not give details. </p> <p>Iraq's oil industry, which provides funds for Iraq's reconstruction efforts, has been the target of repeated attacks by insurgents in recent months. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a 1st Infantry Division Soldier died from a non-combat injury at a base in Diyala province, the US military said today.</p> <p>The soldier was found late on Sunday in his living quarters after he did not return to his guard post. The incident is under investigation. The name of the soldier is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. </p> <p><b>Britain considers troops request</b></p> <p>In London, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said Britain needed to redeploy troops closer to Baghdad so that the insurgency in central Iraq can be dealt with ahead of Iraqi elections. The government is considering a US request for British troops to be moved nearer the Iraqi capital to free up American forces for anti-insurgency operations. (<a href=\" http://politics.theguardian.com/iraq/story/0,12956,1330852,00.html \">Read more here.</a>)</p> <p><b>Australia moves embassy</b></p> <p>In a response to violence, Australia's government said today that it was moving its embassy in Baghdad into the strife-torn city's heavily fortified Green Zone. </p> <p>On Sunday a car bomb blast close to the Australian embassy in the Jadiriyah district killed six people. Authorities believe an Iraqi police convoy was the target.</p> <p>Australia's department of foreign affairs said the embassy would be moved in the first half of next year. </p> <p>Australia has 920 troops in and around Iraq and sent 2,000 to take part in last year's US-led invasion.</p>",
  "My trip to London should have only taken only about six hours. For me six hours is unimaginable. Why do I say that? Let me explain. I shall try to describe, step by step, the journey from Ramallah to London. <p>First we have to be in the taxi to leave at 3am so we can be the first to arrive at the Israeli military check point in Kalandia that opens its gates at 6am. If we get there at 6am then we can expect to pass at 9am or 10am.</p> <p>After passing the Kalandia check point comes the Jericho check point and then the terminal in Jericho. </p> <p>There we have to find our way through the hundreds of Palestinians who are trying to get in the buses in direction of Alenby bridge, the terminal to Amman.</p> <p>Getting on the bus is not so easy. There are a lot of people trying to get on first.</p> <p>In the bus, at the first check point to the bridge, the Israeli soldiers get in the bus and inspect the documents. This takes, in good times, about half an hour. While we are in the bus there will be at least a one to two hour stop waiting the first buses to get in the terminal. There we leave all our bags in the bus to be deposited in an area of departure.</p> <p>Then, at the bridge, it takes about another one to two hours to make the formalities of departure.</p> <p>After that we get in a second bus and it drives us to the area where our bags are. There we get our bags and get in the third bus to pass the bridge toward the Jordanian terminal and for similar procedures of formalities and personal and bags inspection.</p> <p>After finishing that we pass to Amman. In good days we arrive at Amman between 1-3 pm. From the airport of Amman we fly to London. </p> <p>Remember here that we are talking of a 90km distance between Ramallah and Amman. </p> <p>A simple calculation shows that our speed from Ramallah to Amman is 7.5km per hour - a speed slower than travelling on the back of a lazy donkey.</p>",
  "Even though the British mandate on Israel ended way back in 1948 there are still many Israelis who are convinced that we are still part of the Empire. Of course they deny the fact that Israel is in Asia and simply regard themselves as being provincial Europeans. My grandmother is one of these delusional people and so I have been told, since the age of four, that my greatest dream should be to go back to the motherland, specifically, London. <p>I was actually rather happy living in Israel. You know - the sandy beaches, the warm sun, the tanned men, the bombs. Rather unexpectedly (not if you ask my grandmother, who knew all along I was on my way to becoming the first Israeli MP) I was offered a scholarship at City University, London. </p> <p>Ah London, the city of myths. Everyone in London is extremely polite. It's always raining in London. No racism. Clean streets. People have a deep respect for the law. The cars drive on the wrong side of the road. Well, so far - fairly accurate.</p> <p>I guess I love London so far. That is if I don't think about the fact that I'm thousands of miles away from home. And that's a long way to be away from home. Think means panic. It means realising that at the age of 24 I'm starting chapter two of my life in a university with a bunch of 18-year-olds who are out to drink beer and party hard. And what is it with you British and beer? Haven't you heard of beer bellies? They are not aesthetically pleasing.</p> <p>But anyway, back to London. Last time I was here I was 15 and it was more of a 'classical Europe 10 days three capitals' sort of trip. And now here I am, a hopeless socialist straight out of a commune living 10 minutes away from where Karl Marx used to live! Thing is, I'm pretty sure most of my little classmates wouldn't give a damn. </p> <p>A little more about me. I came here as part of a programme which intends to promote human rights issues back home in the Middle East. I came to study journalism at City so I would be able to make a difference among the sometimes apathetic Israeli press. I know this sounds like something one simply writes on an application form hoping to be accepted, but I'm being sincere (or just anachronistic). Unfortunately, I feel rather misplaced.</p> <p>Over the past week I have been officially introduced to the new generation of British journalists. Armed with fierce mini-skirts (someone should have told me it was a 'must have' item in any reporter's wardrobe) and resolved to make 'contacts' at all clubs within a five kilometre radius, they are a determined group and certainly a new breed of watchdogs. Or maybe I simply haven't made new friends yet.</p> <p>Back to mini-skirts for a minute. It must be a wonder of evolution that keeps your legs from freezing and falling off. A round of applause to English girls everywhere for managing to pull that off. They wear them with such grace that you have to admire them for it.</p> <p>I've been here for two weeks now and have had my ups and downs. Sometimes homesick, sometimes carefree. My most prominent feeling though, is excitement. </p> <p>Excitement because I love the rain, and it has rained more in the last two weeks than in all of last winter in Israel. Excitement because my favourite Modigliani painting is hanging in a museum just 15 minutes away from my flat. Excitement because there are so many different new people that I could never have met anywhere else.</p> <p>I guess I feel hope.</p>",
  "The government's plan to liberalise gambling laws before the next parliamentary session received a mixed reaction from the papers. The proposed gambling bill would relax current regulations, clearing the way for large casinos to be opened across the country. <p>\"A libertarian would oppose any attempt by the state to limit a citizen's right to waste his or her money,\" the <b>Times</b> said. It thus considered that \"it is right for the government to experiment with greater liberalisation.\" This view was echoed by the <b> Blackpool Gazette</b>, which welcomed the move as a \"major step\" for the seaside resort - it would \"pave the way for Blackpool to attract major outside investment\". </p> <p>But does anyone want the casinos, asked the <b> Sun</b>. \"Polls show fewer than one in 10 supports a change in the law,\" and \"the social cost of flooding the country with casinos will be immense. The only winners will be American gaming conglomerates, who will rake in billions.\" That explained things for Peter Dobbie: \"Tony Blair does have a passion for everything American,\" he quipped in the <b>Mail on Sunday</b>. </p> <p>\"The government has evidently concluded that a juicy game pie is being baked, and it wants a thick slice,\" remarked Jenny McCartney in the <b> Sunday Telegraph</b> as she considered the tax revenue the government was set to make. But this would come at a cost: a culture of gamblers \"is one that has become impoverished - not just financially but psychologically.\" </p> <p>In the <b> Sunday Times</b>, Minette Marin was bewildered. \"It is really most odd that an administration which intrudes ceaselessly to protect us from ourselves - from our proletarian preference for fatty food, our reckless behaviour with conkers and the awesome risks of our school trips to our local pool - should somehow feel obliged to change the law radically and expose us to all the risks of games of chance,\" she said. </p> <p>New Labour's \"reckless encouragement of the gambling habit\" was too much for the <b> Daily Mail</b>. \"The decision will encourage crime and destroy countless families by adding to the 300,000-strong army of gambling addicts,\" it said. \"The founding fathers of socialism must be turning in their graves. The public good? Who cares?\"</p>",
  "<p>Given the traditional hostility towards their rivals across the Pennines in Manchester, you would not expect Leeds United fans to be interested in betting on red; fortunately for them - and they have not enjoyed a lot of good fortune recently - they should soon have the opportunity to bet on black instead.</p> <p>Stanley Leisure, the UK's biggest casino operator, yesterday acquired an option to buy 2.8 hectares (seven acres) of land next to the club's Elland Road ground. Should planning permission and the expected government deregulation of the gaming industry follow, a Las Vegas-style casino will have sprung up there by the end of 2007.</p> <p>Assuming Leeds have not sold the rest of their stadium by then, come five o'clock on a Saturday afternoon the Elland Road faithful will be able to rip up their worthless betting slips and head next door to hit the blackjack tables, try their luck at roulette - or even watch another craps game.</p> <p>But it won't be just at Leeds: all over the nation families regularly estranged for a fair chunk of their weekends now risk being separated for that little bit longer. With your average football stadium bookie attracting as long a queue as the bar on match days, you don't need the brains of David Beckham to work out that a casino next door might provide as much pulling power as Sven-Goran Eriksson.</p> <p>With the gambling bill getting its first reading today, Leeds becomes the latest in a long list of cities destined to boast stadiums and casinos as neighbours: plans for Glasgow Rangers, Sheffield United, West Ham and Newcastle United have already been announced. </p> <p>And last week Caesars Entertainment, owner of Las Vegas's Caesars Palace, said it would build a \u00a3330m Caesars Wembley next to the new national stadium.</p> <p>The Leeds venture in fact appears to be the exception rather than the rule. For a start, Stanley Leisure is a British company, while the other projects (with the exception of Caesars, which is a joint venture with the UK's Quintain Estates) all involve overseas giants.</p> <p>The Rangers, Sheffield United and West Ham casinos are all to be built by Las Vegas Sands, owner of the $1.5bn (\u00a3840m) Venetian complex, which rises - Grand Canal replica, gondoliers and all - above the Vegas strip.</p> <p>The company, headed by the secretive billionaire Sheldon Adelson, is thought to have approached as many as 20 British football clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham, about the prospect of building casinos next to their grounds.</p> <p>The three confirmed sites will all be \"regional casinos\" - complexes of at least 5,000 sq metres that will allow unlimited jackpots. </p> <p>A spokesman for Sands said football clubs, which often owns large areas of land, such as car parks, were looking at ways to develop their revenue streams and use their assets more than once a fortnight.</p> <p>He added that stadiums were often in inner cities, where Sands was keen to bring development and employment. Stanley said today its Leeds casino should create around 1,000 jobs, while Caesars Wembley would create up to 1,700.</p> <p>Sands is also thought to be in competition with MGM Mirage, owner of the MGM Grand, the world's biggest hotel and casino, over plans to build a casino next to Manchester City's stadium. MGM has already agreed to build casinos next to Newcastle's St James's Park and the Earls Court and Olympia exhibition centres in London.</p> <p>Kerzner International, headed by Sun City veteran Sol Kerzner, is also thought to be in the Manchester fray, having already drawn up plans to bring a casino to the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Some analysts criticise the proposed legislation for favouring the American and South African giants by insisting on the minimum size to qualify for regional casino status.</p> <p>Henk Potts, of Barclays Stockbrokers, believes the big players would see football clubs as a \"prime hunting ground\". </p> <p>\"[The stadiums] are used to catering for a lot of people,\" he says. \"They have the space and the infrastructure and they are looking to generate more revenue - their assets are sitting there doing nothing most of the time.</p> <p>\"There is also a strong element of brand loyalty and often a large catchment area.\"</p> <p>Stanley Leisure made much of the catchment area point when announcing its deal yesterday, pointing out that more than 5 million people lived within an hour's drive of Elland Road. </p> <p>As far as brand loyalty is concerned, however, Leeds fans would do as well betting on red after all: while many of the current projects involve partnerships between the clubs and the casino operators, Leeds's involvement ends with the sale of the land on which the casino will be built. </p> <p>Stanley says it is in discussions \"with possible partners who share its vision to maximise the full potential of the development\". They do not include Leeds. The cash-strapped club would appear to be taking the \u00a35m it gets for the land and running. Given what has happened to it over the last few years, it may well have had enough of gambling.</p>",
  "<p>The gambling bill, published today, is one of the most bizarre creations this government - a Labour government, remember - has come up with. </p> <p>The party that pledged in opposition to boost manufacturing industry but which presided over the loss of another 750,000 manufacturing jobs is now poised to give a big boost to casinos in the regions. Gambling is to be a lifeline for former manufacturing centres such as Birmingham, Coventry and Leeds.</p> <p>Not that the government is admitting this. The normally sage culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, in a moment of Blairspeak, said yesterday: \"This is a bill about new protections, not new casinos.\" </p> <p>There are certainly a number of new and commendable protections, ranging from the establishment of a gambling commission to the removal of fruit machines from more than 6,000 takeaways and minicab offices. There will also be a limit of 1,250 fruit machines in each casino. Oh, that's all right then.</p> <p>But wait: the government is also easing the way for the construction or extension of large new casinos with unlimited payouts, many of them to be built with US money. Ms Jowell is also planning to remove some of what she calls \"draconian\" restrictions, such as the rule that membership is needed 24 hours before entering a casino. I think the dictionary I use is different from hers. </p> <p>The government claims it is responding to popular demand, but the only demand visible on the radar screen is from the gambling industry, which stands to gain millions in profits. Of course, just because there is no recognisable \"demand\" for it doesn't mean it will not be popular. The easing of the licensing laws aggravated binge drinking just as permissive rules about massage parlours led to an explosion in their growth 20 years ago. </p> <p>In the case of gambling, the poor will be the main victims as they will be tempted to punt on a one-in-a-million chance of pulling themselves out of poverty. </p> <p>It is not as if Britain is deprived of opportunities. We are now a nation not of shopkeepers but of gamblers: we have a national lottery, premium bonds with a \u00a31m prize each month, football pools, bingo, scratchcards and bookies at the races and the dogs, not to mention online betting, which is booming. </p> <p>I once asked a returning Swiss journalist what his most vivid memory of Britain was after his first visit, and he replied: \"Betting shops - there seems to be one in every street, unlike anywhere else in Europe.\"</p> <p>There is, of course, a hidden agenda: local authorities are keen on casinos because they could generate local revenues at a time of intense squeeze from Whitehall, and the Treasury, run by Mr Prudence Brown - when did he last have a gamble? - sees it as another stealth tax to keep public borrowing afloat.</p> <p>I have nothing at all against gambling as such, and I'm not against more casinos in the right places. Blackpool has a strong case - though, interestingly, operators are less keen to go there, where gambling would be part of people's holidays, than they are to open in city centres, where weekly pay packets are spent.</p> <p>The government obliges the gambling industry to pay \u00a33m a year to fund research into addiction. Would it not be better to stop it happening in the first place? And will anyone believe research, however independent, that is funded by the industry? </p> <p>The real tragedy is that a government that has singularly failed to generate more manufacturing jobs should be crowing over the number of new ones casinos will bring. The final insult is that the legislation is deemed so important it is going to be \"fast-tracked\" through parliament before the next general election when there is insufficient time, apparently, to debate troop deployments in Iraq.</p>",

  "<p>For someone who specialises in parties of the apolitical variety, Norman Cook, better known as Fatboy Slim, can't seem to shake off the politicians. His anthem Praise You was unofficially adopted by both Tony Blair in 1999 and Al Gore in 2000. Now Labour are at it again, playing his 1998 hit Right Here, Right Now at their recent conference in Brighton, and blasting it from campaign buses at the Hartlepool byelection. </p> <p>\"I want people to know I had no choice,\" responded an aggrieved Cook, an opponent of the war in Iraq. \"Apparently as long as they pay the performing royalties, we have no say in it.\" So it proves. According to Jill Drew of the song-licensing body Phonographic Performance Ltd, Labour exploited a copyright grey area; the artist's permission is required if a political party wants a song as its official campaign tune, but not if it's played informally. </p> <p>Cook's frustration is understandable: he wasn't given the chance to do what any sensible musician should do if ever a politician hoves into view - run like the wind. It's impossible to think of the dance duo D:Ream without picturing John Prescott dancing to Things Can Only Get Better at Labour's 1997 post-election shindig with all the genuine enthusiasm of someone with a gun held to his back. </p> <p>The devoutly socialist Primal Scream were apoplectic when Labour shortlisted Moving On Up for their 2001 election theme tune (they eventually opted for the Lighthouse Family's blandly reassuring Lifted). In America, Bruce Springsteen famously declined Ronald Reagan's request to use Born in the USA as his campaign anthem, and Tom Petty had to stop George W Bush from coopting I Won't Back Down. </p> <p>Baby-kissers are usually drawn to big, bumper-sticker choruses (hence Right Here, Right Now), while ignoring everything else. Reagan missed Born in the USA's anti-war message despite the giveaway couplet \"Sent me off to Vietnam/To go and kill the yellow man\", and Labour adopted the Farm's All Together Now for the 1999 Scottish elections, ignoring the crucial fact that the song is set in the killing fields of Flanders. </p> <p>Perhaps the most curious collision of band and politician occurred at the 2000 Conservative party conference, when someone randomly chose a Massive Attack album to fill time until a technical hitch was overcome. TV cameras accidentally showed William Hague soundtracked by the skulking reggae of Man Next Door. Of course, Hague would never have intentionally selected a suffocating, paranoid rant about a threatening character who lives next door. Tony Blair might consider it, though.</p>",
  "The government today published its contentious gambling bill, which ministers say will regulate \"socially responsible\" gambling but critics claim will see new mega-casinos cause an increase in addiction. <p>The bill will for the first time regulate online gambling, create a new regulator for the industry and allow unlimited jackpots and new \"regional casinos\".</p> <p>But it will also ban slot machines from fast-food restaurants and taxi offices in a bid to remove easy access from children.</p> <p>It will also remove the current \"24 hour\" safeguard between becoming a member of a casino, and being permitted to play.</p> <p>Concerns have been raised that big US operators will cash in on the relaxation of the law. </p> <p>Former welfare minister Frank Field has warned there would be \"no turning back\" once the door had been opened to the US giants. </p> <p>Former shadow culture minister Julie Kirkbride has also voiced concern. \"The sheer access to it [gambling] will create a lot of unhappiness and a lot of family distress,\" she warned. </p> <p>\"And whilst we might want to make it available in one or two places in the country, do we want it on our doorstep in every town and city across the country?\" </p> <p>Religious groups have also criticised the plans. The Salvation Army said the public did not want gambling laws relaxed. </p> <p>An NOP poll it commissioned showed that 93% of the British public thought there were already enough opportunities to gamble. </p> <p>\"There are only two real winners that will benefit from the liberalisation of gambling laws: the gaming industry through massively increased profits, and the government through increased taxation,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>\"The big losers will be the vulnerable people whose lives are ruined by gambling addiction.\" </p> <p>The new legislation, if approved by parliament, will allow unlimited jackpots in the largest new venues - known as regional casinos - while slot machines will be taken out of around 6,000 fast food and other premises.</p> <p><b>Safeguards</b></p> <p>It also creates a new Gambling Commission to supervise the business and a licensing regime which takes the responsibility for approving premises away from local licensing justices. </p> <p>Ministers insist there are safeguards to protect those most at risk, with specific offences of allowing young people to gamble contrary to the revised rules. </p> <p>The new commission will also be required to promote \"socially responsible gambling\" through licence conditions and a new code of practice. </p> <p>The new moves mean casinos will no longer have to be sited in certain \"permitted\" areas, and will be open to the public rather than operating as 24-hour membership clubs. </p> <p>Besides the supersized \"regional\" casinos, there will be others designated as \"large\" and \"small\", where lower prize money can be played for on slot machines. </p> <p>A casino is broadly defined as somewhere with unequal betting, or so-called \"bankers' games\" where punters are betting against the house. </p> <p>In other changes, racecourse betting will be allowed on Good Friday and Christmas Day for the first time. </p> <p>And the new legislation is also aimed at regulating remote betting, for example by TV or on the internet where the operator is based in Great Britain. Most provisions of the bill apply to England, Wales and Scotland - with a few technical exceptions. </p> <p>Some provisions apply in Northern Ireland, including the outlawing of so-called \"chain gift schemes\", where punters pay a joining fee then hope to profit by encouraging others to do so, and a technical measure relating to foreign betting. </p> <p><b>Timing of the bill</b></p> <p>It had been expected that the bill would be introduced in the Queen's Speech at the start of the next parliamentary session. </p> <p>Introducing the bill in this session, under new rules meaning it can be carried over to the next, beginning in November, means it is more likely to become law as the next session is set to be squeezed by a general election. </p> <p>Yesterday the Stanley Leisure group unveiled plans to open a casino complex next to Leeds United's Elland Road ground, a move that it said would create more than 1,000 jobs and open in 2007 and be the second biggest casino complex in the country after one in Birmingham.</p> <p>Yesterday's announcement comes just a week after Caesars Entertainment, the owner of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, unveiled plans to open an \"entertainment resort\" at a redeveloped Wembley leisure complex. </p> <p>The proposed deregulation of gambling laws has already attracted interest in the UK from other major US leisure operators, including MGM Mirage.</p>",
  "<p> Our hallowed bastion of gameland is being threatened by a new danger. No, not parental control, government warning or sequelitis but evil capitalist product placement shenanigans which will promote the latest brand of jeans, shoes and discount meat products to our easily-swayed soft brains!</p> <p>While advertising in games is not terribly new (Danger-shooter <a href=\"http://archive.gamespy.com/games/131.shtml\">Kingpin</a> featured Diesel-wear, <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/09/17/big_macs_pentiums_invade_sims/\">The Sims Online</a> sold McDonalds hamburgers, <a href=\"http://www.there.com/pr_officialLaunch.html\">There.com</a> featured buy-able Nike for your avatars), Activision has boosted the momentum by making a deal with the car manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.there.com/pr_officialLaunch.html\">Chrysler</a>, and funding <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-18-2004/0002284286&amp;EDATE=\">research</a> to boot. Their Surrey tractor-esque Jeep has second billing to OAP skater dude Tony Hawk in the recently released iteration of the series. This isn't just a flash-in-the-pan event either; Peter Molyneux's eagerly anticipated title <a href=\"http://www.themoviesgame.com/\">The Movies</a> is also in on the act, incorporating Chrysler into its script.</p> <p>Essentially, the announcement on Monday suggested that serious marketing thought is going into \"how long and how often players interact with brands\". Suddenly big business is aware that gamers are getting more out of their entertainment than previously anticipated for a \"kids' medium\" (I expect we have some of the negative publicity to thank for that) and that, as virtual world academic <a href=\"http://terranova.blogs.com\">Edward Castronova</a> has explained to me in the past, there's been a significant dip in TV ratings since the boom of computer gaming.</p> <p>There is good argument to suggest that the interactivity of the medium is an important aspect of taking in the message, and the research addresses when, how and where active interaction with a brand in a game is the most cost-effective. The results indicate that games are a viable avenue in which to product place: 87% of the participants remembered seeing an in-game brand, and this translates into pay point purchases.</p> <p>However, this calls into question a discussion I had at lunch the other week with a couple of games industry professionals. While we all admitted that such blatant corporate promotion is inevitable due to spiralling production and development costs, only one of our number was enthusiastic about it, suggesting that it opened up new financial possibilities and mass market appeal for the products. Myself and the other lunching member of the party were more sceptical, and were concerned with the future of such \"beneficial\" arrangements when it came to content and design.</p> <p>What, for example, happens when a well-known car manufacturer's in-game vehicle is used for an in-game un-lawful violation, is driven away and then explodes, killing innocent non-playable characters? Will that well-known car manufacturer start having editorial control over what goes on in the game?</p> <p>Will a trainer manufacturer have a say over what moral character a massively-multiplayer online game avatar must ascribe to if it purchases models of its footwear?</p> <p>What other dangers await when the advertising cloak lifts?</p> <p>As a young industry, eager to get in on the same scale as other forms of entertainment, here's hoping the games business takes heed from its older and potentially wiser brethren, and doesn't start flashing billboards in our digital faces. That would take out most of the fun.</p>",
  "Jack Straw today declared that Britain was \"very sympathetic\" to an American request for UK troops to deploy in Iraq as a fill-in for US forces - although an operational decision would only be taken after a reconnaissance mission by army experts today. <p>The foreign secretary insisted earlier that it was \"possible to say no\" to the request, although that would be \"letting down an ally\".</p> <p>In a joint press conference with Mr Straw in London this morning, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, did not specifically comment on the coalition deployment, but warned that a secure environment in Iraq was vital for effective reconstruction.</p> <p>He added that without this, \"smooth\" elections would not be possible in January, \"therefore to pacify the environment would be extremely helpful\".</p> <p>Mr Annan is to meet Tony Blair later today for private talks, as a furious spat opened up between the government and the only mainstream anti-war party, the Liberal Democrats, after Mr Straw accused them of wanting to leave Saddam in a \"strengthened\" position of power.</p> <p><b>'A strengthened Saddam'</b><br></p> <p>The foreign secretary launched a broadside against the Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, for opposing the war, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning: \"The choice was between our course or a strengthened Saddam Hussein, who for sure once the sanctions had degraded - as they were doing - and the troops had left, would have emerged more powerful, carrying out his torture and his tyranny within Iraq and threatening the region as a whole. </p> <p>\"That, I'm afraid, is the position of the Liberal Democrats which dare not speak its name in terms of their policy.\" </p> <p>An angry Mr Kennedy immediately rang in to Radio 4, demanding an apology from Mr Straw for \"scandalously\" misrepresenting his party's Iraq policy. The Lib Dem leader accused Mr Straw of insulting millions of voters who also opposed the war.</p> <p>He accused the government of \"moving the goalposts\" on the case for the war and said: \"I want an apology today from the foreign secretary for what he has said about us and what he has said about the millions of people in this country who have agreed with us.</p> <p>\"To try to suggest or imply, as he did, that somehow those of us who were against the war were, in fact, covertly in favour of some form of strengthened Saddam Hussein is an absolute insult to the integrity as well as the intelligence of people. </p> <p>Mr Straw had said: \"We have a responsibility for sorting the situation [in Iraq] out. Those who opposed the military action, however, also have their responsibility.</p> <p>\"As of March 2003, the possibility of securing a weakened Saddam by effective inspections and an ultimatum wasn't on offer.\"</p> <p><b>'Compelling justification'</b><br></p> <p>The Conservative leader, Michael Howard, this morning accused the government of having failed to provide a \"compelling\" reason why UK troops should now fill in for the US in Iraq.</p> <p>Mr Howard told Today: \"We don't have a reserve force in southern Iraq for fun. It is there for a purpose.\"</p> <p>Although the south of Iraq is relatively quiet, British troops in towns such as Amara have come under heavy attack in recent weeks, he said.</p> <p>\"If there is a compelling justification for us to accept that greater risk, then we will support that deployment, but we haven't had it yet.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw countered that it was a \"myth\" to suggest that the British-administered area in the south was entirely safe, while US troops in the so-called \"triangle of death\" were under constant attack.</p> <p>\"That is simply untrue. It is an insult to our soldiers and to American solders,\" he told Today. Mr Straw also insisted that Britain could refuse the request: \"It is possible to say no. It depends on the advice we receive from the professional soldiers on the ground. </p> <p>\"I think we would be letting down an ally if we were to say no in the face of very clear advice from our own British commanders that we should make this contribution.\"</p> <p><b>January elections</b><br></p> <p>The purpose of any change in UK troops' positions would be to ensure that elections to an independent Iraqi government went ahead throughout the country in January as planned.</p> <p>\"It is of critical importance that the insurgency is dealt with, otherwise - particularly given the electoral system, which is one constituency for the country - the elections would be flawed,\" said Mr Straw. </p> <p>\"That is why it is necessary for us to make an additional effort.\" </p> <p>He rejected warnings against \"mission creep\", insisting that coming to the assistance of the US in this way could ensure that Britain's responsibilities in Iraq are brought to a swifter conclusion.</p> <p>\"The point of doing this, far from there being any aim of getting bogged down, is so that we can stick to the timetable set by the UN security council and therefore hand over effective power and control - as well as the sovereignty already handed over - to the Iraqi people quicker than would otherwise be the case,\" he said.</p> <p>Reports that the chief of defence staff had expressed opposition to the move to ministers were \"simply untrue\", said Mr Straw.</p> <p>\"We are all in the same position, that if this is operationally justified we should go ahead,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Part of the purpose of the reconnaissance mission by military experts is to ensure that if British troops are put into an area north of their current area of operation, they can make a contribution, but also that the risk to those troops, and therefore the anxiety to their families, is not too high.\"</p> <p>Debate over the deployment comes as Mr Blair holds talks today with Mr Annan. It is the first time they have met since Mr Annan's recent warning that the war in Iraq was illegal.</p> <p>Speaking after his talks with Mr Annan, Mr Straw said: \"They have got the elections well organised ... and in terms of the administrative arrangements these are on course. But of course the key issue there is that of security, ensuring a security environment in which the elections can take place satisfactorily. </p> <p>\"The people of Iraq have waited a long time for the chance to elect their leaders and we are determined they should be able to do so.\"</p>",
  "<p>Average delays to flights using the UK's major airports were the same this spring as for the same period last year, despite a day of disruption in early June, it was announced today. </p> <p>A computer problem at the West Drayton air traffic control centre in west London on June 3 this year caused flight cancellations and severe delays. </p> <p>But the average delay to charter flights in and out of 10 leading UK airports during April-June 2004 was 20 minutes - the same figure as in the corresponding three months of 2003, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said. </p> <p>A total of 73% of April-June 2004 charter flights were on time - also the same figure as in April-June 2003. </p> <p>For scheduled flights during April-June 2004, the on-time figure of 78% and the average delay of 12 minutes were both the same as in the same period last year. </p> <p>The CAA statistics relate to arrivals and departures at Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham, Luton, Stansted, Manchester, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow and London City airports. </p> <p>Overall, the June 3 West Drayton difficulties increased the April-June 2004 average delay for scheduled and charter flights by about half a minute. </p> <p>The figures do not include flight cancellations.</p> <p>Of the most popular scheduled destinations, the routes to Lisbon, Toronto and Newark, New Jersey had on-time performances of less than 70% and average delays of more than 18 minutes.

  "<p>Conrad Russell - Earl Russell and younger son of Bertrand - died last week. I'm not sure if he was well known outside Lib Dem circles, or outside the House of Lords where he commanded unprecedented cross-party respect. But for Lib Dems everywhere he was a hero.</p> <p>Political heroes come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Byelection victors, campaign strategists, great orators, powerful leaders. But the most enduring heroes by far are those who set the terms of debate, who craft the ideas which make a political party tick. Conrad Russell was an ideas man to his fingertips, and liberal to his core.</p> <p>He was a striking, slightly beguiling figure. He walked with an intellectual's stoop, invariably with a cigarette in hand. A shock of white hair was permanently standing to attention above an angular, slightly hawkish face. He talked in paragraphs. I remember having dinner with him at a party conference a couple of years ago. I was writing an earnest essay about how the elusive concept of \"subsidiarity\" (who does what) in the EU should be defined, and I was keen to pick his very considerable brains. </p> <p>Like all clear thinkers, he started from first principles (\"you first need to decide what you think the EU is for\"), and then spoke with compelling clarity, in perfectly scripted paragraphs, about the necessity of a European constitution to define the powers of the EU. As ever, well ahead of his time.</p> <p>His abiding political interest was the nature of power. To be precise, the danger of excessive concentrations of unaccountable power He was equally uncomfortable with overbearing corporate, private sector power as he was with heavy handed state authority. For him, there was a direct ideological link between his enthusiasm to see full blooded competition in the private sector - he always preferred lean enterprise to fat cats - and his wariness of using the full authority of the state to ban foxhunting (\"not the top of my list of priorities\" he once said to me) or to curtail the freedom of smokers - an addiction which did so much to harm his own health.</p> <p>For him, liberalism was rooted firmly in the belief that power of all sorts should always be dispersed and accountable. He detested what he regarded as the patronising, top-down approach to so much public policy in Whitehall, especially at the Treasury. Electoral reform and devolution of authority to local government were not Lib Dem party slogans for him, but indispensable steps to bring British government into line with contemporary liberal principles.</p> <p>His other great preoccupation, one which seemed to grow over time, was how to make the process of globalisation comprehensible and accountable. He admired the ambition of supranational institutions like the EU or the World Trade Organisation, notwithstanding their numerous flaws, but worried about the way in which authority was increasingly congregating at international level out of reach of national parliaments and elected assemblies. </p> <p>The European parliament, to Conrad, was an essential ingredient in the attempt to extend democracy beyond the nation state. But he was realistic enough to see that legitimacy did not come readily to institutions perceived to be distant from voters. Conrad didn't have the definitive answer to this contemporary conundrum, but he had the wisdom to recognise that it is something we all need to struggle with.</p> <p>I guess the art of politics is the ability to connect big ideas to everyday concerns. I was out canvassing in Sheffield Hallam soon after I heard of Conrad's death. What would he have said if he were out knocking on doors with me that day? He would have enjoyed some of the conversations: one very friendly voter said that he would continue voting for the Conservatives unless the Tory party \"went mad and became too Eurosceptic\". A little flabbergasted, I asked how he thought the Tory party could go any more mad on Europe, what with John Redwood's recent Ukip-style pledge to break the law and unilaterally remove Britain from great swaths of EU policy? Or the equally friendly voter who patiently explained that she was a lifelong socialist and so would vote for Tony Blair. Conrad would no doubt have pointed out that Blair would be trembling in his boots at the idea that he still elicits the confidence of sincere socialists...</p> <p>He would have taken a keen interest in the widespread concerns many residents in Sheffield Hallam have about the installation of a new wave of \"third generation\" mobile phone masts. He would have been aghast at the way in which these masts can be erected without any meaningful local scrutiny, as long as they are shorter than an entirely arbitrary height of 15 metres. And he would have been intrigued in the way in which public trust in science has declined so rapidly as concerns about public health have increased.</p> <p>He would have celebrated the way local residents have organised themselves to make their protest heard. Active citizens treating Whitehall officialdom and corporate representatives with tough, but polite, scepticism would have delighted him. Who knows, he might even have said that well informed, independent minded, feisty voters are exactly what Liberalism is all about.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nick Clegg is the Liberal Democrat prospective parliamentary candidate for Sheffield Hallam</p>",
  "The prime minister of Burma's secretive military government, General Khin Nyunt, has been removed from office by hardliners in the regime, according to reports from neighbouring Thailand. <p>\"We can confirm that Khin Nyunt has been removed from the position of prime minister and is being detained under house arrest,\" Thai government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Diplomats in Burma and other senior Thai officials claimed Gen Khin Nyunt, who is number three in the military junta, had lost a power struggle with its most powerful figure, General Than Shwe.</p> <p>Unconfirmed reports from Thailand said Gen Khin Nyunt, who is seen as a relative moderate, had been accused of corruption and place under house arrest. </p> <p>In Burma, which is a highly closed society, there were rumours that Gen Khin Nyunt had been forced to resign and that soldiers had raided the military intelligence headquarters, which were said to no longer be under his control. </p> <p>Observers said that if the reports were true, the hardliners in the junta would have a more powerful position to hamper reconciliation efforts with the pro-democracy opposition led by Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. </p> <p>Thai General Lertart Rattanatavanich told reporters in Mai Sot, a town on the border with Burma, that Thai army reports indicated that the junta \"is unhappy with Gen Khin Nyunt and they want to remove him from his position\". \"We believe that whatever has happened is about changing the position of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt,\" he said. </p> <p>The Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was holding a cabinet meeting in Mai Sot, said he had received reports that there was \"some political tension\" in Burma but could not confirm what was happening. </p> <p>There was no sign of tanks or increased military presence on the streets of the Burmese capital, Rangoon. Gen Khin Nyunt became prime minister in August last year. The role had previously been seen as a ceremonial position, and Burma observers say his appointment was probably a demotion from the positions he had previously held in the ruling clique of generals.</p> <p>Despite Gen Khin Nyunt being considered something of a moderate, he did not succeed in convincing other generals to strike a deal with Ms Suu Kyi to restore democracy to the impoverished south-east Asian country. </p> <p>Over the past year, Gen Khin Nyunt has promoted what he called a road map toward democracy in UN-brokered contacts between the government and Ms Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy. The talks were unfruitful, and critics accused the government of using stalling tactics to retain its grip on power. </p> <p>Burma has been ruled by the military since 1962, when army commander Ne Win seized power. The country was renamed Myanmar by the junta in 1989, a name recognised by the UN but not by some countries including the UK and the US, which do not recognise the military dictatorship. </p> <p>Pro-democracy protests led by Ms Suu Kyi were bloodily suppressed in 1988, and Gen Khin Nyunt was one of the younger generation of generals who assumed power.</p>",
  "<p>Sun editor Rebekah Wade has ordered the paper's sports desk to drop all mention of football sponsors from its coverage in the latest salvo in the ongoing rights battle between newspapers and the game's governing bodies. </p> <p>The move, which is sure to enrage sponsors such as Barclays and Coca-Cola which have shelled out millions for the naming rights to the leagues, comes as the two sides have failed to come to an agreement on the terms under which the game should be covered by the press. </p> <p>In an email to staff, Graham Dudman, the managing editor of the Sun, ordered reporters and subeditors working on the sports desk to refrain from mentioning any sponsors. </p> <p>The first effects of the boycott can be seen in yesterday's Super Goals pullout, with the Barclays Premiership referred to as the Premiership and the Coca-Cola Championship becoming the Championship. The ban also prevents mention of Nationwide, which sponsors the national side and the Conference league. </p> <p>The Sun's picture desk has also been told to obscure sponsors' logos on player's shirts where possible. </p> <p>\"Where possible, picture selection should minimise the use of a logo. If there are two very similar photos, one with a clear logo and one with the logo not so clear, try and use the not as clear logo version. Wherever possible, pictures should be cropped to lose a shirt logo or just show part of it,\" said the edict. </p> <p>The ban on sponsors' names is designed to put pressure on the Premier League and Football League in their latest clash with the media over the rules under which reporters and photographers should be let into football grounds and the licensing terms under which copy and pictures can be used. </p> <p>Newspapers have claimed the football authorities have been heavy-handed in their treatment, seeking to control their coverage despite the fact that they devote acres of editorial every day to promoting the game and the sponsors attached to it.</p> <p>For their part, the football authorities argue that they have no problem with newspapers covering the sport but draw the line at them using data and pictures for commercial gain, such as launching mobile phone score alert and picture services, paid-for online offerings and posters and stickers. </p> <p>The current licensing deal between the Newspaper Publishers Association and the football authorities came to an end at the end of last season, with an extension agreed until the end of this month when the two sides failed to come to an agreement. </p> <p>Yesterday's move by the Sun marks the first time a national newspaper has taken action to remove sponsors from its football coverage, although similar steps have been taken before in Scotland. </p> <p>In 2002, several newspapers removed mentions of the sponsors of horse races from their daily race cards following a row over the use of data with the British Horseracing Board. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Plans by the Treasury to provide accounts for 3 million households without access to banking services are expected to be announced next month in a move that is likely to sour the relationship between the high street banks and the government. </p> <p>The Treasury is expected to set out targets for the number of basic accounts each bank must open in the pre-budget report, which is due next month or early December. It is believed that the targets will be based on each bank's share of the current account market. </p> <p>The major banking groups are being softened up for the move after being summoned to the Treasury in recent weeks to be told they must do more to recruit customers to the so-called basic accounts which offer simple banking services without overdrafts. </p> <p>However, the banks are thought to be unhappy about the plan and some are believed to be ready to fight the demand unless the government forces it upon them through legislation. </p> <p>The basic accounts were set up in 1999 as part of the government's agenda to tackle financial exclusion. At the same time the government set up the post office-based \"universal\" bank account aimed at those who receive social security but do not have bank accounts. </p> <p>The banks were forced to stump up almost \u00a3200m to help create the universal bank and some of them are believed to be frustrated at being asked to do more to open basic bank accounts - which are loss-making. </p> <p>The Treasury signalled its in terest in this area in the budget when it said that despite the introduction of basic bank accounts the number of households operating outside the mainstream financial services had \"not fallen significantly\". </p> <p>The 3 million households who do not have current accounts face higher costs in paying the bills because they do not receive any of the discounts associated with direct debits or standing orders. Around 1.5 million households have no mainstream financial services products at all, according to statistics cited by the Treasury but compiled by the Department for Work and Pensions. </p> <p>According to the banking industry, basic accounts are being opened. The British Bankers' Association, the banking industry's lobby group, calculates that 150,000 new basic accounts are opened every quarter. Since April last year, 834,000 accounts have been opened and the BBA is forecasting that when it publishes its next set of data it will be able to show that 1 million new basic accounts have been opened since April 2003. </p> <p>The BBA refused to comment on the situation while discussions were ongoing with the government. A spokeswoman said: \"The Treasury is having constructive discussions with the British Bankers' Association and the banks on financial inclusion.\" </p> <p>But one source said: \"The Treasury are threatening to introduce targets and individual banks are very unhappy. The banks see this as a trust issue. They paid into the post office bank and [at the time] were told [by the government]: 'If you give us the money and set up basic accounts you will have fulfilled your social responsibilities'.\" </p> <p>While both the accounts offered by the post office and the banks are aimed at people opening accounts for the first time, their features are different. The accounts offered by the banks allow direct debits and standing orders to be set up, while the post office universal accounts do not. </p> <p>In the budget, the Treasury had pledged to make proposals by the summer; however, that deadline has slipped and by the spending review in July the government said it was working with the banks to identify \"a challenging target which specifies the reduction in the unbanked\". </p> <p>The spending review also mentioned other plans to try to reach people without bank accounts which the government believes are more likely to use the \"alternative credit market\" and pay rates of interest many times those of a standard overdraft. At the time the government said it wanted to \"explore mechanisms that allow profitable loans to be made available to those on low incomes at a much lower rate of interest.\"</p>",
  "<p>The publishers of Viz magazine have axed the Fat Slags, one of its most infamous cartoon strips, after their big screen adaptation was branded the worst British film ever made.</p> <p>Sandra and Tracey, two sex-mad north country factory workers from 69 Shit Street, Fulchester, will make their last appearance in the magazine's 25th anniversary issue, which is out next week.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry to say that the Fat Slags are no more,\" said Graham Dury, the editor of Viz. \"After seeing this crass and ill-conceived film I just don't feel like drawing them again. It was crap from start to end, there are no laughs to be had and it bears no relation to the comic strip on which we have worked so hard to make a success.\"</p> <p>The Fat Slags first appeared in Viz 15 years ago. The big screen version, which stars Sophie Thompson and Smack the Pony's Fiona Allen, follows them on a trip to London where they help an American media tycoon, who is brain damaged after insulting the Dalai Lama.</p> <p>The movie was universally panned by critics in tabloids and broadsheets alike. \"Crass, demeaning and thoroughly depressing, I would sooner recommend you scoop out your eyes with teaspoons than watch this,\" said Wendy Ide in the Times.</p> <p>\"There may still be some diehard Viz aficionados who'll love every second of this film - but I'm one and I didn't,\" said Johnny Vaughan in the Sun, while the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw concluded: \"It has plenty of gross-out stuff, but chucked in with an eerie lack of enjoyment or conviction. Depression seeps out of the screen like carbon monoxide.\" </p> <p>\"First they said that Mad Cows was the worst British film ever made. Then they said Sex Lives of the Potato Men was. Now the hot topic among connoisseurs of bad films will be: is Fat Slags worse than Cows and Potato Men combined?\" asked Cosmo Landesman in the Sunday Times.</p> <p>The film adaptation also starred Geri Halliwell, Naomi Campbell, Angus Deayton and former EastEnder Michael Greco. The Dalai Lama was played by Pink Panther star Bert Kwouk.</p> <p>Privately Viz executives are furious that the film has been made at all - when the magazine was sold to Dennis Publishing the film rights were retained by the magazine's former owner, John Brown Publishing. </p> <p>As a result, the Viz editorial team had no control over the film and were \"appalled\" by the end result. The Fat Slags' creator and former Viz editor Simon Donald said it was \"embarrassing\". </p> <p>\"Even the most idiotic, misguided teenage moron will not get a laugh out of this truly irredeemable crock of horseshit,\" he said.</p> <p>They believe that it will damage the reputation of the magazine and decided the only option was to distance themselves by killing the two ladies off.</p> <p>Mr Dury said: \"As far as we are concerned the Fat Slags has already been made by Alan Clarke. His [1986] film Rita, Sue and Bob Too is the best film you could hope to make of the Fat Slags. This version was crap from start to end.\"</p> <p>Within weeks of their debut in 1989, the Fat Slags were recruited in an advertising campaign for Tennent's lager. At the time, a Guardian column said they \"stood out [in Viz] as the most appalling and the funniest strip, perhaps because they contain a hint of truth and tragedy. They're gluttonous and amoral and they'll shag anyone who's good for a bag of chips.\"</p> <p>Viz will celebrate its 25th birthday at a party hosted by digital channel UKTV G2 at London's Cafe de Paris later this month. Featuring wrestlers and a ukulele orchestra, it will be hosted by Nicholas Parsons.</p> <p>Fat Slags was directed by Ed Bye, who also directed Kevin and Perry Go Large. The big screen version of Harry Enfield's comic creation, Kevin the Teenager, was a hit at the box office and took \u00a39m in the UK in its first three weeks on release.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Fifteen seconds, that's what the Nokia Shorts competition gives you: 15 seconds to move, amuse, upset, be memorable. Then roll credits - if you've got time - and get the hell out. If you start at the top of this piece and read aloud at a leisurely pace, 15 seconds will probably get you to around ... here. And 15 seconds isn't the only limit placed by the competition. They also want movies that will play on a mobile phone. So far so tight.</p> <p>We have got form for this sort of thing. In the past, my colleague Joe Berger and I have made films lasting three minutes, two minutes, and 45 seconds; so surely we could tighten our belt once more. </p> <p>We could also draw on the experience of writing our comic strip, The Pitchers, about a couple of hapless Hollywood hacks who churn out films with titles like Cowstore Drugboy and Proud and Prejudiced - starring Steven Seagal. (Hollywood always beats us at our own game in the end though: see Bride and Prejudice). Four-panel comic strips, like micro-short films, force you to get your idea across \"as the crow flies\" - by the most direct route. </p> <p>And our heroes' favourite activity - pitching - is itself the art of brevity. Producer Don Simpson memorably got it right down to the bone for Top Gun. In fact he didn't really use any words at all. He briefed the writer, Chip Proser, with a photograph. \"It was two guys in leather jackets and sunglasses standing in front of the biggest, fastest, fucking airplane you ever saw in your life,\" said Proser. \"This is it,\" said Simpson, \"this is the concept.\"</p> <p>But when we came to make the film, the first thing we had to understand is what 15 seconds means. You imagine an idea that you think will comfortably fit that space, but often get a shock when it is realised. Your mind seems to bend time. (To get an idea: read a book aloud at the same pace as you do silently, and it sounds absurdly fast.) And there is something about the shortness that lulls you. You twist the logic to read: \"I have less time to fill, so surely it will be easier.\" But it's more like someone moving the goalposts closer together and making you shoot from the same distance. </p> <p>Even in this tiny world, you still have to ask big questions. Cue cigar-chomping producer: \"Where's my emotional journey? I wanna feel something, for Chrissakes!\" Amusement is one of the quickest feelings to trigger, so most of the films in the competition are gags. It's more difficult if you want to deal with deeper emotions that take time to grow. You can laugh at a guy slipping on a banana skin, but it's hard to sympathise with his mid-life crisis if you've only known him for 15 seconds.</p> <p>What was impressive about last year's winner was how it squeezed poignancy from what, at heart, is a joke. Rob Glenny's The Final Performance shows a flashback of an escapologist being chained inside a sack, intercut with footage of the present, in which the police are dragging the sack out of the sea. His glamorous assistant is looking on, and when his corpse is cut out of the bag, she turns to the camera and half-heartedly declaims: \"Da-naaaa.\"</p> <p>The film punches above its weight partly because it suggests a bigger picture. You can imagine a version of The Final Performance minus the assistant, with one of the policemen getting the \"escape\" punchline. But it would lose the poignancy, which comes from someone who has lost a job and a friend - whose life we can imagine beyond the keyhole-sized vision of the film.</p> <p>As it happened, we ended up totally ignoring all this theory in our entry - an animation called Not Long Now. </p> <p>It's all very well knocking together a thesis, after the fact, as to why a film succeeds, but it's impossible to reverse-engineer. We tried, but ended up ramming a quart into a pint pot - the end result, a story entirely seen through the window of a moving train, looked like Agatha Christie on speed. The story went off like a bent firework, created all the wrong reactions. We started again, but to make matters worse, with just a few days to go, we found we had to stick to the train window idea, complete with passing trees to create scene changes. We had a vehicle, but no story to put in it. </p> <p>But then something happened: the old cliche about restrictions being liberating lived up to its promise. You need to get an idea up and running and sift through the mess it creates to discover its peculiar rules and internal logic. We had to put our imaginary train on the track before we could find out where it would take us.</p> <p>Enough theory: You can watch and vote for this year's shortlisted films, including Not Long Now, at <a href=\"http://www.nokiashorts.co.uk\">nokiashorts.co.uk</a>. If you have 15 seconds to spare, that is.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Pascal Wyse and Jo Berger create our weekly cartoon strip The Pitchers</p>",

  "<p>Objectively, this is a very bad tourist experience. At least at the Eiffel Tower, the other highlight of travel-brochure Paris, you get the excitement of the lift and an incredible view. Here you get one small, dark picture surrounded by a jostling crowd of hundreds. </p> <p>It is hard to see how anyone can genuinely enjoy looking at the painting in these circumstances, which probably explains why most people don't. A few seconds, a few photographs and the line moves on. The speed with which the majority of visitors deal with this tourist obligation is astonishing. And yet, unless they have anarchist tendencies, no first-time visitor to Paris would consider skipping it. </p> <p>The Mona Lisa remains the most famous painting in the world. This year the crowds lining up to see it have grown thicker than ever, with the influx of millions of new Chinese tourists into Europe. A day spent in the room where the picture hangs reveals much about the global tourist industry - illustrating which countries are doing well enough economically to allow their middle classes the chance to visit France. It casts only scant light on why people still bother to come in their thousands to pay homage to the painting. </p> <p>If you starting queuing well before the Louvre's doors open at 9am, and walk briskly through a network of long galleries that stand between the entrance hall and the first-floor room where the painting hangs, you can reach the Mona Lisa at about 9.09, before anyone else. For a short few minutes it is cool and quiet. A guard is rearranging the crowd barriers in the centre of the room with careful precision. </p> <p>Four Chinese tourists are the first visitors at 9.11. They arrive, visibly delighted, and begin to examine the picture, holding their hands up to shield their eyes against a sun which isn't there. They take a few pictures of the painting and then of each other in front of the painting. Their delight lasts for about 50 seconds, after which they hurry off. </p> <p>The rumble of dozens of approaching feet is already audible by 9.14, as dozens of people make their way rapidly down the grand gallery, rushing past Caravaggios, Bellinis, Raphaels and a few other da Vincis, guided by the Mona Lisa signposts. By 9.20 there is a group of 28 people standing in front of the painting and fathers are already having to hold their children above the crowd so that they can see. </p> <p>\"People come because she is famous. Period,\" says Pete Brown, a retired businessman from Iowa, with some irritation. \"But you want my opinion honestly? I'm not overly impressed.\" </p> <p>At 9.30 the crowd has grown to about 47. Mobile phones are used to take pictures. Children show their parents how to use the equipment. The noise of the clicking of shutters, the buzzing of zooms whirring in and out, the satisfied pips of the machinery signalling its readiness, becomes overwhelming. Some couples kiss as they walk away, happy that another part of the Paris experience has been completed. At 10.14 the mass of people is 12 rows deep; 15 minutes later there are so many people elbowing from behind that it becomes uncomfortable to stand at the curved wooden barrier by the front of the picture. </p> <p>\"She must be one of the ugliest women in the world,\" a teenager mutters. </p> <p>Waiting to see the Mona Lisa has all the thrill of standing in an airport check-in queue. The crowd pushes forward, cattle-like and unquestioning, performing a ritual they know they have to go through with in order to complete a pre-ordained tourist experience. </p> <p>By midday the room is seething with visitors, the line heaves towards the front, a slow, weary museum trudge, and around 70 more people file in every minute. Caged in a box of bullet-proof glass, the picture looks unimpressive under the harsh institutional lighting. Winking dots of red and orange reflected camera eyes dance across the canvas and every few seconds the Mona Lisa's face is obscured by another flash. </p> <p>\"I don't know why they keep coming,\" Stephane, a security guard who has worked for the Louvre for the past two years, says. \"It's a nice painting, but there are many more interesting pictures elsewhere in the museum. People don't look at it anyway. They come in, take a picture and leave. It takes 15 seconds.\" </p> <p>\"People no longer study it. It is no longer a painting, but has become a symbol of a painting,\" says Darian Leader, author of Stealing the Mona Lisa: What Art Stops Us From Seeing. Looking at the visitors from the front of the crowd, about half have their faces pressed into a camera. Those at the back arch onto tiptoes, hold their arms far above their head and take a picture, paparazzi-style. </p> <p>You have to feel sorry for Salvator Rosa, whose pictures hang to the left and the right of the Mona Lisa. No one spares a glance for the enormous Heroic Battle, 1652, to the left, with its dramatic portrayal of carnage. There must have been a time when this would have been the more obvious crowd-gatherer, but a sequence of quite random events has transformed the Mona Lisa over the past century into a celebrity painting. </p> <p>Before the 1789 revolution, scarcely anyone had access to it. Then, with the creation of the Louvre, it was for some time kept in the curator's bureau, away from the hordes, and valued much less than Leonardo's Virgin and Child with St Anne. But as the romantic poets of the 19th century began to be obsessed with the femme fatale, the Mona Lisa was seized on as an ideal of womanhood, her smile and the eyes venerated. The confusion over quite who she was increased her allure. </p> <p>Donald Sassoon, author of Becoming Mona Lisa - The History of the World's Most Famous Painting, points out that such was the profusion of religious paintings of saints, famous royals, skinny Dutch women and obese Rubens females, that there weren't that many other paintings of unknown, beautiful women to choose as the object of male fantasies. </p> <p>Then just as the painting was gaining mass recognition, it was stolen in 1911, at a time when popular newspapers were booming. The image was reproduced globally as the search began. Such was the painting's new significance, that people lined up to stare at the empty space where the picture had been hanging. The story of the theft and its rediscovery inspired dozens of books and films. Then came the lampooning of the work by Marcel Duchamp, the appropriation of the image by surrealists, pop artists, and finally by the advertising industry. </p> <p>Art historian EH Gombrich says the picture has become so worn out by all these references that it's almost impossible \"to see it with fresh eyes\". But the reality is that in the Louvre, you cannot really see the painting at all for the far more practical reason that there are too many other people in front of it. </p> <p>Some visitors are quite open about their frustration. \"The Mona Lisa is probably the single most disappointing piece of work in the entire world,\" Guy Kress, an experimental psychologist from California, says. \"The picture everyone has in their minds is much larger and brighter.\" It is true that the poster reproduction in the museum shop is a much bolder image. With this fresh in your mind, the original looks dour and gloomy. </p> <p>Moonkyou Kim, a tour guide with a group of 16 tourists from Seoul, taking a 10-day whirlwind tour of Europe with 24 hours in France, says the anti-climax is palpable. \"People aren't very happy when they see it. It's too small. They don't believe it's the original.\" But of the 51 people approached randomly over the day, the majority still say the picture is wonderful and they are thrilled to have seen it. Despite the crush and the inconvenience there is for many a reluctance to question the value of the experience. </p> <p>To doubt that the Mona Lisa is worth seeing is a bit like asking whether it's worth coming to Paris at all. The Mona Lisa is a key part of the Paris package, and one of the reasons why you come to France, why you come to Europe. For most tourists this moment will be a critical part of their memory of France as a whole. To come here and not be amazed or delighted is in some way to admit that the whole Paris experience is somehow not as great as it's cracked up to be. Most people know this is illogical, and yet they buy into it anyway. \"When you come to Paris for the first time, you have to see the cliches. You can't be too proud,\" Oded Hauptaman, an opthamologist from Melbourne says. </p> <p>Among the thousands who process past throughout the day, there are very few who pause to look hard. Takuya Sejima is an exception, stopping for over 30 minutes, holding his hand up towards his eyes at different angles, using his museum plan to help measure different sections of the painting, making notes. Next to the rushing masses, his behaviour looks eccentric, verging on the insane. An 18-year-old art student from Tokyo, he wants to assess why daVinci made the left hand so much larger than the right hand, and so out of proportion with the face. \"It's marvellous. It's difficult to express why in words,\" he says. </p> <p>Later the tourists become wearier, their legs heavier, more prone to squabbling with their partners. The number of tour groups dwindles. The number of French visitors increases. Leading away his small group of French art enthusiasts, Bruno de Baecque explains: \"People invest a lot of hope into the prospect of seeing the Mona Lisa for the first time. It becomes a quasi-sacred experience. They're ready to suffer considerable discomfort to extract some pleasure from the experience. No one can really know if they're disappointed. I tell people to try to enjoy the thrill of seeing the painting surrounded by crowds.\" </p> <p>By 9.30pm there are only about 10 people left in the room, and for the first time all day there's time to really examine the painting. But as closing time approaches, guards shoo the remaining visitors away so that only Mohamed Elabdi, the night cleaner, remains sweeping away the mound of rubbish discarded over the day at the foot of the painting. </p> <p>After 30 years in France, he saw the painting for the first time three days ago when he started this new job with the Louvre. \"It's hard to hard to understand what the fuss is about,\" he says. \"But the way that the eyes follow you around the room as you work is disconcerting.\"</p>",
  "The new Freedom of Information Act will require government funding to stop councils having to penalise residents through higher council tax, a panel of MPs will be told today. <p>Peter Chalke, Conservative vice chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA), is set to give evidence to the constitutional affairs committee on the Freedom of Information Act, which from January will enable the public to request information held by 100,000 public authorities, including councils.</p> <p>Mr Chalke will tell MPs that unless councils receive central funding, councils are unlikely to meet John Prescott's demands for single low figure council tax increases next year.</p> <p>Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs secretary, has quelled fears that the public would be charged prohibitive fees for the privilege of exercising their rights to information, by saying that the majority of information will be handled free of charge.</p> <p>Until now, the government line has been that access to information would come at a cost, with public bodies able to charge 10% of the cost of gathering the requested information.</p> <p>But in a Guardian interview published yesterday, Lord Falconer said the majority of information should be free of charge, with only rare, high-cost requests leading to a fee.</p> <p>While the news will delight citizens, councils fear they will face a financial headache, with council tax payers picking up the bill. </p> <p>Mr Chalke said he welcomed the right to access information, but would tell the scrutiny committee that unless the government funds councils to deliver their duties, the cost would end up being passed on to residents by the backdoor. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, has given assurances to councils that any further burdens imposed by government will be fully-funded, though no mention has yet been made of the funding implications of providing the information, nor who will pay for them, Mr Chalke will say.</p> <p>The LGA has estimated that the new act will cost councils \u00a313m to administer. \"You do not get something for nothing,\" Mr Chalke said.</p> <p>He plans to outline the extra staff and time that will be required to meet public requests for information, which he anticipates will be significant.</p> <p>\"There will be a large number of requests for large amounts of information which will cost a lot of money and I hope we will be able to charge for that,\" Mr Chalke said. </p> <p>\"What worries me is that the public will pay because the cost of this will go on the council tax,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, Robert Blair primary school in Islington advertised for a new head. The school has among the lowest Sats results in the borough, and high levels of deprivation; the majority of pupils have English as a second language and the school is situated in an area barren of any sense of community, positioned in a road lined with factories and warehouses.</p> <p>Against these odds, and as a tribute to the skill of the staff, the school's Ofsted report in 2002 had praised Robert Blair's \"strong ethos ... in which teachers value individuals. Pupils concentrate well and work hard.\" The new head would obviously be expected to develop the school's potential, but he or she would also have to face an even bigger challenge in trying to turn one of the most radical concepts on the education agenda into a reality - transforming a primary school into a children's centre.</p> <p>The government has committed itself to the creation of 2,500 children's centres by 2008. The interdepartmental review of childcare in 2002 found that an integrated approach \"which ensures the joining up of services and disciplines such as education, care, family support and health is a key factor in determining good outcomes for children\".</p> <p>No single blueprint exists but, whatever the circumstances, for teachers, children's centres will mean a radically transformed working day: more flexibility and potential concerns about the demarcation of professional territory.</p> <p>So how is Mark Miller, the new head of Robert Blair, meeting the many and various challenges? Robert Blair has a couple of advantages over some schools. First, it has extra space. Built in the 1880s, it originally housed a secondary school on the upper two floors, long since closed.</p> <p>The second advantage lies in Miller's own background. Nursery education, he says, has always been a passion. A headteacher by the age of 31 - he is now 45 - he later worked for three years as head of early years and childcare in the borough of Bromley. \"It was that job that woke me up to the possibilities of what a school might be in the 21st century,\" he explains. \"The 9am to 3.30pm deal is a thing of the past in terms of education. Of course, it's still our core purpose, but particularly with our children and parents, the time has come to look at education as far wider than just what happens in the classroom.\"</p> <p>Miller sits in his office with the architectural plans that, by next September, with luck, will have transformed the school. The ground floor will be completely remodelled to offer integrated care for nine babies, 12 toddlers, 52 nursery children and 45 reception pupils. In addition, there will be wrap-around care from breakfast to 6pm for 21 of the under-fives. Rooms will also be allocated for the use of other health and social care professionals and support groups for parents.</p> <p>Miller, who believes in \"collective leadership\", is working with a team of four of his senior staff, all of whom are enthusiastic about the change. The total budget, including children's centre funding, is \u00a31.2m over three years, and the entire school, badly in need of refurbishment, will benefit. Classrooms will be enlarged and the playground landscaped.</p> <p>Inevitably, however, there is an impact on staff and they do have concerns. Miller says, for instance, that he is keen to end the long-hours culture. So, from September, teaching staff will have half a day a week to prepare, \"giving them back their weekends\". \"But then,\" he adds, \"if we're talking about school days lasting from eight until six, that is bound to have an effect.\"</p> <p>What he wants to avoid, he says, is jerky handovers from wrap-around care to the school day. A shift system, he hopes, will make for a more seamless day for children. Are his staff concerned about acting as unpaid social workers? \"They are unpaid social workers already,\" he laughs. \"One of the strengths of the school is the relationship it has with parents. As a children's centre, the advantage is that there will be much more back-up support on hand.\"</p> <p>Islington intends to have 16 children's centres in each of its most socially deprived wards. Miller says he has had strong strategic support from Islington's early years and childcare team and his board of governors, two of whom have early years back grounds. Over the next few months, none the less, he has a number of delicate dilemmas to resolve, including new staffing structures, work patterns, continued consultation with parents and the crucial issue of sustainability.</p> <p>Within three years, the childcare aspect of the children's centre is supposed to be self-funding. \"Heads are entrepreneurial, but sustainability is going to be much more of a long-term headache than raising a few thousand pounds for a new school pond,\" he says.</p> <p>He hopes that, in addition to affordable places for local parents, large businesses may buy a proportion of childcare places, and the regeneration of King's Cross may bring other new parents who are able to pay the market price. Some childcare places will be reserved for key workers and his own staff. His deputy head, Clare Loftus, pregnant with her first child, hopes to bring her baby in September.</p> <p>On the issue of who is in charge, Miller is unequivocal. He is. He will head a unified children's centre in which other health and social professionals will be an integral part. In that way, he says, the new organisation will have clear leadership and a strong opportunity to develop its own philosophy.</p> <p>\"This is a truly revolutionary opportunity. We have done a lot of work to encourage parents to understand far better how their children develop and learn,\" he says. \"We have more chance of doing that the longer and earlier we have children in our care. A children's centre is all part of that.\"</p> <p>Does he have concerns about children institutionalised from babyhood into a school system? \"I do,\" he replies. \"But it's about parental choice. In areas such as this one, the opportunity to have good-quality care for your children also means the chance to train and to work and to move out of poverty. That also may be tremendously important for a child's future.\"</p>",
  "<p>London emerged in the autumn sunlight yesterday as one of the leafiest of Europe's capitals, blessed with low levels of recorded crime and short of little apart from doctors and citizens willing to turn out to vote. </p> <p>The city is rich in culture and, contrary to reputation, has more hours of sunshine than Paris or Berlin, says a survey yesterday by Eurostat, the EU's official number-crunching arm, based in Luxembourg. </p> <p>It confirmed London's status as Europe's only contender in the international league of capitals large enough to be classed as world cities to rival New York and Tokyo. </p> <p>Its 7.2 million population is larger than Berlin (3.4 million) and Madrid (3 million) put together and falls only just short of the combined citizenry of Rome, Paris, Vienna and Brussels. </p> <p>There are drawbacks to the city's size. London commuters have the longest journey to work, averaging 43 minutes each way, compared with about half an hour in Madrid, Berlin and Stockholm, and just 17 minutes in Luxembourg. </p> <p>There is still much inadequate housing, with 8.5% of London's homes lacking basic amenities - not as bad as Copenhagen and Paris, but a lot worse than Luxembourg, Dublin and Madrid, where less than 1% are similarly substandard. </p> <p>The figures for 2001 were the most recent available to Eurostat, which tries hard to produce comparable data from across the EU. </p> <p>It made no comment on the results. Having suffered the embarrassment of deleting Wales from the map of Europe earlier this month, its officials knew any assessment of the overall quality of life in member state capitals would put them on a hiding to nul points. </p> <p>They left the statistics to tell their own story and, for London, it was frequently positive. </p> <p>Its 6.5% unemployment rate compared favourably with 14.9% in Berlin, 12.4% in Madrid and 11.7% in Paris, but was nonetheless double the rate in Stockholm and Luxembourg. </p> <p>Recorded crime was low. In spite of a bad reputation within Britain, Londoners reported 61.9 crimes per 1,000 population, compared with 204.4 in Stockholm, 168.9 in Berlin and 146.7 in Paris. Among 12 EU capitals answering this question, only Madrid and Vienna reported less crime. Eurostat did not investigate whether the reported figures were an accurate reflection of actual crime levels. </p> <p>It found London the second worst city for car theft, with 8.7 such crimes per 1,000 population in 2001, behind Copenhagen with 9.2. In law-abiding Vienna there were 0.7. </p> <p>London was second-equal for murders and violent deaths, with three per 100,000 residents, compared with two in Paris, Berlin and Madrid, and one in Rome. Brussels came highest with 10. </p> <p>But the Italian capital spoiled its record on road safety, where it had 8.4 deaths or serious injuries per 1,000 population, compared with less than one in London, Berlin and Paris. </p> <p>London has 4.7 hours of sunshine on the average day, compared with 4.4 in Paris and 4.1 in Berlin. Not surprisingly, they are all put in the shade by Athens with 7.6 hours. London has 163 days of rain a year, compared with 246 in Dublin and 199 in Brussels. </p> <p>Unfortunately France did not return its capital's rainfall figure or its acreage of parkland. London, with nearly a third of its area given over to green space, came third on this measure. </p> <p>For men and women under 65, London had the lowest rate of death from heart and respiratory disease. This may have had little to do with the availability of GPs. London had 0.6 doctors per 1,000 population, compared with more than two in every other EU capital and as many as 11.3 in Lisbon. </p> <p>Also in short supply were voters. Londoners were less likely to vote than the citizens of every other EU capital, scoring 33.6% in local elections and 55.2% in national parliamentary elections. This compared with more than 80% in civic-minded Brussels. </p> <p>London was well stocked with theatres, with 135, twice as many as Madrid and Berlin, but behind Rome and Athens. </p> <p>Eurostat's figures could not tell the whole story. It made more than 250 comparisons, but few had information from all 15 countries that were member states in 2001. For example, London could not provide statistics on the proportion of under-fives in day care or the volume of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions - a sign that there may have been less concern about these topics among policymakers in Britain.</p>",
  "No one could have accused the Conservative government of breaking its promise to bring back Victorian values. When, in 1992, it permitted private water companies to install pre-paid meters in Birmingham, the people who couldn't afford to flush their toilets started defecating into pots, which they then emptied out of the windows of their tower blocks. It made one quite nostalgic. <p>The meters were ruled illegal in 1998, on the grounds that they deprived the poor of their most important resource. So it goes without saying that the model has now been exported to two of the world's poorest urban communities. </p> <p>Some African countries are so short of money that delivering clean water to everyone is almost impossible. But not South Africa. In purchasing power terms, it is the world's 21st biggest economy. It is also one of the most unequal. It could afford to provide everyone with sufficient water, as long as it was prepared to sting the rich and subsidise the poor. But that is a \"non-market policy\", and therefore out of bounds. </p> <p>The problem for any government which attempts to run its services on free-market principles is that some people cannot afford to pay. This means that you must send men to their homes to cut them off. In South Africa, where people are aware of their rights, that means confrontations and riots. So Johannesburg city council, which has set up a public-private partnership with the British firm Northumbrian Water and its French parent Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, has devised an easier way to do it: rather than disconnect people, you force them to disconnect themselves. Over the past year, the council has been installing pre-paid water meters in the two poorest districts of Johannesburg: Orange Farm and Phiri. It has chosen them for the obvious reason that they contain the largest proportion of people who can't pay. </p> <p>It does so in full knowledge of the consequences. Pre-paid meters were first installed in Madlebe, in KwaZulu Natal, in 2000. Those who had no money had to draw their water from the rivers. The inevitable outbreak of cholera infected over 100,000 people, and killed 260. The meter scheme was dropped. </p> <p>Today, a full-scale insurrection is brewing in Phiri. Last week the residents blockaded the main road through Soweto. They have been ripping up the pipes and fighting with the workmen. The old anti-apartheid activists have now turned on the ANC. </p> <p>To understand what is happening in South Africa, you must first understand the role of its biggest foreign investor, the United Kingdom. So let me take you back to the days of Victorian values, and the visit to South Africa in 1996 of the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke. Trade missions are normally led by junior trade ministers. But South Africa had a new government, which wanted to invest heavily, but whose leaders had no experience of running a country. It was rich, naive and ready to be led by the nose. </p> <p>\"Privatisation has been at the very heart of our public-sector reforms in Britain,\" Clarke explained before he went. \"Can what we have done here in the UK be exported to South Africa? I would argue definitely yes ... British business can help. They have an unrivalled wealth of experience in privatisation, private finance and all types of public sector reform ... The real beneficiaries of reform will not be the politicians or company shareholders but the ordinary people. ... In this way, Britain can share in the bright future that beckons for South Africa.\" </p> <p>South Africa is too big simply to be told what to do. Foreign governments can't just march in there with instructions as they do in Zambia or Mozambique. But since apartheid fell, the World Bank, the IMF, the UK and the US have been flooding the country with advisers and consultants. In 1996 the policy paid off when the government devised something called the Growth, Employment and Redistribution Strategy. It's widely seen as a self-imposed structural adjustment programme: it does everything the powerful countries wanted, while creating the impression that it was all South Africa's idea. And at the heart of it is the notion that \"market disciplines\" will help the poor to escape from poverty. </p> <p>The corporations loved it. KPMG told its clients that if they went to South Africa, they would \"find a major business opportunity about to burst forth in a country where there is a lot of goodwill towards UK\". The International Project Finance Association reported that UK businesses \"now have the opportunity to export their public-private partnership know-how and expertise ... We are world leaders within this field and must now capitalise on the various opportunities that exist abroad.\" </p> <p>The Labour government took South African civil servants on a tour of privately financed British hospitals, and took the private financiers on a tour of South Africa. The South African government, unaware that Britain's private finance initiative rests upon nine separate kinds of public fraud and false accounting, began commissioning its new hospitals and prisons by the same means and from the same British companies. Now, suckered again by a new round of trade fairs and ministerial visits, it has begun to permit foreign companies to move in on its essential public services. Making a bed for them requires \"cost recovery\" and \"marketisation\", which is why pre-paid meters are now being imposed upon the people of Phiri and Orange Farm. </p> <p>The agency keeping the South African government on track is Britain's Department for International Development (DfID). This year it is giving \u00a36.3m to the Adam Smith Institute - the ultra-rightwing privatisation lobby group - for \"public-sector reform\" in South Africa. Staggeringly, the institute has been given its own budget - \u00a35m of British aid money - to disburse as it pleases. By this means, DfID can generate all the support it likes for privatisation and public-private partnerships, while avoiding direct responsibility for the decisions the institute makes. </p> <p>DfID is plainly breaking the law. The International Development Act forbids it from spending money for any purpose other than the elimination of poverty. It might also have broken the rules forbidding it to link aid money to deals for specific British businesses. DfID funds or has recently funded (it has so far been unable to tell me whether or not the scheme is still current) something called the \"British investment in South Africa promotion scheme\", which promotes \"business-to-business links\" between companies in the UK and companies in South Africa. What this is doing inside a foreign aid department, no one can say. </p> <p>I am not suggesting that DfID has told Johannesburg council \"thou shalt strike a public-private partnership with a British company, and make sure that it is profitable for that company by forcing everyone to pay the full price for their water, regardless of their ability to do so\". I am suggesting that it is creating a policy environment which encourages that outcome. And it is doing so with money allocated for something called foreign aid. Is there anyone out there who thinks this is how it should be spent? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Far from the sickly-sweet smell of his home in India's northern sugar belt, sapper Arif Mohammed trudged through the snow of the Siachen Glacier, just a few months after the world had come close to a nuclear exchange on the world's highest battlefield. </p> <p>It was September 1999 and Arif, a soldier in the Indian army's 108 Engineering Regiment, had not seen much action when Indian and Pakistani troops had fought over the ice-tipped peaks and frozen wastes of the Himalayas that summer. Just married to his teenage bride, Gudiya, Arif's thoughts were of love, not war. But for the next five years, Arif would not see his wife or his village, or even the craggy ranges of Kashmir that he once patrolled. </p> <p>Inadvertently straying over the border into Pakistan, Arif was captured and held in prison for half a decade. What happened when he returned last month, to find his wife not only eight months' pregnant but married to another man, has gripped India and cast a harsh light on hitherto private affairs. </p> <p>Filling television screens and newspaper columns, the travails of the Mohammed family have been picked over and consumed by an Indian public rarely exposed to the intimacies of married life, let alone those of a poor, conservative Muslim couple. </p> <p>After Arif was detained that September, and while he stared at the bare brick walls of his small, windowless cell in Pakistan, his 16-year-old bride was pining for her missing husband. But as days became weeks and weeks became months, the thought of becoming a \"half-widow\" gnawed away at Gudiya. She began to spend more time with her mother and father. </p> <p>\"There was a decision in my family that Arif was gone,\" she says. \"I could not go on alone, so it was decided that I should remarry. I still loved Arif and remembered him and thought about him. I waited for four years.\" </p> <p>Soon Gudiya met a another man, Taufiq. \"Taufiq cared for me and I began to be slowly involved with him. I had to go on with my life and that meant slowly trying to forget Arif. You cannot have two husbands. Life is not a game.\" </p> <p>Gudiya decided to annul the marriage. This should have been a mere formality since sharia law, which has governed the life of Muslims in India since the days of the British Raj, allows for the dissolution of a union after four years. But rather than taking the case to the sharia courts, Gudiya and Arif's marriage was declared over by a village priest. This was her first mistake. While the local imam has authority over many areas, his writ does not run to dissolving the union between man and wife. </p> <p>Unbeknown to Arif, his difficulties were multiplying. Not only had his family given up on him and his wife left him for another man, but his country had abandoned him; the Indian army formally declared him a \"deserter\". </p> <p>\"I spent my days and nights thinking of going home to see my family and my wife, that is what kept me alive,\" says Arif, sitting in the courtyard of his home in the village of Mundali, 120km from Delhi. </p> <p>Arif says that he only found out about his wife's new life from his sister-in-law when he first returned across the border last month, the event captured on camera, just as the past month of his life has been. Dressed in a light blue sherwani, the traditional dress of Pakistan's Punjab province, and surrounded by the khaki uniforms of Indian officers, Arif waved, smiled and then broke down sobbing in the arms of his brother, Abdul Hamid, and sister-in-law, Sanjida. \"I was happy to be back in my country. I was alive again,\" says Arif. Soon, however, the mood changed. Gudiya was not there. Hope became dread in Arif's mind. </p> <p>\"I was worried then because I had not been able to see or speak to Gudiya. I then found out she was with a child. It was hard, yes.\" </p> <p>Arif could not come home immediately. He had to be debriefed by the Indian army, which makes the 29-year-old very cautious when talking about his \"stay\" in Pakistan. In the celebration and confusion of his eventual homecoming, the question over what to do about his marriage lay unanswered. </p> <p>There were lengthy discussions between the three families involved. Religious leaders were called in and a village council hastily convened. </p> <p>A two-hour meeting between Arif and Gudiya - the first time that they had been alone together since his return home - convinced Arif they could be happy together. \"I asked her if she loved me still. She said she could and I knew then that we could make this marriage again,\" he says. \"Gudiya had waited for four years but there was pressure from family and village to remarry.\" </p> <p>The problem was that while Arif wanted his wife back, he did not want to raise the child she is expecting. \"Gudiya told me that if I did not accept the child, she would not come back to me.\" </p> <p>To make matters worse, Taufiq, the second husband, also said that he did not want to give up his new family. </p> <p>Caught between two lifes and two loves, a heavily pregnant Gudiya at first said that she wanted to be with her second husband, then said she would go back to her first spouse, only to recant both statements. </p> <p>Because the first marriage had not been annulled, the issue still had to be decided under sharia law by Islamic judges, or ulema . Usually, this would be considered an intensely private affair, but instead it became public property, thanks to the country's burgeoning rolling news networks. </p> <p>One in particular, Zee News, took great interest in the story and created a show the like of which had never been seen on Indian television before. Gudiya, her two husbands and the village elders were persuaded to appear in a studio in the presence of Islamic scholars, to make a decision on which husband to stay with and what to do with the child. </p> <p>The programme was an immediate sensation. With questions flashing up on the screen, such as \"Whose Gudiya?\" and \"What kind of relationship?\", viewers were encouraged to ring in with questions for the guests. While this treatment may be a mainstay of British day-time television, India's billion plus population has rarely been exposed to the kind of voyeuristic thrills that shows such as Jerry Springer or Oprah have brought to the west. </p> <p>The programme lasted seven hours and moved from drama to farce. Burning with fever, Gudiya spoke from beneath the folds of an orange duppatta to say that she was not \"above the sharia\" and that she would abide by whatever decision was arrived at. </p> <p>The mock village council, or panchayat , decided that Gudiya would return to Arif and that the child would be raised in his house for a few years. The decision, which was attributed to Gudiya but was heavily influenced by the priesthood, was unsurprisingly popular with community leaders. </p> <p>A bearded Islamic scholar, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, broke down in tears at the end of the programme saying that he, \"had not thought how important a role television can play for society\". </p> <p>Taufiq, having lost both a wife and his child, looked dumbstruck and since the programme has disappeared from public view. His father rushed out of the studio and demanded half a million rupees (\u00a36,000) in compensation. </p> <p>Arif and Gudiya, meanwhile, have gone back to his home in Mundali. While they appear reconciled, there are still issues over what will happen to the new addition to their family. Although he beams for photographs, Arif still says that the child his wife is expecting is his erstwhile rival's. He looks blank when questioned about what happens after the child is born, saying that, \"If Gudiya wants to keep the kid herself then I have no problem. The ulema said it is Taufiq's child. So it is right for it to go back to him.\" </p> <p>Sitting in a cool, dark room, Gudiya shifts uncomfortably under the weight of her belly. The 21-year-old speaks slowly and without much feeling. \"I do not know what the fate of the baby will be. Please do not ask me about its future. Who knows if it will live?\" It is hardly a vote of confidence in the new baby's future. </p> <p>When asked about such dire musings, Arif says that his wife is ill and that he will look after her. After all, he points out, he has five years' pay to collect. He has plans to build a \"double-storey home\" in the village. \"There is a lot I want to do. I want to go back to my unit and serve my country. But I will be taking my wife with me this time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Studies on monkeys designed to test whether the combination of vaccine jabs and tablets to protect troops against nerve agents might have contributed to illness among veterans of the first Gulf war have failed to establish any link, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>Results from the government-funded experiments on marmosets at Porton Down, Wiltshire, have yet to be published in peer-reviewed scientific literature, but a scientist overseeing the project, David Ray of Nottingham University, said yesterday: \"Results do not indicate any clear interaction.\" </p> <p>The hypothesis that the combination of injections might have worked with the active ingredient in so-called Naps tablets has been regarded by some scientists in Britain as more plausible than the idea that veterans have fallen ill through exposure to neurotoxins from a single source - whether in pesticides, insect repellent, Naps tablets, or fall-out from bombing raids. </p> <p>Leaks from a US report, reviewing research on Gulf war illnesses, suggested a probable link between exposure to neurotoxins and the development of illnesses in veterans. However it is understood they think other factors need further research. </p> <p>Professor Ray, a neuroscientist and a member of the independent panel that oversaw the Porton Down tests, made clear at a briefing organised by the Science Media Centre in London yesterday that he did not believe the proof was there. </p> <p>\"People who did the study looked at general health, muscular function; they looked at sleep patterns [and] visual ability. They looked at reasoning ability that is surprisingly good in marmosets. What we learn in 20 minutes might take a marmoset a month or two to learn, but they do learn very sophisticated 11-plus style tests. </p> <p>\"The most important thing ... in my mind, was that they looked at motivation of mar mosets to learn these tasks. There were no interactive or single-agent effects that appeared to justify the hypothesis that there was an interaction between pyridostigmine bromide [the active ingredient in Naps tablets] and the vaccines. </p> <p>\"I think this was as good an animal test as could be done.\" </p> <p>The experiments were done by the defence, science and technology laboratory, part of the Ministry of Defence, and the results will be regarded as a severe setback for those seeking an identifiable cause for illnesses. </p> <p>Lord Morris of Manchester, who has been seeking government statements on results from Porton Down, said: \"I am surprised, when parliament has waited so long for the outcome of this work, the purported results are being discussed at a media briefing.\" </p> <p>He also said the research had not replicated the conditions in which troops had been given the vaccines and tablets. </p> <p>Scientists at the briefing made clear that they had not ruled out all possible connections between different elements of troops' experience in the Gulf war of 1991. However it could prove excessively expensive and time-consuming to replicate them, especially stress from being at war. </p> <p>Troops who received their vaccines in the Gulf rather than before they were deployed have reported higher levels of illness. </p> <p>Simon Wessely, director of the Gulf war research unit at King's College London, is among those that believe that stress was a contributory factor. He believes a \"smoking gun\" may never be found, but hoped the leaks of the US report were inaccurate in suggesting stress did not remain an important factor. </p> <p>Thinking war did not produce psychiatric casualties was, he said, \"flying in the face of reason\". He said very recent US research had not found a connection between failure of neurological function and exposure to pesticides or the nerve agent sarin.</p>",
  "<p>This English jazz and contemporary classical pianist composes and teaches quietly in the west country and raises his profile rarely. Yet Alfred Brendel has called him \"an interesting and highly gifted maverick musician, and Law has deserved to have much wider public appreciation for years. </p> <p>Law has been touring with a new ensemble, Cornucopia - a mix of a jazz quartet featuring Andy Sheppard on saxophones, and a group of contemporary classical players from the London Sinfonietta under violinist Rita Manning. At the Purcell Room, Law devoted the first half to a thickly wrought single composition (Out of the Darkness) and the second to a variety of shorter, jazzier pieces that often packed an unexpectedly funky punch. Whether he had his tongue in his cheek in naming the second section Light Music (the BBC's former put-down for anything that wasn't classical) is hard to tell - but in announcing that the second half wouldn't have \"the same unremittingly lugubrious intensity\", it's likely. </p> <p>But Out of the Darkness was an ambitious piece combining rich and slowly transforming (sometimes rather Mike Gibbs-like) harmonic movements, sudden clustered ensemble sprints, and systems-music overlays of phrasing deploying bassoon, brass and strings lines against the jazz instruments. </p> <p>Fiendish drum parts never fazed Paul Clarvis, and bursts of hurtling swing travelled on Chris Laurence's bass lines, with Sheppard's flexible sax figures skidding over the top. Law's piano improvisations were often astonishing in their boldness and technical ambition, the more so for being jazz-rooted without mimicking the usual Jarrett, Tyner or Hancock licks. </p> <p>Law could perhaps have edited his second half a little, but he could find his winding, contrapuntal funky licks in The Loop being hoovered up by samplists, and a wispy Sheppard blues was delicious. </p> <p>A rich and completely distinctive contemporary music programme. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>At Poole Centre for the Arts on October 28.

  "More than 20 years ago, a journalist called Oscar Reyes and his wife Gloria, an interior designer, were taken from their home in Tegucigalpa, Honduras by members of the country's armed forces as part of an operation against suspected \"subversives.\" <p>Over the following days, Oscar was suspended by handcuffs from a pulley and beaten while Gloria had electric shocks applied to her breasts and genitals before being beaten unconscious with rifle butts. </p> <p>Now the man in charge of the country's intelligence service at the time has been tracked down to Florida and faces a civil action in the American courts brought by the Reyes and relatives of other detainees who did not survive to tell the tale. </p> <p>The case is the latest in a series showing that military and intelligence chiefs whose forces were responsible for extra-judicial killings and torture can no longer escape trial by fleeing the country where the atrocities took place. </p> <p>The case is due to be heard in a court in Miami, and involves the former Honduran military intelligence chief, Colonel Juan L\u00f3pez Grijalba. </p> <p>Six people, five of them now resident in the US, allege that Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba was responsible for the torture, disappearance and killing of Honduran civilians during the 1980s. </p> <p>More than 150 people died during that period. Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba was the head of the secret police force called DNI, and Battalion 3/16, a death squad operating at the time of the incidents. </p> <p>Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba, who denies the charges, moved to the Miami area from Honduras in 1998, and is being held in a detention centre by immigration authorities. He had been found to be teaching at the School of the Americas, the military training academy in Georgia that has been accused of training Latin-American soldiers in violent interrogation techniques. He has said, through his lawyer, that he was unaware of the acts committed by his subordinates. </p> <p>As well as Oscar Reyes - who is now the director of a Spanish-language newspaper in Washington, DC - those bringing the actions include Zenaida and Hector Ricardo Vel\u00e1squez, the sister and son of Manfredo Vel\u00e1squez, a university leader abducted and \"disappeared\" by intelligence agents in 1981. Relatives of Hans Madisson, a student who was abducted and murdered at the same time, are also among the plaintiffs. </p> <p>Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba has ended up in court largely through the efforts of the Centre for Justice and Accountability (CJA), a San Francisco-based human rights organisation. The group pursues alleged perpetrators of human rights abuses who have become residents of the US. \"We were alerted to his presence in the US so we went about putting a case against him,\" said Matt Eisenbrandt of CJA. </p> <p>The organisation works with pro bono lawyers and organisations representing the 500,000 political refugees estimated to be in the US. Last month, a CJA case in California resulted in a judge ordering a resident of the city of Modesto to pay $10m (\u00a35.5m) in damages in connection with the assassination of the Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero. </p> <p>While damages are being sought in the present case, the issue of money is not paramount. \"For both the CJA and our clients the most important thing is justice, getting the case into court, not the money,\" Mr Eisenbrandt said. \"At the same time we don't view it as simply symbolic. We think it is important to pursue assets to send a message. Depriving the defendant of assets could be very important.\" </p> <p>The case against Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba alleges that he was under a duty to investigate and prevent violations of international law carried out by members of the military and security forces under his command. \"The penalty we hope to achieve with this lawsuit cannot compare to what the perpetrators did to our loved ones,\" said Zenaida Velasquez, whose brother was last seen being taken for interrogation by members of Battalion 3/16. </p> <p>Success in court, she said, would be a \"moral victory ... We are motivated by love for the ones we lost, and also by a voice of conscience that says we must do everything in our power to stop the cycle of impunity that leads to more human rights abuses.\" </p> <p>Legislation introduced into the US in 1996 gave victims of torture the right for the first time to bring such actions in the American courts. </p> <p>The CJA has been largely successful, but it has not won all its cases. In one action brought against the former Salvadoran ministers of defence Guillermo Garcia and Carlos Vides Casanova, by the families of four US churchwomen who were murdered in El Salvador in 1980, the generals convinced the jury that they did not have \"effective control\" over the subordinates who committed the murders.</p>",
  "Two child refugees, who escaped from an Australian detention centre and were refused the protection of the British government, had their appeal dismissed by the court of appeal yesterday. It ruled the Foreign Office was not in breach of the Convention of Human Rights. <p>Brothers Alamdar and Muntazar Bakhtiari, aged 15 and 14, escaped from the Woomera detention centre on June 29, 2002. </p> <p>They arrived at the British consulate in Melbourne on July 18, and requested asylum. </p> <p>They were initially given protection, but hours later - on the direction of the foreign secretary, Jack Straw - they were handed back to Australian authorities. </p> <p>The unprecedented legal action brought by the brothers, hoped to prove that Mr Straw had defied the Human Rights Act by sending them back. </p> <p>However, counsel for Mr Straw had rejected the claim arguing the British consulate was not a part of the United Kingdom territory and was therefore not subject to British law. </p> <p>Lord Phillips, Lord Justice Chadwick and Lord Slynn said they found the perceived threat to the children was not severe enough that the British officials in Melbourne could have refused to return them to Australian authorities without violating international law.</p>",

  "<p>Colleges are outraged at an apparent attempt by the government to exclude them from the consultation on plans to make it easier for schools to set up sixth forms.</p> <p>An extensive \"list of consultees\" invited by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) to submit views on the school expansion proposals does not include any representing further education.</p> <p>There are 37 organisations on the list, ranging from the Board of Deputies of British Jews to the British Humanist Association and the Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Notable omissions are the Association of Colleges (AoC); the Association of College Management, the trade union for college principals; the Learning and Skills Development Agency, the FE thinktank; and the Sixth Form Colleges' Forum.</p> <p>The AoC has written to the department urgently seeking the omission be put right and for the sector to be included in the consultation, which ends on December 31.</p> <p>\"We should have been consulted,\" says John Brennan, the AoC's chief executive. \"We've made it very clear that these proposals affect patterns of provision. To open up a new sixth form is certainly going to have an impact on the range of choices available and on the existing institutions.\"</p> <p>A DfES spokesman said: \"The consultation has been widely promulgated and is freely available on <a href=\"http://www.dfes.gov.uk/schoolorg\">www.dfes.gov.uk/schoolorg</a> from where we hope to be receiving responses from all interested parties.\"</p> <p>The AoC is also anxious to discuss with ministers, now that the Tomlinson working group has published its report on reforming the 14-19 curriculum, the possibility of some 14-year-olds leaving school and going to college full-time. Currently, young people cannot enrol for full-time college courses until they have reached the post-compulsory education age of 16.</p> <p>The AoC welcomes the Tomlinson proposals, which are understood to have won the initial approval of Conservative and Liberal Democrat education spokesmen, although they are expected to rouse opposition on the Tory backbenches.</p> <p>\"We would say that, in determining how we are going to implement Tomlinson, we need to be open-minded and we need to explore radical thoughts,\" Brennan says. For 14-year-olds who want to take a predominantly vocational option, if the Tomlinson diploma system is adopted, schools may find it difficult to \"deliver the totality of the offer to them\".</p> <p>\"You have to ask: what's the best way of doing this? Some of it may be possible through school/college partnerships, and these already happen in some areas. In some instances, it might make sense for a 14-year-old to embark upon a full-time course at college.\"</p> <p>A lot of questions needed to be answered first, and the law would have to be changed. \"There is a whole range of operational issues that needs to be looked at if this is to be a viable option,\" says Brennan. \"There are questions about pastoral care and support, and about whether FE lecturers are qualified to teach this age group.\"</p> <p>The proposals to ease the way for specialist schools to acquire sixth forms if they do not already have them were a surprise inclusion in the government's five-year education strategy, published in July.</p> <p>The initiative is known to have come from the prime minister's education adviser Andrew Adonis, who is reported to have later admitted privately that he didn't realise it could cause serious damage to sixth form colleges of acknowledged quality.</p> <p>The DfES consultation document confirms that government plans to allow \"popular and successful schools ... to add sixth forms\". To make this easier the government intends to introduce a fast-track process to speed up expansion proposals to take less than 12 weeks. This will \"strengthen the presumption in favour of agreeing proposals for sixth forms in areas where there is not a good enough choice of successful sixth form provision\".</p> <p>In addition, all secondary schools proposing the addition of a sixth form would have the right to appeal to the adjudicator if their plans were turned down by the local school organisation committee.</p> <p>\"The FE sector should have the opportunity to be consulted - we certainly should be recognised as consultees,\" Brennan says.</p>",
  "<p>After months of speculation, the government last Friday finally named Professor Sir Martin Harris as the director of the Office for Fair Access (Offa). It is an appointment calculated to keep the universities on side. Harris is not some heavyweight civil servant or tough-talking businessman; he's one of them. A former vice-chancellor of both Manchester and Essex universities, he has been chairman and vice-chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.</p> <p>In making the appointment, Charles Clarke, the education secretary, said: \"The director of fair access may be an essential position, but I know universities are as passionate about widening participation as I am. That is why I expect there to be a healthy relationship between institutions and the director. I would consider it to be a success if the director never had to rely on his sanctioning powers during his term in office.\"</p> <p>Harris had no disagreement. \"I fully share the secretary of state's view that there should be a continuing drive to widen participation,\" he said. \"Whilst one of my key aims in this new post will be to implement a process for setting up access agreements to safeguard fair access, I hope as director to do this by working as collaboratively as possible with institutions and in doing so I will respect the secretary of state's wish not to add to their bureaucratic burden. My past experience working in the sector has led me to understand and respect institutional autonomy and it is on this basis that I look forward to working with the sector.\"</p> <p>However much both men might want to talk up Offa's importance, no one can pretend it has anything like the clout that was first envisaged. Offa started life as reassurance to the Labour rebels planning to vote against the government's higher education bill to introduce top-up fees. This was to be the guarantee that the top-rate \u00a33,000 fees would not deter students from the poorest backgrounds, by creating a watchdog to ensure universities were on-message with the widening participation agenda by signing up to a fair access plan.</p> <p>The universities - especially the Russell group - were not best pleased at any suggestions of interference with their admissions procedure, but largely chose to hold their fire to ensure that their main concern, top-up fees, survived the Commons unscathed. It turned out to be a tactically astute move. By the time the bill had been through the Lords, Offa's remit had been seriously curtailed.</p> <p>It was always likely to be thus. As one vice-chancellor said privately, \"Just look how many university chancellors are members of the Lords. They were never going to allow Offa to be too powerful.\" So it proved.</p> <p>\"It was clear by the time the bill came back to the Commons that Offa didn't amount to very much,\" says Anne Campbell, MP for Cambridge and one of the Labour rebels on fees. Campbell, and others, tried to beef up Offa by adding some claws and clauses at a late stage, but the final changes were not likely to cause the universities to lose much sleep.</p> <p>No one can say precisely how much difference the promise of a strong watchdog made to the eventual outcome of the higher education bill. As Campbell points out: \"MPs had lots of different reasons for either supporting or voting against the bill.\" But with a majority of just five at the second reading - and with significant numbers of MPs changing their mind in the last week and choosing to support the government - it's not unreasonable to suppose that Offa could have been decisive.</p> <p>\"In a sense, the Labour backbench rebels have been let down,\" says Ian Gibson, MP for Norwich North and another of the most outspoken Labour opponents of top-up fees. \"They won't make a fuss about it, though. Some were always unwilling rebels and, in any case, the nature of politics is always to move on. They're now focused on other issues, not least the next election.</p> <p>\"But the fact remains that throughout the passage of the bill, the universities have played a cagey game. And now they're back where they were at the beginning of the process: running the show.\"</p> <p>Offa was left with no control over admissions. Its powers were restricted to the control of bursaries, by preventing universities from charging the full rate of \u00a33,000 and imposing penalties of up to \u00a3500,000, if universities are not thought to be doing enough to attract poorer students through grants. However, these limited powers seemed to be undermined further last week when the new higher education minister, Kim Howells, spoke at a Universities UK conference on fair admissions.</p> <p>\"Access agreements will set out what universities plan to do to attract more applications from students from under-represented groups,\" Howells said. \"They will also set out what the university's access ambitions are, but universities will choose their own milestones. It will be up to universities themselves to decide where they want to get and by which measure. They could use the benchmarks as a measure if they want to, or they can create their own.</p> <p>\"Whatever they choose, they will not automatically be penalised by Offa for failing to reach their milestones. As long as Offa is satisfied that the milestones are stretching and ambitious, and that the university has done all it can to meet them, they will be allowed to increase fees.\"</p> <p>His conciliatory tone might owe something to the heated debate over \"benchmarks\", after the recent publication of figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), which named and shamed many of the top universities for their poor performance in recruiting students from the state sector.</p> <p>This sparked a warning shot from Michael Beloff, president of Trinity College, Oxford, that focusing on improving access through targets pointed towards a devaluation of university degrees and that if the government didn't \"take its tanks off Oxford's lawns\", the university might be forced to go private. This was followed last week with further threats of privatisation from Chris Patten, Oxford's chancellor.</p> <p>No one in academia is taking Oxford's threat remotely seriously - the university gets \u00a3150m a year of public money - and the Department for Education and Skills would regard any such action as a disaster. So Howells was again at his reassuring best.</p> <p>\"There is the myth that there are some quotas that dictate how many students from lower incomes every university must accept,\" he said. \"This myth has once again reared its ugly head because of the recent publication of the Hesa performance indicators.</p> <p>\"The performance indicators do not represent quotas. They are benchmarks, a snapshot, a barometer measuring where universities are in terms of access and where they could be were all things completely equal. They get published once a year and it is up to universities to decide how to use the indicators. But the government does not force any university to meet them and does not have any other form of access quota or target.\"</p> <p>There was even better news for universities in the question session that followed. Much of the steam rising from this year's performance indicators stemmed from the change in the statistical framework that had widened the gap between the benchmarks and actual state student intake for the top universities. Howells argued he was not wedded to the new system.</p> <p>\"I am looking at the way in which these results are gathered and published at the moment,\" he said. \"I have a completely open mind about this and I'm going to look at it.\"</p> <p>This is no more than you might expect from an honest and open politician starting a new job. But it is hardly what the new head of Offa wanted to hear the day before getting his feet under the desk for the first time - benchmarks aren't quotas, and even if they were, the figures might not be the same next year; and in any case it's up to the universities to do what they think best, and if they do fall short, a penalty is far from guaranteed.</p> <p>The government has also done the new head few favours by delaying the announcement of his position until well into the autumn. \"This raises some very obvious practical problems,\" says Professor David Melville, vice-chancellor of Kent University. \"Every higher education institution needs to have agreed a five-year fair access plan by next January. It won't be easy.\" Offa will have less than a day to go through each institution's plan. Unless it is prepared to take a lot on trust and to skimp on rigour, it is hard to see how it can manage its workload.</p> <p>It is not that there is a conspiracy among the Russell group to keep state school students out of their universities. Far from it. Fair access is high up everyone's agenda these days. But there is genuine concern and confusion about the meaning of fairness and the best way to achieve it.</p> <p>\"There are 10,000 students with straight As at A-level who are rejected by Oxbridge each year,\" Melville points out. \"Few doubt that these rejected students would do just as well as those who were accepted. So what would be a fairer way of admitting them?</p> <p>\"You could argue that Oxbridge should have some kind of lottery system. But the applicants don't seem to want that. They want their chance to be discriminated against at interview.\"</p> <p>The report into a fair admissions policy by Steven Schwartz, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, which was published last month, has laid down a useful framework. Indeed, the government has accepted almost all its proposals, and has expressed particular enthusiasm for post-qualification admissions. But nobody pretends this will be an overall panacea.</p> <p>While Schwartz has been delighted with his report's reception, even he has concerns. \"The diminution in Offa's powers is particularly worrying,\" he says. \"I would have liked to have seen a much stronger watchdog.</p> <p>\"The fact remains that universities have talked about fairer admissions for the best part of 10 years, but the percentage of students from state school and manual and non-professional backgrounds has remained largely unaltered. The government and the universities are adamantly opposed to any form of social engineering, but I'm not so sure it wouldn't be a good idea.</p> <p>\"The current situation is not God-given. It has been socially engineered itself. So I don't see what harm could necessarily be done by re-engineering the process a little to even up the system and to give more people an equal chance.\"</p> <p>As Schwartz knows only too well, such measures would be electoral suicide for a government, so it is going to be down to the universities to effect change. So what price fairness? And what price Offa?</p> <p>Anne Campbell remains optimistic. \"I believe the universities are committed to fair access,\" she says. \"I have been very impressed by the efforts in this direction by the vice-chancellor of Cambridge. I also believe that Offa's mere existence will help to concentrate the minds of some universities.</p> <p>\"Running Offa will not be an easy job, and how much weight and credibility it is given will be largely determined by the person in charge. I just hope he remembers what was in parliament's mind when the post was created.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Sue Fishburn</strong></p> <p><strong>Headteacher, Leeds</strong></p> <p>The existing A-level system is not providing the information that university admissions tutors need. They desperately need more information in order to select students for popular courses.</p> <p>People will welcome the reduction in coursework, much of which has proved of little teaching value and difficult to quality-control. At the A-level end we are using structures we already have and fine-tuning them, rather than seeing a radical overhaul.</p> <p>Schools evolve and move on all the time. We face these changes in the knowledge that they will be brought in over an extended period and that there has been significant input from teachers. As with all such changes, the devil will be in the detail.</p> <p><strong>Richard Barnes</strong></p> <p><strong>Parent, London</strong></p> <p>I don't have any problem with systems evolving. It's simply good management practice that if something isn't working properly, you fix it. Something clearly isn't right, remembering the fuss about results a couple of years ago when everyone was getting As at A-level. The important thing is that everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet and that changes go smoothly, without any problems for the pupils - it has to be seamless.</p> <p>My two children will be doing A-levels in 2007 and 2008, and by then hopefully everything will be in place and running like clockwork. I'd perhaps feel less confident if they were in the very first groups going through. I feel sorry for teachers if it means extra work for them getting to grips with the new system, but it's like any other managerial overhaul, everyone has to know what they're doing and then all goes fine.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Allen</strong></p> <p><strong>Aged 16, Cornwall</strong></p> <p>I'm glad that they are looking at reducing coursework because it takes up so much time and there's such a lot of it. I prefer exams. Everyone's in the same situation, under the same pressure and you just have to get on with it on the day. Some people do prefer coursework because you have more time to think, look things up and present your work well, but I hate work that hangs around and you never see the end of it.</p> <p>I don't think changing things will make that much difference to pupils, in some ways. We do what the teachers tell us to do and we assume they know what we need to know to get through the exams. Learning a new system is probably more of a problem for the teachers.</p>",
  "<p>Leave early, says expert</p> <p>As a 15-year-old at secondary school, I was interested to read last week's article about young people's ideas on the new curriculum (Being there, doing that, Cover story, October 12). They are without a doubt the real experts in the area and make a number of important suggestions. Most significant, in my opinion, are their proposals for better organisation of work experience placements, recognition of responsibilities unsupported by qualifications, and more emphasis on life skills, such as stress management and social interaction. There is one issue, however, that I am surprised to see is not mentioned: student behaviour.</p> <p>The effects of the disrespect shown by some school pupils, particularly teenagers, are appalling. First, any single act of disobedience causes a distraction, so everything takes twice as long to be taught or get done. Further time is wasted as those in charge have to talk about the offences and punish the wrongdoers. The students who actually care about their work must neglect it because of their peers who do not. The process inevitably discourages the teachers from making an effort, so in the end everybody loses. I can't see that even the note-passers and back-talkers can get much long-term satisfaction.</p> <p>The solution I offer is to bring forward the end of compulsory education to year 10 or even year 9. The most obvious result would be that those who seriously do not want to be at school can leave, and will have no more negative influence on their friends. The students who do decide to remain will know they are there by choice, so there is no point in intentional disruption. An improvement in classroom behaviour would be a huge benefit to young people and teachers alike.<br> <strong>Name supplied</strong><br> <strong>Bromley, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>No sympathy</strong></p> <p>Your diary correspondent (Deep end, Teach, October 12) seemed surprised to find another group in the workforce who work in challenging conditions (\"Teachers are not alone in the hard-work/high-stress/ low-pay ratio\"). I am baffled by the notion, increasingly played upon by some teachers and those who speak for them, that their situation is unique.</p> <p>The \"I am worse off than anyone else\" approach risks losing the sympathy of parents for the hard job teachers do indeed have in educating and caring for our children. However, the rest of the working world has to function without the luxury of half-terms, long Christmas breaks and summer holidays.</p> <p>The bottom line is that a large proportion of the working population has to put in extremely long hours without the number of breaks teachers have to recharge their batteries. Now, people are being told they will have to work until they are over 70 in order to achieve a half-way decent standard of living in retirement.</p> <p>Teachers should aim to get our respect for the quality of the work they do, not ask for our sympathy because they feel hard done by.<br> <strong>Pamela Dix</strong><br> <strong>Woking</strong></p> <p><strong>Figure it out, minister</strong></p> <p>If Kim Howells, the new minister for further education, wants to get to know his patch better (Keen eye on a new landscape, Further, October 12), he could ask at his local college about a maths course. He has missed a glaring reason why the parents of school children have more electoral muscle than parents of college students: there are a lot more of them.</p> <p>Children are in schools for at least 11 years. Since each age group numbers about 600,000, and, assuming that children, on average, have two parents or step-parents who are concerned about their education, that adds up to more than 14 million parents of school children - a huge proportion of the electorate.</p> <p>Although slightly more 16- and 17-year-olds are in FE or sixth-form colleges than in schools, only just over 1 million people are parents of teenagers in colleges. In fact, since the majority of FE students are over 25, voters are more likely to be FE students in their own right than parents of FE students.</p> <p>There is, of course, another reason why college students' parents find it difficult to make their voices heard amid the clamour for a return to 11-18 schools. That is because they are much more likely to be from a disadvantaged background than are parents of students in school sixth forms.</p> <p>If ministers don't even understand the context they're operating in, then is the strategic area review just an attempt to pass the buck down to the local learning and skills councils and local authorities?<br> <strong>Judith Watson</strong><br> <strong>Senior research fellow, School of the environment, University of Brighton</strong></p> <p>I note with interest that Kim Howells' plans for FE and HE seem to involve nothing short-term and a commendable attachment to avoid meaningless reviews and inquiries.

  "<p>Sarah Robinson's first attempts at fiction this summer could be a sign of things to come. The 18-year-old student at Whitehaven school in Cumbria embarked on a short story about court intrigue and a murderous prince as part of an Open University short course.</p> <p>This - the OU's young applicants in schools scheme (Yass), not the court intrigue - is one of the ideas for stretching bright youngsters picked up by Mike Tomlinson in his report on the state of secondary education in England this week.</p> <p>Last week, as he was putting the final touches to a report that carries a huge burden of hopes and expectation, Sarah and more than 50 other sixth formers from nine schools in west Cumbria received their OU awards for completing degree-level work in subjects such as maths, science and languages, as well as creative writing.</p> <p>The story wasn't perfect, conceded Sarah, who juggled her writing course with a holiday job at the local Whitehaven News, alongside A-levels in English, history and philosophy. But it has given her a taste for more. \"I would really like to do another course related to English. Time management is definitely a big part of it. It's been really good to get the chance to do creative writing, a chance to look at a different side of writing.\" When she spoke to Education Guardian she was filling out her Ucas form, hoping to study journalism at the Carlisle Institute of the Arts, and, of course, citing her successfully completed course.</p> <p>Yesterday, Tomlinson, the former schools chief inspector now promoted to the government's flak-catcher in chief, was doing his best to persuade the nation that his own writings should not be dismissed as fiction. So many reports on the intractable problems of secondary schooling and vocational education have come and gone that people are bound to ask if this is the revolution we've all been waiting for - or whether the wheels of English education are just revolving in the mud again.</p> <p>Indeed, prolonged exposure to education debates induces an almost Buddhist acceptance of life repeating itself, as policies are proclaimed, die and are then reincarnated by a new set of politicians in search of nirvana.</p> <p>Tomlinson has been charged with inventing a system for 14- to 19-year-olds that at one end will stretch the most able and enable the most sought-after universities to choose between them, while at the other stem the haemorrhage of young people who are turned off by schooling and either vote with their feet or sit sullenly at the back of the class causing trouble.</p> <p>Crucially, he must bring coherence and credibility to the fragmented arrangements for vocational education and training - currently more than 4,000 qualifications given by 114 awarding bodies. Oh, and while you're about it, Mike, reduce the insane burden of exams and coursework on students and teachers.</p> <p>We've been here before, as Tomlinson is well aware. In 1884, a royal commission reported that schooling in Germany was \"overwhelmingly superior ... the dense ignorance so common among workmen in England is unknown\". Nicholas Timmins's biography of the welfare state, The Five Giants, goes on to quote: \"Your commissioners cannot repeat too often that they have been impressed with the general intelligence and technical knowledge of the masters and managers of industrial establishments on the Continent.\"</p> <p>The 1944 Butler Act envisaged three kinds of schools: grammar, secondary modern and technical. But the last were just never built. British, especially English, culture seemed unable to accord vocational and technical achievements the same respect as academic ones. These are deep, intractable societal problems - if they were easy to solve, they probably would have been solved already.</p> <p>In 1988, the Higginson report, which recommended moving from three A-levels to five, lasted a few seconds on the desk of the education secretary before being rejected out of hand. A few years later, the Conservative government came up with an attractive-sounding scheme to broaden England's narrow sixth-form curriculum and enhance the status of vocational qualifications. This \"advanced diploma\" would include A-levels within it, but also basic skills and vocational courses. Sound familiar?</p> <p>It disappeared without trace. The main \"customers\" - universities, employers and students themselves - couldn't see the point of it. University admissions tutors continued to insist that candidates had two Bs and a C at A-level, or whatever their going rate was, in the subjects they specified. Employers were still getting to grips with GCSEs, let alone fancy new diplomas.</p> <p>The lesson Tomlinson and his colleagues learned from that episode is that, while he is making great efforts to reassure everyone that the content and rigour of A-levels will be retained - and indeed enhanced - in his new diploma, the name will vanish.</p> <p>In 1995, Lord (then Sir Ron) Dearing had a go at \"achieving greater coherence and breadth of study without compromising standards\". Reporting a year later, in the dying days of the Major government, there was little prospect of getting his more radical ideas put into practice. So what he privately called his \"non-baccalaureate\" - a diploma for which students would have to study a subject from each of four areas: science, arts, modern languages and \"the way the community works\", for example, business, economics, law, sociology - failed to dent the A-level \"gold standard\". (Though not before this correspondent rashly predicted the death of A-levels at the hands of the incoming Labour government.)</p> <p>Dearing did succeed in bringing in one-year AS-levels, but their implementation was bungled by the Labour ministers. First, ministers consulted about the Dearing recommendations for more than a year, and then they rushed to bring in Curriculum 2000, with predictably chaotic results - schools and colleges were starting A-level courses before the syllabuses were published. Indeed, it was the knock-on effect on A-level marking that provoked the row that eventually claimed the scalp of the education secretary Estelle Morris, and led to the setting-up of the Tomlinson inquiry. The number of wrong results turned out to be very small, but the feeling that things could not go on as before had taken hold.</p> <p>For education ministers, the past two years have been cushioned: any difficult questions about A-levels, GCSEs, secondary schools and colleges could be fielded by an appeal to wait for Tomlinson's conclusions. Now Charles Clarke, the education secretary, will have to step into the line of media fire on \"abolishing\" A-levels and GCSEs. A white paper will set out his stall.</p> <p>But Tomlinson has recruited an impressive band of allies to encourage ministers - and in the process generated a remarkable amount of optimism among the seen-it-all-before cynics in the sector. At one end, the Russell group universities, which have been complaining that they can't choose the best candidates because so many have A grades, welcome the stretching of A-levels with more open-ended questions and gradations at the top end. Delyth Chambers, of Birmingham University, the Russell group's spokesperson on admissions, said they also like the idea of an extended piece of work to enthuse students as well as developing their research and study skills. For similar reasons, the independent schools are pleased, saying they have got 95% of what they wanted from the inquiry.</p> <p>In the further education sector, both lecturers and colleges are hopeful about Tomlinson - the move to a broader curriculum in which young people can mix and match vocational and academic courses ought in theory to favour colleges or at least promote collaboration with schools.</p> <p>John Brennan, general secretary of the Association of Colleges, looks forward to sorting out the plethora of qualifications, which are little understood by the public. \"Tomlinson offers us a way of achieving a more coherent structure which can fulfil many of the needs we face as a nation over the next few decades.\" But only, he adds, if colleges get the resources to do the job - at the moment they receive at least 10% less than schools for teaching equivalent students, a gap the government shows no signs of closing.</p> <p>For Chambers, too, there is a concern that some students would be at a disadvantage because their school or college did not give them access to the full range of the diploma.</p> <p>Brennan hopes for more cooperation with schools and even for 14-year-olds to be able to opt for a mainly vocational education in colleges - something that would provoke strong opposition in some quarters.</p> <p>At the lecturers' union Natfhe, national officer Dan Taubman said it was very much in favour of a diploma that recognised the achievements of all students at different levels. \"This is a golden moment for reform. If we don't reform post-14 education now, we will lose the chance for a generation. We have got to maintain the momentum. It's a social revolution; that's why we are in favour of it.\"</p> <p>There are flaws to the plan - for instance, the fetishisation of ICT as a compulsory part of the diploma, a recurring theme of all these inquiries since the 1980s. This is a middle-aged obsession; young people learn the ICT skills they need anyway. What counts is the knowledge they acquire and their skills in handling it, not whether they look it up on the net and write it on to disk, or read a book and write on bits of paper. The same obsession with technology severely hampered the introduction of the national curriculum after 1988.</p> <p>More fundamentally, can Natfhe's hopes really be reconciled with happy, smiling independent schools? Tomlinson is trying. What has given everyone hope is his advice that the changes should take a decade. Most of the educational cock-ups of recent years - including the marking row that led to this inquiry - have been caused by trying to hurry.</p> <p>Dearing, who paved the way for Tomlinson with three major education inquiries, said last week: \"I'm a person who believes in progressive change, not a big bang. After a big bang, there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth while you try to make it work.\"</p> <p>The example of Scotland, which had its own big secondary education review 10 years ago, suggests that not only must things be taken slowly but that a lot of readjustment and fine tuning is necessary for years to come. Originally, Professor John Howie had opted for a baccalaureate system, but that was watered down in favour of highers and advanced highers (akin to AS-levels and A-levels) and intermediates (equivalent to GCSE) in a framework including vocational courses.</p> <p>The idea of mixing academic and vocational modules was already quite well established in Scottish schools. The first advanced highers didn't run until 1999-2000 - five years after the Howie review - and adjustments are still being made. The amount of testing and assessment is being reduced in response to complaints from teachers, students and parents.</p> <p>The long lead-in time brings its own risks, of course - in five years' time, who knows what the current education ministers will be up to - but it is reassuring for teachers, and probably for parents, too. But Tomlinson has seen enough wailing and gnashing to make him wary of big bangs and, as he told journalists before the launch: \"There's nothing in here that isn't happening somewhere in a school.\"</p> <p>So school pupils taking Open University courses get an honourable mention because there are already more than 800 students doing them, at 60 schools.</p> <p>At least the parts of the Tomlinson vehicle have been road-tested. It now remains to be seen whether the whole thing is roadworthy and his story ends with everyone studying happily ever after.</p>",
  "<p>Many of you will have read All in a Day, devised almost 20 years ago by Mitsumasa Anno. The principal theme is peace, a message to be shared by the members of the global village in which we live, learn and, for some, teach.</p> <p>As the authors of the book describe, children's activities are related to the very different conditions in which they live, created in part by time and climate. The book focuses on new year's day in eight time zones, highlighting the differences in the way we look while emphasising that we are all fundamentally the same.</p> <p>The main actors in the text are children of a similar age; waking, sleeping, playing, eating, interacting with the environment in which they live. The children who attend schools and colleges across the UK are also representative of a number of cultures, heritages and background, yet all have the same desire and need for food, warmth, communication and peace.</p> <p>While teachers are responsible for the transmission of knowledge, this is never in isolation from the experiences learners bring to the classroom. Increasingly, schools are the only places where some children can find the peace they need to grow.</p> <p>As Anno and his collaborators demonstrate, there are strong similarities and differences between children around the globe. But teachers have similar, yet different, characteristics. The similarities could include a desire to be part of a community of learners who through their practice and lives are committed to value-based education.</p> <p>This is described in the European Commission report, Learning for the 21st century, in which the authors explain that learning is a composite of learning to know, learning to do, learning to live together and learning to be. Applying this to practice would extend the role of the teacher, for in addition to the transmission of knowledge that prepares the learner for a job, there is also a responsibility for preparing them to become citizens.</p> <p>Social commentators inform us that there is a social and economic need for people to be lifelong learners. Nowadays, irrespective of location, people rarely find a job for life; there is a need for lifelong learning. In theory, there has never been a better time to be a teacher.</p> <p>Within the cycle of learning, teachers are also lifelong learners, with a need to develop further their skills. Teachers need support in maintaining and improving the achievements of the learner; fundamentally, they require a basic set of tools that encompasses working with knowledge regardless of subject or discipline.</p> <p>The tools will also include the training and education required to develop an ability to collaborate and work with an increasingly diverse range of professionals and learners. Returning to the simple yet powerful message of Anno's book, teachers also require the tools to develop the voice of the learner, be that adult or child.</p> <p>Anno concludes the introduction by commenting that each country has a neighbourhood in which children live, beyond which there is another country that shares the same sun and moon. In this text, no child is isolated from the others. The same could be said of learners and teachers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Professor Sonia Blandford is dean of education at Canterbury Christ Church University College. <a href=\"mailto:masterclass@cant.ac.uk\">masterclass@cant.ac.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Two large roulette wheels and an inviting tray of $25 chips take centre stage in one room. Next door, the fluorescent lights of an electronic GPOD - game play on demand - catch the eye. I place a bet on the number 14 and a ball starts spinning round the on-screen wheel. It lands on the number 2. I bet on the 14 for a second time, and again the ball lands on 2. Even I can see a pattern here. I put my money on the 2. The wheel spits the ball out into the 14. Someone is having a laugh. And that someone is Stephanie Haywood.</p> <p>Most academics regard filling in grant application forms as a complicated form of blackjack. You play your cards as best you can, but you're never quite sure what aces the awarding panel has up its sleeve. Yet Haywood played her last hand so well that she didn't just end up with a bundle of cash, she also came away just a craps table short of the full casino.</p> <p>The new Gaming Technology Centre (GTC), of which Haywood is the director, occupies the half floor of Hull University's structural engineering building that became vacant when another professor, his research team and his grant were poached by another university. It was opened only at the beginning of this month, and a fork-lift parked in the corridor tells you that all is not exactly bedded in as yet.</p> <p>Haywood is not a betting person and has only ever been into a casino once. \"It was one afternoon last summer on a research trip to Leeds,\" she says. \"It was a real eye-opener, seeing the clientele: there was everyone from pensioners playing the machines to business types playing cards.\"</p> <p>Haywood kept her hands in her pockets that time, but she would put money on the GTC being more permanent than her predecessors in the building. Already, just a few weeks into the three-year venture, the two sponsors - ECM Systems and the Gala Group - have indicated they would like the project to run longer.</p> <p>As head of the engineering department, Haywood spends more time than she would like dreaming up new ways of bringing in research money. \"We all feel the squeeze these days,\" she grins. \"Our student numbers are good but our per capita grant is decreasing year on year in real terms, so if we want to maintain the size of the department, the pressure is on to bring in new income.\" And once you have exhausted the UK and EU research councils, you start looking towards business.</p> <p>And in Hull, that doesn't leave you many options. There's BP ... and that's about it, as far as the big players are concerned. So Haywood thought small. She had remained friends with Paul Whitbread, who used to work as a technician in the physics department, and had gone on to set-up ECM Systems, an electronic hardware manufacturer. So she invited him out to lunch.</p> <p>The timing was good. ECM systems was already making components for bingo halls and casinos, which were - with the expected imminent relaxation in the gaming laws - in turn looking for ways to improve and expand their operations. So the GTC was born.</p> <p>\"There are three main strands to the deal,\" Haywood says. \"We are committed to supply Gala with a certain number of days' consultancy per year; ECM is sponsoring students on our new electronic gaming degree; and we are doing applied research on behalf of ECM and Gala.\"</p> <p>Initially, the research will be focused on security. The spin of a roulette wheel is relatively predictable, and tracking devices, such as a pre-programmed mobile phone, have been used to determine in which quadrant the ball will land. The GTC is developing a camera that can be attached to the roulette wheel, which can detect if any tracking system is in operation and block it. Thereafter, research will be applied to the wider issues of linking the hardware and software to support remote gaming.</p> <p>Haywood looks an unlikely person to be fronting a gaming operation. Her humour and conversation don't run to the loud or obvious, and there's not a hint of a bow tie in sight. When asked about the morality of gaming, she initially seems a little defensive, talking about science being neutral - \"It's the applications that have moral consequences\" - and it's only a little later that she sparks into life. \"Look, gaming, when done in moderation, provides a great deal of enjoyment. And it's not as if we're making components for weapons systems. That I would have problems with.\"</p> <p>Yet she appears almost embarrassed to be the director. \"I'm obviously very proud of it,\" she insists, \"but I don't think I'm the ideal person to be in charge. As the one who brought the money in, I rather emerged as the figurehead, but I hope we can soon appoint someone who can dedicate more time to it.\"</p> <p>There again, if you check out most university science and engineering departments, you could only conclude that she's an unlikely person to be running one. Haywood is quick to put me right. \"I'm actually the second woman to have been in charge of engineering at Hull,\" she says, before conceding that her university may be unusual in this respect.</p> <p>Haywood does not seem that keen to discuss glass doors and ceilings, and it's clear that gender has never really been a barrier for her.</p> <p>\"Neither of my parents knew anything about science,\" she says, \"and so I realised that if I wanted to know about Dr Who and the space race, I was going to have to find out for myself. And when they both died when I was a teenager, I went to live with the family of my best friend and there was no one to decide my future but me. I knew I was going to make a life in science: the only debate was in which area.\"</p> <p>She studied chemistry at Oxford, but didn't really enjoy the first three years: \"I had a detached retina, so I couldn't really see and I turned out to be useless at organic chemistry.\" Things picked up in her final research year, and on graduation she went to work for Lucas engineering in Solihull. It was among colleagues that she met her only real sexism - \"some seemed amazed I knew one end of a spanner from the other\" - but it was boredom that drove her back into academia. \"I realised that to get the freedom to do the research that interested me I was going to have to get a PhD.\" So it was back to Middlesex Poly and the University of Leuven to work on materials for integrated circuits, and it was on the completion of her doctorate in 1985 that she faced another major decision.</p> <p>\"IBM offered me a job at their research facility in the US,\" she says. \"At the same time, both Imperial College and Oxford invited me to work as a research assistant.\" She put academia before cash and went to Oxford to work on low-dimensional structures, now known as nanotechnology.</p> <p>UCL then offered her a full-time job, and she moved to Hull when she was expecting her second child. \"My husband was commuting there to work for BP,\" she says, \"and I was wondering how I could earn enough to carry on lecturing and pay for childcare. I didn't want to stop work, so I targeted Hull.\"</p> <p>She applied for one job but didn't get it, then found her way in through another opening, and hasn't looked back. Although the admin takes more time than she would like, she makes space for her own research. At present, she's working on systems to improve the detection of pollutants and, together with teams from Umist, Oxford, Sheffield and Lancaster, developing smart materials that can change the wave-length from the visible to infra-red.</p> <p>In fact, it's her own research that may put the boot into her dreams of passing on the directorship of the GTC. \"I never imagined that my blue-skies research would integrate with the GTC,\" she says. \"But there is an interesting overlap between my infra-red work and building a system for detecting the flow of chips through a casino.\" Like the mob before her, Haywood may yet discover there is money to be made from gambling.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Stephanie Haywood</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 47</p> <p><strong>Job:</strong> professor of optoelectronics and head of engineering department, University of Hull</p> <p><strong>Before that:</strong> senior lecturer, University College London; research assistant, Clarendon lab, Oxford University</p> <p><strong>Awards:</strong> fellow of the Institute of Physics; visiting professor, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier</p> <p><strong>Publications:</strong> more than 60 refereed journals and conference proceedings</p> <p><strong>Likes:</strong> the Archers omnibus</p> <p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> world poverty, coconut</p> <p><strong>Married:</strong> with two children</p>",
  "<p>The pensions time-bomb is ticking louder, but the government is searching for the detonator in the wrong place. So says Martin Sullivan, senior lecturer in economics at the University of the West of England. He argues that the real crisis is not with state pensions, but with the private schemes encouraged by the government.</p> <p>\"My research has led me to believe that state pension schemes are sustainable, but private schemes provided by employers and insurance companies are in deep trouble,\" he says. \"Consequently, the government's suggestions that private pension saving can fill the gap left by an increasingly stingy state pension are unrealistic for the majority of the population.\"</p> <p>Sullivan points out that in the 1980s it was hoped private pensions would fill the gap left by declining state pensions. But he has found that large employees are now closing their schemes, and returns on individual ones, such as stakeholder pensions, have been \"miserable in the last year or two\".</p> <p>He blames the media for fuelling an unhelpful perception of the pensions crisis, and criticises the arcane, impenetrable language and concepts used by the professionals. \"Terms like 'longevity risk', 'defined benefit', 'pay-as-you-go' and 'moral hazard' are not part of the everyday vocabulary of most people,\" he points out.</p> <p>The multiplicity of schemes, and the way they fit together, can be bewildering, he adds. And these complexities, the lack of fluidity and the continuously changing rules are particularly off-putting to people in their 40s and 50s - the groups who should be saving the most.</p> <p>Sullivan urges today's increasingly myopic youngsters to formulate a savings strategy, warning that the future has a nasty habit of creeping up on you. \"Those in their early 20s that I see at university and in the wider community are very much of a 'live now' generation,\" he says. \"That contrasts with their grandparents, who were more thrifty.\"</p> <p>And he challenges the government's attempts to raise the retirement age. The groundswell of opinion, he says, is that the age should rise because people's health is improving, enabling them to work longer. \"That's wrong,\" he stresses. \"While raising the age for the average worker wouldn't be too burdensome, for some groups, raising the age would be particularly onerous.\" He highlights manual and semi-manual workers in professions that take a heavy toll on their health, and whose life expectancy after retirement may be short anyway.</p> <p>Another target for Sullivan's criticism is the government's \u00a3500,000-a-year means-testing system. \"It is an extremely expensive way of providing relatively small amounts to a large number of pensioners.\"</p> <p>Investigating the bedrock of today's pensions regulations, Sullivan turned to the fall-out from one of the most notorious pensions scandals, the Maxwell affair. That led to excessive burdens, making it too expensive for companies to run their own schemes.</p> <p>Surely, faced with such an apparently unfathomable system, Sullivan must be a godsend for his family and friends? Yet he explains: \"Under the law, giving advice is risky, so I never give advice, but I'm frequently asked to comment.\"</p> <p>But he must have the perfect pensions package? \"Because I'm an insider, I understand the language and I've been able to make my own arrangements more efficiently,\" he agrees.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Understanding Pensions by Martin Sullivan is published by Routledge</p>",
  "<p>The first possible explanation is that word has got round that you're not a very good teacher, but this is highly unlikely. Schools are so desperate, you have to be off-the-bottom-of-the-scale bad not to get supply work. </p> <p>The second is that all the teachers in your area have been taking loads of vitamins and are enjoying an illness-free six months. This is even more unlikely. </p> <p>The most probable answer is that local schools are fed up with being stiffed by supply agencies and are making alternative arrangements. You might not think you're getting that much for your day's work, but when you consider the agency's cut, the school is probably paying at least half as much again - if not double. And making a right mess of the school budget in the process. </p> <p>None of this is your fault. But try imagining the effect of supply on the school. The head gets to work at about 7.30am, and the first thing he or she has to do is take a load of calls from teachers hacking up phlegm. He or she will then do a quick mental calculation about which remaining members of staff can have their arm twisted into doubling up classes, before admitting defeat. </p> <p>Shortly before 8, the head calls the agency. It's almost certainly engaged. Eventually, someone answers, and if the school is fortunate, replacements can be found. With any luck, they will be supply teachers who have worked at the school before, but the head will usually take whoever is on offer just to ensure there's a body in front of the kids. </p> <p>This is why the atmosphere is always so poisonous when you breeze into the staffroom just before 9am. You see yourself as the white knight riding to the school's rescue. But the staff see someone who is being paid much more than they are; will almost certainly not help out at break- and mealtimes; will do little more than a riot-control job in the classroom; and will trot off home at 3.45 without a care in the world. </p> <p>To be fair to you, you didn't invent the system. But you must understand why some schools have been looking for a way round the problem. </p> <p>And now they've found one. New regulations allow qualified teaching assistants - with salaries far lower than a teacher's - to take some lessons unsupervised. This is obviously less than ideal, but, faced with the choice of an expensive supply teacher who's got no real knowledge of the kids' work or their range of abilities and won't be setting homework, and an assistant who at least knows some of the kids ... Well, you can see which way the wind is blowing. </p> <p>You won't like it, and your union won't like it, either. But unless a serious number of parents object, there may not be much to change heads' minds. You might be better off rethinking your strategy. If you're a half-way decent teacher, many schools would be delighted to take you on part-time. So give it a thought - some of the kids aren't so bad, once you've learned their names.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send your problems to <a href=\"mailto:education@theguardian.com\">education@theguardian.com</a> marked Career Doctor</p>",
  "<p>Some science books are deadly dull. But there is no dullness in Robert Cohen's \"Deadly\" adventure series. It's got plenty of good, old-fashioned deadliness.</p> <p>So far Cohen has produced four cracking good reads:</p> <p>Milk: The Deadly Poison, by Robert Cohen and Jane Heimlich, Argus Books; 1998, 317 pages.</p> <p>Diet Soda : The Deadly Poison, by Robert Cohen, Argus Books; 1998.</p> <p>Radiation: The Deadly Poison, by Robert Cohen, Argus Books; 1999.</p> <p>Vaccines: The Deadly Poison, by Robert Cohen, Argus Books; 2000.</p> <p>These are four of the most fun books ever written. I cannot recommend them highly enough to anyone who, like me, enjoys worrying constantly about deadly poisons.</p> <p>The author, the aforementioned Robert Cohen, is prolific. He turned out these first four books in a mere three years. Cohen has the special ability to see deadly poisons where others somehow don't. He invites us all to share his enjoyment. His enthusiasm is nearly rabid.</p> <p>And his words give hope. Here is a quote from Milk: The Deadly Poison. \"A sip of milk contains hundreds of different substances, each one having the potential to exert a powerful biological effect when taken independently of the others.\" Happily, this is true of most substances that people ingest. So there is much as-yet-unground grist for Cohen's mill. We can hope that he will write many other \"deadly poison\" books.</p> <p>A colleague says he heard that Cohen's next book will be called A Nice Glass of Tea: A Deadly Poison. But I could not get the book publisher to confirm that, so I don't know if it's true.</p> <p>If, like me, you want to know everything you can about a favourite author, you can supplement your reading by going online and finding his or her website. Cohen has a lively one at <a href=\"http://www.notmilk.com\">www.notmilk.com</a>. There one learns that Cohen is executive director of the Dairy Education Board, though I found only a spare description of what the Dairy Education Board is: \"A public information association that has been formed to let America know that cow's milk is not nature's perfect food for people.\"</p> <p>In Cohen's writings, the unexpected lurks everywhere. One essay, entitled Rat Poison, begins: \"It's the law - rat poison must be added to milk.\" I didn't know that. There is a thrill that comes from reading books where you know for certain that you will be surprised.</p> <p>I now understand, thanks to Cohen, that milk consists largely of pus and other yucky stuff, and that many popular celebrities come down with horrible diseases and even die because they drink milk. It's fun to hear about the private lives of the stars.</p> <p>This is science the way it could be. If only scientists and reporters would stop being so fussbudgety careful in the things they say and write, they too could produce fun books and fun websites just like Cohen's.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly magazine Annals of Improbable Research (<a href=\"http://www.improbable.com\" )>www.improbable.com</a>) and organiser of the Ig Nobel Prize</p>",
  "<p>Andrew West, deputy director of student services at the University of Sheffield, last week won the first annual Association of University Administrators' (AUA) awards for excellence. The awards were inaugurated to recognise and acknowledge the contribution of managers and administrators in higher education in the UK and Ireland, and are an opportunity for individuals in the higher education sector to raise their profiles, and that of their institutions.</p> <p>Entrants were asked to describe a project or programme on which they had worked, which they considered to be an example of excellence. West described a programme of new training and support that his department provided for other members of staff, based within academic departments of the university that deliver services to students.</p> <p>The awards were jointly sponsored by the Guardian and the leading corporate law firm Pinsents, and the prize money of \u00a33,000 was presented by Ewart Wooldridge, chief executive of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and Nicola Hart, partner and national head of the universities group at Pinsents, at the AUA annual lecture last Thursday.</p> <p>The prize money is for international travel to learn from examples of best practice at higher education institutions abroad, or to promote examples of UK best practice in other countries. Entrants had to outline their travel plans as part of their application. West intends to visit a number of institutions in the US in order to investigate the support given to academic staff there by the equivalent of a central student services department in the UK.</p> <p>He will produce a report on his findings for the AUA national office and may go on to describe them in the AUA journal, Perspectives: Policy and Practice in Higher Education; the AUA newsletter, Newslink; and also by delivering a workshop at the next AUA conference.</p> <p>The entries were assessed by a panel of senior AUA members, including Sue Holmes, AUA chair and head of facilities planning at Sheffield Hallam University; John Hogan, registrar at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne; Anthony McClaran, chief executive of Ucas; Bruce Nelson, academic registrar and deputy secretary at the University of Edinburgh; and Maureen Skinner, registrar at Thames Valley University. In judging the projects put forward by entrants, they looked for evidence of the impact of the project, the contribution of the individual to it, innovation and creativity, establishment of best practice, success of the project against original objectives, and effective teamwork and leadership.</p> <p>A wide range of projects were submitted for consideration, covering many major higher education business areas, including widening participation, human resources, space and facilities planning and teaching management.</p> <p>As well as West, four other entrants were singled out by the assessors. Scott Mulholland, head of student administration at the Robert Gordon University, and Sheila Quairney, business partnerships manager at Sheffield Hallam University, were declared runners-up. Michelle Morgan, student experience manager at the University of Sussex, and Sue Hybart, director of planning at Cardiff University, were both highly commended.</p> <p>Mulholland, who is studying for an MSc in e-business at the Robert Gordon University, as well as carrying out his administrative role, put forward a project that aimed to re-engineer the application and enrolment process for students at the university, making it less time-consuming and resource intensive.</p> <p>Quairney submitted her work on the enterprise challenge project at Sheffield Hallam, which encourages student entrepreneurs and has seen the number of graduates of the university entering self-employment rise to its highest-ever level.</p> <p>Morgan described her role in devising a new induction process for students at Sussex to improve the student experience. Finally, Hybart outlined her work as project manager on the merger of Cardiff University and the University of Wales College of Medicine. The assessors felt these entrants had made a real difference through their leadership of, or contribution to a particular project.</p> <p>The AUA will now use its publications and website to increase awareness of best practice throughout the higher education sector, draw particular attention to the top entries in this competition, and use them to fulfil its aim of promoting excellence in higher education management and enhancing the profile of the profession.</p>",
  "<p>It is a university that never sleeps - thousands of students across the world studying remotely at the same institution 24 hours a day. Forget noisy classrooms with teachers trying to gain control; enter peaceful learning environments where the only noise is the hum of PCs and the occasional voice of students asking questions. </p> <p>This is the objective of Edinburgh's Interactive University (IU), a teaching programme that, over the past 18 months, has attracted 75,000 students from more than 23 countries. In sharp contrast to the failure of its English counterpart, UkeU, which had signed up only 900 students when it was scrapped in June, the IU has seen a 75% increase in student numbers over the past year. </p> <p>A spin-off from Heriot Watt University, the IU adapts courses from Scottish schools, colleges and universities, sell ing them online to partner institutions around the globe. Since its introduction early last year, courses have been successfully piloted in south-east Asia, China, India, the Middle East and south America. </p> <p>\"The IU enables international students to obtain degrees from Scottish universities without the expense of studying in Scotland,\" says Professor Roy Leitch, IU's chief executive officer. \"The greatest uptake has been in foundation or undergraduate courses, with students enrolling in either business management or IT.\" </p> <p>While undergraduate courses have the lion's share of students, postgraduate programmes are becoming more popular among international students; the University of Stirling offers an MBA in entrepreneurship and business venturing. At secondary school level, the most popular course has been the Scholar e-learning programme, which now has 60,000 students throughout Scotland. Created by Heriot Watt, Scholar provides e-learning materials to support conventional classroom teaching. </p> <p>The courses have also been piloted in Cumbria, Kent and the Midlands, where 4,000 students have taken part in the scheme. \"The key to the Scholar programme and the other IU courses is that the student enjoys more one-to-one attention from the teacher,\" says Leitch. \"Conventional learning relies on a teacher doing all the teaching. The software does this by teaching modular subjects, with the teacher listening to the student and answering questions.\" He points out the system enables students to learn at their own pace, rather than trying to absorb information from the teacher. </p> <p>Scholar works using two support services. The first is the Scholar forum, a network of regional user groups involving local education advisers and development officers. The second is the staff development programme, which introduces teachers to new material, classroom practices and, importantly, to the idea of working in a \"listening\" environment. </p> <p>\"The IU must have input from a teacher or it wouldn't work,\" argues Leitch. \"The teacher's knowledge of how students learn is used to better advantage, while e-learning teaches the lesson. Computers will never replace teachers in motivating pupils to learn.\" </p> <p>But while Leitch is at pains to point out the advantages of the IU, some sectors of the teaching profession have reservations. Clare Harris, a biology teacher at Harrogate Granby high school, says: \"From a personal point of view, computer training is an extra hassle teachers can do without.\" She also believes the IU prevents students from developing the all-important social skills required in class interaction, as well as skills needed for practical subjects such as sciences. </p> <p>Yet Scotland has seen the number of students opting for sciences increase by 10% over the past 12 months. Moreover, Scholar has seen a 100% take-up by Scottish local authorities, and average pass rates have increased from 84% to 92%. </p> <p>Neil Johnson, a biology teacher at Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen, is an advocate of the programme. \"Scholar suits all learning styles as it enables students to learn from different materials in a self-directed way,\" he says. </p> <p>Scholar, foundation and postgraduate courses are all assessed through written examinations, overseen by the British Council in foreign countries. Every course has exactly the same curriculum as offered in schools, colleges and universities in Scotland - this is seen as crucial to enable the IU to achieve the same teaching standards globally, regardless of whether the course is conducted in Dundee or Dubai. </p> <p>The IU is promoting the reputation of Scotland's leading educational institutions. Heriot Watt, Edinburgh and Aberdeen universities are just three offering courses to other countries. Leitch says: \"The primary focus for us now is in east Asia, providing management courses in areas such as hospitality, retail and tourism.\" He adds: \"Our strategy for China is going to be at university entry level, where there is a large gap in English language and computer competence.\" </p> <p>He perceives new markets in Europe and north America; the IU is also working with the World Bank to discover a financially viable solution to offering courses in Africa. </p> <p>While Leitch freely discloses the IU is only \"scratching the surface\" of the \u00a318bn global e-learning market, he is quick to mention the organisation is a not-for-profit enterprise. </p> <p>As Leith sums it up, \"we will continue to reinvest in programmes to deliver the high quality education for which Scotland is renowned\".</p>",
  "Warm, relentlessly polite and occasionally confused, the British sporting public yesterday offered the International Olympic Committee a glimpse of what they can expect should they choose to bestow the 2012 games on the capital. <p>Officially the thousands who gathered in central London were there to offer Britain's Olympic and Paralympic medallists a final curtain call nine weeks after the Olympic flame was lit in Athens. Their presence was also a crucial element in London's bid to win the right to host the 2012 summer games. Genuine though the affection and respect for the medallists was, yesterday's event was also a crucial part of that intensifying campaign. </p> <p>London's final candidature file is at the printers, and will be presented to the IOC in a month. Yesterday, according to officials, marked the start of \"the selling campaign\". The aim was to provide the IOC, via pictures beamed around the world, another persuasive argument for bringing the games to London, and bid organisers could not have asked for more. </p> <p>A beautiful autumn afternoon greeted the Olympians as they climbed aboard open-backed lorries in Piccadilly, the capital's landmarks were at their best basking in the sun, the TV cameras ignored occasional gaps along the route, and the spectators caught the mood, dutifully waving Union and London 2012 \"Back the Bid\" flags. </p> <p>The exact number that turned out in person seems likely to remain a matter of dispute, but as a backdrop for the BBC's coverage - the corporation has spent \u00a3150m for first option on the rights for the 2012 games - they did their job perfectly. </p> <p>Officials from the British Olympic Association said 200,000 people lined the parade route through central London, culminating in a celebratory rally in Trafalgar Square. The impeccably behaved crowd that gathered at the feet of the National Gallery may have numbered no more than 20,000, and unusually the Metropolitan Police declined to put a figure to it. </p> <p>The reception that greeted the \"Parade of the Heroes\" never matched the event's hubristic title. Where England's rugby World Cup winning squad were raucously cheered by almost one million people on their return in the rain last November, here the lorries bearing Olympians mainly drew polite applause and whispered enquiries as to who exactly was being cheered, not least from the many tourists who paused to watch. </p> <p>Kelly Sotherton, who won bronze in the heptathlon, reflected the confusion. \"I have been called 'Paula' this afternoon, and 'Sally', so I'm not sure who they think we all are,\" she said. </p> <p>Memories of Radcliffe and Gunnell may persist, but there was no mistaking the warmth of the welcome, nor the delight that athletes often obscured from the public eye take from public recognition of their achievements. </p> <p>\"It was overwhelming to be out there and to see and hear all those people cheering for us. I really enjoyed it,\" said Sotherton. \"Things have changed a bit for me since Athens. I got stopped in the Gap in Birmingham the other day by someone who wasn't sure if I was a medallist or not. A policeman stopped me too, and said 'well done'. I said, 'what for?', and then realised what he was on about.\" </p> <p>Several of those present yesterday would have no chance of walking down the street unrecognised. Kelly Holmes, the double-gold medallist at 800 and 1,500 metres, the victorious 4x100 metre squad, boxer Amir Khan and four-time gold winning rower Matthew Pinsent all drew roars from the crowd yesterday, no one more than Holmes. </p> <p>The past seven weeks have seen her life transformed. She has barely been able to leave her front door without someone holding a ticker-tape parade - 80,000 people turned out in her home town of Tonbridge - but she appears to be taking fame in her stride: \"It's been pretty manic since the games but I'm enjoying every moment,\" she said. \"I have always said I'll never change as a person but everyone else seems to have become hysterical, which is pretty funny.\" </p> <p>The reason the parade could not take place until yesterday is said to be because it was the first date that Holmes and Pinsent could both make. Pinsent, who declined to commit himself to an attempt on a fifth gold, was glad they waited. </p> <p>\"It is rare to get so many Olympians together in one place, and its fantastic to be together with the Paralympians too. I will never get tired of this sort of reception. It is fantastic to feel that the Olympics are cherished by people here and that they love their sport. We are too ready to kick people down in this country, so it's nice to feel some positive spirit.\" </p> <p>Khan, the poster boy of the Olympic team who was accompanied by his father, said the 2012 games could offer others the opportunity he had enjoyed. \"We'd have more sports centres and facilities being built, more chances for kids to come through and prove themselves. It would be fantastic.\" </p> <p>As the athletes made their way to Buckingham Palace for a reception with the Queen, and Trafalgar Square emptied as Tony Hadley belted out Spandau Ballet's hit Gold, it was impossible to find anyone who disagreed. </p> <p>\"We need the games to come here to cheer people up and give us a reason to be patriotic in a positive way,\" said Pauline Sollis from Borough in south London. \"I know people say it's going to cost us a lot, but we could do with a boost. Londoners are nice people, not hooligans.\"</p> <p><b>Just rewards: What they brought home</b></p> <p><b> Mark Lewis-Francis, Marlon Devonish, Darren Campbell, Jason Gardener</b> Gold, 4x100m relay </p> <p><b> Kelly Holmes</b> Gold, 1500m and 800m </p> <p><b> Bradley Wiggins </b> Gold, silver and bronze, cycling; Madison, men's individual pursuit, men's team pursuit </p> <p><b> Chris Hoy</b> Gold, cycling </p> <p><b> Leslie Law </b> Gold and silver, eventing </p> <p><b> Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell, Ed Coode, Steve Williams </b> Gold, coxless four, rowing </p> <p><b> Shirley Robertson, Sarah Webb, Sarah Ayton </b> Gold, sailing </p> <p><b> Ben Ainslie </b> Gold, sailing </p> <p><b> Gail Emms, Nathan Robertson</b> Silver, badminton, mixed doubles </p> <p><b> Amir Khan, right </b> Silver, boxing </p> <p><b> Campbell Walsh </b> Silver, canoeing, K1 kayak singles </p> <p><b> Rob Hayles </b> Silver and bronze, cycling </p> <p><b> Bryan Steel, Chris Newton, Steve Cummings, Paul Manning </b> Silver, cycling </p> <p><b> Leon Taylor, Peter Waterfield </b> Silver, diving, men's synchronised 10m </p> <p><b> Mary King </b> Silver, eventing </p> <p><b> Pippa Funnell</b> Silver and bronze, eventing </p> <p><b> William Fox-Pitt, Jeanette Brakewell </b> Silver, eventing </p> <p><b> Katherine Grainger, Cath Bishop </b> Silver, rowing </p> <p><b> Debbie Flood, Frances Houghton, Rebecca Romero, Alison Mowbray </b> Silver, rowing, women's quad sculls </p> <p><b> Joe Glanfield, Nick Rogers </b> Silver, sailing, men's 470 </p> <p><b> Alison Williamson </b> Bronze, archery </p> <p><b> Kelly Sotherton </b> Bronze, heptathlon </p> <p><b> Ian Wynne</b> Bronze, canoeing </p> <p><b> Helen Reeves </b> Bronze, canoeing </p> <p><b> Georgina Harland</b> Bronze, modern pentathlon </p> <p><b> Sarah Winckless, Elise Laverick</b> Bronze, rowing, women's double sculls </p> <p><b> Nick Dempsey </b> Bronze, sailing, men's Mistral </p> <p><b> Chris Draper, Simon Hiscocks </b> Bronze, sailing </p> <p><b> David Davies</b> Bronze, swimming, men's 1500m freestyle </p> <p><b> Stephen Parry</b> Bronze, swimming, men's 200m butterfly </p> <p>Paralympian gold medallists included: </p> <p><b> Anita Chapman, Kathy Smith and Margaret Parker </b> Archery </p> <p><b> John Cavanagh </b> Archery </p> <p><b> Ken Churchill</b> Javelin </p> <p><b> Tanni Grey Thompson</b> (2 golds) 100m and 400m </p> <p><b> Danny Crates </b> 800m </p> <p><b> Daniel Greaves</b> Discus </p> <p><b> Stephen Miller</b> Men's club throw </p> <p><b> Darren Kenny</b> (2) Cycling </p> <p><b> Aileen McGlynn, Ellen Hunter</b> Cycling </p> <p><b> Deborah Criddle</b> (3) Equestrian </p> <p><b> Lee Pearson</b> (2) Equestrian </p> <p><b> Nicola Tustain, Anne Dunham</b> Dressage </p> <p><b> Emma Brown</b> Powerlifting </p> <p><b> Isabel Newstead </b> Shooting </p> <p><b> Jim Anderson</b> (4) Swimming </p> <p><b> Maggi McEleny, Jane Stidever</b> Swimming </p> <p><b> Gareth Duke</b> Swimming </p> <p><b> David Roberts</b> (4) Swimming </p> <p><b> Sascha Kindred</b> (2) Swimming </p> <p><b> Natalie Jones </b> (2) Swimming </p> <p><b> Elaine Barrett </b> Swimming </p> <p><b> Nyree Lewis</b> (2) Swimming </p> <p><b> Andrew Lindsay</b> Swimming </p> <p><b> Matthew Walker, Graham Edmunds, Robert Welbourn</b> Swimming </p> <p><b> Peter Norfolk </b> Tennis</p>",
  "<p>Leslie Law will feel a bit less naked this morning. Though the 91 other competitors in the parade through London's streets yesterday to celebrate the success of Britain's Olympic and Paralympic teams in Athens were proudly wearing their medals, he had nothing round his neck. But last night he was finally awarded the gold medal he was due for winning the three-day event in Greece more than eight weeks ago. </p> <p>Law had originally won the silver and the British team the bronze. But the rider from Hereford was upgraded to gold and the team to silver after officials ruled that Germany's Bettina Hoy had gone through the starting gate twice during the showjumping. </p> <p>Law had sent his medals back to the International Olympic Committee. But his schedule since Athens had been so busy that it was not until the team's reception at Buckingham Palace, attended by the Queen, that he was able to formally receive his new medals, which were presented by the Princess Royal. </p> <p>\"It is the closest I have been to the gold medal since I saw it being presented to Bettina in Athens,\" said Law. \"I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time and what makes it so special is that the whole team were there.\" </p> <p>There was little time for Law to celebrate, however. Immediately after leaving the palace he jumped into his horsebox to drive through the night to a World Cup event in France. </p>",
  "<p>The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, has censured Channel 4 for failing to halt an outbreak of on-screen violence in the last series of Big Brother. </p> <p>In a decision that sets down a marker about the limits the regulator intends to place on so-called reality television, Ofcom said the broadcaster's apparent failure to intervene sooner had caused distress and offence to viewers. </p> <p>But it did not agree with the view of many complainants who thought the participants in the programme had been exploited, describing them as informed adults who \"know what they are letting themselves in for\". </p> <p>The fracas broke out after a drink-fuelled evening in which one evicted participant, Michelle, had been returned to the Big Brother \"house\" after watching what her fellow contestants had said about her. Another contestant, Emma, was later removed from the house; some viewers were concerned that none of the protagonists in the fight had been made to leave. </p> <p>The episode, in June, came to embody the criticism of commentators who feel that reality television is going too far, sacrificing the welfare of participants in favour of the commercial gain of high ratings. Many of those who complained to Ofcom were angry that Channel 4 had engineered a confrontational situation. </p> <p>Ofcom received 328 complaints from viewers - some about the live coverage on E4 but most about the highlights programme shown on Channel 4 the next day. </p> <p>Ofcom criticised Channel 4 for letting the fight, in which a table was overturned and the living area damaged, continue for 20 minutes before ordering security guards to intervene. </p> <p>The regulator also criticised Channel 4 for running text messages on screen during the fight when it was shown \"as live\" on E4, giving the impression that it viewed the scenes as entertainment. Some were encouraging of the fight. One said: \"This is quality. Lovin it.\" </p> <p>Ofcom agreed with viewers of the live coverage on E4 that Channel 4 had acted inappropriately. \"The apparent absence of intervention by Channel 4 to prevent the situation escalating to this point, having 'engineered' the situation originally, clearly caused distress and offence to viewers.\" </p> <p>Finding Channel 4 in breach of its programme code, Ofcom said viewers \"saw a potentially dangerous situation develop and had no way of predicting the outcome\". It added: \"This was frightening and concerning for some viewers, so much so that some called the police.\" </p> <p>But it said Channel 4 was not in breach of the Ofcom code in relation to the highlights show the following evening, which was preceded by an unambiguous warning and edited \"appropriately\". </p> <p>It also ruled that viewers could not complain on behalf of the contestants, and rejected suggestions they had been exploited. \"Considering the now well-known format of Big Brother, it is clear that participants know, to a greater or lesser degree, what they are letting themselves in for.\" </p> <p>In a statement, Channel 4 said the programme-makers had handled the incident well, and the situation was always under control. </p> <p>\"Although these were not comfortable scenes to watch, the producers decided that the events in the house should be relayed to viewers until the shouting had abated to reassure viewers that the outcome was not as bad as they might otherwise have imagined. Ofcom took a different view and we must accept their decision.\"</p>",

  "David Blunkett, home secretary, admitted levels of gun crime were \"unacceptable\" yesterday as he led MPs in condemning the drive-by shooting of 14-year-old Danielle Beccan. <p>He said there had been an \"exponential rise\" in gun possession since the mid-1990s, with it stablilising, but still not being acceptable, in the last three years. </p> <p>But he warned against pretending the situation was \"out of control\", since this would only play into the hands of young men who believed guns made them look \"trendy and invincible\". </p> <p>Speaking at the first Home Office questions since Danielle's death on October 9, Mr Blunkett, who will visit her home city next month to meet representatives of communities most affected, conveyed his \"condolences and heartfelt feeling\" to her family. \"All gun crime is a tragedy; the death of a child is a bigger tragedy than any other,\" he added. </p> <p>He said there were no statistics for the number of deaths caused by drive-by shootings in the past three years. But there had been a fall in the number of deaths from gun crime in the last three years following a \"rapidly rising curve\" in gun possesssion since the mid-1990s. </p> <p>Pressed by Labour backbencher Gordon Prentice on the five-year sentence for gun possession, he said this was \"a starting point not an end point in terms of getting a grip on gun crime.\"</p>",
  "<p>The airline pilots' union, Balpa, has shelved plans for a potentially acrimonious vote on formal recognition at Ryanair, opting instead to work towards the establishment of a unique trans-European staff association. </p> <p>Ryanair is notoriously hostile to unions - its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, recently dubbed Balpa the \"British Airways low-pay association\". </p> <p>Unions have attacked the airline's policy of refusing to pay trainee staff and forcing workers to foot the bill for uniforms and meals. In a ballot in October 2001, British pilots voted against formal recognition of Balpa by two to one. Balpa accused Mr O'Leary of unfairly putting pressure on staff to reject the proposal. </p> <p>Under employment law, Balpa has to wait three years before holding another ballot and was expected to make an attempt this autumn. Instead, Balpa said yesterday it was linking up with counterparts across Europe to create a \"united voice\", called the Ryanair European Pilots' Association. The union said the project was the first of its kind and could set an example of how unions organise in the future. </p> <p>Balpa's chairman, Mervyn Granshaw, said: \"We recently raised the issue of cross-border unions dealing with cross-border companies at the Trades Union Congress, as today's markets require more than the traditional response of sovereign trade unions.\" </p> <p>Ryanair argues that most of its employees prefer to negotiate individually with the firm. It says it pays its staff over the odds, with an average salary of \u20ac50,582 (\u00a335,125). This is well above BA's \u20ac37,000 or Aer Lingus's \u20ac38,000, but the figures are skewed by Ryanair's use of external contractors for poorly paid ground-handling. </p> <p>In a provocative memo to this year, a Ryanair manager at Stansted airport, Warwick Brady, told pilots they might as well join \"the Taliban, the Monster Raving Loonies or the Moonies\" as Balpa. He threatened that pay deals and share options could be frozen if pilots backed recognition. </p> <p>Ryanair claimed yesterday its staff were so well rewarded that it had more than 300 qualified pilots waiting for jobs.</p>",
  "<b> Will the proposed deployment of British troops affect their rules of engagement?</b> <p>No. The defence secretary was clear on this point yesterday. The British army's rules of engagement will still put greater emphasis on shooting only as a last resort - when lives of soldiers or Iraqis attacked by insurgents are thought to be at imminent risk. </p> <p>One British defence source said yesterday: \"We are more prepared to de-escalate more quickly, not to escalate\" </p> <p><b> Do these differences run deep?</b> </p> <p>Yes, say British commanders, who refer to \"cultural\" differences rooted in history and reflected in modern training. </p> <p>General Sir Mike Jackson, the head of the army, told MPs earlier this year: \"We must be able to fight with the Americans. That does not mean we must be able to fight as the Americans.\" </p> <p>Lord Guthrie, one of his predecessors, told the Guardian that the Americans talked as though \"peacekeeping is for wimps\". </p> <p>The British say they go more for \"hearts and minds\", patrolling streets on foot and talking to local leaders. The Americans, meanwhile, give priority to their own \"force protection\", rarely leaving their armoured vehicles </p> <p> <b> Will the proposed deployment of British troops put them in greater danger - and help to escalate the conflict?</b> </p> <p>There is a risk of more casualties, with British troops in a Sunni area, south of Baghdad, for the first time - and freeing up US troops to attack Falluja using tactics earlier criticised by British military commanders. </p> <p>This would be strategically significant - rendering false the distinction made by ministers between an operational and a political decision, in the view of British military chiefs </p> <p><b>What are the implications for the command structure?</b> </p> <p>British military sources play down the issue of more direct US command over British soldiers, saying that the commanding officer of the Black Watch, Lt Col James Cowan, could go over the heads of his US superiors in the event of a dispute, and appeal to British defence chiefs and, ultimately, Tony Blair </p> <p><b>Are there legal implications?</b> </p> <p>Potentially, in so far as there is a risk of escalating violence, which would lead to the deaths of more innocent Iraqis. The high court here has yet to rule on whether British troops in Iraq are bound by the European human rights convention </p> <p> <b>But haven't British troops already been involved in serious violent incidents in southern Iraq?</b> </p> <p>Yes, particularly around the town of Amara, north of Basra. In August they fired 30,000 rounds in 10 days, killing an unknown number of Iraqis. On one occasion, they called in a heavily-armed US Spectre gunship to attack Mahdi militia. </p> <p>In a \"war-fighting\" situation, British rules of engagement can be as robust as the American ones, a defence source said yesterday </p> <p><b>Are there potential long-term implications of the planned deployment?</b> </p> <p>Yes. The dispatch of the Black Watch would leave a gap in southern Iraq which would have to be filled by other soldiers now involved in training Iraqi forces. That training programme would be delayed, delaying in turn the homecoming of British troops</p>",
  "Near the start of Ken Loach's fine new movie Ae Fond Kiss there's a terrific moment when one of the main female characters explains why, as a Scottish Muslim sixth-former, she rejects the west's simplification of Islam. <p>\"I am a Glaswegian Pakistani teenage woman of Muslim descent,\" Tahara Khan tells her increasingly restless school assembly, \"who supports Glasgow Rangers in a Catholic school, 'cause I'm a mixture and I'm proud of it.\" The result is an uproar - though whether it's on account of her race, her religion or her Rangers shirt is hard to say. </p> <p>There's good case to be made that Loach is overdoing it a bit here. How many teenage Glaswegian Pakistani women actually go to Catholic schools and support Rangers? Rather few, one suspects. But that's not really the point. The film's larger statement is hard to deny. </p> <p>Nobody is defined by one characteristic or factor alone. That is not to say that these characteristics are not formative. Tahara in the film is very much a Pakistani. But she isn't just a Pakistani. She's also powerfully Glaswegian, but that fact does not say everything about her either. Her gender is an essential part of who she is as well, but again it's not the whole story. </p> <p>And although Loach may have created a character whose make-up stretches the limits, he is working here with a bigger truth. In the film complexity is simply a given, a fact of life. The particular complexity of Tahara's multiple identity may be especially dramatic, but it certainly isn't unrecognisable. Identity is always multiple, always complex, frequently conflicted and always changing: Tahara's, Loach's, yours, mine, the lot. </p> <p>My guess is that human beings have pretty much always been like this. Even the cavemen were not hunters all the time; to judge by the surviving evidence, some of them were at least as happy doing interior decoration. We may like to think that our world is unprecedentedly complicated and interrelated - and in certain respects that's true. But multiple identity wasn't invented in the 21st century. </p> <p>Modern party politics, however, is hopelessly ill at ease with complexity. Partly this is because parties are tribal. They also often encourage people to define themselves as one thing rather than another, even though most people are always a bit of both. They have an interest in encouraging people to adopt simpler identities than they really have - whether as workers, Protestants, Scots etc - and even as Labour, Tory or Lib Dem voters. </p> <p>But they are also unsettled by the pluralism that inevitably flows from complexity. Parties hate disagreement and argument because they think it makes them inefficient and that voters don't like it. But there is a paradox here. How are citizens, who know that life is complex and difficult, to take political parties seriously if they do not show that they understand these things too? </p> <p>The opinion polls have a similar flattening effect. The typical British political poll will subdivide people by gender, age, class and region. But, with the exception of gender (and even that's controversial for a few), these can often be very vague, mushy categories. They tell you some things that are true, such as that poor people are more likely to vote Labour, but they won't tell you whether anyone thinks voting Labour is important. </p> <p>In America, political polling is more elaborate. There is more about a person's educational qualifications, their earnings, their race and their religion. And US political parties are light years ahead of their British equivalents in amassing data about individual voters, enabling them to identify smaller groups to target - like the soccer moms of the 1990s, and the security moms of the current presidential campaign. </p> <p>This can sometimes produce a ludicrous and improbable level of bogus specificity, which is wittily captured in a recent New Yorker cartoon. It depicts representatives of supposedly undecided political blocs, including \"Pro-war gay oil men for separation of church and state\", \"Black Christian Howard Stern fans from Texas\" and \"Trust-funded organic-farming Enron-stock-holding gun enthusiasts.\" </p> <p>But at least the Americans try. Over here, though, there is only the most occasional sense that political life is alive to the sociological and cultural changes that shape the identities of modern British life. Terms like Mondeo man and Worcester woman make good headlines - and they at least hint at a more complex reality than the old categories - but our parties and our campaigners too often shut their eyes and their ears to the society they purport to represent. The results, in terms of disengagement, cynicism and mistrust, are too obvious to need repeating. </p> <p>Occasionally, there is an exception. For many years, motoring organisations have tried this approach, by appealing to people to think of themselves as drivers. Sitting in yet another traffic jam, it is indeed possible to see oneself this way. But what is sauce for the driver is also sauce for the shopper, the homeowner, the commuter and a host of other potential identities that all of us adopt at certain times. </p> <p>Yet unless politicians can adapt to complexity, they will continue to struggle to speak for people who lead complicated, stressed and often conflicted lives. The right place for politicians to start is by acknowledging complexity in the first place. When they acknowledge that problems exist and that solving them is difficult - on migration or pensions, for example - then at least they can connect. But when politicians pretend that the solution to a complex problem is simple - whether it is Iraq or street crime - then they have lost it. </p> <p>The need to understand the inevitability of complexity is not new. Four centuries ago, Michel de Montaigne got right to the heart of the matter in an essay entitled On the Inconstancy of Our Actions. Even the best writers, Montaigne observed, \"are wrong in stubbornly trying to weave us into one invariable and solid fabric\". </p> <p>\"Anyone who turns his prime attention on to himself will hardly ever find himself in the same state twice,\" Montaigne went on. \"I give my soul this face or that, depending upon which side I lay it down. I speak about myself in diverse ways: that is because I look at myself in diverse ways. </p> <p>\"Every sort of contradiction can be found in me, depending upon some twist or attribute: timid, insolent; chaste, lecherous; talkative, taciturn; tough, sickly; clever, dull; drooding, affable; lying, truthful; learned, ignorant; generous, miserly and then prodigal. </p> <p>\"I can see something of all that in myself, depending on how I gyrate; and anyone who studies himself attentively finds in himself and in this very judgment this whirring about and this discordancy. There is nothing I can say about myself as a whole, simply and completely, without intermingling and admixture.\" </p> <p>Tahara Khan could hardly have put it better. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.kettle@theguardian.com\">m.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>"
