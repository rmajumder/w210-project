  "<b> We're all going on a summer holiday!</b> Yes, Cherie, but Cliff's Barbados hideaway was last week. Now we're going somewhere else. <p><b>We are? Where's that then, Tony?</b> Why, to beautiful Chiantishire again! </p> <p><b>Crikey! We haven't been there since ...</b> Summer hols 2000! That's right, darling! </p> <p><b>Wow! How exciting! Remember the pool, Tony? The tennis courts, the 50 bedrooms ...</b> Of course, my dove. </p> <p><b>Oh, and there was that messy business with that funny little Robinson man in 1998 ...</b> Geoffrey, yes. Best not to worry your pretty head over the paymaster general, dear. Anyway, his villa was vastly inferior to Prince Girolamo Strozzi's. </p> <p><b>Ah, Prince Strozzi! And his lovely wife Irina! Wasn't it kind of them to lend us their beautiful palace at such short notice?</b> Very kind, dear. </p> <p><b>Because we had to get out of Geoffrey's quick smart after all that financial hoo-ha, didn't we?</b> Ahem yes, let's try to forget about that. </p> <p><b>Was it Prince Strozzi who sang Bachelor Boy?</b> No dear, you're confusing him with Cliff. Prince Strozzi teaches law at Florence University. </p> <p><b>Oh yes. Remember the lovely views over the cypresses and the sunflowers? You could see all the way to San Jimmy, couldn't you?</b> San Gimignano, darling. Only the expats call it San Jimmy. Charming medieval town. Lots of towers. Lovely. </p> <p><b>And what was his wine called?</b> I believe it was known as Vernaccia. </p> <p><b>Ooh, it was lovely! </b> Volpini, the Prince's chief wine expert, described it as a vigorous straw-coloured wine that is \"dry, soft and harmonious, with solid body and excellent length on the palate\". </p> <p><b>It was so romantic, wasn't it? In fact, wasn't it Prince Strozzi's where Leo was conceived? Do you think we'll be hearing the pitter-patter of tiny Blairite feet again, dear?</b> Well, I have just reinstated Mandelson.</p>",

  "A senator in Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party caused outrage across the political spectrum yesterday by proposing a law limiting free abortions to one per woman, after which they would be charged. <p>Under Antonio Gentile's law, after their first free abortion on the state health service, financially comfortable women would have to foot part and then all of the bill, varying from \u20ac2,000 to \u20ac3,000 (\u00a31,400-\u00a32,000). </p> <p>Mr Gentile, who has the support of about 20 senators of Forza Italia and its post-fascist coalition ally Alleanza Nazionale, said the proposal was to discourage multiple abortions on the health service and encourage contraception. He told La Repubblica newspaper that young Italians \"do not appreciate the value of contraception\". He plans to present the law to parliament in September. </p> <p>\"If the government accepts the proposal, the health minister will be able to send out a circular to the regions so they apply the new rules,\" Mr Gentile told the newspaper La Repubblica. </p> <p>The proposal has angered politicians from other parties and women's rights advocates barely a week after the Vatican reiterated the Catholic church's stance that a woman's mission is to stay at home and breed. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately we are inundated with Catholic fundamentalists,\" said one Forza Italia deputy, who disapproves of the proposal. </p> <p>The MEP Emma Bonino, formerly the European commissioner for humanitarian affairs, told the Guardian: \"More and more, we Italians are not European citizens, we are Vatican citizens. Every day we wake up and find there is something new designed to take away women's right to choose.\" </p> <p>She said Italy was the only country in Europe where the abortion pill was not on sale, where the morning after pill was not available over the counter and where there are proposals to give chemists the right to refuse to sell morning after pills. </p> <p>Many saw the proposal by the senator, who has in the past proposed that Mr Berlusconi be awarded the Nobel Peace prize, as an attempt to encourage women to have more children. </p> <p>Italy's birth rate last year was the lowest in Europe at 9.18 births/1,000 compared to the UK's 10.99/1,000, and the European average of 10.43/ 1,000. </p> <p>Italy's birth rate has been low for several years with women choosing to focus on careers, and couples gradually reaching a certain financial threshold before starting a family. </p> <p>To encourage Italians to have more children quickly, the government offered a \u20ac1,000 \"baby bonus\" last year for every second child born by the end of the year. </p> <p>But the government has clamped down on access to IVF treatment, dashing the hopes of many couples that science might help them have children. </p> <p>The law, which aims to give embryos equal rights with women, is seen as a victory for hardline Catholics across the political spectrum who voted for it in February. </p> <p>It restricts IVF treatment to \"stable\" couples and bans sperm donation and surrogate motherhood. </p> <p>Embryos cannot be frozen or used for research and women must have three embryos implanted at once, raising the risk of younger women carrying triplets and reducing the chances of the treatment helping older women to conceive. </p> <p>Left-wing groups are racing to collect half a million signatures needed by September 30 to force a referendum to soften or abolish the IVF law. Women's groups warned that such a law could force women to revert to illegal abortion, which they have not had to do since it became legal in Italy in 1978. </p> <p>Government figures do not suggest that abortion is a significant factor contributing to Italy's low birth rate. </p> <p>In 2002, the number of abortions recorded was 130,690, around half the peak of 235,000 reached in 1982.</p>",
  "A planning loophole that \"so blatantly favours the rich that until last week it was believed inevitable that a Labour government would abolish it\" angered <b> Ross Clark </b> in the Sunday Telegraph. The rule in question only allows new houses to be built on untouched countryside if they are of sufficient architectural merit. \"While the wealthy are granted the right to realise their architectural dreams, home-owners like me will remain under the control of the increasingly bolshy heritage police,\" said Clark. \"If we want to live in a new house it will have to be ... built by the house-building giants on the verge of some ring road.\" <p> <b> Nick Cohen </b> in the Observer questioned whether another privileged set should get special treatment. Leading accountants \"want a cap on the damages their firms can be required to pay for negligence or fraud. If they don't get it, they warn that one of their number could go bust.\" Cohen welcomed rumours that Gordon Brown was ready to stand up to the firms: \"The Labour party wasn't founded to create a Milton Friedman world of socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor,\" he said. </p> <p> <b> Melanie McDonagh </b> looked at attitudes to women at work in her Sunday Times column. Last week, the president of the Royal College of Physicians claimed that, now 60% of new doctors are female, the medical profession was over-feminised and risked lower levels of pay. Were the kinds of jobs women opt for \"low-status inherently\" or \"low-status because women opt for them?\" McDonagh asked. </p> <p>\"If women choose to relieve pain [through specialisms such palliative medicine and geriatrics] rather than get enormous salaries as telly-friendly cardiac surgeons, they've got their priorities right,\" she argued. \"The fault is not in their life choices. It's in our sense of what's important.\" </p> <p>While many hailed transsexual Nadia Almada's Big Brother victory as a sign of how liberal British attitudes have become, <b> Suzanne Moore </b> provided a voice of dissent in the Mail on Sunday. \"I find her story rather sad,\" Moore declared. \"I don't see how sex changes represent any kind of liberation,\" she continued. \"Rather, they are about a desperate need to conform to gender stereotypes.\"</p>",
  "After five years in power, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez could be forced to step down when Venezuelans vote in a referendum on his presidency this Sunday. <p><b> What are the implications? </b> Venezuela will have a chance, maybe its last, to esolve years of political turmoil by peaceful and democratic means ... If [the vote] is fairly held and Mr Ch\u00e1vez wins, an opposition that in the past has supported a military coup and a general strike in an attempt to force the president from office will be obliged to accept his rule for two and a half more years. If he loses, Mr Ch\u00e1vez - a self-styled revolutionary who once led a military rebellion against a democratic government - will be removed, and new elections for president will be held.<br><b>From the Washington Post, July 30 </b></p> <p><b> How did the referendum come about?</b> Venezuela's opposition ... won the right to hold a referendum to remove Mr Ch\u00e1vez, the populist president, from power. It gathered 2.56m signatures to force a recall vote ... Mr Ch\u00e1vez promised to abide by any decision made by the election council ... Should [he] fail to gain 50% of the vote he will have to step down and fresh presidential elections will be called. The polarisation in Venezuela pitches the charismatic Mr Ch\u00e1vez, supported by the nation's poor, against the middle and upper classes who fear the president is leading them into the creation of another Cuba. He has made no secret of his admiration for Fidel Castro, Cuba's dictator.<br><b>Jeremy McDermott in the Daily Telegraph, June 4 </b> </p> <p><b> What do the polls say?</b> </p> <p>Venezuela's poor are worse off in almost every measurable respect. Yet millions of them are likely to vote for him ... Their support could save him: the latest polls suggest he might narrowly win the referendum. The recall campaign by the opposition Democratic Coordinator coalition ... needs at least 3.8m votes to revoke the president's mandate, but lacks both a message and a leader. Mr Ch\u00e1vez, on the other hand, is counting on a trump card: the \"missions\" ... In focusing on education and health, Mr Ch\u00e1vez has correctly identified some of the sources of Venezuela's big inequalities.<br><b>From the Economist, July 10 </b></p> <p><b> How are relations between Venezuela and the US?</b> </p> <p>Mr Chavez [has] said he hoped ties between his country and its biggest oil client, the US, would improve dramatically if Democrat John Kerry won the US presidential election in November ... Left-winger Chavez ... has accused George Bush of backing opposition efforts to overthrow him. The Bush administration denies the charge but has strongly supported the Venezuelan referendum process. <br><b>From the Washington Post, August 7</b> </p> <p><b> How is Mr Chavez perceived in Venezuela? </b> According to surveys, Mr Chavez's image improved as he increased his control over the oil industry and the armed forces ... [But] internationally trapped, surprised by a recall that he thought was aborted and facing an evident unease in the armed forces, Mr Ch\u00e1vez [has] now resorted to nationalism ... The man who spent the past five years dividing the country is now unable to reunite it. <br><b>Roberto Guisti in El Universal, Venezuela, July 31 </b></p> <p><b> What would Mr Chavez do if he lost? </b> [He] said that if his opponents won, he would run in the presidential elections a month later. Electoral authorities ruled [in June] that Mr Chavez could stand again in 2006, but did not say if he could do so immediately after the recall vote. If Mr Chavez is defeated, an election will be held within 30 days.<br><b>From BBC News online, July 9 </b></p> <p><b> Would there be a violent reaction? </b> Despite a peaceful recall campaign, Venezuela's political rivals have rioted in the past to protest decisions by elections officials they deemed unacceptable. Memories linger of a brief 2002 coup, in which dozens were killed. Riots erupted in February when the elections council ruled that Chavez's foes lacked enough voter signatures to force the recall. At least seven people were killed and scores were wounded in the unrest. On June 3, when the elections council announced that Mr Chavez would face a recall, violence gripped parts of downtown Caracas ... At least 6,000 troops will be dispatched for the vote. <br><b>Christopher Toothaker, Associated Press, August 6 </b></p>",
  "South Africa will today begin culling some 30,000 ostriches to control an outbreak of avian flu in the Eastern Cape. <p>Police and soldiers have set up roadblocks in a 20-mile radius around Middleton in the Somerset East area, to prevent exposed birds being transported around the country. </p> <p>The outbreak has killed 1,500 ostriches on two large ranches in the Eastern Cape. </p> <p>Officials have ordered the extermination of all potentially exposed birds to prevent the virus from spreading and harming the ostrich industry, which is worth some \u00a3108m a year. They have also halted exports of all poultry products until the outbreak is over. </p> <p>Hong Kong and Singapore announced bans on all South African poultry products. </p> <p>South Africa's ostrich business has been hit by the flu H5N2, which is different from the H5N1 strain that killed 24 people and millions of chickens when it swept through Asia earlier this year. </p> <p>\"The virus is dangerous for poultry, not for humans,\" said an agriculture department spokesman. </p> <p>He said the cause of the outbreak is being investigated and affected farmers would be compensated. </p> <p>South Africa's ostrich farming industry has grown rapidly in recent years because the large bird's meat is very low in fat popular with dieters and is exported across the world. </p> <p>Chefs are less impressed. They say the bird meat is relatively tasteless and advise marinating it before cooking.</p>",
  "<p>A Channel Islands airline which takes thousands of passengers to Guernsey and Jersey every summer has been chastised by the safety regulator for its \"inappropriate\" management arrangements. </p> <p>Aurigny, which is owned by the government of Guernsey and expects to carry 550,000 people this year, was reprimanded over its handling of an incident last November in which one of its planes ran into trouble over the Channel. </p> <p>The aircraft began to lose power en route to Stansted after becoming covered with ice. The first officer tried to reduce altitude but struggled to retain control as the plane pitched and rolled. </p> <p>According to an inquiry by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, staff later failed to report the incident, did not collect \"black box\" evidence and only looked over the plane before allowing it to fly again. </p> <p>The report criticised \"the continued use of an aircraft with a serviceability status not confirmed by an appropriate engineering inspection\". </p> <p>It said Aurigny allowed a data recording box in the cockpit to be overwritten, in breach of air navigation regulations, and because the flight was at a weekend, senior management were not informed for 48 hours. The AAIB said Aurigny had inadequate procedures for responding to technical incidents. There was \"no formal management contact procedure\" and no \"duty manager\". </p> <p>Founded in 1968, Aurigny has nearly 300 staff and a fleet of 15 aircraft. It flies from Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney to mainland airports. </p> <p>The airline was \"renationalised\" by Guernsey's government last year for \u00a36m. The buyout, intended to safeguard links to the mainland, was attacked as unfair state aid by rivals such as FlyBe, which pointed out that it would have been illegal if Guernsey was part of the European Union. </p> <p>In a statement, Aurigny said it had \"reviewed and reinforced\" its procedures since the incident, acknowledging that staff ought to have kept the flight's black box recorder.</p>",
  "While the world focuses on the war against terror, the war against poverty slides on to the backburner. Since the bombing of the World Trade Centre in 2001, three developments have become decisive on a global scale. The first is the fight to root out militants, the second is the political rise of those on the religious margins and the third is the growing gap between the rich and the poor. <p>Pakistan is a frontline state in the war against terrorism. Most of the leading terrorists have been arrested in Pakistan. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, once described as the CEO of al-Qaida, was arrested in Rawalpindi. Other important leaders continue to be caught in dribs and drabs every six months, including Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian, who was arrested in the Pakistani city of Gujrat last month. </p> <p>This is good and bad news for Islamabad's military ruler. The positive part is that General Pervez Musharraf gets to play good cop and earn Washington's pleasure to continue his dictatorship. The bad part is that eyebrows are raised as to why leading al-Qaida militants found it necessary to hide in a land run by Washington's \"key ally\" in the war against terror. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Pakistan, assassinations and suicide bombings have also been increasing domestically. Scores of Pakistanis and many foreigners have been killed. Many political leaders have been gunned down in the streets - from Rawalpindi in the north to Karachi in the south. </p> <p>None of the assassins has been arrested. Instead, public attention has been focused on five apparent assassination attempts against high-profile targets that have taken place since last December: two attacks on Gen Musharraf, and one each on the Karachi corps commander, the prime minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz, and the Baluchistan chief minister. </p> <p>While the regime insists these were genuine assassination attempts, their pattern suggests something different. At most, they seem to have been attempts to frighten the targets. At worst, if the cynics are to be believed, the attacks were stage-managed for external consumption. </p> <p>For example, in each case, the bombers used low intensity explosives. None of the people hurt or killed was of political value - though they were, of course, of personal and national value. These included innocent people escorting the apparent targets. The main targets escaped without a scratch. While it is welcome that they survived, the larger issue needs resolving. </p> <p>The drivers in the corps commander's and prime minister-designate's cars were killed, but the other passengers escaped unscathed. It is difficult to believe that bombers would repeatedly use low-intensity explosives so that only one occupant of the car being attacked - or a person outside the car - would die. A public commission into these attacks is needed. </p> <p>The second crucial development since September 11 2001 has been the rise of religious extremists. There appear to be groups in both the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds who believe that a clash of civilisations is needed for religious reasons. The Christian fundamentalists believe that Christ will be resurrected once the people of the Jewish faith are resettled on the banks of the Euphrates. The Muslim extremists believe that the Mahdi will arrive when the battle between Muslims and non-Muslims intensifies. </p> <p>This political scenario is threatening to undo the entire global social fabric built since the end of the second world war - one based on the tolerance between different faiths, races, genders and cultures. A clash of civilisations can lead to Armageddon, where there will be no winners on earth. But perhaps the religious extremists are not searching for winners on earth. </p> <p>The challenge for the world community is to emphasise values of tolerance, moderation and inter-faith understanding, on which rest the pillars of a less violent world. However, the bombing of the World Trade Centre and the events in Iraq have made that more difficult. The former led to suspicion against Muslims and a loss of civil liberties; the latter to a counter-suspicion from Muslims as to the real purposes of the war. The inability to find weapons of mass destruction and the Abu Ghraib abuses undermined the reasons given for the Iraq war. </p> <p>While global attention is focused on terrorism, the crisis of poverty is effectively disregarded. Today, big business seems to be in the driving seat. One recent report found that while 20 years ago CEOs made an average of 40 times more than factory workers, last year it was 400 times more, and is now climbing to a multiple of 500. </p> <p>This staggering rise in the fortunes of those on top, while those below suffer, is a festering sore that has the potential to erupt. The recent Indian elections showed that a stock-market economy alone could not make India shine. The Indian electorate went against all predictions, as peasants, labourers and the middle classes voted for change. Similarly, in Pakistan the talk of stock market rises and foreign exchange increases hides a more troubling picture. This is one of increasing poverty, hunger, misery and frustration. The numbers of young people killing themselves because of hunger was 1,200 in six months. These are the officially recorded figures - the real figures are believed to be much higher. </p> <p>In Pakistan, the average income has been shrinking. The cost of living is rising sharply. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the ordinary citizen to pay fat utility bills and buy the basic necessities of life. The Pakistan Economic Survey admits that poverty has increased since democracy was derailed in 1996. The gap between the rich and the poor is growing at an alarming rate. The war against terrorism is primarily perceived as a war based on the use of force. However, economics has its own force, as does the desperation of families who cannot feed themselves. A more stable world depends on the ability to use force when necessary - and to seek political solutions when possible. After all, force is the prelude to achieving a more favourable negotiating position in a political settlement. </p> <p>Militancy and greed cannot become the defining images of a new century that began with much hope. As the body count rises in Iraq, as a leading NGO pulls out of Afghanistan and as a suicide attack takes place against Pakistan's prime minister designate, the time has come to rethink. By returning to the values of democracy, the will of the people, broad-based government and building institutions that can respond to the people, the social malaise can be addressed. </p> <p>The neglect of rising poverty against the background of religious extremism can only complicate an already difficult world situation. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Benazir Bhutto is chairperson of the Pakistan People's party and a former prime minister of Pakistan </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:bashirriaz@aol.com\">bashirriaz@aol.com</a></p>",

You will, however, have to organise visas, accommodation and tickets, which often drives people to use the UK's excellent trans-Siberian tour firms.</p> <p>Train tickets are the main problem. If you pitch up at Yaroslavl station in Moscow you can buy tickets to any destination. The second-class Moscow to Beijing fare starts at around \u00a3120.</p> <p>But it isn't possible to purchase a hop-on, hop-off ticket for any of the trans-Siberian routes, so you must get tickets as you go along.

Is it possible to find cheap, hostel-type accommodation on the Caribbean islands, and have you any advice on obtaining cheap air or sea travel between islands?<br><strong>Paul Griffiths, north London</strong></p> <p>The Caribbean is a big region, and the options vary from island to island. Generally, it is not a budget travel destination, and where cheap accommodation exists it is in guest houses rather than backpacker hostels, and normally in towns rather than idyllic beach areas. The places are clean and functional, but don't expect any resort-type frills. </p> <p>Barbados, Trinidad, Dominica and St Lucia are all good places to find guest houses, which charge under \u00a320 a night. Check the official tourist websites for these islands for details. </p> <p>Getting around will also be more costly than you'll have been used to. There are some reasonably priced inter-island ferries, mostly in the Grenadines and around the French islands. </p> <p>Air travel between the islands can be expensive, but there are some good deals around including passes with the main regional airline <a href=\"http://www.fly-liat.com\">LIAT</a> which can take you around a few islands for as little as \u00a3125. </p> <p><strong>US waiver muddle</strong></p> <p> My husband and I flew to Atlanta via Detroit with the US airline Northwest.

This may delay our entry next time we go to visit our son in Atlanta. Can we surrender the waivers in the UK?<br><strong>Jenny Hydes, Louth</strong></p> <p>If you still have the waiver, you are likely to show up on the official system next time as having overstayed a visa. </p> <p>The US Embassy in London, which has a visa line on 09055 444546, advises you to assemble a copy of the visa form, the biographical data page of your passport, your boarding pass for the return flight home if you still have it and evidence that you have lived in the UK since your last visit. Send these to ACS-USCIS, SBU, PO Box 7125, London, KY 40742-7125, USA.

  "<p>Cheapside's resident publican, Sidney, is revolting. He was pulled in to see a junior government minister, one Hazel Blears to discuss the national disgrace that is binge drinking. </p> <p>Along with fellow pint-pullers from the British Beer and Pub Association and the British Hospitality Association, Sid had his knuckles rapped. Tony is sick of the sight of bevvied-up youngsters fighting or falling over in town centres, and Blears has been deputised to discourage promotional activity. </p> <p>As if this were not bad enough, Sid says that the supermarkets were invited to the rebalancing session but did not turn up. Blears plans another special meeting for them. Why the no-show? we asked their representatives at the British Retail Consortium. 'Probably because they have made their case already,' explodes a spokesman. 'If the on-trade thinks it can wangle a restraint on our trade, then it can think again. Binge drinking is nothing to do with us. If you buy three bottles of wine in a pub, you'll drink them in one evening. If you buy them in a supermarket, you tend not to.' What about all those cheap beer deals, then? 'There are no votes in any government telling consumers it will stop supermarkets selling cheap lager.' Goodness. Check, mate. </p> <p><strong>Breadmaker</strong></p> <p>Jonathan Bloomer, head of Prudential, was not the most popular man in the City last week after he announced that the company was abandoning the sale of internet bank Egg.

Everyone was quick to point out the luckless Bloomer's previous howlers, but have they forgotten his triumphs? The biggest was collecting a break fee of over \u00a3600 million when the Pru was forced to abandon an agreed bid for American General in 2001 after the target received a higher bid from AIG. It was the biggest ever such fee paid to a British company - bloomin' clever, one might be forced to say. </p> <p><strong>Cold war</strong></p> <p>It has been a long time coming, but a neo-con nemesis has emerged in the United States to confront Unilever-owned hippy ice cream makers Ben &amp; Jerry's.

  "<p>I learnt to dive 15 years ago, over almost six months of successive Thursday evenings, in a swimming pool in Swiss Cottage. My friend Jaimie learned to dive a few weeks ago, in just four days, on the island of Alphonse, in the Seychelles. While I was learning the vital skills of buddy breathing and buoyancy control back in 1989, the most diverting visual attractions on offer - my foretaste of great ocean adventures to come - were discarded corn plasters, matted balls of hair, and the grey-blue lines on the floor of the pool. In contrast, by the end of his second lesson in the Alphonse lagoon, Jaimie had a shoal of admiring parrot fish all to himself, and was on nodding terms with the local turtle. </p> <p>My first open-water dive took place in a cold muddy quarry in Leicestershire, euphemistically called Stoney Cove, and the only fish I saw were a pair of gawping roach. Jaimie's first open-water dive was in the crystal waters of the stunning coral reef that surrounds the island, and within seconds of descending to the bottom, through small galaxies of shimmering reef fish, he found himself looking at a 10-ft nurse shark. I was with him at the time, and the experience of watching Jaimie watching the shark watching him actually made me laugh underwater. This was partly in sheer disbelief at the absurd contrast in our learning experiences, and the folly of my plodding progress all those years ago. But it was mainly because I knew that, despite the privilege of such an encounter on a first dive, the last thing Jaimie wanted to be looking at was a shark of any kind. </p> <p>His fear of sharks is matched only by his fear of spiders (which, incidentally, is matched only by my fear of spiders). Although our dive guide, Norbert, had mentioned the possibility that we would see a shark, Jaimie had assumed he was joking. In fact, he told me afterwards that his first thought on seeing the shark, which was lying motionless in a sandy gully on the reef, was that it was a plastic one placed by the dive team as an elaborate practical joke. But when he noticed how the gills of the fish were rippling, and how its unmistakably sharky tail tilted occasionally to steady itself in the current, his fantasy rationalisation rapidly began to fade. </p> <p>Despite my amusement, I felt obliged to do something to allay his fears. I had seen a few nurse sharks before, and I happened to know that, of all the sharks, they are the least likely to give divers any kind of grief. They are passive bottom feeders, who tend to lie up and sleep during the day, and swim lazily over the reef at night, munching the odd crab. They are the teddy bears of the shark world, in fact. In order to make this point, I swam towards the shark, with my hand stretched out towards its head, and made what I intended as gentle stroking motions a couple of feet away. At the same time, I looked over towards Jaimie and, with my non-stroking hand, made the thumb and finger circle that is the underwater signal for 'everything's OK'. </p> <p>Jaimie's response was to invent an entirely new signal in the sub-aqua lexicon. It involved waving the extended index finger of his right hand vigorously from side to side, while shaking his head, and the meaning was clear: 'Listen, don't muck about. I can see that is a totally shark-shaped fish, so can we please swim rapidly in the opposite direction, now!' </p> <p>Back on dry land, Jaimie reminded me that a principal objective of our week on Alphonse was that we should be eating the local fish, and not the other way round. In order to reassert our rightful place in the tropical food chain, we decided to take a day off from diving, and charter the island's serious fish-hunting boat, Bijoutier, in pursuit of a Seychellois fish supper. One of the finest eating fish in the Indian ocean - and therefore probably the world - is the yellowtail tuna. In theory we were a couple of weeks too early to hook up with the seasonal run of yellowtail, but the odd fish had already been picked up before our arrival, so there was a faint hope of striking lucky. On the strength of that, I packed in my fishing box a tube of wasabi, a bottle of Kikkoman soy sauce, some pickled ginger, and a Tupperware box of vinegar rice. As an afterthought, I hacked down a large, banana leaf from the tree outside our bungalow, rolled it up, and stashed it in my rod case. </p> <p>Jaimie took this level of preparation to be a cast-iron guarantee that the yellowtail, and indeed every other sushi-grade pelagic we might have hoped to encounter, would elude us for the entire day. And, for a while, it seemed like he might be right, but then 'Toooo-naah!' yelled Jude, our Seychellois fishing guide - jabbing his finger out to sea. A few hundred metres from the boat, there was a commotion in the water, all white splashes and sliver flashes. 'That's yellowtail,' said our skipper, Vaughan, calmly turning the boat towards the action. </p> <p>I was having a private Attenborough moment at this fishy feeding frenzy, when I heard the pulse-quickening 'ZZZzzeeee!' of a reel gleefully pouring out line to a running fish. I grabbed the twitching rod and yanked on it. The fish yanked back, almost wresting the rod from my arms, and Jude helped me guide the rod butt into the 'stand-up' rig, a pivoting, swivelling rod holder designed to take some of the heat out of playing fast-running fish. </p> <p>Mine wasn't quite the monster I'd first reckoned it and, after a few short surges it began, grudgingly, to come to the boat. Still, it was enough to make my arms ache. And it was a relief when Jude swung the steel-hooked gaffing pole over the side, and hauled on board a solid, quivering muscle of a fish. It was a yellowtail of about 15 kilos. 'A baby,' said Vaughan, mildly mocking my efforts. A few minutes later, it was Jaimie's turn to grunt, sweat and strain, and try to look nonchalantly tough. He made a showy job of it, I thought, but the full display was entirely justified when, after a struggle of a good 15 minutes, a second yellowtail, well over twice the size of mine, was hauled on board. 'How about lunch,' he asked, coolly. I was more than ready to oblige. </p> <p>I laid out the banana leaf on the deck, and the over-optimistic eccentricity of my first-response sushi kit immediately came into its own. I only had my chunky diving knife to carve the fish with, but it was razor sharp, and did the job better than I expected. Individually moulded fingers of sushi rice seemed too formal, so I spread the rice in a thick layer over the banana leaf, and laid generous slices of tuna over it. I dabbed on little piles of wasabi and pickled ginger around the rice and between the fish. My sushi bar was open for business. </p> <p>My God, it was good. The fish had an irresistible resistance, and a fullness to it, that I have never encountered in restaurant sushi - whose tuna, even when of the highest quality, has invariably been frozen. Alphonse is without doubt the ultimate Indian Ocean destination for diving and fishing, and for those who like to combine the two it is sheer heaven. What made it extra special was that, for a few brief moments at least, it also became the sushi capital of the world.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Hugh travelled with Sunset Faraway Holidays.

The important thing is to start with a good, rich fish stock. The best thing is therefore to fillet any fish you are going to put in the curry, and use all the heads and skeletons to make the stock. </p> <p>For an Anglicised version of this curry, use firm-fleshed fish with a good bony head such as black bream, grey mullet and gurnard, to help make the stock rich. Once you've got the stock-based curry sauce sorted, you can add all sorts of seafood at the end - including lobster, large prawns, squid and scallops. Chunks of fresh mackerel, as the Seychellois bonito, are also a worthwhile addition. </p> <p><strong> To feed 6</strong> </p> <p><br> about 2 kilos of mixed fish, scaled and gutted </p> <p> 500g prepared scallops, or cleaned squid, or pre-cooked octopus, or a mixture </p> <p> stock veg and herbs: onions, carrots, celery, fennel, parsley, dill, bay leaves, garlic... </p> <p> 2-4 tbs curry paste or powder </p> <p> 1 large tin creamed coconut </p> <p> 500g potatoes, peeled </p> <p> a couple of fresh limes </p> <p> fresh coriander leaves </p> <p> salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper </p> <p>Take the fish and slice the fillets off them with a very sharp knife. Place the heads and chopped up skeletons in a pan with whatever stock vegetables and fishy herbs you can muster - bay leaves, a few crushed garlic cloves, a nugget of ginger root if you like, peppercorns - cover with water and simmer for half an hour. Leave to cool with all the bits in, then strain. </p> <p>Finely chop a large onion and fry gently in a large pan in a little oil. Add your favourite blend of curry powder or paste (I bought the local blend from the Mah\u00e9 market back with me) in a quantity that reflects the amount of heat you like - say a couple of good tablespoons if it's a mild blend. Fry for a further few minutes, then add about a litre of the fish stock, and a whole tin of creamed coconut, and a good teaspoon of salt. Add the potatoes, peeled and cut into forkable chunks. Bring the sauce to the boil and simmer gently for 20-30 minutes until the potatoes begin to break up and thicken the sauce a little. Taste, adjust the seasoning, including the heat level, using cayenne pepper. </p> <p>Slice any larger fish fillets into thick strips or suitable chunks, and add to the gently simmering sauce (along with the scallops, squid or octopus, and any other fresh seafood you want to include). Cook for just 4-6 more minutes, so the fish is just cooked through. Serve at once, in bowls rather than plates, as this is practically a soup. If you like you can sprinkle over fresh chopped coriander, and squeeze over a little fresh lime. Serve with plain boiled rice.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 15 2004</strong></p> <p> Readers tempted to follow advice given in the article below to move their washing machine from kitchen to bathroom should contact the manufacturer to ensure that the appliance is suitable for bathroom installation.

Contact the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) for further advice or visit <a href=\"http://www.eca.co.uk\">Eca.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>  </p> <p>On the day of Jenny Morris's visit, our kitchen is inexplicably filled with flies. I say inexplicably, but as Jenny - the doyenne of food safety and hygiene - is about to tell me, no unwelcome visitor to the domestic kitchen is there without an invitation from a slapdash cook. It's the hottest day of the year and the back door and windows are wide open. Something must be luring the flies in. 'That bin is the problem,' Jenny observes in her matronly, Margaret Thatcher way, inspecting the US-style trash can (Jerry's Home Store, circa 1995) with its letterbox lid hanging limply open and a disposable nappy clearly poking out the top. 'It's not just that the spring is broken, but you have to touch it every time you throw anything away. Your hands pick up bacteria and transfer them to food, which is why you should wash them regularly. A pedal bin is better, even if it's less fashionable.' </p> <p>I can see where things are heading. Here I am, confidently inviting an environmental health officer (EHO) to watch me cook, secure in the belief that our kitchen is pristine and my culinary habits impeccable - and already I have failed. 'What shall I do about the flies?' I ask flatly, expecting Jenny to recommend Vapona fly-paper strips or a repellent device - but her solution is low-tech. 'Give all kitchen surfaces a good wash down before you start,' she says, 'using hot soapy water. That should be done every time, regardless of the weather. After that, don't leave out any food on which flies are likely to settle; if you do, cover it.' </p> <p>It's a sobering thought, that no meal should be prepared without scrubbing up like a surgeon and scrubbing down like a deckhand - but that is the reality of cooking in a British summer. July and August are peak months for cases of infectious intestinal disease (IID), characterised by diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and passed from person to person. The condition accounts for 10.5 million cases a year and costs the country \u00a3750 million in healthcare bills and lost working days. Of these cases, perhaps 2.4 million are directly caused by food poisoning and, in particular, fly-borne bacteria. Feeding alternately on filth (notably faeces) and sweet foods (such as sugar and milk), houseflies regurgitate their first meal on their second, trample it to a slurry with their feet and siphon it up, leaving behind bacteria trapped among their leg hairs. 'You never know where flies have been,' says Jenny, 'so you don't want to take any risks.' </p> <p>Nor is it just insects that are at their most active in the warmer months. Thanks to inept barbecuing (which leaves bacteria alive in undercooked meat), mass outdoor catering (which spreads infection), poor personal hygiene, defective refrigerators and rapidly deteriorating food, the bacteria associated with poor animal husbandry also have a field day. Farm animals harbour organisms in their gut which are spread to the outside of meat at the time of slaughter; eggs and milk can also be tainted by the disease and fecundity of the farmyard. In August, cases of salmonellosis (caused by the salmonella bacterium) increase fourfold compared with January, while campylobacteriosis (from the campylobacter bug associated with poultry) doubles. Though both organisms can be killed by thorough cooking at high temperatures, they can be transferred to foods such as salad which will not be cooked - typically when the juices from raw meat and poultry drip onto the shelf below in the fridge. This is cross-contamination. </p> <p>So significant is the problem that the Food Standards Agency has set itself the target of achieving a 20 per cent reduction in food-poisoning cases by 2006, focusing its campaign on five micro-organisms that are rampant during the summer months: salmonella, campylobacter and clostridium perfringens (responsible for the largest number of cases) and listeria and E.coli 0157 (which causes more severe illness in fewer people). In June, the Food and Drink Federation - assisted by the FSA and others - ran a National Food Safety Week highlighting how bacteria are spread. 'Are You A Chicken Splasher?' its campaign literature asked, referring to a finding that 81 per cent of Britons rinse poultry under the kitchen tap before cooking it, splattering bacteria over sink, work surfaces, utensils and themselves. </p> <p>'That is classic cross-contamination,' Jenny Morris explains, 'which is one of the Food Standard Agency's four Cs [used in its campaign as an aide-memoir for avoiding food poisoning]. The other three are cleaning, cooking and chilling.' It is against these criteria that my performance will be judged by Jenny (who, as well as being an EHO, is policy officer for the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health). To make things worse, I have chosen ingredients and methods notorious for their food-poisoning potential: frozen scallops, king prawns, fresh raw tuna and cod, sliced, marinated in lemon juice and threaded on skewers with red and yellow peppers and courgettes. These kebabs will be lightly grilled (to simulate barbecuing) and served with new potatoes and a salad of organic red batavia lettuce, Little Gem leaves, wild rocket and vine tomatoes. My pact with Jenny is that I will behave as I do when preparing a family meal; I must not sanitise my technique on account of her presence. Armed with a probe thermometer and a critical demeanour, she will judge my food safety and my personal hygiene. </p> <p>First, there is the bacteriological can of worms that is our fridge - an ancient, leaking Hotpoint bought for \u00a320 from the previous owner of the house. 'I'll just leave the thermometer in here for a while,' says Jenny, as I pick up an abrasive sponge - our only abrasive sponge - and begin scrubbing the new potatoes. Wiping down the board I chopped them on, I take my medley of fish and seafood from the fridge, where the scallops have been defrosting overnight. I can see Jenny taking notes. A quick slash with the knife, a squeeze of lemon juice, some salt and pepper, and the fish and vegetables are ready for assembly on skewers. Brushing the kebabs with olive oil, I stick them under the grill and start preparing the salad. Jenny takes her thermometer from the fridge, looks at it through narrowed eyes, then sticks its probe into a can of tuna covered in Clingfilm, leftover from the night before. She closes the door and retrieves the thermometer later. </p> <p>Oddly, like the unprecedented flies, the grill undermines my confidence on the very day I am being held up to scrutiny. Our gleaming Smeg cooker which we cherish like a baby (even using Johnson's baby oil to maintain its mirror-like sheen) takes nearly half an hour to grill one side of the kebabs. There is plenty of time to chat. I discover that Jenny has been both a chef and a caterer before becoming an EHO - so my meal will be judged for its culinary merits as well as micro-biologically. </p> <p>'It's all very tasty,' she says politely at my hour of reckoning, when we eventually sit down to a plateful of pale, fashionably underdone kebabs and a fly-blown salad. 'I haven't seen anything so bad it makes me not want to eat it.' Without warning, she whips out her thermometer and thrusts it deep into a scallop, retrieving the device after two minutes. Is it my imagination, or does she look worried? 'It's 59 ,' she announces, 'but to kill all the bacteria you need to achieve 70 at the centre for two minutes. Wouldn't it be good for your story if we both went down with food poisoning?' I laugh nervously. </p> <p> <strong> How the bacteria stacked up </strong></p> <p><strong> Chopping boards </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> mine is expensive and constructed from a single piece of wood. 'Those made from several pieces are glued together,' says Jenny, 'and if the glue starts to give, you have lots of gaps for food-trapping and bacteria.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> although there are two boards in the house, I am too lazy to use the second. The same one is used for raw fish and seafood as for chopping vegetables and salad, albeit with a good wash down in between. Theoretically, I turn it over when I switch from raw fish to vegetables - but I can't recall which side I'm on. It's a perfect recipe for contamination. </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> 'In a domestic kitchen, it's a very good idea to have more than one board,' says Jenny, 'ideally in different shapes or colours, so you can differentiate. Anything \"dirty\" - raw meat and fish - would be prepared on one, and all the \"clean\" stuff - salads and sandwiches - on the other.' </p> <p>Commercial food businesses use heavy-duty plastic or polypropylene boards, which are the most hygienic, and Jenny recommends them. 'If you have only one board,' she advises, 'spray it after use with a sanitiser, an antibacterial spray such as Dettox, then wipe it dry with a piece of kitchen towel. Because the risk of cross-contamination is so high, I might not rely on hot soapy water.' </p> <p> <strong> Cloths and sponges </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> there really isn't one. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> 'It's one of your big failings,' says Jenny, witheringly. 'You have a major cross-contamination issue with your cloths.' To begin with, I used the same abrasive sponge to scrub muddy potatoes as I did to wipe down the board on which I prepared salad - spreading farm bacteria everywhere. Then, after chopping raw fish and seafood, I used the same sponge again to swab down kitchen surfaces. 'Even though you rinsed it out,' says Jenny, 'it has potential bacteria traps because it is abrasive.' </p> <p>That was certainly the finding of a University of Westminster study examining the fingertips of subjects after using different types of cloth: for a sponge, the count was 65.8 colonies of bacteria on the fingers compared with 39.7 for a dishcloth and zero for a paper towel. Some 83 per cent of sponges examined showed a 'high' rate of contamination after one day's use (with more than a billion bacteria present, rising to 10 billion after several days). As the study's stomach-churning summary pointed out, the source of bacteria 'varied from water to the human gut, respiratory tract and skin' and included E. coli, salmonella and the distinctly unappetising enterococcus faecalis. </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> use different cloths or sponges for different tasks - 'That's my clean cloth, the yellow one; that's my dirty cloth, the blue one,' suggests Jenny. Failing that, boil, bleach or disinfect cloths regularly (ideally every day) or throw them away. Non-woven dish cloths are better than sponges because they have fewer 'traps' where germs can hide, and hold less water, which helps bacteria thrive. </p> <p> <strong> The freezer </strong></p> <p> <strong>Upside: </strong> everything in it is still frozen! The scallops were defrosted in the fridge, not the open air - 'the correct way to do it', says Jenny. 'A lot of research has been done on defrosting,' she explains, 'and the recommendation is to do it in the fridge, where there are controlled conditions.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> I didn't check whether the scallops were thawed right through before using them. 'If that product is not defrosted at the core,' says Jenny, 'the little nugget of ice in the middle will cool the scallop down and stop it cooking properly.' The result: serious food poisoning. I also splashed water from the scallop bag on to the kitchen surface - a cross-contamination issue - and put the unsealed bag back in the fridge next to a tub of hummus. 'Those juices can contaminate other things,' Jenny warns. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> press defrosted food with your fingers to check it is thawed, or even run a skewer through it. Be careful with defrosted juices, which carry bacteria. </p> <p> <strong> The fridge </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside: </strong> to my amazement, Jenny gives this a clean bill of health. 'You've got reasonable separation,' she says, 'with your salad on the top and your meat below to avoid cross-contamination. Everything was covered properly and it gives the general impression of being clean.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> a fridge should operate at 1 C to 4 C to stop bacteria multiplying - but this one registered 9 C on Jenny's probe thermometer (after the door was opened briefly). A better indication was the tinned tuna, with a core temperature of 6.7 C. 'You are just within the legal limit for commercial premises, which is 8 C,' says Jenny, 'but the general safety recommendation is 5 C and below.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> buy a new fridge - or at the very least, a fridge thermometer. Turn up the temperature control in summer. </p> <p> <strong> The grill </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> it certainly looks attractive. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> it doesn't work. Maybe I omitted to turn it on fully, but it took an eternity to cook the kebabs. 'The danger with that,' Jenny points out, 'is that if something has been under the grill a long time, people assume it is cooked and don't check.' She checked, and found the core temperature of the fish was 58 C or 59 C. 'To make sure you have killed all the bacteria,' she warns, 'you need to achieve 70 C at the centre for a minimum of two minutes. The cooking temperature depends on the food product - and if that was a piece of chicken [notorious for bacteria], pork [known to contain parasites] or a burger [where the mincing process transfers surface bacteria to the core of the patty], you would have a potential problem.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> if the grilling is suspect, as with a barbecue, it's essential to cook very thoroughly. No fashionable pinkness, says Jenny, and no 'piercing with a skewer until the juices run clear'. That method, she found as a caterer, is far too subjective and it's better to cut through to the centre of the meat with a knife to check. Chicken, she argues, should never be served at a barbecue. 'Don't do it,' she says, 'because you can't cook it properly on account of its size. If you must, cook it in the oven and finish it over charcoal.' </p> <p> <strong> The hands </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> there is a bottle of antibacterial hand-wash by the kitchen sink. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> I never use it. 'I'm sorry,' observes Jenny, 'but you really don't wash your hands very often. You should definitely wash them before you begin and after handling raw fish or meat - but you didn't.' From fingertip to elbow, the average person has between two million and 10 million bacteria, according to Martin Paterson, deputy director general of the Food and Drink Federation. 'If you wear a ring,' he adds, 'there could be as many germs under it - 700 million - as there are people in Europe.' No wonder Jenny recoiled when I failed to wash my hands after assembling the (raw) fish kebabs. 'You went to find your oil brush,' she says, 'and you rooted through the kitchen drawer, touching many things. The handles of your utensils are now contaminated, the drawer handles are contaminated. Then you picked up your oil bottle, so the next person who touches it will pick up that contamination. They may be handling a salad next.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> wash hands regularly and do it properly. Most people neglect to clean around the thumbs, between the fingers, and around and under the nails, and the hands should be vigorously rubbed together for 15 seconds. Wet them before applying soap and dry them on kitchen towel: 1,000 times as many germs are spread from damp hands as from dry. </p> <p> <strong> The kitchen </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> 'It looks clean,' Jenny pronounces. 'Nothing made me gasp in horror.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> the designer swing bin, with its lid flapping open and all kinds of fly fodder (including the baby's soiled nappies) inside. Less obvious is the washing machine, sited under food-preparation surfaces. 'Wherever there is moisture there is contamination spread by the aerosol [droplet] method.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> 'Definitely get a new bin,' says Jenny. 'Whenever you prepare food, wash down all surfaces with hot soapy water as a precaution; you don't know whether flies have landed there or not. Thereafter, cover all food immediately. And re-plumb the washing machine in the bathroom.' </p> <p><strong> Knives </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside:</strong> we have a whole range to choose from in our Global knife-block, including - wait for it - a tomato knife. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> the smallest, sharpest vegetable blade is the only one we ever use (except for cutting bread and carving meat) - for fish, seafood and vegetables. 'The biggest issue around that,' says Jenny, 'was the lemon used in the marinade. You sliced it with the knife used for the raw fish and put the remainder straight back in the fridge. That lemon now has raw fish on the edges - so if you use it in, say, a drink, there will be contamination. If it's a gin and tonic, the alcohol might kill the bacteria; if it's a soft drink, it won't.' The result? A bacteria cocktail. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> ideally, use different knives for different foods. Failing that, wash the knife thoroughly when going from meat or fish to food you will eat uncooked. 'I'd probably use the sanitiser spray again,' says Jenny. </p> <p><strong> Leftovers </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> 'This was fine,' says Jenny. (I'm usually such a pig, there are none.) </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> 'You need to think carefully about what you are going to do with this food afterwards.' It is very important to cool food down before it goes back in the fridge; the maximum recommended time is 90 minutes, after which it will attract flies and be at a perfect temperature for bacteria to multiply. Quick cooling is an art. 'If it's a great big container of stew left over, split it up into smaller bowls,' says Jenny. 'Instead of cooking a single large joint, have a couple of smaller ones or cut it to aid cooling.' One major problem is rice. 'There is a bacterium associated with it, bacillus cereus,' she explains, 'which has a nasty habit of producing spores when conditions are adverse. It is very resistant to heat.' When cooked rice is left in less than ideal conditions for four or five hours or overnight, spores are released and the bacteria multiply dangerously. Though associated with takeaway restaurants, bacillus cereus might be a problem when making rice salad - leaving cooked rice in the open air and making the salad later. People will eat that live bacteria. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> 'The best way with rice is to cook it and eat it quickly,' says Jenny. 'If you want to re-use it, cool it very quickly and refrigerate it.' Some people do reheat rice successfully - that's what fried rice is - but it's safer to throw it away. </p> <p><strong> Tea towels </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> see cloths.</p> <p><strong> Downside: </strong> a cross-contamination disaster area. Tea towels hold a special place in the pantheon of food-poisoning risks, being damp, laden with bacteria from hands and decomposing food and typically kept on a warm radiator where bacteria thrive. 'A few years ago,' says Martin Paterson, 'we [the Food and Drink Federation] were highlighting tea towels because they are a major carrier of germs. People would go for six months without washing them; they'd just leave them sitting around on work surfaces. They are a huge source of contamination.' Jenny Morris also had a few things to say: 'I've noticed that you dry your hands on the tea towels,' she says. 'Again, you are transferring contamination on to those tea towels, and then you are using them to wipe down the chopping board you've just cleaned. You have possibly re-contaminated the board and the tea towels.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> 'You should never dry your hands on a tea towel,' Jenny insists. 'Kitchen roll is quite good. Don't use a tea towel on your chopping board; wash it, drain it and wipe the surface with a paper kitchen towel, which is for a single use.' Martin Paterson adds: 'Even for washing up, it's best to leave the dishes to drain, then use disposable cloths or paper towels.' Chuck your tea towels out. </p> <p><strong> Washing up </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> I scored full marks - almost. After washing the dishes in warm, soapy water, I rinsed them in hot water (described by Jenny as 'best practice') and left them on the surface to drain. My wife would never allow this; she says I'm lazy. </p> <p><strong> Downside: </strong> though this is the best method when washing up by hand (because it avoids wiping, tea towels and contamination), it is far better to use a dishwasher. 'They typically operate in excess of 80 C,' says Jenny, 'because at about 82 C, water starts to act as a disinfectant. The heat is killing bacteria, which you can't achieve with a hand wash - even wearing rubber gloves. All the warm water is doing is loosening the dirt and grease from the plate. With rubbing and the penetration of the soap, this might get some of the bacteria off but it certainly won't kill them. What's more, if you don't change the water often enough, very soon it won't be hot soapy water; it will be a bacterial soup.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> buy a dishwasher.</p> <p><strong>Guess whose coming to dinner</strong></p> <p><strong> Campylobacter </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> The most common food-poisoning bug in Britain, responsible for 43,445 cases in 2003 and causing about 80 deaths a year. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Raw and undercooked poultry, red meat, unpasteurised milk, untreated water. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Very potent. Just a few bacteria in a piece of undercooked chicken can cause severe illness. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Gastroenteritis with fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea that is often bloody. The most serious cases can be fatal. </p> <p> <strong> Clostridium perfringens </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it? </strong> Officially, the third most common food bacterium in the UK, although the least reported because symptoms are vague and often dismissed as IID (infectious intestinal disease). In 2000 there were 166 confirmed cases but it is estimated that only one in 343 is notified. The real total could be closer to 57,000. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Soil, sewage, animal manure and the gut of animals and humans. It can easily be transferred to poultry, meat and meat products. Foods cooked slowly in large quantities, then left to stand for a long time, are its breeding ground. Particularly associated with leftover gravy and stuffing. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Clostridium perfringens can't be completely destroyed by ordinary cooking. It produces heat-resistant spores which may even be stimulated by high temperatures, causing the spores to germinate further. Unless infected food is eaten immediately, the bacteria will multiply rapidly as the food cools down. It must be reheated to 'piping hot' (ideally 75 C) to be safe. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> When ingested in large numbers, the bacteria produce toxins which attack the gut lining, causing diarrhoea and acute abdominal pain. </p> <p> <strong> E.coli 0157 </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Most strains of E.coli are harmless, but those producing the poison verocytoxin (VTEC) can cause severe illness. Of these, E.coli 0157 is the most common in Britain. A small number of cases (675 last year) have serious repercussions. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Farm animals and land contaminated with their faeces. Among foods, E.coli is transmitted most commonly through undercooked minced beef (such as burgers) and milk that is raw, inadequately pasteurised or contaminated after pasteurisation. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> The bacterium can spread directly from animals to humans and from person to person. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea. In serious cases, kidney failure, severe anaemia, neurological problems and death. </p> <p> <strong> Listeria </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Full name listeria monocytogenes, a food-poisoning bug of particular danger to pregnant women, babies and the elderly. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Everywhere in the environment, because it can survive at low temperatures (most bacteria require warmth to thrive). Foods most at risk are soft, mould-ripened cheeses, pt\u00e9s, unpasteurised milk and shellfish. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Resists heat, salt, nitrite (preservative) and acidity better than many micro-organisms. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Can be fatal to the elderly, the immune-impaired, infants and developing foetuses. </p> <p> <strong> Salmonella </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> The second most common cause of food poisoning after campylobacter (14,853 cases in 2003), widespread in eggs and poultry flocks in the 1980s. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Despite the poultry industry cleaning up its act with new codes of practice and the Lion Quality assurance scheme, salmonella is still found in eggs - at about the same levels as before the Edwina Currie debacle. Other sources are raw meat, poultry, unpasteurised milk, yeast - even pasta, coconut and chocolate. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Grows very well in the food itself, so a tiny number of bacteria will multiply to thousands of millions if the product is not chilled. Salmonella is also passed easily from person to person by poor hygiene, such as not washing hands. </p> <p> <strong> Symptoms</strong> Usually mild, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea but rarely vomiting. </p> <p> <strong> Scrombotoxin </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Not a bug as such, but a poison produced by certain bacteria present in oily fish which has been allowed to spoil through inadequate refrigeration. It causes a dramatic histamine reaction. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Fresh and tinned mackerel, tuna and, very rarely, Swiss cheese. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Once produced, the toxin is heat-resistant. Cooking, canning or freezing will have no effect. Contaminated food will not look, taste or smell any different from usual. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Tingling or burning in the mouth, a rash on the face or upper body, itching, sweating and headache, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting may follow.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Jools Oliver, ex-model, mother and wife of Jamie</strong> <br> Interview by Nicki Sprinz</p> <p>'On a sunny day, sitting here at the Brew House Cafe is like being in the middle of the countryside; the views are really amazing and you never feel as though you're in central London. The cafe sells great ice creams and home-made cakes - they're delicious. It can be difficult to feed the girls in restaurants when I'm by myself, but I'm comfortable here. I love to take the girls out every afternoon and here they can run around and enjoy the sunshine. Poppy and Daisy really enjoy the novelty of eating outside, plus it means I don't have to do any clearing up after them. </p> <p>I enjoy cooking now, but the truth is I used to hate it. Food only became important when I moved in with Jamie. I used to come back from a day's modelling and eat supermarket ready-meals. Naturally, I've picked up a few skills from living with him. During the week I'm home every night while Jamie works at the restaurant. That's when I dabble in the kitchen - without him there looking over my shoulder. </p> <p>At the weekends it's a real treat because Jamie does all the cooking - the kids' meals get more exotic, he experiments with new recipes and ideas and I stay out of the kitchen. </p> <p>Jamie and I always really like the idea of going out to eat, but when it comes to the crunch we mostly stay in and watch a DVD. If we do go out we like to go to Nobu [on Park Lane, London W1] - no one bothers us there. </p> <p>It is when we go food shopping that people tend to stare. In the supermarket they seem interested in what we are buying - although I think they're probably more interested in Jamie's purchases than mine!' </p> <p> <strong> The Brew House</strong> <br>Kenwood House <br>Hampstead Lane <br>London NW3 <br>020 8341 5384 </p> <p> <strong>Alek Wek, model</strong> <br>Interview by Zoe Smith</p> <p>'There's nothing better than sitting outside on the deck at La Bottega on a hot summer's day surrounded by magnolia trees and white lanterns. The range of people who go there is just so diverse and the range of food on offer is a real treat. It's the perfect place to pop in to after work. </p> <p>My favourite dish is grilled tuna with steamed spinach on the side. I usually have it with a salad. I always try to make sure that whatever I eat is balanced as I like to have my greens and my protein. </p> <p>It's a really casual place to dine. You have views of Chelsea so one of the nice things about eating there is that you're not just stuck in some restaurant; you actually have a sense of where you are. I don't really buy into the whole hype that surrounds many of the restaurants in New York but I do enjoy the sort of places where the people are pleasant and the food is great. I can't understand why people go to a restaurant and sit there tossing and turning to see who else is dining there. Me? If I'm hungry and I go to a restaurant I want to sit down and eat. Some people get all dolled up and that's fine but I rarely feel like dressing up. As long as I'm clean, it's all good. </p> <p>I don't really worry too much about what I eat but I can't just stuff my face with any kind of food. I think that's good in a way because, even though it sounds corny, what you eat is what you are. Breakfast is a must for me and lunch, too, because I run around all day and need something in my belly. </p> <p>I love La Bottega but I don't go there too often because cooking is one of my passions. I pick up culinary influences from all the places I've travelled to but what I always crave is the sort of food that I used to hate when I was young. When I'm at home I like to prepare things like ochre stew with onions and fish, chicken or beef. My mum always sends my dried ochre in the post so I never run out of the stuff. </p> <p>Stews feature a lot in Sudanese food and they're often eaten with rice or brown bread or kisra which is similar to a pancake, but much lighter. My mum does the most amazing cabbage stew that she steams, simmers and tosses. It's delicious. Unfortunately there aren't any Sudanese restaurants in New York but my friends don't mind because they can always order original Sudanese food at my place. </p> <p>When I'm away from New York I miss the fact that you can eat at times when in other cities everything is closed. Sometimes in London, I think that I can eat when I finish working late, only to find that everything is closed. But it's never a catastrophe because I can always pop round to my mum's for some good food.' </p> <p> <strong> La Bottega</strong> <br>The Maritime Hotel <br>363 West 16th Street <br>New York NY10011 <br>001 212 242 4300 <br><a href=\"http://www.themaritimehotel.com\">www.themaritimehotel.com</a></p> <p><strong>Mourad Mazouz, restaurateur</strong> <br>Interview by Rebecca Seal</p> <p>'In Paris there are a few little bistros that I really love - and this is my favourite. Ramulaud serves traditional French food and is run by a great big guy with a huge moustache who also happens to be an ex-communist. He's arrogant in that very hilarious Parisian way. He and his waiters have all been there for years and it doesn't take long to be treated like a local. </p> <p>Now when I go I don't order from the menu; I just sit down and they bring me things to try. The staff are quite firm though - if they think you're ordering the wrong wine for the food they say so. </p> <p>Once I arrived on my moped for lunch but there were no vacant tables. So I just wheeled the bike in between two tables, sat on it and waited. The waiter came, took my order, and brought me a delicious lunch. I ate it balancing on the bike. </p> <p>I miss places like it when I'm in London. I miss the neighbourliness of Paris. I love sitting outside a bistro watching the world pass, close to the other tables, listening to the other people talk, the regulars, the old drunk guy mumbling on his own, the people who come in every day. I haven't found that in London. </p> <p>There was another little bistro in Paris that I loved very much when I lived there but it closed down a few years ago. The couple who ran it were in their seventies - they had had the restaurant for nearly 50 years. But every night they would have a huge fight, throw plates of food on the floor, scream about how much one had ruined the other's life, right in the middle of the restaurant. And the next night they would be there again, quietly serving food until one of them made a mistake and then the show would start all over again. </p> <p>I try and go to Paris as much as possible. When I really want to forget about my work in London [Mourad runs the restaurants Momo and Sketch] I check in to a little hotel and head for Ramulaud.' </p> <p> <strong> Le Ramulaud</strong> <br>269, rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine <br>75011 Paris <br>00 33 1 43 72 23 29 </p> <p><strong>Thandie Newton, actress</strong> <br> Interview by Chloe Diski</p> <p>'I just love this place. When I first came here six years ago, I didn't get a feel for the atmosphere because it was at night. The River Cafe is still magical in the evening because you can see lights over the Thames, but it's in the day when the sun is out that you really appreciate where it is. I love sitting by this particular stretch of the river Thames, surrounded by great architecture and it's incredibly peaceful. </p> <p>I first met Ruth Rogers [co-owner of the restaurant] at my friend [the artist]Sam Taylor-Wood's house. I remember Sam saying to me, 'Oh God, Ruth is coming and I'm really nervous because I've got to cook for her.' That evening I had this really bizarre moment when I just found myself giving Ruthie a hug. I was shocked at myself and said, 'Oh my God. I'm so sorry.' I knew what I was doing (I don't drink), but it was such an unconscious act. Ruthie has that incredible aura. </p> <p>It is a great place to take children: the staff offer food straight away if they see you have a kid and they don't mind if they play on the lawn in front - in fact, they encourage it by putting a couple of Spacehoppers out for them to bounce on. </p> <p>The second time I came here, I had the chocolate nemesis and that was it - I was hooked. The River Cafe serves seasonal food but thank God chocolate doesn't have a season. At the moment my favourite dish is sea bass with cherry tomatoes and anchovies - it is unbelievable. I love the bruschetta with Cornish crab, too (I'm from Cornwall so it reminds me of home). </p> <p>Often when I go out to eat, I sometimes feel that the chef is just trying to show off. Here they seem to want to celebrate the food, not themselves. Here they uncover the food. It's naked. It's what real Italian food is all about.' </p> <p> <strong> The River Cafe</strong> <br>Thames Wharf, <br>Rainville Road, London <br>020 7386 4200 </p> <p><strong>Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, interior designer</strong> <br> Interview by Rebecca Seal</p> <p>'I am a creature of habit so I always have tuna tartare and then seared fillet of beef when I come here, although the rest of the menu is lovely. I only drink vodka with lunch - wine gives me a hangover. I might sometimes have frogs' legs and a little foie gras starter. Youcef, the new chef, does little amuses bouches too - today we had a little roast breast of quail and scallops. I'm a big protein fan, sort of a reformed Atkinser - which is such a boy's diet after all. I like food that is recognisably meat. Like an ear. Or offal. I'm fighting the onset of a 40-year-old's rotundity, especially since giving up smoking at Christmas. The upsetting thing is that, since stopping, I haven't eaten more, I just seem to absorb every last calorie. </p> <p>My friend Frank and I have lunch here at least once a week - my offices are just round the corner. My wife Jackie came with us last week, which is quite rare, since Frank and I have a tendency either to sit around discussing the exact stipple technique William Hogarth used in the 1720s or fart jokes. I think she was a bit shocked. It's wonderful to have lunch in the sun now that they have this garden. It is in huge contrast to the inside, which is really quite dark. If you think back 10 years, no restaurant had a garden and now everyone is dragging tables outside - which actually only makes sense if you're somewhere nice like this and not in Piccadilly Circus. </p> <p>The Spread Eagle is an old coaching inn and the garden is the old coach yard. It's always been a part of the real Greenwich - the old theatrical, randy, bawdy, sailor-infested Greenwich, which I find really rather horny and love the idea of bringing more of that back. The whole place is about the contrast of slum and splendour, even if now the slums are all furnished by Ikea and have Changing Rooms on the telly in the corner. </p> <p>I am emphatically not good at cooking, as Mrs Llewelyn-Bowen will testify. I am a phenomenally talented and really very enthusiastic pot-washer but I can't even make salad dressing properly. I can just about bring pasta to the boil, but there is a fair chance it will take on some strange and unthought-of consistency during the cooking process. We eat out a huge amount as a family and my kids aren't at all fussy; if they don't see anything on the menu they like, they won't moan and whinge to us, but will quietly ask the waiter if they could just have some pasta. I think that shows that if the worst should happen, they would be able to survive, especially in Knightsbridge.' </p> <p><strong>The Spread Eagle Restaurant </strong> <br>1 &amp; 2 Stockwell St <br>Greenwich , London SE10 9JB <br>020 8853 2333 </p> <p> <strong>Alberta Ferretti, fashion designer</strong> <br> Interview by Allegra Donn</p> <p>'The wonderful thing about Italy is that you don't have to travel far to taste different types of food. This is because Italian cuisine is very much based on local produce; if you're by the sea, it'll be fish, if you're inland, it'll be more meat-based. It is as simple as that. </p> <p>The Vicolo Santa Lucia offers a traditional type of cooking from the area - it is on the Adriatic coast near Rimini - with an oriental twist. </p> <p>I was born in Cattolica and my clothes factory is nearby, so I am here at least two days a week. For me it is a little haven, away from the noisy crowds of the Adriatic coast. </p> <p>If I want something light I have the freshly grilled tuna with vegetables. If I really feel like something special, I'll order the \u00ebmezze maniche [literally: short sleeved pasta] or the sea bass with olives and potatoes. The sushi and sashimi are also delicious and if I have pudding it'll usually be the plate of different ice creams mixed with fruits and caramel. </p> <p>At lunchtime I don't touch alcohol, but in the evening I always have a glass of white wine. My favourite is from a producer in Friulli called Josko Gravner, which is quite hard to come by. The owner produces it in small quantities and he matures it in earthenware containers rather than in wooden barrels as most vineyards do today. </p> <p>The setting of the restaurant is wonderful - it is by the swimming pool and beyond that is the sea.' </p> <p><strong> Vicolo Santa Lucia</strong> <br>Carducci 76 <br>Viale Carducci 76 <br>47841 Cattolica <br>Italy <br>00 39 0541 954677 </p> <p><strong>Beach shacks to restaurants - great alfresco eating places in Britain </strong> <br>Compiled by Sue Webster and Viola Fort</p> <p> <strong> Baywatch Beach Restaurant</strong> </p> <p> The Waterfront, St Helens, Isle of Wight </p> <p>01983 873259; <a href=\"http://www.bay-watch.co.uk\">www.bay-watch.co.uk</a> </p> <p>'Pretty posh', but a beach cafe nonetheless during the day, Baywatch morphs into a restaurant at night - with 12 large tables outside.

  "<p>My first car? A Renault 5, orange, \u00a315, window mould and holes in the boot. Second car: Fiat 127, blue, \u00a3350, more rust than Iron Maiden. Third: VW Polo, \u00a3900, maroon, stained seats and only one working lock... you get the picture. Can you judge a man by the cars he has owned? Do they form a sort of motoring CV? If so, you'll know that a) style has never been an issue for me, b) neither has performance, and c) my parents aren't rich. What you won't know is the sheer excitement (and relief) that getting into a new car brings me. Having spent so many years on the rough end of motoring's affections, I really know how to appreciate the smooth. I'm a family man with three young children, and a slobbering dog, and I hope that through these pages you'll get to read not about torque outputs and maximum axle weights, but about which cars make your kids feel nauseous, and which models will make your neighbours sick with envy.</p> <p><strong>Your questions answered</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> What on earth does all the jargon mean in car ads? It's just another example of boys being boys playing with their toys. Why can't they just say what they mean? <br><strong>Eleanor Dawson, York</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hi Eleanor, When it comes to small ads, an acronym saves you lineage and therefore money. But as you say, speaking in capital letters also becomes a game in which lonely men who spend their days scanning 'cars for sale' columns can pretend what they're doing is more glamorous than it is. Recently, however, Network Q teamed up with the Plain English Campaign to produce a jargon-free guide to dealerspeak, which included terms such as: </p> <p>18AW - 18in alloy wheels; FAR - front armrest; ESR - electric sunroof; and ICE - in-car entertainment. But even spelling these terms out can bamboozle anybody who doesn't think it's fun to spend weekends lying on your back covered in oil (on second thoughts...). My favourite ad, which I spotted in the Salisbury Journal, stated simply: </p> <p>'Mrs pregnant, Porsche got to go - gutted.' I was never sure whether he was gutted at having to sell his car, or because his wife was expecting. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Mr Love, Which car offers the most comfortable back-seat shag? <br><strong>Caroline, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Sex in cars should never be about comfort, and always about excitement. If it's comfort you're after, a Transit van will do the job. If it's excitement, try the still-warm bonnet of a red E-Type.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Last time I looked the upper speed limit on all Britain's roads was 70mph. Why then do manufacturers make vehicles that can do 150mph? And why do people like yourself go on about how fast cars are? Don't you realise that speeding is illegal, dangerous and stupid!<br><strong>Alastair McKay, Bath</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Alastair, You're right, the speed limit is 70, though you could be forgiven for thinking it was 90. On your behalf I phoned the press office at Mercedes to ask them why they made such fast cars. Their spokeswoman said: 'We make cars according to the market demand for them. Our customers want fast cars and so that's what we give them.' She did point out that Mercedes has led the way in innovative safety developments, airbags, crumple zones, etc. As to your point about us journalists... well, you're right, of course. However, I have a no-nonsense wife who has little faith in my driving ability, so hopefully you'll find reviews on these pages which take the macho out of motoring. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Martin, My mother-in-law is 74 years old and her trusty Polo has finally driven itself into the ground. She wants something similar and has a budget of about \u00a37,000. She says this will be her 'last' vehicle. Any suggestions? <br><strong>Jackie, Dorset</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> 'Last' sounds a bit final. I'm tempted to suggest a leather-clad Harley so she can go out in a blaze of glory. For \u00a37,000, she has plenty of options, but the one that'll turn most heads at the bingo is the new Fiat Panda - and she'll save \u00a31,000. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I'm fed up with driving the mass-produced cars that are churned out these days and have decided to buy a classic. But I don't know anything about cars. Do you have any tips/pointers for the lazy vintage enthusiast? <br><strong>Ian Wickes, Leeds</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Today's cars are like Stepford wives. Efficient and reliable, but scarily boring, so a classic is a great idea. The first thing to do is decide what you want to drive, then contact the owner's club of that make. They'll give you all the help and advice you need to find a car and then, importantly, keep it on the road. Auctions are another avenue to explore, see <a href=\"http://www.classic-car-auction.co.uk\">www.classic-car-auction.co.uk</a> for details. It's worth remembering that cars made before 31 December 1972 pay no road tax and are cheap to insure. My neighbour, for instance, bought an Austin A35 (his fifth) for \u00a31,800 and has insured it for a year for \u00a390. Another alternative is to join a members' collective, such as the <a href=\"http://www.classiccarclub.co.uk\">Classic Car Club</a>, where for an annual fee you can drive any of its fleet of immaculate vintage cars.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hi, We thought it might be a laugh to drive to the Olympics. We've got our hands on an old Land Rover. We figured we could sleep in the back. Do you think we'll make it? Baz and Chris, Birmingham</p> <p><strong>A</strong> The games start on 13 August, so you have five days to drive 2,500 miles. Better get started. When you get there, report to the British Team office.</p> <p>They could do with all the help they can get.</p>",
  "<p>Ever since I had my daughter Eleanor 20 months ago my husband Matt and I have had no desire to travel abroad. Why put yourselves through the potential stress of being stranded at the airport for hours due to flight delays when you can holiday quite happily nearer to home? </p> <p>Our theory was backed up by the experiences of friends and family who had dared to leave British soil with their young offspring. My sister and husband took their baby daughter to Italy when she was only a few months old. Georgia didn't stop crying from taking off at Gatwick to landing back there a week later (OK, a slight exaggeration but let's just say my sister looked far worse when she got home than when she had left). </p> <p>When I asked Caroline, another new mum, if she had enjoyed her trip to Greece with her six-month-old daughter Emily she wasn't exactly ecstatic. 'I wished I'd stayed at home,' she groaned. 'The flight was delayed by five hours on the way out and Emily didn't seem to like the heat.' </p> <p>I have to admit that my resistance to foreign travel has also been fuelled by Matt's tendency to lose his rag at airports. Being bumped off a flight or delays of more than two hours send him into a rage and the thought of having a child in tow has made the prospect even more daunting. </p> <p>So, it was with some trepidation that we set off on our first overseas jaunt: a family cruise round the Mediterranean. Fortunately the outward journey went relatively smoothly. We discovered the joys of airport parking (no struggling on the tube with suitcases and cheaper than a cab) and were very relieved to hear that our flight to Barcelona was not delayed. My sister had warned me to take a whole load of new toys to keep Eleanor entertained but she was quite happy playing with the seatbelt and flirting with the other passengers. As another child screamed its way through the entire two-hour flight we were the smug parents with the beautifully behaved child in seat numbers 20 and 21. </p> <p>The situation had somewhat deteriorated by the time we arrived at the port. Eleanor, by this time needing to sleep, started to lose it in the cab and had a full-blown tantrum as we boarded the ship. We rushed past the cheery cruise photographer attempting to take our picture; it wouldn't have been the best happy family holiday snap. </p> <p>I have to admit that I had never really associated cruising with family holidays, holding the stereotypical view of the average cruise passenger being 'overfed and nearly dead'. But I was staggered by the number of families on our ship, Brilliance of the Seas. The week before our cruise - half-term week - an amazing 700 of the 2,000 passengers had been children. Obviously some cruise ships are more child friendly than others. Our cruise line, Royal Caribbean International, has a children's club, Adventure Ocean, which offers a huge range of activities for three to 17-year-olds. Many of the ships have children's pools and slides, rock climb ing walls and some even boast ice-skating rinks. </p> <p>Our cabin was surprisingly child-friendly, with fold-down beds for older children and travel cots supplied for babies and toddlers. There was a thick curtain you could pull across to separate the sleeping area from the lounge so we didn't have to sit in complete darkness while Eleanor had her lunchtime sleep. The only downside of the cabin was that there was no bath, and she didn't take too kindly to being hosed down every night in the shower. </p> <p>When we had been planning our cruise, Matt and I had been a bit wimpy about the excursions. Initially excited by the prospect of day trips to Florence, Pompeii and the island of Capri, we reasoned that long coach trips and trailing after tour guides in the searing heat with a toddler in tow wouldn't be much fun. Instead we spent a lovely morning in the Corsican capital Ajaccio visiting Napoleon's museum, wandering the narrow streets and sitting in a waterside cafe while Eleanor slept in her pushchair. From Livorno we went on an excursion to Pisa, a 30-minute drive away, which is just about as long as we can take on a coach with a toddler. In Naples we decided to negotiate the city on foot, which turned out to be the highlight of our trip. We spent a wonderful afternoon discovering crumbling churches and beautiful little squares. Eleanor was quite content to sit in her pushchair and take it all in. When she did get bored and wanted to get out and walk we bribed her with ice cream. </p> <p>And what of life aboard? Eleanor loved it. She lapped up the attention from both passengers - many of whom were Italian and Spanish and made a great fuss of her - and staff, who were friendly and helpful. She had a great time exploring the ship - most of which is surrounded by high balconies (a great relief when you have an adventurous toddler) - and going up and down in the glass lifts overlooking the atrium. </p> <p>My only disappointment was finding out that Eleanor couldn't use the children's pool because she wasn't toilet trained. However, we did flout the rules and sneak her in a few times when members of staff weren't looking. It wasn't a problem when we were in port and could go off and do things but our last day was spent completely at sea and we did run out of things to do. </p> <p>So what did other families think of life on the ocean waves? Initially sceptical about cruising, first timers Jo and David Brown and their four-year-old daughter Lucy and 22-month-old Charlotte from Stockport were thoroughly enjoying the trip. The family had been used to doing more independent holidays until three and a half years ago when David was blinded by a bomb in Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Jo said: 'Everything is so easy. It's good that the destinations come to you, rather than you having to go to them. The ship's a lot less stuffy and claustrophobic than I had imagined and you don't have to worry about the kids upsetting people. The staff are really friendly. I'd definitely do it again.' </p> <p>Jonathan and Yulie Wagman from Manchester, also first-time cruisers, were impressed by how the staff had catered for their seven-month-old Benji. 'It's all been really easy. They prepared steamed white fish and vegetables and were quite happy to wash and sterilise bottles. We weren't comfortable using babysitters but brought our own walkie-talkies so we could go and have dinner,' said Jonathan. </p> <p>Matt and I were more than happy to use a babysitter. We went out together more in one week than we had since Eleanor was born. When the babysitter arrived we'd nip off for a swim and then come back and change for dinner. One night we went really wild and saw a show. By the end of the week we really felt like we'd had a proper holiday. </p> <p>Unfortunately our flight home was less successful. Eleanor had a sense of humour failure when the flight attendant wouldn't let her sit in her own seat for the takeoff (she was too young) and screamed the whole way home. She was escorted off the plane by a couple of zombies who felt like they'd just flown back from Los Angeles, not Barcelona. It's amazing how quickly that holiday feeling can wear off.</p> <p><strong>Factfile </strong></p> <p>Liz Bird and family travelled with <a href=\"http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk\">Royal Caribbean International</a> (0800 018 2020) on a five-night cruise from Barcelona, which starts from \u00a3665pp for an outside cabin, including flights. </p> <p>Brilliance of the Seas is sailing a series of 12-night Mediterranean fly-cruise holidays out of Barcelona until October.

  "<p>After seven years at the Treasury, I find it hard to resist the temptation to reminisce. And last Thursday's rate rise took me straight back to that day, in May 1997, when Gordon Brown announced that he was granting the Bank of England operational independence to set interest rates. </p> <p>I will never forget the slightly surreal sight of a Labour Chancellor calling past Chancellors - Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke (we inadvertently forgot John Major) - to inform them of his decision. Or the look of ill-concealed horror that flashed across William Keegan's face at the morning press conference when he realised what was happening. </p> <p>My favourite moment came when a journalist (luckily I've forgotten who) asked Brown if he expected to have to raise interest rates again next month. He had clearly missed the significance of the announcement. </p> <p>Today there is near-universal support for independence. Back then it was seen as a rather risky step. Many eminent columnists were understandably sceptical, given the Bank's history. And, of course, the Conservative party opposed the change. </p> <p>That day changed British economic policy in some unexpected ways. As Keegan writes in The Prudence of Mr Gordon Brown, Bank independence removed at a stroke one of the main sources of tension between Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street which caused Clarke and Lawson so much grief. </p> <p>And far from weakening the ability of the Treasury to ensure public spending discipline, the risk that the monetary policy committee (MPC) might respond with a rate rise has proved a useful and effective deterrent to profligate departmental proposals on more than occasion. Fiscal policy has supported monetary policy throughout this economic cycle - far more than in previous decades. </p> <p>At the same time, Bank independence has freed Brown to spend much of his time pursuing the goals this Labour government was elected to deliver - full employment, a reduction in child and pensioner poverty, reform of and investment in public services, tackling global injustice. </p> <p>Yet it has been the MPC's deliberately forward-looking and pre-emptive approach to setting interest rates that, I believe, explains why central bank independence has been an economic policy success since 1997. </p> <p>The MPC's first big test came in the autumn of 1998, when the Asian and Russian financial crises, followed by the LTCM Wall Street hedge fund scare, sent world financial markets into a tailspin. The Bank responded by cutting interest rates month after month to prevent a British slowdown and sustain growth. </p> <p>Just to prove that this was not a one-off, the MPC again cut interest rates - nine times - following the US slowdown in 2000 and the collapse in global trade growth. While the US, Japan, Germany and France all suffered recessions, Britain continued to grow, with employment rising and consumer confidence robust. </p> <p>Why was the MPC able to act in such a decisive manner? Part of the reason was that the Chancellor set the Bank an explicit inflation target of 2.5 per cent: inflation below the target is as much to be avoided as inflation above target. This has removed for Britain the deflationary bias that has characterised some other independent central banks. </p> <p>The other key ingredient is the flexibility and discretion that the constraint of operational independence has allowed. As Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott wrote in a powerful column last week about trust in economics and politics: 'Voters no longer assume ... the government will play politics with interest rates and screw up the economy.' </p> <p>This is a rather more subtle point than would first appear. There is no doubt that, pre-1997, there was a tendency to play politics with interest rates, evidenced by the fact that they were often cut on Budget day or the day after. But the case for independence is not simply that it stops venal policymakers from deliberately manipulating interest rates to fit an electoral timetable. </p> <p>Imagine if in 1998 a Chancellor had tried to take a similarly forward-looking and pre-emptive approach to setting interest rates and embarked - rightly - on a series of consecutive monthly rate cuts. After the second cut, the political process would be shouting 'panic' and the old 1970s newsreels dusted off. By the time of the third cut, a full-scale political crisis - and probably a sterling crisis, too - would have been under way. </p> <p>No wonder that, pre-1997, the temptation for Chancellors and Bank governors was not to be forward-looking and pre-emptive but to wait and see, in the hope that something would turn up. Yet it was this inflexibility and delay that led repeatedly to sharper rises in interest rates to try to bring inflation back under control and then deeper rate cuts - too late - as the economy slipped into recession. </p> <p>Since 1997, with interest rate decisions to meet the politically determined inflation target now in the hands of a group of technical experts, regular pre-emptive rate cuts have twice proved not destabilising but stabilising. And while in 1998 the Conservative shadow chancellor predicted 'a recession made in Downing Street' he soon had to eat his words - as did the leader of the opposition and the shadow chancellor when growth came in on target last year. </p> <p>Which brings me to last Thursday's interest rate decision. It is the MPC's determination to avoid repetition of past mistakes that explains why, as the global economy has strengthened over then past year and US interest rates have risen, the Bank has also embarked on a series of five small pre-emptive increases in UK interest rates to keep the economy growing at a sustainable pace. And while vigilant about the risks, it is because of the MPC's pre-emptive approach that the necessary moderation in house-price inflation seems now to be happening. </p> <p>Far from these modest rate rises denting public support for the government's economic policy, the CBI and Engineering Employers' Federation have actually advocated modest and pre-emptive increases in interest rates to keep the economy stable and growing - and avoid a return to the double-digit interest rates of the past. </p> <p>As rising employment remains consistent with moderate growth in average earnings, there is scope for economic growth to be above the rate of inflation next year. </p> <p>But it is premature to declare that politics has been taken out of the interest rate debate. Because the Conservative party once again responded by predicting doom for Britain and, rather oddly, blamed rising public spending for last week's rate rise. </p> <p>It is easy to see why the Tories are so desperate to re-politicise UK monetary policy. With public trust in both the MPC and UK economic policy rebuilt after the failures of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Shadow Chancellor needs to dent that trust if he can. </p> <p>But on economic matters the memories of the British public are long and vivid. To images of 1970s strikes and the winter of discon tent have now been added sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, double-digit interest rates and the poll tax. </p> <p>Trust in economic policy, once shattered, is hard to rebuild. So given the choice of Brown and the MPC running the economy or Michael Howard and Oliver Letwin, I can hazard a guess as to whom most people would choose. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ed Balls is the prospective parliamentary candidate for Normanton and former chief economic adviser to the Treasury </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Keegan is on holiday</p>",
  "Once the Edinburgh fringe was all about cabaret shows in crumbling church halls, unknown acts, cheap tickets and student drama. Yet now the three-week festival is more readily associated with big names, lucrative sponsorship contracts and West End deals. <p>But as a booming fringe kicks off this weekend and finally threatens to overtake completely the official annual arts festival, there are signs of a dangerous split. Prompted by a dislike of the slick public relations operations, bureaucracy and high admission prices, many influential performers are striking out to create a radical, cool 'fringe of the fringe'. </p> <p>In a deliberate attempt to break the dominance of three key companies behind the main venues for fringe shows, the Assembly Rooms, the Pleasance and the Gilded Balloon, several smaller venues are taking them on by successfully wooing top artists with more money. They also offer what they claim is a 'more authentic' risk-taking, fringe atmosphere. </p> <p>Among the high-profile comics drawn to the new anti-fringe fringe are stand-up Stewart Lee, co-creator of the West End hit Jerry Springer: The Opera, and former Perrier Award winners Daniel Kitson and Jenny Eclair. </p> <p>Even the large entertainment promoters from London, such as Avalon, have been forced to admit the impact of these venues. </p> <p>'Somewhere like the Underbelly is fringier,' said James Taylor of Avalon. 'It is like a dungeon with a certain bare charm,' he added. </p> <p>'Some people are annoyed with the newcomers for offering these deals, but it is great for the small acts and it is making the big three venues raise their game.' </p> <p>This trend is likely to be welcomed by those who criticise the commercialisation of the fringe, such as veteran arts promoter Richard Demarco, who called it 'the Blackpool of the arts' this weekend and urged a return to its initial values. 'The fringe has lost its dignity and its reason for existing. There are ever-increasing amounts of crass entertainment that should be Channel Five. It is also very much driven by economics,' he said. </p> <p>Demarco, a co-founder of the city's renowned Traverse theatre, is nostalgic for a time when stars performed for nothing. 'People like Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Richard Burton gave quality performances for the love of what they were doing. The festival is now living off that reputation, but it isn't paying it enough respect.' </p> <p>On Friday, William Burdett-Coutts, who runs the Assembly Rooms, probably the smartest and best-known venue, provocatively suggested that the fringe should steal the title Edinburgh Festival in triumphal acknowledgement of its dominance. No longer can it be described as a mere adjunct to the official festival, he said. </p> <p>Last year fringe ticket sales topped a million for the first time, and this year the Assembly Rooms has already sold double the number it had at the same point in 2003. </p> <p>Fringe festival director Paul Gudgin has responded by floating his controversial suggestion this weekend and asking for suggestions for other new names. </p> <p>The commercial success of the modern fringe is not welcomed by everyone. Tickets for shows now frequently cost more than \u00a310, and while Gudgin insists the average admission price is lower this year than last - at \u00a37.78 rather than \u00a38.40 - the chance to see big names, such as the comedian Ross Noble, will cost the fringe-goer \u00a316. </p> <p>Performers suffer too. While the stars of the British comedy scene, such as Ed Byrne or Paul Merton, stand to make as much as \u00a350,000 from a brief run at the festival, many fresh acts find it hard to afford the trip. It is common for up-and-coming performers to lose as much as \u00a35,000 during the festival, even with good reviews. </p> <p>And while Gudgin is happy to revel in the popularity of the fringe, he too has noticed the effect of the new venues. 'The market has been stimulated by their arrival,' he said. 'The artists now have a choice to make.' </p> <p>Promoter Nigel Klarfeld of the comedy agency Bound and Gagged, who represents established comics as well as newcomers, believes that, although artists will always benefit from the professionalism of the big venues, the newer spaces could broaden the scope of the fringe again. </p> <p>'Most performers lose money at the fringe and at most venues it is only the big names that can start to make it pay,' he said. </p> <p>Increasingly, smaller acts are promoting themselves by criticising the rest of the fringe. Kevin Tomlinson's acclaimed improvisation show is billed as 'the riskiest show at the festival', which 'demonstrates the true spirit' of the fringe; 'self-financed, rather than commercially sponsored', it has no support from one of the big comedy promotion companies. </p> <p>Similarly the performers behind A Blunt Sketch Show claim to be artistically independent and popular without any professional hype. 'Many fringe acts are represented by one of two or three big promotion companies,' said performer-producer Ben Slotover. 'We have been drawing in our audience by word of mouth and by handing out our own fliers.' He and his fellow cast members control their own show as a result. 'It is nice not to be told how long your show has to be or that you have to leave out a certain bit.' </p> <p>As the big three fringe venues continue to expand to meet audience demand, opening up satellite spaces for the festival under the same banner, newer clubs such as the Underbelly, the Pod and the Stand are giving unknown artists a chance to be seen at cheaper prices without bankrupting themselves. </p> <p>While performers are traditionally offered a 60 per cent share of the takings, the Pod, based in an Art Deco cinema, offers more. </p> <p>'We can give our performers 65 per cent,' said Heidi Waddington, its co-director. Better deals still are available for big names. 'We were coming at it from the point of view of the acts and because we are new, we were able to do things a new way'.</p>",
  "<p>For some photographers, such as the ambulance-chasing Weegee, the camera is an investigative device, catching reality in flagrante delicto. Ansel Adams or Edward Weston saw it as an aid to contemplation; through their cameras they studied nature - mosaic mountains, or humble assortments of vegetables - in the hope of glimpsing the divine geometry of supernature. For Cartier-Bresson, who may well have been the greatest photographer of all, the camera served as a bodily extension, not just a mental tool. He gratefully described his first little Leica, bought in Marseille in the early 1930s, as 'the extension of my eye', but it was more than that. The machine, when he used it, acquired human aptitudes. Alert, sentient, compassionate, it enabled him to align head, heart and eye, as he said, along the same axis. </p> <p>These miracles of integration were momentary: the existentialist lives in the instant, dancing on a tightrope. A younger photographer, Joel Meyerowitz, once incredulously watched Cartier-Bresson at work in a New York street parade. He dashed in and out of crowds and scampered through traffic, apparently never pausing to raise the camera to his eyes or adjust its focus. Despite his jittery animation, the images of course were perfect, stilling the frenzy and discovering logic and equilibrium in it. At first he must have looked like the entranced dancers he photographed in Bali in 1949, whirling in ecstasy. Yet his movements, if slowed down, would have had the deliberation of the men doing t'ai chi exercises in a Peking courtyard whom he photographed the previous year. </p> <p>Technique enabled him to find poise and balance; a chaotic content disclosed, despite itself, the grace of form. It was all managed in the blinking of an eyelid, which happens faster than the clicking of the camera's mechanical shutter, and it was precious because precarious. Cartier-Bresson began as a painter, and in 1973 gave up photography to concentrate on drawing; but he was well aware of the difference between the two arts. 'One makes a painting,' he said, 'whereas one takes a picture.' The making could be done with forethought, but the taking had to be a snatch-and-grab affair, a raid on 'the live moment'. Perhaps he learned how during his time as a hunter and gatherer on the Ivory Coast in 1931. </p> <p>Or it may have been a cinematographic skill, absorbed during his work with Jean Renoir. His great images are certainly celebrations of kinesis, tributes to the exhilaration of movement and to the mobility of phenomena. A man jumps over a puddle behind the Gare St Lazare, and fortuitously pho tographs himself upside down in the water as he does so. A boy cycles in a blur down a curved street in Hy\u00e8res; the photograph is taken from the top of a twisted stone stairway, and it looks as if he has biked down the stairs, triumphantly vaulting over physical obstacles. A smiling urchin in Seville scuttles along on crutches, as athletic as his able-bodied playmates. Because the people Cartier-Bresson portrayed self-consciously transfixed themselves in front of the camera, he preferred to photograph them in company with friskier, less disciplined creatures: Matisse shares his studio with a flight of uncaged doves, and William Faulkner's statuesque pose is subverted by the frisking of his Jack Russell terriers. </p> <p>Immobility, prized by painters, is for this photographer either sad or absurd. Hence the troop of wooden horses he photographed in Cuba, unhitched from their carousel and put out to pasture in a stony backyard, their flaunting tails unscrewed. One of his books studied the new, modern partnership between men and machines, but refused to accept our inevitable dehumanisation. The operators - without creating mayhem in the factory as Chaplin does in Modern Times - energise whatever apparatus they happen to be assembling. These industrial vignettes are cautionary tales about how the camera should be employed: the cold gadget must be infused with feeling. </p> <p>As a reporter, Cartier-Bresson accepted his responsibility to 'supply information to a world in a hurry'. He documented the liberation of Paris, the collapse of the Nationalist regime in China, Gandhi's funeral and the partitioning of Berlin. But his work, unlike that of Magnum colleagues such as Robert Capa or Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, avoided political commentary. Sartre noted that the Chinese people he photographed - in one case a wizened, amiable eunuch expelled from the Forbidden City, in another a boy soldier squatting beside a tripod of rifles - never looked picturesque, which would have defined them as alien, inimical beings. Admiring this neutrality, Sartre declared: 'We have to thank Cartier-Bresson for his gift of nominalism.' His work is indeed a nominalist's paradise, an encyclopedic account of human singularity and of the irrepressibility of our species in its busy pursuit of happiness. </p> <p>He wanted his images to contain and preserve 'a great physical and intellectual joy'. The original title of the book known as The Decisive Moment was Images \u00e0 la sauvette, referring to the little basket in the sink that salvages your ring if it slips off while you're washing up. The translation emphasised Cartier-Bresson's decisiveness, whereas his actual practice embraced the random: his 'ultra-receptive posture', as the surrealist Andr\u00e9 Breton put it, 'helped chance along'. The French title underlines capture and salvation, reminding us that photography enables us to gain a brief control of time, the tragically erosive medium of our lives. </p> <p>If I had to choose my favourite Cartier-Bresson, I'd select a snapshot that does just this, even though it's not one of his most ingenious feats of juggling. It shows a boy making his way home through the Rue Mouffetard street market in Paris. He carries two bottles of wine, cradling them as if they were his fragile twin siblings. He beams with delight, pleased to charged with this delicate responsibility, even more pleased to be, while the photographer is looking at him, the centre of the world. The image dates from 1952, which means the little boy might be dead by now - or else he's my age, which is near enough the same thing. But in the photograph he enjoys a perpetual childhood, and so do I, for a few radiant seconds, when I look at it. Sartre's homage can be improved by being cut short: we simply have to thank Cartier-Bresson.</p>",
  "<p>'You have such beautiful skies,' Woody Allen said last week at the completion of another scene in another film, 'when they're overcast.' Allen and his crew had been looking up at the skies above West Kensington all morning, hoping for cloud. They were at Queen's Club, surrounded by the lush tennis courts and white-cottoned members trying not to appear too interested as a small 68-year-old man in a frayed green baseball cap moved among them. 'I never shoot in the sun if I can help it because everything looks much better without it,' the director continued. 'The sun has been the bane of my existence.' </p> <p>Allen's crew wear laminated passes bearing the letters WASP 04 - the Woody Allen Summer Project, the 36th such project in his career. They have filmed in Belgravia and the Fulham Road, in St James's Park and Tate Modern, and everywhere they've been people are thrilled to see them. Passers-by ring up friends on their mobiles: Woody Allen filming in our street! Scarlett Johansson looking beautiful! Woody much smaller in real life! 'Occasionally people ask me for autographs and I give them,' the recipient of this adulation says. 'People are so nice to me. If only everyone who is so keen to see me would go to see my movies!' </p> <p>WASP 04 is still a mystery, even to those on set. Allen will only say who's in it (Johansson, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode) and what it's vaguely about, which turns out to be the same as almost all his other movies - human relationships and their consequences. In his famous style, the actors only get to see their own scenes, and the producers even less. As the only person who knows quite what film he is trying to make, Allen says he is happy with progress, 'but I hope it's not just that the English voices are so beautiful to my ear that they cover a multitude of my sins.' </p> <p>He fears that the same speeches read by an American cast would be pedestrian. 'To hear Jonathan Rhys-Meyers do them or Brian Cox or Penelope Wilton - they sound like what we've grown up in America to consider as acting and theatre at its highest. And Scarlett is of course just a natural great actress. She can do no wrong, incapable of a bad moment. Very sexy, very pretty. She was just touched by God.' </p> <p>We talk while the sun is out - 10 minutes here, 15 there - on a sequence of benches, director's chairs and catering buses. Allen walks slowly between each spot, and speaks gently and with great conviction. When he is filming, he occasionally crouches down to peer through a lens, but otherwise watches over the cameraman's shoulder with the day's script tightly rolled in his hand, as if he is about to swat flies. He does not bellow 'And... action !' at any point; the working day progresses organically, merging from set-up to camera-roll in smooth order, with hushed conversations among his technicians between scenes. On this day in West London, precisely halfway through a seven-week schedule, it is as if nothing is riding on the film at all. </p> <p>If only this were so. The paying public and large parts of the film business have fallen out of love with Woody Allen's art, if not his person. With each new film they see a diminishing of talents. Allen peps up his work with the leading young actors of the day, and he injects the usual one-liners and angsty philosophies, but he is regularly regarded as a lost cause, a man who has spent the last decade grimly failing to reproduce the great achievements of his career - Annie Hall, Manhattan, Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose, Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Husbands and Wives - some of which defined an era, some of which just defined the best imaginable way to spend a Saturday night. </p> <p>It's not that Small Time Crooks or Sweet and Lowdown or Mighty Aphrodite are bad films - how much more entertaining they are than most teen and disaster movies - it's just that they don't fill us with the joy that they used to, and we don't tend to quote from them. Every year a hopeful critic jumps out from the page to proclaim The Curse of the Jade Scorpion or Hollywood Ending 'a magnificent return to form', but theirs is a minority voice. It may be his age, it may be exhaustion, it may be the lack of someone around him to say, 'Whoa, one movie every two years is enough for anyone!' Or it may be that he no longer has the power to grasp and ridicule the concerns of our times. But what if most people are wrong? What if his best work is still to come? </p> <p>I have met Allen twice before, but have never seen him with such an assured outlook on life. He says he loves being in London, his wife and two children are either out at the sights or in the pool of his rented house, and he is serious when he says that he finds the on-set catering to be better than in New York. His own opinion of his current standing in the film world is instructive. </p> <p>'In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now,' he says. 'There was a time in the 1950s when I wanted to be a playwright, because until that time movies, which mostly came out of Hollywood, were stupid and not interesting. Then we started to get wonderful European films, and American films started to grow up a little bit, and the industry became more fun to work in than the theatre. I loved it. But now it's taken a turn in the other direction and studios are back in command and are not that interested in pictures that make only a little bit of money. When I was younger, every week we'd get a Fellini or a Bergman or a Godard or Truffaut, but now you almost never get any of that. Filmmakers like myself have a hard time. The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films - if they get a good film they're twice as happy, but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500m. </p> <p>'That's why I'm happy to work in London, because I'm right back in the same kind of liberal creative attitude that I'm used to.' </p> <p>I wonder if there was a time recently when he found the situation he describes too painful to endure? 'Yes. In the last couple of years I've thought about if I do really want to function in the film business the way I did when I started. When I started, there was a great joy in wanting to make a film and knowing there was a huge audience out there - not huge, but a special audience, and I would try to appeal to that audience if I could. </p> <p>'You felt part of something. Now, you know, I don't really care that much. There's no real prestigious film industry, there's no real cultivated film industry. All new young directors are smitten by what they see, and they are smitten by special effects and blockbusters and they all want to make those kind of pictures. OK, not all - 98 per cent. Maybe if I can get a situation in the United States where someone will work the way I want to work I'll do it. If not, I'll make another film in Europe... or I'll work in the theatre.' </p> <p>In October he will direct his own play, Second-Hand Memory in New York. 'It doesn't have to be films,' he says of his future career. 'There's no film community I really care to be a part of.' </p> <p>For the time being he perseveres, often to the consternation of his greatest fans. Why does he work so hard? 'Why not?' he replies with some bewilderment. 'What does one do in the world? I read books, listen to music, I watch sports, and there's plenty of time to work. What else would I do? When my grandmother was old she used to just sit by the window all day and look out at people. That seems to me boring. Life is a meaningless grind, so... you know... One film a year really isn't a big deal. There's plenty of time to do all this stuff, and plenty of time for my family and to go to the basketball game and take walks and go to dinner every night. Tonight I'll go see the dailies, yesterday's work, and hopefully it will be good. I'll go home, play with the kids, my wife and I will go out to a nice restaurant for dinner, go to sleep...' </p> <p>Allen says he has all but given up on his ambitions to make a masterpiece, something that may be ranked against Kurosawa and his dead European idols. 'I've resigned myself,' he says. 'I'm functioning within the parameters of my mediocrity.' He maintains that he never sees any of his films after they leave the editing room, and that he remains vaguely unhappy with all of them; they never turn out the way he had hoped when he first sketched out his ideas in his bedroom. Surely not Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters ? </p> <p>'You know, I tried to buy Manhattan back, because I was disappointed with it and I wished I could get them not to release it and I'd do a free film for them, which is what I offered them. But other people loved it, so I can't really tell myself.' </p> <p>We walk towards some lunch. I tell him there is lamb today, and swordfish steaks. He says he may go for something more spartan. As he constructs a tiny mixed salad in a polystyrene bowl I wonder if he is glad that Manhattan appeared after all. 'Yes, because it was such a big success. I always think with films like that that I got away with something. I think, \"It's interesting, they really don't see what the problem is...\"' </p> <p>Allen says he feels the same when people pay to hear him play New Orleans jazz on his clarinet. Last weekend he travelled with his band to perform three concerts in Germany, and this weekend he's in Spain and Monaco for a Red Cross gala in the presence of Prince Albert. 'I have improved, but I've improved within the parameters of no talent. I don't say this with false modesty. I'm a strict amateur, with no ear, but people come to see me because I'm a celebrity from the movies. I would starve to death in a week if I had to do it without being a celebrity. I go into these 2,000- or 3,000-seat venues and I sell them out. Jazz musicians who are truly miraculous go in and don't have anything near that kind of thing, so obviously it's got nothing to do with the quality of my playing.' </p> <p>He fears that his fame may also work against him. 'I tried to write a novel,' he says. 'And I finished it. But I didn't want to have a novel out there that would be regarded as the work of a celebrity. I didn't want it looked down upon or embraced because it had a celebrity name. I wanted to write a novel that could hold its own with professional novels, and I didn't think that this could, so I have it in my drawer. I just didn't think it was good enough.' </p> <p>His assistant joins us at the back of the catering bus, asking whether it's OK if a driver can bring someone to the set. 'That is OK,' Allen says, 'but I need something more to eat.' He holds up his bowl. 'These turned out to be cucumbers but I thought they were something else. Can I get a piece of bread, a nice dry piece of brown bread, a few more tomatoes?' </p> <p>'A candy bar?' his assistant asks. </p> <p>'No, I don't want a candy bar. If there's anything else in the vegetable family...' </p> <p>I wondered about the title for his London film. He said that when he writes in his bedroom he too refers to his new movie as the Woody Allen Spring / Summer / Fall Project. 'It's never that I'm hiding the titles. When I have them, I always give them out. But when a film is over then I want to see what title feels best, and what title best leads the audience to that material. I've had all the people working for me trying to think of titles. Sometimes it comes right to the wire and we panic.' On one film he came up with the title Anhedonia. 'They thought it was too obscure a word; it means the inability to experience pleasure. People said, it's a lovely movie, but if they see the title Anhedonia they won't be interested at all. So finally, not even two weeks before we were ready to make the ads we thought, OK: Annie Hall.' </p> <p>The appearance of one Woody Allen title each year has remained the only constant in a decade of flux. The last 10 years have been one of dramatic personal and professional upheaval for Allen: he split from his partner Mia Farrow and married her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. They adopted two children. Both his parents died. He endured a painful legal battle with his long-time producer Jean Doumanian. He even changed his jazz musicians. </p> <p>He talks of these events with protective nonchalance, but once there was a period when his career, or at least his reputation, seemed over, those months when Mia Farrow accused him of child neglect and people assumed he was sleeping with his daughter. One thing was clear even before the courts ruled on custody: Woody could never really play Woody again. </p> <p>'I never give it any thought,' he claims. 'It never meant anything to me. I just function, and the tabloids do their work, and it never had any direct bearing on my life. It didn't make my pictures do better or worse. It didn't make me happy or unhappy. As a newspaper reader you could read about it every day, but there was nothing really happening. If you were in it, it was kind of boring. </p> <p>'I consider myself incredibly lucky,' he continues. 'I have an ideal marriage and great kids. My parents both died peacefully. I was disappointed that I had a falling-out with my former producer because she was a friend, but it's not a brain tumour - that's the worst thing that could happen to either one of us.' </p> <p>Several times during our meeting Allen mentioned how grateful he was to have his health, and he did look for wood to touch. His father lived beyond 100, his mother to her mid-nineties, so the great screen hypochondriac has genes on his side. 'My hearing is a little worse,' he says, 'and my eyesight is a little worse, but I'm in reasonably decent physical shape. But growing older you never like, because it's sadder, because you're getting closer to dying, and who wants that?' </p> <p>Last week Anything Else opened to the usual mixed reviews. It's an intriguing film, in which Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci take the roles Allen would once have written for himself. Allen plays a paranoid crank who may also be a visionary, a gag-writer who advises everyone to carry a rifle and water-purifying tablets and a torch that floats in water. It is a part that for once no one can mistake for autobiography: he drives a red Porsche and wants to move to LA. But it may be autobiographical in other ways. Anything Else is rather an optimistic picture, despite the apocalyptic jokes: the Jason Biggs character cleanses his life of pretence and disastrous relationships and moves on to some sort of contentment. I went to see it on the first Sunday evening following its release - and there were only about 30 others in the cinema. </p> <p>The real buzz is for his next film, completed not long before he arrived in London and already being lined up for the autumn film festivals. He describes Melinda and Melinda as both a dramatic and comic film, telling the same story from two perspectives. It features Will Ferrell, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Radha Mitchell, the latter replacing Winona Ryder at the eleventh hour and tipped by Allen for great things. In WASP 04, Scarlett Johansson replaced Kate Winslet shortly before shooting began, a switch that required the character to change nationality. 'It was not a problem,' Allen says. 'It took about an hour.' </p> <p>As we relocate for the fourth time I ask Allen what he enjoys most about filmmaking, and he says 'not the filming. I like the writing and the editing. When I get bored with writing, I can stop and finish the next day, and when I'm editing I have my own private room in New York, I have all my music, and it could be 95 degrees outside or zero, and I'm functioning.' </p> <p>What he likes most about filming is the improvement actors bring to his scripts. 'There is a lot of improvisation. I make up things all the time, and I encourage the actors to do the same. The first thing I tell the actors is \"Disregard the script - if you want to drop lines, change lines, improvise, lengthen or shorten something just do it and if you're getting anything wrong I'll tell you.\"' Brian Cox said recently that he found Allen a very fast director but the freedom Allen gave him was rather intimidating. 'Woody will say, \"You know, it would be nice if I could recognise some of my own words, but that's OK...\"' </p> <p>Ten years ago, when I first met him, I reminded Allen of something he'd once written: he'd said that if he could live his whole life again he'd do it just the same but he wouldn't read Beowulf. I wondered what he'd change in reality. He said he would have liked to have entered a more physical profession, perhaps ballet dancing. </p> <p>Ten years on, he says: 'It would be like having a re-shoot. Whenever I do a re-shoot for a scene the new scene is always better, and this would be the same with my life. I only wish I could do a re-shoot. I would rather that my talent had been a musical one. I would rather have been a great instrumentalist. Or when I did What's New Pussycat? in 1965, my first movie, in retrospect I regret not staying and living in Paris. Living in Paris was a very happy experience. I thought, \"What if I never go home? What if I stay in Paris, I love this city.\" I wonder in retrospect if I would have enjoyed that more... making films in France.' </p> <p>The sun was disappearing for him again; there was another career move to make. I asked him what he'd still like to achieve in his life. 'Besides death in sleep? I'd like to keep happy and play with the kids and be with my wife. I've never known great family life since I was an adult, but now I do and it's meaningful to me. I would like to keep healthy and make a great movie. I would love to be able to do that, but I don't think that's going to happen any more. If I keep working, I think it's possible that I could do a great movie some day by accident.'</p>",
  "<p>The television networks are awash with harridans. Stick-thin dieticians telling us our poo is the wrong colour; bland designers making us paint everything beige; laughably-dressed posh birds mocking what we wear and of course the lovely Aggie Mackenzie and Kim Woodburn with their rubber gloves and swabs checking out the germs in our kitchens. Aggie has known me long enough to know I believe in a pinch of dirt being a damn sight more healthy than Dettoxing everything in sight, but not everyone would agree with me. Including most health inspectors. </p> <p>The fact is that food poisoning incidents in the home kitchen double during the summer months. Here at OFM we decided to send a professional public health inspector (rather than a woman in fur-trimmed Marigolds) to check out what killer bugs lie behind the average 'clean' domestic kitchen. Rather than risking my own dinner party invitations being politely turned down, we delegated The Observer Food Monthly's own Andrew Purvis. </p> <p>If there is only one thing our kitchens need less than a dose of salmonella it's the threat of another TV cook. Until our increasingly desperate TV moguls come up with a presenter with the natural ease of Jamie or the unashamed sexiness of Nigella it looks as if we may have to import a few as a temporary measure. Regular visitors to the US will know Padma Lakshmi's (aka Mrs Salman Rushdie) show and cookbook. Yes, she looks good on camera - not to mention this month's cover - but can she cook? Perhaps all this is a warning to us to stay out of the kitchen for a while. </p> <p>From hereon OFM goes alfresco. We have all the best addresses at which to eat outdoors, a sample of summer vegetarian cooking from the Gate restaurant's new cookbook and a handful of ideas from me as to what to make for lunch in the garden. We also have Alex Renton returning to the island of Tiree, to relive his Scottish childhood holidays hunting snails, lobsters and crab while Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall swaps his gumboots for flippers and slices sashimi on a boat deck in the Seychelles.

  "<p><strong>Leo 23 Jul-22 Aug:</strong> Prepare for a slower pace as Mars bids you au revoir and Mercury rakes over old business in your 'scope's money sector for, oh, weeks on end. You're at the 'later' stage of 'Live now pay later', a maxim surely coined by a Leo. The atmosphere on Planet Lion may not be as grandly theatrical as in recent weeks, but, until the 24th, you're still the one with the Sun. Blaze on. </p> <p><strong>Virgo 23 Aug-22 Sep:</strong> Like Lewis Carroll's white rabbit, you're late, you're late, for a very important date. Your planetary ruler is at a standstill in your sign, the clock is running slow and the traffic even slower. Any point asking a Virgo not to fret over things like this, that you can't fix? Thought not. For the next three weeks you have to double back, double-check your facts and perhaps take a trip down memory lane. </p> <p><strong>Libra 23 Sep-23 Oct:</strong> Show some profile. When your planetary ruler is peaking atop your solar chart (as now), a twirl in the spotlight does your reputation no harm whatsoever. Venus in command makes assets of self-presentation (go ahead, pose) and your killer diplomatic touch. Mercury stuck out the way implies you probably aren't fully in any information loop, however - maintain a knowing smile and keep others guessing just how much you know. </p> <p><strong>Scorpio 24 Oct-21 Nov:</strong> Money and public acclaim (or notoriety) don't always hold hands, but there should be fat rewards for any career coups now. As Mercury turns awkward for three weeks on Tuesday, expect delays - in fact, ask for them - before you ink any deals. By the same token, a few cancelled social events aren't the end of the world, or the end of a budding affair. Keep your phone fully charged.</p> <p><strong>Sagittarius 22 Nov-21 Dec:</strong> Shrug off the heel-draggers and nay sayers at work - for every niggling set-back there is a moment of opportunity, especially for birthdays of 11 to 12 December. Just keep scheming and patiently see what transpires between here and November. Those of you caught between homes may likewise have to hang on a few weeks before deliverance (key birthdays in November). Faith in the future - normally an easily worn attribute for Centaurs - is now a challenge. </p> <p><strong>Capricorn 22 Dec-19 Jan:</strong> If you're travelling any time this month, check your tickets and double-label your luggage which, with Mercury in contrary mood in your ninth house, is otherwise destined for Alaska (maybe you should join it there). This week's double-shift of Mars and Venus, meanwhile, reminds you that, while Capricorns are tough old goats, you can also be a jaunty soldier of fortune when you're so inclined. Hold on to that mood, sailor. </p> <p><strong>Aquarius 20 Jan-19 Feb:</strong> Other people are a mystery sometimes, n'est-ce pas? Even more bafflingly, it's the ones with whom you are tightest who most confound expectations. Use the next couple of days to make clear what is mutually expected; after that, the wires are likely to get hopelessly tangled. Money is, as is its way, high up on the agenda, but with one of your planets, Saturn, so well sited, practical issues bend to your intention. </p> <p><strong>Pisces 20 Feb-20 Mar:</strong> The more you can dislocate from your professional agenda and embrace your personal passions, the better. Submerging in therapeutic mud, strolling in your garden of delights, or floating your boat on a sea of romantic possibilities are what your 'scope has in mind. Despite the intractability, perhaps contrariness, of significant others, next weekend is wonderful for meeting those of similar mind and heart. Don't miss out. </p> <p><strong>Aries 21 Mar-19 Apr:</strong> Even a red-blooded Aries such as yourself (just speculating) can't maintain a frantic pace all the time. As Mars (your personal planet) moves on just as Mercury (your personal clerk) clocks off - both on Tuesday - it's a fair bet you'll be leaking energy thereafter. A plunge into the healing waters of your spa of choice - bathrooms and municipal pools are included - is what your 'scope suggests.</p> <p><strong>Taurus 20 Apr-20 May:</strong> Feeling expansive? Jupiter, planet of the big idea (and large meal), is currently the star turn of your 'scope, and is shining a can-do light on your plans for world domination (and for another slice of that delicious pie).

  "<p>This column is the hub of my working week - everything else is fitted around it. Each week I sit down and sort of write you a letter - although I don't know who you are. Just occasionally I meet some of you or you write to me, and if you say nice things about this column that counts for as much as anything in my working life. I am pathetically easily flattered. </p> <p>But we hardly ever talk. So, after 10 years, this is the first time that I am responding to your specific gardening concerns. </p> <p>When I started to write this column, I realised that the only way that I could work was to write about my own experiences and concerns. I am entirely self-taught, which means that my day-to-day gardening in my own back yard is my centre of knowledge. My gardening life is likely to be pretty much like yours, if perhaps a little more so, given that I am completely obsessed by it. But as I get older and more experienced, I still feel hopelessly ignorant about too much. I suppose I have now learnt enough to know how little I know. </p> <p>Obviously, I am sorry if you were not one of the few I have replied to here. Some questions I rejected because they were general and others required only a brief sentence or name, but I could have easily answered 10 or 12 different sets and have been as representative.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My wife and I are keen - if a little inexperienced - gardeners and last year we bought and planted out an established (3ft high) olive tree (Olea europaea). Last year's long, hot summer brought to bear a handful of tiny fruit that never developed. We live in Cambridgeshire and have reasonably mild winters. Our garden is sheltered and is east facing and the tree itself is planted on the southern side. Am I holding out too much hope that our olive tree will bear fruit? All references I have found tend to suggest that trees rarely bear fruit outside the Mediterranean. <br><strong>Neil and Lois Rowlands</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you have fantasies of pressing your own oil a move to Tuscany would be quicker and cheaper. But it should be straightforward enough to raise an interesting and handsome plant. They like a very well-drained, light, alkaline soil and need very little water. I would definitely grow it in a pot that can be taken outside for the summer and then brought in under glass for winter, mixing a peat-free potting compost 50:50 with grit. They are tender and should be kept frost-free as far as possible, but do not make the mistake of heating them in winter and keeping the air good and dry. In spring, at the first sign of growth, water them with a seaweed solution and repeat this monthly until autumn. Put them outside at the beginning of May, but have some fleece handy in case there is a late frost, and bring them back under cover around the end of September. As with citrus, only water when the soil is bone dry. And if you do take the Tuscany option, I'm up for a bottle of the first pressing.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have had such a problem with slugs this year. They have decimated flowers and veg. My lupins didn't flower because they'd been so badly eaten; every delphinium I plant gets reduced to twigs within 48 hours; pretty much every vegetable I've planted has been eaten as soon as it pokes its head above the soil. I try to garden totally organically and I am thinking of getting some nematodes - is there a best time of year to introduce them and do they need re-applying at a certain interval? <br><strong>Yours hopefully, Alice Fox, Shipley</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> There is no easy answer to this, Alice. Slugs are with most of us and they are here to stay. Global warming means that they overwinter much more than they used to and in any realistic world we have to learn to share the garden with them. </p> <p>Slug pellets have very limited use and are harmful to the garden's ecobalance, so they are not an option. I have found various barriers, such as beer traps, grit, eggshells or even human hair, to be a waste of time, although old copper piping worked as a barrier around seedlings outside.</p> <p>All the following things will help. The parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a minute worm that infects the host with a fatal disease and, rather gratifyingly, eats the slug up from the inside. Yum. You buy them live, mixed with a clay-based agent, which must be diluted with water. The solution is then watered on to the area you wish to protect. The soil must be warm and wet for them to work and they need time to breed; normally, they only stay effective for about six weeks. Ducks, hedgehogs and beetles eat slugs and thrushes love a snail. A sawn-off plastic bottle over young seedlings works well but looks horrid. Rotovating bare soil in winter chops up some slugs and exposes others to hungry birds. </p> <p>But I prefer a more general approach. My own garden is riddled with slugs and yet I have come to an acceptable level of accommodation by working out various avoidance and diversionary tactics. To start with, I would highly recommend getting a greenhouse or at least a cold frame that can be kept more or less slug-free. I sow as much as possible in containers and grow the seedlings in this protected zone. After hardening off outside (in another area with a daily anti-slug patrol), I plant them out. By this time they are both coarse enough and growing quickly enough to resist being eaten. This system works beautifully for things like lettuce, beans, or tender annuals like cosmos. </p> <p>The other important factors are timing and feeding. Slugs like young, soft tissue, so make it available for as short a time as possible. Harden the plants off really well before planting out, so that they are acclimatised and will grow quickly. I often pick a lettuce that has a dozen small slugs secreted about it, although the leaves appear practically untouched. It means everything must be carefully washed, but that is an acceptable price to pay. </p> <p>Resist sowing or planting tender plants too soon. It is better to wait another week or so than risk losing plants, and do not feed plants more than is necessary. Feed the soil, not the plant. This will avoid a spurt of soft, sappy growth, which slugs love. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I had grown a magnificent 8ft onopordum from seed and then the Cornish gales came. I noticed that you had them as focal points in the beds at Berryfield. How do you stake them without it looking ugly?<br><strong>Jenny Blincoe, Fowey, Cornwall</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Onopordums are the prickliest, biggest, baddest thistle there is. They look fantastic, are easy to grow, and self-seed, so you only ever need buy a couple to have a supply for ever. But they are an absolute bugger to support. I get round it by using fencing stakes and thick hop twine, and even then I usually leave it too late and a storm sends them sprawling. In short, use the thickest stake you can buy and try and hide it as best you can. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> The apples on our Bramley apple tree, which we planted eight years ago, suffer badly with bitter pit. We pruned it hard back, but still the crop suffered from the brown pit marks. Is there anything we can do to remedy the situation? We have a warm and dry walled garden with several other fruit and apple trees. <br><strong>Jackie Sayer</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I like the sound of a warm and dry walled garden but therein, I suspect, lies your problem. But first three cheers for planting a Bramley. They make the best of garden trees - becoming solid and avuncular without overwhelming even a small garden and are perfect for a swing. Also, we must all fight for our orchards and mature apple trees. </p> <p>As a result of the recent withdrawal of EU subsidy, farmers are now grubbing out orchards that are extremely old, extremely beautiful and almost irreplaceable. It is a monstrous piece of eco-vandalism that is a result of the crazy CAP, tyrannical supermarkets and our willingness to tolerate cheap, tasteless food.</p> <p>Back to bitter pit. You can recognise this by the sunken pockmarks on the fruit surface. Then, when you peel the apple there are brown bits on the flesh beneath each pit. The main problem is that it dramatically reduces the apple's keeping time. It is caused by a calcium deficiency in the fruit itself and is induced by water shortage. Hence the clue in your warm and dry walled garden. If it is planted up against the warm and dry wall, it will be drier still, as any wall sucks away moisture from the ground. </p> <p>Clearly, a lot of extra watering will sort this out, but it is just as important to reduce the competition for water by clearing an area a metre in radius right round the tree and mulching this thickly with straw, grass cuttings or wood chips. Manure or compost will tend to induce too much soft growth without increasing fruit production, but it will not do any harm if it is the most convenient material to use. </p> <p>Some varieties, such as 'Newton Wonder', 'Bramley's Seedling' and 'Egremont Russet', are more susceptible to bitter pit than others, so consider an alternative to these if you live in an area of low rainfall or have a warm, dry, walled garden. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> How do you get around the problem of oriental poppies leaving holes in your planting? They are a large plant until mid-June, but then you're left with a big gap in the border when you cut them back after flowering. I have three clumps in my mixed border (of 'Karine' and 'Patty's Plum') which grow to nearly a metre in diameter each, but afterwards I'm left with a crown of about 20cm and a big bare patch all around. This year I managed to buy some tall-ish bedding - salvias and snapdragons - and I have planted these around the crowns, but I am still not convinced this is the best solution. What do you suggest? <br><strong>Sam Grover, Bristol</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hey Sam, let's call it a space rather than a hole, and an opportunity rather than a problem. I plant tender annuals into the opportunity as soon as I have chopped the poppies back. This year it was tithonias and cosmos. Inevitably, both sit without doing much for a while, but the light and space give them a chance to get growing rather than having to compete with other plants. Buying bedding is a good solution, but sowing some well ahead of time so that you have choice and control is the best solution of all. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> We have a wooden pergola with a lattice down one side (about 10 years old) which is covered by some gorgeous New Dawn roses. The rose, of course, twines through the lattice and around the pergola and the wood in the pergola is rotting. We would like to replace it with a more robust version, probably oak. But how do we replace it without having to severely prune the rose? I have attached a photo of the rose in full glory. <br><strong>Madeleine Haines</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Thanks for the picture Madeleine, and yes, you are right, it is lovely and it is swamped. But this is not a pergola question so much as a pruning one. You can't have both rose and pergola as they are, so the rose will have to be radically hacked back from the wooden support. The good news is that this will not damage it and, if two or three healthy young shoots can be salvaged at a reasonable length, then it should do it a lot of good, with it growing back in full flowering glory the following year. </p> <p>The secret is to never let the growing shoots wind themselves around the support. Instead, you must attach them to it so they are resting against it. Then they can be untied and gently lowered. </p> <p>There is also a pruning regime that allows you to annually correct and repair the trend towards entanglement. This should be done as soon as the rose finishes flowering - which in the case of New Dawn could be well into October. The idea is to take out some of the old wood each year, pruning it right down to the base of the plant, leaving behind a tracery of uncluttered straight stems attached to the outside of the archway. Reduce the lateral growth from these stems so that nothing is touching or crossing. Do this every year and the plant will remain controllable, as well as renewing itself completely every three or four years. On the other hand, you could let it froth and foam freely, just sniping off the bits that catch in your hair and accepting a total revamp every 10 years or so.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Our four-year-old rosemary bush suddenly and spontaneously passed away. It stood among other shrubs by a north-facing wall. Should we try again in the same place, or move to the south-facing fence, together with the more exotic shrubs? <br><strong>Richard Bateman, Walsall </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Rosemary is surprisingly hardy and will take winter frosts well below -10C, but it hates sitting in wet soil, especially in winter. Like all Mediterranean herbs, rosemary needs as much sun as you have to give it, and a north-facing wall is probably the worst possible place to put one. It also thrives in very poor, well-drained soil, so it can easily be killed with kindness. Start again in a sunny spot, adding lots of drainage (sharpsand, grit, even rough stones) and do not give it any compost, manure or fertiliser. Oh, and it's a plant, Richard. It did not 'pass away'. It died. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have a problem growing sweet peas. They grow tall but never produce many flowers, even though I pick them. What soil, feed and position are the best to get good results?<br><strong>Sally Roberts</strong></p> <p>Each year I raise sweet peas from seed and plant good little plants out in spring - and each year, after a first flush of lovely long-stemmed blooms, the second flush can only produce flowers on short stems of about 3in long. Am I starving them? <br><strong>Jan Church</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> First, Sally, do you pinch out the leader when they are a few inches tall? This is important, as it promotes side shoots - which bear the flowers - rather than strong upright growth. You might have to do this several times before planting out so you have a bushy, short plant that needs no support rather than a spindly, floppy affair. </p> <p>Sweet peas need rich, moisture-retentive soil so sow the seed in a good potting compost (I add some sieved garden compost, too) but do not over water until they have developed a leaf or two, and then never let them fully dry out. They like cool conditions, so semi-shade is ideal. I grow mine up wigwams of hazel bean sticks and before I make each support I dig a pit under the site and fill it with garden compost. This feeds the brutes and acts as a sponge to hold water for them. Having very rich soil and lots of water will make for bushier, healthier plants with lots more flowers. As for your short stems, Jan, this is because the first flower has had all the energy of the plant focused on to it. Professional growers pinch out all side branches and tendrils save for one, to try and get as long a stem as possible. For most of us, the shorter stems of the subsequent batch of flowers is a price worth paying for the extra blooms. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My front garden is full of English marigolds and now I would like some in my back garden, but garden centres seem to sell only French marigolds. How could I produce new plants from the seeds of my plants, and when is the best time to do this?<br><strong> Carol Mooney, Blackpool</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The English or 'pot' marigold is calendula and self-seeds prolifically, which is why, in your front garden, they have multiplied over the years. The easiest way of getting them into the back garden is either to collect seed from these in late summer, keep it in the fridge over winter and sow them in March, or move some seedlings next spring, while they are still small. Otherwise most seed companies will supply them from a garden centre or by mail order. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Which pot plants would you suggest for an urban balcony? It is southwest-facing on the second floor and susceptible to prevailing winds. A cantilever roof shields the balcony from rain, necessitating hand watering with (hard) tap water. <br><strong>Jo Langley, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It sounds as though you have an ideal position, facing southwest to get the afternoon and evening sun, sheltered from cold winds and with a cover to protect from the worst weather. Even warm wind is desiccating, so a screen would help - ideally a glass or Perspex one, so it does not block out too much light. A strong balcony can take an awful lot of pots of varying sizes. But it will mean daily watering or investing in a simple irrigation system. Actually, I think hand watering is good because it becomes part of your intimate acquaintance with the plants.</p> <p>Potting compost becomes a big issue on a balcony. Ideally it is water-retentive, nutritious, but also drains well and allows a healthy root run. Avoid any peat-based compost - I would recommend an organic soil-based potting compost or one based on crushed bark. And make sure that every pot has crocks or broken polystyrene at the base to help drainage - very few plants survive sitting in water. </p> <p>If you do not use peat - and I strongly urge you not to - then you will find it difficult to grow many ericaceous plants such as heathers, rhododendrons, camellias or pieris. However, most plants grow in most situations in most soils.</p> <p>I would go for a seasonal succession, starting with pots of snowdrops and crocus, perhaps with some daffodils coming through. Tulips look wonderful in pots. If possible I would have a number of smaller pots, each with a single variety. These can be left tucked away for the summer. Geraniums will do well, and you could have flowering shrubs of a hundred different types, from ribes to roses as well as topiary in box - which is very happy in pots - for green structure. A friend of mine successfully grew a wide range of veg on a balcony in Gray's Inn Road, including lettuce crops, runner beans, tomatoes and even potatoes, and I would certainly do this with growbags and a couple of large pots. Chillies and peppers are ideal for a sunny balcony, although have some fleece handy in case of cold late-summer nights. I'd also suggest some herbs - rosemary and thyme in one pot and some annuals like basil and parsley in another. </p> <p>Finally, whatever you grow, you'll need to supply some extra feed, and I suggest a weekly watering of a liquid seaweed solution. As for strength and regularity, the best advice is: weakly weekly.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I have been married for a long time and we have four children. I love my husband very much, am very attracted to him and enjoy sex with him. However, I have discovered in recent years that he buys literature featuring spanking and S&amp;M, and he's also looked at this on the internet. The 'problem' is that I can't deal with this. My initial reaction was one of shock and hurt, and I still feel as though this is some kind of shortcoming of mine. We have discussed this at length and I never feel my husband acknowledges my feelings. He maintains that many couples embrace erotic pornographic materials, films, etc, in their relationship and can't really understand why I don't. There is now a complete impasse: he says I am policing his mind and exhibiting disgust towards him. I, on the other hand, feel this is poisoning my life and am retreating from an intimate relationship with him. What can I do? How can I accept my husband's interests? At the moment there's no choice: he expects me to change my view. It's also very lonely, as I can't discuss this with anyone. Please give me some of your wise advice.</strong></p> <p>You poor thing. It's always quite a shock to find the person we feel we know intimately has desires we can't police. You're in correspondence with a control freak here, so don't think I don't understand. It's all too common to presume that just because you've spent decades of your life with someone, you can scrutinise their thought process as clearly as Superman sees Lois Lane's underwear. Nobody's imagination is available for x-ray. It's a secret retreat that can't be invaded; we share it or withhold it as we see fit. We're all full of surprises, and your husband is no exception. Ironically, he may understand you better than you do him. He seems to have judged your response to his covert sexual predilection rather accurately, and resolved until recently not to reveal it. </p> <p>You can allow this discovery of yours to poison your relationship, or you could sit back, relax and ponder the merits of a bit of spanking. </p> <p>You say your husband offers you no choice and expects you to change your view. I suggest that he's merely being honest. He knows that such material will continue to stimulate him and isn't prepared to lie about it to spare your feelings. Could it be that your reaction to your husband's newly revealed sexual predilection has more to do with loss of control than it does any prudery on your part? If so, as the old adage goes: if you can't beat him, why not join him? Although in this instance, you can potentially have the best of both worlds. I'm constantly being written to by people in long-term relationships bemoaning the lack of spice in their sex lives. Yet here you are being offered the sexual equivalent of a vindaloo, and you won't even try a forkful. </p> <p>I suggest that you sample the produce before turning your nose up. Studied from a less threatened vantage point, your recent discovery offers you both a potential passport to newfound pleasures. For your husband, it's an opportunity to expand his relationship with you by sharing something deeply personal, and for you the chance to embark on a journey of discovery. Don't let insecurity or inhibitions hold you back. You haven't failed your husband because he's stimulated by the idea of some lightweight S&amp;M. You'll only fail him if you refuse even to consider experimenting. Indeed, you may find that your current antagonism toward his sexual hobby reflects more on your own feelings of inadequacy than your spirit of adventure. </p> <p>It may seem like a contradiction, but a little consensual spanking never hurt anyone. That's not to say you should feel forced into any kind of sexual activity you feel uncomfortable with, but what's wrong with a bit of experimentation? It sounds like you have enjoyed a good, solid marriage up until now, so surely you can afford to try something new and daring? You might find you like strutting around in 6in razor-sharp stilettos with your husband on a lead and chain. If nothing else, it's a good way to wrangle a new pair of shoes out of him. </p> <p>Of course I'm being slightly frivolous here, but things could be so much worse. How delightful in later life to stumble on a ready-made path to sexual revitalisation while all your friends are settling into bed in their velour nighties. Your husband has been pursuing a sexual life of the mind; count yourself lucky, as plenty of people wouldn't have stopped there. Even if your tastes don't run to being transformed into a whip-wielding dominatrix, I'm sure you'll find something to excite you in the S&amp;M repertoire. If not, you can always compromise by giving him a good slap every time you stumble on his pornography. That way you'll both derive a little pleasure.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mariella Frostrup will be away on maternity leave for the next three months.

  "<p>I have always loved clothes. I had my earliest fashion moment when I was five years old, standing in my parents' garden, wearing my mum's needle stilettos and a large floppy hat. It went from there. Through school, I worked a number of different haircuts and colours; at college, I spent as much time working out my clubbing wardrobe (always on a tight budget) as I did studying. </p> <p>I've always enjoyed challenges and problem solving. I remember my first week on a fashion journalism and promotion course at Saint Martins. For our first project, we were asked to create some outfits. Everyone else designed theirs to fit a size 8 to 10 model - I decided to design a collection for French and Saunders. My illustrations looked like they had been crushed and stretched, next to everyone else's. </p> <p>After working for more than 12 years in fashion - photographing models, readers and celebrities - I've notched up a long list of experiences, and learnt how to overcome fashion dilemmas and disasters. In that capacity, I suppose I might be considered an expert. </p> <p>One of my most grounding and humbling moments - which brought me crashing off fabulous Planet Fashion with a loud bump - was when I was a guest fashion editor on the first series of BBC's Style Challenge. My make-over subject was blind. I had to gain the confidence of someone who had never seen a dress, let alone one in burnt-orange velvet. But she loved the feel of the fabric, and eventually left the studio wearing that colourful dress. There is more to fashion than meets the eye.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> If money was no object and you could buy one item for the new season, what would it be and why? And where can I get it?<br><strong> Marina Spade, Lancashire</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It would have to be a showstopper coat, like the Prada jewel-embellished, long, black, brushed-leather coat (Prada 020 7647 5000). Imagine the luxury of having a coat for just one season, and then, once it becomes too last year, you frame it - objet d'art style - and hang it on your wall. </p> <p>With a great coat, it doesn't matter what you wear underneath - just your underwear, if you like. One fashion editor I know bought a very sexy Balenciaga rain mac at great expense. She loved it so much that she wore it as a mac-dress, exactly as the designer suggested.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I keep reading about Diane von Furstenberg's wrap dresses. Are they really that great? And where can I buy one? <br><strong>Kaulai Harwood-Scorer, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I am an avid fan; the wonderful thing about her dresses is that almost one size fits all. Diane von Furstenberg seems to always choose the right fabric, and they're ideal for travelling in and very easy to wear - you literally wrap, tie and leave your house. The wrap-and-drape cut is incredibly flattering. Buy one now - you will never regret it. Main stockists are the DvF shop (020 7221 1120), Harvey Nichols, Browns and Matches. You can also buy online at <a href=\"http://www.dvflondon.com\">www.dvflondon.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I've moved into a new, smaller flat, and my wardrobe seems to have multiplied. Any storage ideas? I hate those flat-pack boxes you have to assemble. <br><strong>Julia Moss, Melrose</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Pay a visit to the Holding Company (020 8445 2888); they specialise in storage-saving ideas and solutions. Some of the designs even come ready assembled so there's no messing around with those tedious 'Slide tab A into slot B' nightmares. My advice on shoes is to give Perspex racks a miss, and go straight to porthole boxes: they're sturdy, large, and have clear windows, so you can see what's inside without having to empty the contents across the bedroom floor first.</p> <p>Never buy a cheap clothing rail. Hang more then a wisp of chiffon from them and they collapse or tilt like the Titanic. Invest in a heavy-duty one from Morplan, from \u00a334.99 (0800 451 122), or where space permits, buy a wardrobe. It looks neater, and you don't get the dust problem.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Is it OK for me to wear baggy jeans, quite low down, fitted T-shirts and a silver chain around my neck, and shave my head, at 29? I look remarkably like Sol, who used to be in Hollyoaks. Am I growing old disgracefully? Should I cut my losses and start wearing slacks and jumpers, and let my grey hair grow through? PS I think I carry the Sol look off quite well, but I am still 29. <br><strong>Michael Ellis, Cornwall</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Of course it's OK! Look at Beckham. Lots of silver chains on him, and he's a style icon. And Brad Pitt is 40, and he endorses the tight T-shirt - never seen him in slacks and jumpers. (Though, come to think of it, if you can pull off a loincloth, as Pitt can, you can pull off anything.) Even so, there's no need to worry about this kind of thing for at least another 20 years. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Will the Annie Hall look really catch on next season, as shown on the catwalks and in trend predictions? I hope so. <br><strong>Aya Sekine</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The answer to that is yes. Karen Walker showed a very Annie Hall meets Ali McGraw collection, brimming with wearable pieces. Martin Margiela always does a good take on masculine tailoring for women, too, and Diane Keaton would be proud of his baggy, wide-legged trousers. As for the high street, I've already seen pinstripe men's suit-style trousers on the rail in H&amp;M, and you can bet your Manolos that Topshop will pick up this trend faster than you can say 'Woody Allen'. Ralph Lauren - stalwart of American dressing - did the costumes for the film and is still one of the best places to look for an all-American take on the timeless English classics, particularly for tweedy jackets. (Ralph Lauren 020 7535 4600)</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My 16-year-old daughter has been approached by a model scout from a big agency. Until now she had wanted to do her A levels and go to university to do medicine. Now she is having second thoughts. Is she too young, and in your experience is this a good career choice? </p> <p>Already, the scout has suggested she lose a bit of weight.<br><strong> Martha Gulling, Bath</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> This is a question I am frequently asked and it's a very difficult one to answer. Your daughter's not too young, no, but if she becomes a model you will have to chaperone her on castings and jobs until she's 18 years old. If she really wants to have a go at it, maybe you should set a length of time for her to try it, so that she can see if she likes it, and if she's successful. Maybe a gap year from her studies, or the next summer holidays (although this is a quiet time in the fashion calendar). Alternatively, you could suggest that she waits another year. If the agency wants her now, they'll still want her then.</p> <p>Two things to remember: 1) make sure the model agency in question is a reputable one and a member of the AMA (Association of Model Agencies); and 2) don't pay any money up front. If the agency wants to represent your daughter, they will invest in her portfolio and pay for it themselves.</p> <p>As for long-term career considerations, I think it's always good for young models to have other strings to their bow. Your daughter could model through the school holidays and at weekends and continue her studies the rest of the time. </p> <p>As for losing weight - this is a dangerous area. At such an impressionable age, no young girl should be pressured into it. If the model shape is not your natural physique, simply don't go into the industry. </p> <p>I would never advocate shedding 'just a few pounds' to make it as a model. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I am sturdy of ankle and chunky in the calf region. Which autumn shoes are likely to flatter my affliction when worn with a knee-length skirt? I don't want to wear boots; I want to look feminine.<br><strong> Natalie King, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You're blessed this season. Contrary to popular belief, the ankle strap does not draw attention to the ankle in a negative way, but rather frames it, giving the leg more definition. If you are choosing a flat shoe, look for a deep, shaped toe. If you're a larger shoe size, it keeps your feet in proportion to your body. Some round-toe shoes can make it look like your toes have been amputated. A little toe cleavage is always good - but trial and error may be the best answer. If you're looking for a shoe with a heel, a T-bar style offers further distraction from the sturdiest of ankles.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I was flicking through the Vogue catwalk round-up and saw that capes are a trend for this season. I'm just about to go shopping for my winter coat - shall I buy a cape instead? <br><strong>Stephanie Cushing, Sheffield</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Unless you are in the two-coat financial bracket, I'd recommend trying the high street - the cape should only be a second coat. Miss Selfridge has a great pink and grey wool check cape for \u00a350, while Reiss has a black zip-up version with a detachable feather brooch for \u00a395.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> You have the best job in the world. How can I become a fashion editor? <br><strong>Jamie Marks, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I can't deny that I love my job. Even during the unglamorous moments - unpacking and packing clothes, travelling with three suitcases and six holdalls, battling with all weather conditions - it always seems worth it. </p> <p>I did a fashion journalism and promotion degree, but I know other editors who studied specific journalism courses, or even did language-based degrees. Central Saint Martins runs a Fashion Journalism MA. Try to get work experience at the first available opportunity - the more practical experience you have, the better. You probably won't be paid for this experience, so try and start while you're at college. You might need to support yourself with an evening or weekend job. Think of it as an investment in your future. During your work experience, build up a contact book of photographers, agents, PRs, editors and stylists. </p> <p>This job is about who you know, as well as what you know. Make an impression and someone might invite you back, even offer you a job. Don't be disheartened if a job isn't exactly what you want to do - any foot in the door is good.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I am a 55-year-old, size 18 woman. My daughter is getting married in October and I haven't a clue what to wear. I don't want to be the awful mother-of-the-bride-in-salmon monstrosity. </p> <p>Ideally, I'd like to recycle the outfit, or elements of it, again. My budget, however, is not limitless. <br><strong>Linda Jackson-Jones, Hertfordshire</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Avoid print - much too mother of the bride. </p> <p>A two-piece suit is value for money; you can mix and match both halves later on. Think about your silhouette: don't buy anything that cuts you right down the middle. On a larger figure, longer lengths are more elegant and slimming. There are plenty of fantastic dresses with long-line jackets around - you can wear the jacket at a later date with trousers, and dress it up with a sequin scarf from Oasis (\u00a322) for the evening. Monsoon is wedding guests' heaven, and Anna Scholz has great things in this season's essential colour: purple (Anna Scholz 020 8964 3040). </p> <p>Fenwicks has a selection of designers all within browsing distance of each other - but keep some money to spend on accessories. There is a big revival of embellishment in the form of brooches, but on the hat front, less is currently more - forget big, ridiculous confections. Try Accessorize or John Lewis for a more delicate comb with a small plume of feathers attached - something you can easily recycle for a cocktail party.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I absolutely love the jewelled clothes I've seen in magazines for autumn/winter. Where can I look for clothes inspired by this trend with a less costly price tag? <br><strong>C Bass</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The easiest way to recreate this look on a budget is to buy a selection of diamante brooches and cluster them together on a chunky belted cardigan. My favourite costume jewellery on the high street is from Oasis, Diva at Miss Selfridge, Freedom at Topshop and Accessorize. Alternatively, if you are handy with the fabric glue and needle, you can customise any neckline with a scattering of diamante gemstones. Try John Lewis or Creative Beadcraft (020 7629 9964), or any good haberdashers for a wide range of stick-and-sew-on sparkle.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I recently lost what I can only describe as the backbone of my wardrobe: my car was stolen with my suitcase in the boot. Now I am left without all my favourite pieces: my most slimming black trousers, perfect black skirt and top, boots, all my make-up, the list goes on. Should I try and replace the same stuff or see it as an opportunity to revamp my wardrobe? Isabel Rose, Northamptonshire</p> <p><strong>A</strong> I am sorry for your loss - how awful! But think positively. Look at it as a wardrobe clear-out. </p> <p>Some people pay lifestyle consultants vast amounts for that service. You need to replace the staples of your wardrobe - anything that works as basics. A great pair of black trousers is always good, but perhaps you should use this as a chance to branch out, and try grey or pinstripe. Then find a fabulous pair of boots that work with a skirt, with a dress and trousers together, or with jeans. They're worth spending a little more on - I like to justify buying expensive items with a breakdown per wear. Suddenly, a guilty designer splurge can average only a few pounds per outing.</p> <p>The chiffon blouse is a great piece that crosses from day to evening. Accessories play an important part in next season's looks, and the high street has great embellished styles for the autumn. The sequin scarf doubles as a belt, and livens up any outfit, even a plain vest and jeans.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Why are the models you use so skinny? <br><strong>Mrs Hessie, Hampshire</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> This has to be the most frequently asked question, and one I feel needs explaining. We shoot our photographic stories about six months in advance and therefore the clothes we use are designer samples borrowed from press offices, which only come in a size 8 to 10. As much as I would love to have the power to change things rather than go along with the way the fashion industry is run, the samples do determine the size of the models I use. </p> <p>In the past, I have used larger girls. I loved Sophie Dahl (before she got skinny) and I try not to use anorexic-looking girls, but opt instead for well-proportioned, healthy-looking models. I have a responsibility not to promote an image that might make women feel inadequate in any way. Ultimately, it will take a long time to change an industry obsessed with thinness and youth - you can't do it alone. Photographers like Nick Knight have tried to change things with stories like the Sarah Morrison pictures in Vogue, but right now, these always seem to be one-offs.</p>",
  "<p>'If few books are forgivable' (as the psychoanalyst RD Laing prefaced one of his), then so are even fewer of today's newspaper columns. Adding to the compost heap of self-referential drivel produced by the brotherhood and sisterhood of Polly Fillas would be inexcusable, yet it is so hard to be confident that I am any different. I might point to the fact that I worked in a mental hospital for six years as a clinical psychologist, that I have produced many documentaries, that I have written several books and that I have read a great many others. But so what? Lots of people have done lots of things - it does not mean they would necessarily write good columns. I can only fall back on the idea that my mixture of science, clinical knowledge and bigotry might possibly sometimes entertain as well as inform about subjects that I feel passionately about. Alas, facile opinion has often replaced fact, and investigation in newspapers is deeply to be regretted. I must leave it to you to decide whether my efforts are yet another example of this trend.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My life is slipping away, like sand through my hands. If I hear another dinner-party discussion about property prices, I may lose control. I am 'living and partly living' and my life is 'measured out by coffee spoons' (pace Eliot's Prufrock). Is it hopeless?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> No, definitely not. The carapaces of civilisation have been keeping us apart for some time now (as you rightly indicate by your quotations) and at least sometimes, in some respects, things truly have got better. Think of the authenticity of children, and the much greater engagement of many parents with it, compared with the recent past. Think of the emancipation of women, with all its problems; the greater opportunities they have to be themselves. Think of the many couples that once might have stayed together who are happier apart, and of the many other intact ones who are enabled by modern life to explore each other more fully in greater numbers. If that does not work, watch Withnail &amp; I or Life is Sweet.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> After more than 20 years of trying, at 42 I have finally given up on relationships (and even friendships to a large degree) with men. They are not worth the effort! Hating men is not the question. It's more about not being such a mug any more. It's about not accepting inequality any more: economic, financial, social, sexual, emotional, domestic. It's about looking at heterosexual relationships and considering the fact that they have worked (after a fashion) for centuries simply because women have always been forced/prepared to put up with quite a lot. That's enough! My motto is now: 'If they can't consider equality, leave them well alone.' So, what's the answer?<br><strong> Maggie, Folkestone</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Clinically speaking, this is not a sign that you are a loony. As far as I am concerned, Hell is Other People, as Sartre famously encapsulated it, so you have all my sympathy. However, we misanthropists run the risk of transferring our dudgeon on to hated groups, in your case men (in mine, people who got Firsts and Office Politicians). Regarding gender inequality: while I can see that men do still have some unfair advantages (above all, they rarely get left holding the baby), I really doubt it's what it was. For example, the exam-obsessed education system seems to favour girls far more than boys. The answer for you, masturbation apart, is surely to seek out men who have grown up. You may doubt there are any, but in my experience, for instance, there do exist some male divorc\u00e9s of about your age who have actually learnt from the experience and I am sure would make rather good partners.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Could you say a little more about personality disorder, of which you often write? I suspect I have it. I have been 'in therapy' at various times in my life, but I feel worse now than I have ever felt. <br><strong>Charles, York</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The self-preoccupation, grandiosity, fear of relationships, proneness to despair and flaky hopping between people and careers of the personality disordered (PD) is greatly magnified by modern life. We have shifted from a highly structured, collectivist society in which identity was ascribed to us by our gender and class to one in which individualism dominates, with identity achieved through education and profession. In the world of Brief Encounter, there were many certainties and boundaries which helped to limit PD (the same is still true in Singapore and Shanghai, where I have recently been). But in New York or Notting Hill, self-transformation into anyone or anything is not just a possibility - it's a virtual duty. While that does mean a person can become David Bowie (whoever he is), it also means they can be Michelle in Big Brother (whoever she is). Either way, while people with PD may be very entertaining and successful, it's not much of a life. Luckily, it is one of the ailments for which psychoanalysis has been proven to work, so I fear you may have to seek this terribly time-consuming and costly solution. I hate to say it, but you have been to the wrong therapists. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> As I understand things, the human species and our forebears have been social animals for a very, very long time indeed. So why should we think that there might be a conflict between the needs of the individual and the needs of society? The two are surely indivisible. I can only think that the conflict arises because of what we are taught about how to behave - for which I find myself increasingly laying the blame at the door of religion. I used to be ambivalent about it, as it seems to be in decline, but the more I look at the evidence, the more I realise men treat women as illogical and not to be trusted. No wonder we get nowhere fast at work! And there's only one source of that attitude: the Bible and presumably all other male-focused religious doctrine. Is religion as bad a thing as I suspect?<br><strong> Carmen, Oxford</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> For some time now, religion has been a rather tricky problem for social scientists like me. The trouble is that in study after study, people who attend church once a week come out as less likely to suffer depression or unhappiness than those who do not. Since few of us share Tony Blair's enthusiasm for The Almighty, there has not exactly been a torrent of books and papers advocating it. Luckily, we do have a get-out clause in the data: it's not altogether clear why the pious are better off.</p> <p>It could be because they were actually more than averagely screwed up before God came into their life and that they are self-deceivers (opium of the people, etc). It could be that it's not religion which is doing the business for them but the fact that church-goers are much more likely to be actively involved in their communities - a major inoculant against affluenza. Finally, gulp, it could be that there is a God and the righteous shall inherit the earth. Not much has been written supporting the latter hypothesis, but in a world where Blair can still be prime minister after taking us to war under false pretences, anything is possible.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have been taking the antidepressant Seroxat for seven years and I read in the papers that it is addictive. Should I switch to something else?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> While not a pill doctor myself, I know a good deal about this, and would say it is probably all right to carry on. Seroxat is often handed out because the depressed patient is also anxious or sleeping badly, and it is said to be quite good for people with these co-morbidities. As I have written before - resulting in cartloads of email manure from doctors - I tend to think that the least worst modern antidepressant is Lustral. </p> <p>Prozac is now handed out by GPs all the time because it is the first modern drug to have become cheap (out of licence), but I would not recommend that. I know several men who rapidly switched from being earnest, tongue-tied wallflowers at parties to silver-tongued devils on it. Unfortunately, their priapism did not match their pulling power, resulting in some very embarrassing incidents (I also know of some Prozac-fuelled women who started shagging anything that moved after taking the drug).</p> <p>Plenty of people find Seroxat hits the spot, and when it comes to pills, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If you do decide to come off it, the key is to wean yourself gradually. It's not anything like as ghastly as coming off Valium (or fags), and with close monitoring from your doctor you should be able to do so relatively painlessly. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Is this a question?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> If this is an answer, then that is a question (favourite gag when I was at university).</p>",
  "<p>Millions of small savers are stranded in investment funds that managers have closed to new investors. This creates uncertainty about prospects for future growth which savers may be relying on to pay for pensions, endowments or retirement income. </p> <p>The scale of the problem afflicting so-called 'closed' funds was spelt out last month by the Treasury select committee after an investigation into the life insurance and investment industries. The committee's report showed that there is now \u00a3160 billion tied up in these investment vehicles, which are mainly with-profits funds. This represents about half of all with-profits investors. </p> <p>Many household-name companies have closed their funds because they do not want to be in the with-profits business any more or cannot afford to devote the capital these funds need for expansion. The mass closure is a symptom of the financial strain that has affected the life insurance industry in recent years. </p> <p>Throughout the investment industry it is widely believed that, with no incentive to attract new buyers through good performance, the prospects for healthy returns on closed funds is strictly limited. </p> <p>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance has just agreed to sell its \u00a320bn of with-profits funds, which have been closed for two years. The buyer is a private company called Resolution Life, which thinks it can make money out of running them and offer a reasonable return to investors. The arrival of a company such as Resolution, and the interest shown by one or two other life insurers in buying up closed funds, could mean an improvement in prospects for investors. But it is too early to say what the outcome of such sales will be. </p> <p>Many investors in closed with-profits funds need to decide whether to cut and run, and the answer is not yet clear. The main priority for closed with-profits fund managers is to ensure that assets cover the existing liabilities. Typically, this means closed funds hold higher proportions of fixed-interest assets and property and lower proportions of more risky, but historically more rewarding, equities. </p> <p>Ben Willis, of independent financial adviser Chartwell, says: 'Closed funds are managed defensively. While open with-profits funds typically have a decent equity content, closed funds can have low amounts. As equities over the long term tend to deliver the strongest growth, funds with low equity percentages are likely to add no or very low annual bonuses.' </p> <p>Combine this with the eroding impact of inflation and the situation for millions of investors in closed funds can look dire. </p> <p>Cutting their losses and taking the cash elsewhere may look like the obvious option. This would be the case were it not for the exit penalties - known as market value adjustments or reductions (MVRs) - which some life insurance companies impose on those leaving with-profits funds. They can rob deserting policyholders of up to 25 per cent of the value of their investment. </p> <p>Financial advisers say that the purchase of a closed fund might be a false dawn for investors. Tom McPhail, of IFA Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'A new parent will bring stability, but probably won't improve your investment prospects.' </p> <p>Willis comments: 'It might take a couple of years to understand what kind of model any new company is working on. However, there is unlikely to be much of an incentive to manage the fund more aggressively and to improve performance.' </p> <p>Admin Re, a business of life and health insurer Swiss Re, bought Windsor Life's 800,000 closed with-profits policies in July last year through the acquisition of Life Assurance Holding Corporation. In November 2003 Admin Re also acquired the closed book of business at Zurich Life. </p> <p>Swiss Re says it cannot comment on whether the purchase of these businesses has altered the growth prospects for all the with-profits investors now under its umbrella. It recommends individuals with the policies in question contact their company directly if they want details of asset mix and exit penalties. </p> <p>Whether you stay or go, there are a number of factors to consider. The issues can be complicated and you could require tax-planning expertise, so you may need to speak to a reputable independent financial adviser </p> <p>Penalties are more likely to be higher at companies whose financial strength is not as robust as stronger players. For example, recent research by Hargreaves Lansdown showed that National Provident Institution's closed fund might hit deserters with an exit penalty of more than 20 per cent, compared with a charge of 4 per cent at a strong company where funds are still open. </p> <p>McPhail says that MVRs are likely to be lower when policyholders have had their cash invested in the fund for a relatively short time - say less than a year or two - or for periods of more than 10-15 years. Importantly, some with-profits contracts have dates when customers can take out all their cash without penalty. Check your original paperwork or call the company if you are unclear. </p> <p>Willis suggests a further option: 'You could choose to drip the fund dry by making MVR-free annual withdrawals of up to 7.5 per cent, but this could trigger an income tax liability, so needs to be dealt with carefully.' </p> <p>Some advisers believe that if you have an MVR to contend with, but have an investment view of more than seven or so years, it may be better to take the hit and try and make up for lost time with a more aggressively managed investment vehicle. </p> <p>Again, if you have a significant MVR, but your horizon is no longer than a few years, then leaving your cash invested in the closed fund and making withdrawals might be the best option. This might be true if your policy is with one of the stronger companies that boast funds with higher proportions of equities, say advisers. Policyholders ought to be able to obtain this information from their investment company . </p> <p>McPhail says: 'Unfortunately, there is no one-size- fits-all approach to the question of sticking with a closed with-profits fund or not. Often the decision will simply be a judgment call. That said, if your insurer is not awarding annual bonuses, then inflation will be reducing your investment and you have to ask yourself if there is any point leaving the cash where it is.' </p> <p><strong>Exit strategies</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Does the fund hold a decent proportion of equities? If the answer is yes, it may be better to stick with it than to accept a penalty for leaving and invest the cash elsewhere. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do you have a number of years before you are looking to draw on your investment? If the answer is yes, then you may be better pulling the cash out and re-investing elsewhere with the hope of making up for lost time. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> How high is the MVR? If it is relatively low, then the odds might be stacked in favour of getting out now. Advisers reckon those who either bought their policy recently or more than 15 or so years ago can expect to find their contracts carry the lowest penalties. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Does your contract specify dates when it is possible to withdraw your entire investment without penalty? If it does, then removing your cash from the fund on those dates could be a sound course of action.</p> <p><strong>Contacts</strong></p> <p><strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong>, 0845 345 0016, <a href=\"http://www.hargreaveslansdown.co.uk\">www.hargreaveslansdown.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Chartwell</strong>, 01225 321 700, <a href=\"http://www.chartwell-investment.co.uk\">www.chartwell-investment.co.uk </a></p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of clubbers and festival-goers are turning their backs on traditional narcotics and switching instead to so-called 'legal highs' following the introduction of a number of new products on the market that outshine their predecessors - because they actually appear to work. </p> <p>Packets of dried leaves claiming to provide a marijuana-like high and boxes of tablets that allegedly produce an amphetamine-like buzz have been around for decades but until recently they were generally dismissed as being ineffective. But in recent months new herbs like Salvia, a rare Mexican plant related to sage, and Kratom, an obscure Thai herb, have produced legions of devoted users, many of whom claim they are just as effective as illicit drugs. Business in the multi-million pound legal high trade is now booming with the number of products on offer having quadrupled in the past five years. </p> <p>One of the most popular products is Salvia, used for centuries by Mexican Indians in religious ceremonies, which produces a powerful hallucinogenic effect when chewed, drunk in an infusion or smoked through a pipe. Also known as Diviner's Sage and Sally D many users claim to have vivid out-of-body experiences, though others suffer only terrifying nightmares. </p> <p>Banned in Finland, Australia and Denmark, Salvia currently remains legal in Britain and the rest of the world with the Home Office having no plans to take any action against it. The So High SoHo shop in central London is one of hundreds of outlets openly selling the substance in the UK. Salvia is available at \u00a310 for a bag of leaves or \u00a330 for a bag of the more powerful \"extract\" version. </p> <p>'It takes you to an incredible place,' says the enthusiastic saleswoman. 'It's a real trip, like coming out of anaesthetic. You'll have a great time, it's really, really good.' Devotees fear the increasing popularity of Salvia may lead to a ban. Spiralling use in Italy, Germany and the Baleric Islands has caused concern to local law enforcement agencies. The US Drug Enforcement Administration includes the plant in its list of 'drugs and chemicals of concern' and has spent the past two years monitoring its use. 'It is currently under review by the medical and scientific community to determine if it should be a controlled substance,' a spokesperson told The Observer. </p> <p>Kratom, a tree native to Thailand and other parts of southeast Asia, has been available in the UK for the past six months and is proving popular. 'It's really taking off,' says Mark Evans, head of the web-based retailer Everyone Does It. 'It's spreading by word of mouth. People are trying it, liking it and coming back for more.' </p> <p>Believed to work on the same receptors in the brain as heroin, Kratom initially induces alertness, increasing physical energy and the desire to interact with others. At higher doses it becomes a sedative, constricting the pupils and desensitising the user to physical and emotional pain. The effects last for up to six hours. A packet obtained by The Observer states that Kratom will 'induce a unique and relaxed dreamy sensation.' The manufacturers recommend that the product is used no more than twice a month in order to ensure it does not become habit forming. </p> <p>'There are several reasons why the herbal products are becoming more popular,' says Evans. 'One is the price - they are often cheaper than the stuff you can buy on the street. Another is quality which tends to be more consistent. In the past some of the products have been a bit hit and miss but, with something like Salvia extract, it is almost always going to have an effect.' </p> <p>Started on a market stall with just \u00a3500, Evans's company now turns over more than \u00a33 million each year and offers 22,000 products including numerous legal highs, cannabis seeds and drugs paraphernalia including bongs, scales and specialist books. The firm's website receives 2.5 million hits each month. </p> <p>The massive growth of the legal high market mirrors the recent growth in the market for magic mushrooms, currently on sale at more than 300 outlets across the UK. Under the current law the magic mushroom is not a controlled substance but the hallucinogen, psilocin, that it contains, is classified as Class A drug. Provided the gatherer does not commercially 'prepare' the mushrooms - by freezing them, drying them or using them to make tea - before selling them they are not committing a criminal offence. </p> <p>The peyote cactus is also widely available. Used by native Americans for centuries, peyote produces effects similar to LSD. Like mushrooms the cactus can be sold as it becomes illegal only when prepared as a hallucinogenic. </p> <p>Evans admits that natural products are also popular because many users see them as safer than their chemical cousins - use of ecstasy has declined by 20 per cent in the last year according to Home Office figures. However, this is not always the case. Magic mushrooms have been linked to psychosis while a key component of many herbal ecstasy tablets was banned in the US this year after being linked to 155 deaths. </p> <p>Another natural drug, the hallucinogenic wild flower known as Angel's Trumpet, which is becoming increasingly common in the UK, has been linked to several deaths in America. Last October an 18-year-old student in Halle, Germany, used a pair of garden shears to cut off his tongue and penis after drinking a tea made from the plant.</p>"
