  "<p><strong>Letter of the week</strong></p> <p><strong>We have arranged a two-week holiday in the Gambia early next year, and want to visit children we sponsor in Senegal. The charity has offices in Dakar, from which we understand the visit will be arranged. Please suggest how we get there from the Gambia. We need to have all the arrangements in place before we leave.</strong><br> Richard Horsfall and Pat Priestley, by email </p> <p>Transport connections are cheap and good between the Gambia and Senegal, and few travellers fly. </p> <p>As with most long distance travel in West Africa, you're at the mercy of unpredictable services and unreliable vehicles. Allow plenty of time in case you hit delays, be flexible and keep cool if things go wrong. </p> <p>Whether you're in Gambia's Atlantic coast resorts or in the capital Banjul, getting to Dakar means taking the ferry across the mouth of the Gambia River to Barras. This ferry runs from roughly dawn to dusk daily, and the trip takes between 30 minutes and an hour. You buy tickets before boarding and the cost is less than \u00a31 for you both. </p> <p>If you can get to Barras before 9am and are quick off the boat, there's usually an express bus to Dakar. This takes between five and six hours and costs around \u00a31.50 each. </p> <p>If you're slower, there's a bus which takes roughly two hours longer and leaves when it's full. If these buses have no room, or are not running, you need to get to the border at Karang, which is a bush taxi ride away. From there you'll have a choice of taxi, minibus or bus to Dakar. </p> <p>On this journey, be prepared for the hustlers and touts who congregate around Barras ferry terminal. It's a good idea to sound out your fellow ferry passengers and check the details of your route to ensure you are not misled by anyone. </p> <p><strong> I am going to New York for two weeks later this month. I have been twice before and I am wondering if there are any good day trips that do not require hiring a car. I may be too late to book for sports events this time, but for future reference what is the best way to get tickets? Is there an agency you could recommend?</strong><br> Eoghan Beecher, Dublin </p> <p> Though you've seen the highlights of Manhattan, there's still a lot to explore. Plenty of day trips can be made without leaving the Metro, from Coney Island's faded grandeur to Rockaway Beach's boardwalks, perfect for strolling at any time of year. </p> <p>Less well known subway excursions include taking a picnic to Pelham Bay Park, an enormous stretch of Bronx parkland; and Fort Tryon in the far north of Manhattan Island. This recently rejuvenated park is home to The Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's medieval extension. </p> <p>A great way to spend a day is hopping on and off the 7 Subway Line, designated as a National Historic Trail due to the historic immigrant area it passes through. Finish this trip at Shea Stadium, exploring the 1964 World's Fair site. </p> <p>If you want to escape the Big Apple, Long Island is easily accessible by train, and during the summer months ferries connect with rail services to link up attractive parts of South Shore. </p> <p>Alternatively, ride the Long Island Railroad to Montauk, a laid-back town with shifting dunes that's great for cycling, kayaking and exploring. </p> <p>There are hundreds of other great day trips, including the beautiful rural towns and accessible state parks of the lower Hudson Valley. The website <a href=\"http://www.iloveny.com\">iloveny.com</a> has more on the city and state. </p> <p>It's best to book sports tickets on each team's own website. It's generally possible to get baseball tickets, but those for American football, hockey and basketball are scarce. Craigslist (<a href=\"http://www.craigslist.org\">craigslist.org)</a> is a good source of tickets for popular fixtures. Expect to pay a little above face value. </p> <p><strong> I read in Escape last year about a system of cycle routes on disused railway tracks in southern Spain. I'd like more information, as I plan to be in the area for a month or so soon.</strong> <br> Isabel de Sudea, by email </p> <p>Spain has almost 800 miles of Vias Verdes, or Green Ways. Designed for walkers and cyclists, they are mostly disused railway tracks on reasonably level gradients. </p> <p>If your Spanish is good, you can find information on the Vias Verdes website (<a href=\"http://www.ffe.es/viasverdes/index.html\">ffe.es/viasverdes/index.html</a>). It has a limited English translation. </p> <p><strong> I'm off for a weekend to Budapest shortly. What's the safest cheap way of getting from the airport into the city centre, and what are the 'must see' sights for a short visit?</strong><br> A. Spencer, by email </p> <p> A minibus from the airport will take you straight to your hotel for around \u00a310 return. A taxi is more expensive. A bus is far cheaper but much slower. </p> <p>Start exploring the city with a stroll up to Fisherman's Bastion, where there are wonderful views, day or night. </p> <p>If you're there in the daytime, look around the Castle Hill area, home to the Royal Palace and the medieval Old Town. </p> <p>Then you can branch away from the most touristed area to the parliament building, which has a wonderful Gothic interior. Margaret Island is a lovely place for a stroll, rollerblade or picnic. </p> <p>You must take a soak in one of the baths that are a Budapest institution. Gellert and Szechenyi are the best known, but such local favourites as Lukacs and Kiraly are also worth a visit. </p> <p>Budapest is full of modern cafes and restaurants. The VI List Ferenc Ter in Pest is a great place to rest your legs while listening to classical music.

  "Michael Howard will use the Conservative's final party conference before next year's likely general election to spell out a \"timetable for action\" of hour-by-hour, day-by-day achievements for the first days of a new Tory government. <p>Brushing aside doubts about the party's electability in the wake of its fourth place in last week's Hartlepool byelection, the Tory leader will set out a traditional tax-cutting agenda - although leave details on where cuts will fall to the actual election manifesto.</p> <p>Launching the party's five days at Bournemouth, the Tory chairman, Liam Fox, said: \"We intend to cut taxes - and how far will depend on the finances when we find them.\"</p> <p>Briefing journalists on the eve of Monday's official opening of the conference, Dr Fox said the themes would be \"freedom and security\".</p> <p>Shadow ministers will all work to a timetable setting out concrete legislation within days of coming to power in a bid to reengage with a \"disaffected and cynical\" electorate.</p> <p>Dr Fox said: \"People have fallen out of love with Tony Blair - but they haven't fallen in love with the Tories.</p> <p>\"This is the most intrusive government we have ever had, from means testing to a speed camera on every corner.</p> <p>\"We stand for low taxation, deregulation and secure borders.\"</p> <p>Revealing the party would try to wrestle back asylum and immigration from the \"extremists\", Dr Fox said: \"We will not be inhibited from talking about these issues. We will not abandon them to the extremists who would love to have this field to themselves.\"</p> <p><b>Labour 'in chaos'</b><br></p> <p>Earlier, speaking to the BBC, Mr Howard claimed the Labour government was now \"in chaos\" following Mr Blair's declaration of an intention to retire.</p> <p>Denying that the Tories now needed \"a miracle\" to win the next election, Mr Howard instead went on the offensive, challenging the prime minister to a series of US-style TV debates before the next year's likely contest.</p> <p>The conference is taking place in the wake of an opinion poll today which showed that two-thirds of top party officials could envisage pulling out of Europe - closer to the position of single-issue rivals Ukip than the official Tory policy of \"not foreseeing\" such an outcome.</p> <p>Mr Howard, speaking this morning on the BBC, insisted that the party was in \"quite good shape\".</p> <p>In an interview with BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme, he dismissed suggestions that the best the party could hope for at the general election was to finish second ahead of the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>\"Of course that is not true,\" he said. </p> <p>He said that the political landscape had changed \"hugely\" as a result of Mr Blair's shock announcement last week that he intended to stand down after serving one more term as prime minister. </p> <p>\"The choice that people will have at the next general election is between another Labour government, now thrown totally into chaos as a consequence of Tony Blair's announcement, or a Conservative government,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair has fired the starting pistol for the race for his succession and everybody is going to be jostling for position, everybody is going to be vying for the succession. </p> <p>\"The truth is that everybody is going to be looking for their own advantage and the country's going to come a poor second.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard rejected suggestions that he would now be taking the party to the right on issues like Europe and immigration and asylum in a bid to stave off the threat from Ukip. </p> <p>\"I don't accept that this is a basis for looking at these things. I don't really accept this distinction between right and left and centre,\" he said. </p> <p>As party officials put last-minute touches to the Bournemouth Conference Centre, which is festooned with placards of the new Tory logo, Mr Howard went on a lunchtime walkabout in steady drizzle with local police to discuss law and order.</p> <p>Tomorrow's keynote speech comes from the shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, who is expected to make pledges - but not commitments - on where the Tories would cut indirect taxation and raise income tax thresholds.</p> <p><b>EU survey</b><br></p> <p>Meanwhile, a survey today revealed that more than two out of three Conservative party constituency chairmen envisage a situation where Britain could pull out of the EU. </p> <p>Of the 110 chairmen who responded to the BBC survey, 71 disagreed with the proposition that there were no circumstances under which Britain should withdraw from the EU. Only 25 said that they agreed, while 14 said that they did not know or refused to answer. </p> <p>Meanwhile, 38 said that the party's general election manifesto should include a firm commitment to cut the standard rate of income tax, as against 51 who disagreed and 21 who did not know or refused to answer. </p> <p>Almost half - 53 - said they opposed legislation to give gay and lesbian couples the same legal rights as married couples, as against 35 who supported it and 22 who did not know or refused to answer.</p>",
  "<p>With his shock of white hair, woolly moustache and amiable, distracted air, Albert Einstein has given society its defining image of an eccentric scientist: lovable, brilliant but unworldly. </p> <p>Things are about to change, however. Next year a global campaign is to be launched to mark Einstein Year. An unprecedented fusillade of shows, exhibitions and products will be unleashed round the world, each aimed at turning the great physicist into one of the sexiest figures of the 20th century. Make way, Che Guevara. </p> <p>Apart from the Einstein posters, mugs, T-shirts, calendars, and bookmarks already churning off production lines, there will be an Einstein experiment pack for Glastonbury festival-goers; an Einstein screen saver that will help computer owners track down gravitation waves; kiddies' Einstein party packs; an Einstein ballet by the Rambert dance group; and a series of concerts, in Israel, to mark his lesser-known achievements - as a violin player. </p> <p>Major exhibitions dedicated to the German-born physicist have already opened in the United States, and journals - including the current Scientific American - have dedicated entire issues to the great man's life and works. That soup-strainer moustache and floppy white mane will be hard to avoid in the next few months. </p> <p>'This is a chance to get people to appreciate what physics has done for the modern world,' said Caitlin Watson, Einstein Year co-ordinator for the UK Institute of Physics. 'There is nobody to touch Einstein for that.' </p> <p>Scientists have chosen 2005 to be Einstein Year (as well as International Year of Physics) because four of his greatest scientific papers were published in 1905. They included his theory of relativity, which redefined our ideas about space and time, and the paper that introduced the idea that energy and matter are interchangeable. This notion is summed up by his equation E=mc<strong><sup>2</sup></strong> , the most enduring, scientific icon of the last century. </p> <p>For physics, 1905 was an annus mirabilis , thanks to an unprepossessing Swiss patent office clerk who, working quietly on his own, utterly changed our ideas about the universe. Within 10 years, Einstein had been made a professor at the University of Berlin. A few years later he won the Nobel Prize, and not long after he published his general theory of relativity, which transformed our ideas about gravity and the universe. </p> <p>This was a man who stretched time and bent space. As Scientific American puts it: 'Albert Einstein looms over 20th-century physics as its defining, emblematic figure.' Hence the lavish nature of next year's celebrations, although not every plan has been welcomed universally. </p> <p>An Austrian proposal to mark the 50th anniversary of Einstein's death, which falls on 18 April, 2005, by holding a 'light relay' - a sort of astronomical Mexican wave in which thousands of people round the world will shine torches into the night sky - is to be boycotted by British astronomers. Light pollution is already ruining our study of the heavens, they say. However, most other ideas have been enthusiastically seized on by scientists - such as the Einstein at Home project. 'People will be able to send off for software that will allow their computers to operate at night using data, automatically downloaded from observatories, to spot minute fluctuations in data that reveal the existence of gravitational waves,' said Professor Jim Hough, of Glasgow University. </p> <p>Gravitational waves, predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity, are ripples in the curvature of space-time triggered by massive energetic events, such as supernovae - when stars explode and destroy themselves. None has ever been detected. 'There could be no better way to celebrate Einstein's great year than finding one this way,' added Hough. </p> <p>Then there is the 'Einstein at Glastonbury' pack which physics students will display at the festival next June. Among the marvels of modern physics to be demonstrated will be rockets powered by water and fizzy Alka-Seltzer tablets and a levitating lemon that will be raised by some strange use of pint glasses, ashtrays and water. Normal fare for Glastonbury, in short. </p> <p>The Einstein pack for kiddies' parties will include games for sticking kebab sticks through balloons without bursting them. 'You can learn a lot of physics this way,' said Caitlin Watson. </p> <p>All of which should make Einstein a new folk hero as well as making the Hebrew University of Israel very rich. Through a Californian law firm, they control use of Einstein's image, and have to give permission, often in exchange for royalties, for the use of the great man's face or name on any products. Given what is about to be unleashed, things can only get better for them.</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 10 2004</b> <br>  In the article below we stated that several large donors to George Bush's campaign had also given to Nader. We should clarify that the Center for Public Integrity reports that while the 51 donors have given $54,300 to Nader, they have given the Democrats $66,000 and the Republicans $415,000. Nader's total from donors who have also contributed to the Republicans represents about 4 per cent of the $1.5 million he has raised.      Ralph Nader surveyed a packed hall of Florida students who had come to hear about his third-party tilt for the presidency. 'I am not here to flatter you. I'm going to take you to task,' he warned in his opening sentence. <p>'I am looking at the future,' he said dismissively, glaring at the sea of, in his view, apathetic and politically unaware young faces. 'And the future looks much like the past.' </p> <p>Many politicians start campaign speeches with an attack on an opponent. Few start with an attack on their audience. Then again, Nader is no ordinary campaigner. Nor is it an ordinary campaign. </p> <p>No figure divides America as much as Nader, the long-time liberal consumer activist turned political revolutionary, who is standing this time as an independent. Democrats blame him for robbing Al Gore of vital votes that cost him the 2000 election. Republicans love him for the same reason. Now both think it might happen again. </p> <p>Democrats are right to be worried. Nader has defied the odds and is in the final stages of crafting a presidential challenge across most of America. He is on the ballot in 31 states and expects that number to end up as nearer 40. Many are battleground states. </p> <p>That prospect has Democrats terrified. Last week, several new opinion polls showed how crucial Nader could be. In New Jersey the independent has just 2 per cent support, but Bush and Kerry are tied at 48 per cent. </p> <p>In New Hampshire, Bush and Kerry are tied at 46 per cent, while Nader again has 2 per cent. In Colorado, the former consumer crusader has 3 per cent, leaving Bush with a one-point lead over Kerry. Without Nader, Kerry would probably be winning there. Some Democrats are starting to see the nightmare of 2000 all over again. </p> <p>Nader can still draw crowds, as he proved when he criss-crossed hurricane-torn Florida last week, touring the swing state that still haunts Democrats. In the steamy resort town of Sarasota more than 300 people packed a university hall, overflowing into the corridors outside. They clapped and cheered his speech. </p> <p>In Tampa a day later another 150 people came to a theatre to hear him. 'Not even the hurricanes can stop you coming,' Nader told them. </p> <p>Hurricanes may not have put people off Nader, but the Democrats have tried to: they have launched a huge legal effort in many states to keep Nader off the ballot. Nader activists have been harassed and the signatures of support that the campaign has collected have repeatedly been challenged in court. </p> <p>At some Nader meetings Democratic stooges have stood up to beg the audience to vote for Kerry to stop Bush. High-profile liberals, such as Michael Moore, publicly begged Nader not to run. Democrats refer to Nader as 'a spoiler' candidate who will let the Republicans win. </p> <p>The effort has backfired, however. Nader comes across as a very angry man, and much of that anger is directed at Democrats, not Bush. At press conferences and rallies the same message is pumped out again and again: the Democrats are the same as the Republicans. </p> <p>'They are gutless, clueless and spineless. The Democratic Party is a shell of its former self. The fact that they can't landslide Bush shows their decadence,' Nader says. </p> <p>He is also fired up by the Democratic lawsuits, which have cost many thousands of dollars to defend. 'They are going to pay a woeful price for this. People don't like bullies.' </p> <p>For Democrats, people like Adam Tebrougge, 42, a lawyer who has been active in the Sarasota Democratic Party but is now supporting Nader, are a deeply worrying sign that their plans to eliminate Nader have hurt only themselves. </p> <p>In Sarasota, Tebrougge listened as one Nader aide begged the crowd for a $500 donation. His hand shot up and a few minutes later he handed over his cheque. </p> <p>Tebrougge said: 'I was very affected by Kerry's attempts to get Nader off the ballot. That might even have made the difference with me.' </p> <p>Nader is clear what he thinks will happen in this election: Bush will win. He is clear too about who will be to blame. 'Kerry is taking away more votes from himself than I ever could,' Nader said. </p> <p>The truth is more complex, however. Behind Nader's campaign lies a complex web of Republican support - often unsolicited but usually welcome - that seems to play into the hands of the Bush White House. Many Republicans see Nader as another weapon with which to beat Kerry. </p> <p>Nader denies that it is a concerted Republican effort, but it seems widespread. Nader's legal fight to get on the ballot in Florida was crucially backed by Governor Jeb Bush, the President's brother. In other states it is Republican law firms that have successfully fought Democrat attempts to stop him standing. </p> <p>Some Republican groups have collected signatures to try to get him on the ballot. In Nevada, the man behind the effort was Steve Wark, a top Republican consultant. The Nader campaign has also used the Florida-based firm JSM, whose parent company previously helped the election campaigns of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush. JSM has been dogged by repeated allegations of collecting fraudulent Nader signatures, especially in the swing state of Ohio. </p> <p>Republicans have also played a role in financing Nader. Several large donors to Bush's war coffers have dug in their pockets for Nader. They include billionaire John Egan, one of the most prominent financial backers of Bush's political career, and Houston businessman Nijad Fares. One study showed that nearly one in 10 of those who gave Nader $1,000 or more also gave to the Republicans. </p> <p>As some Democrats complain about dirty tricks, however, Nader is striking a chord with others on the main issues. Unburdened by the prospect of success, he is free to make his unbridled opposition to the Iraq war a popular part of his platform. </p> <p>He is lobbying for a withdrawal of US forces in six months' time. Nader's biggest cheers always come with the mention of getting out of Iraq. He compares Iraq to Vietnam, warning darkly of a reinstatement of the draft. All this makes good ammunition for attacks but it is Kerry, not Bush, who is the target. </p> <p>'I have never seen a Democrat be so reluctant to have an exit strategy. He now says he wants out in four years. Well in four years it will be worse than Vietnam,' Nader said. His speeches are unlike those of the main candidates. They change with each venue, appear to be mainly ad-libbed and attack the system, especially big business, with ferocity. Nader poses as an outsider aiming to bring the house down. That is not hard to do when, as Kerry and Bush whizz around in hired jets, your air tickets are bought at a pensioner's discount price. </p> <p>The crowds Nader is attracting this time, however, are much smaller than those of four years ago. Some of his speeches can also veer into the bizarre. He can sound like an angry old grandad, lecturing troublesome children. 'What happened to playing kick the can in the backyard?' he cried at one meeting in Miami as he ranted against Nintendo. </p> <p>But the real problem for Nader is people such as Vanessa White. Clutching Nader's book after the Sarasota meeting, she was fired up by his speech. Yet her vote was going to Kerry: the overriding thing was to get rid of Bush. 'I just really don't like Bush,' White said. 'That's what matters this time.' Nader knows he cannot hope for victory, especially when both major parties have combined to deny him any hope of appearing in the two remaining presidential TV debates. Nader jokes he may gatecrash the final debate, planned for Arizona. </p> <p>'I am talking to Zorro about sneaking through the air conditioning system and landing on the stage,' he quipped. </p> <p>But for Democrats, Nader's jokes are not funny. Even when denied a place in the debates, his campaign is a thorn in the Democrat side in several swing states, and in an election that could be decided by a few closely fought contests, even a small thorn can be fatal.</p>",
  "<p>Spray-can graffiti has entered the art market's mainstream. Wild designs hitherto seen only on walls in the street, or train carriages, are being sprayed on to canvas and pondered by aficionados in art galleries throughout the world. </p> <p>A selling exhibition of work by six heroes of the spray can, at Elms Lesters Painting Rooms in London from 13-30 October, includes not only paintings but merchandise. Japanese-made plastic toys in the form of the weird, mascot-like creatures that have come to inhabit the graffiti and hand-knotted rugs. You can't get more mainstream than that. </p> <p>Your typical successful 'graffer' is now in his thirties. Nights when, as a teenager, he stole into train yards toting a holdall of up to 100 spray cans, selected colours by touch and sprayed carriages in the darkness, are a memory. He now designs casual clothes, logos, toys, record sleeves, flyers and backdrops for stage performances. He is fawned upon by local authority bigwigs wanting murals and museum curators who have taken it into their heads that graffiti is the first major calligraphic artform outside the Islamic world, China and Japan. </p> <p>The Elms Lesters show is called 'Icy Grape No. 1924', the name of a much-coveted but now obsolete enamel aerosol colour. Dedicated collectors pay $1,000 a can and even empty ones have a value. The paintings are priced \u00a3350-\u00a33,500 and limited edition prints from \u00a325. </p> <p>The 20 rug designs are \u00a3150-\u00a32,700 and the limited-edition toy action figures - including pointy-headed 'kubricks', like extra-terrestrials with spray guns - are \u00a325-\u00a3300. </p> <p>Brooklyn-based graffiti artist Stash - real name Josh Franklin - is 37. In his teens, unseen in a dark tunnel, he would cover a 60ft by 20ft subway car in 20 hours. 'Even in the dark', he told me, 'I knew where my different colours were and sort of choreographed the design in my head.' He was never arrested. 'I was damned lucky.' </p> <p>He also had some narrow escapes when 'beef wars' between rival gangs erupted on the street. 'If an artist had a beef with another artist, he had a beef with the artist's gang, too; it got serious.' All that was needed to spark a beef was 'toy' sprayed by a rival over an artist's 'tag'- signatures such as 'Craze', 'Blaze', or 'Stash'. 'Toy' meant: 'I don't like your shit,' says Stash. </p> <p>Today, besides continuing to paint on canvas, Stash is a big-time clothing designer. Nike has used his designs. He founded the legendary clothing design studio Subware, collaborates on the clothing line Project Dragon and owns Recon stores in New York, San Francisco and Tokyo. His 'Recon 12' action figure is Stash in Recon gear with spray gun and Steyr Aug sniper rifle. </p> <p>Its illegal origin as part of a youth subculture still gives graffiti art its edge, a sniff of danger.'Its strength is the demographic that created it; look at the youth,' Stash says. 'It's a movement that reflects the pace of life and it's now reached global proportions'. </p> <p>Paul Jones, owner of Elms Lesters, says: 'I say this is the next movement in art. It has that feel about it, as did Pop Art or the Futurists. It's been building gradually for 30 or 40 years and all of a sudden, you know it's the thing. There's nothing else around like it. When I look at contemporary art magazines and see the same conceptual artists - the Chapman brothers, for example - they look old school by comparison.' </p> <p>It has certainly been a long time building and has lacked the mainstream promotion given, say, to punk, the British street-style music and design movement concocted by the publicity conscious Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood. </p> <p>Norman Mailer wrote a book about graffiti and in 1980, when New York's subway trains were seemingly irremediably coated with spray paint, the New York contemporary art adviser Jeffrey Deitch urged collectors at a big art seminar to invest in a whole graffiti-covered subway train and mothball it. Nobody did. Stash had his first on-canvas show at the Fun Gallery in New York in 1983 but there was still no take-off for the movement. </p> <p>But by the time Tony Silver's compendium of film about graffiti artists, Style Wars, appeared last year, graffiti in its most evolved form - with landscapes and crazy creatures, besides wild lettering - was being shown in galleries worldwide, having ridden to fame on the hip-hop movement, along with rap music, break dancing and deejaying. </p> <p>Futura, an American, one of the six artists showing at Elms Lesters, thanks Europe for recognising graffiti art. 'American attention and investment were never really there,' he laments. Perhaps the American public sided with the New York Transit Authority's vandal squad, with its snarling guard dogs, razor wire and graffiti-proof paint. </p> <p>If graffiti art is to prosper, it will have to remember the stylistic roots of the original calligraphers, or 'writers', as they are sometimes still called. One of the most sophisticated British artists in the show, Stet - 31-year-old Andrew McAttee - spray-paints huge canvasses with highly finished faux-spontaneous brushstrokes and shiny Ribena-like bubbles, vaguely reminiscent of the American Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein and the Surrealist Joan Miro. </p> <p>Stet earned his street credentials as a youngster at legally approved graffiti sites in London's Westbourne Park and Fulham, which allowed him to perfect his work unhurried and unharassed, before studying painting at Central St Martin's College of Art and Design. But his riotous compositions retain an unmistakable graffiti 'look'. </p> <p>Graffiti-proof paint, security of anti-terrorist proportions and jail sentences of up to five years mean there is little opportunity these days for new artists to gain a reputation in the movement through street apprenticeship. Those who have - such as the six top names at Elms Lesters - are therefore virtually unrivalled and will remain so. That should mean something to collector-investors.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.elmslesters.co.uk\">Elms Lesters Painting Rooms</a>, 1-5 Flitcroft Street, London WC2 (020 7836 6747)</p>",
  "<p>Rich and married to the wrong person? Then pray you are eligible to choose where you divorce. It could save you a small fortune. </p> <p>The asset- or income-rich can save thousands, if not millions, of pounds by shopping around for the most advantageous legal jurisdiction in which they are allowed to divorce, says Suzanne Kingston, head of family law at London solicitors Dawsons. </p> <p>Someone who qualifies to divorce in France could escape paying maintenance, for example. 'Joint lives maintenance is almost non-existent in France, unless one partner is of pension able age or incapacitated,' she says. 'Wives are expected to go back to work.' No wonder France has one of the highest rates of working women. </p> <p>'Forum shopping' - choosing the best legal jurisdiction for your circumstances - is becoming more popular now because more people are moving from one country to another to live and work, and marrying people from other EU member states. </p> <p>The cost of issuing divorce papers in an unfavourable jurisdiction can be staggering. Newcastle United striker Patrick Kluivert is reported to be offering his wife Angela \u00a36 million in a one-off settlement - a sum that must surely bring tears to your eyes, even when you earn \u00a367,000 or so a week. But Kluivert, who is Dutch, could save through the deal. </p> <p>Until two months ago, Kluivert was playing for Barcelona, so could have filed for divorce in Spain, where pre-marital assets and inheritances are excluded from capital settlements. But in Holland Angela could be entitled to half of everything. Pundits speculate that 50 per cent of Kluivert's wealth is \u20ac18 million, a very good reason for trying for an out-of-court settlement. </p> <p>Most EU countries, with the exception of the UK and the Netherlands, exclude inherited wealth and pre-marital assets from the divorce settlement. But big differences arise when it comes to maintenance and the treatment of prenuptial agreements. </p> <p>Prenuptial agreements are not strictly enforceable in the UK. The terms of such an agreement may be upheld by a court, but usually only where there has been full financial disclosure, the parties have taken separate legal advice, there are no children, no unforeseen circumstances (such as one partner becoming incapacitated) and a relatively short marriage. </p> <p>It may be sensible to consider a 'pre-nup' if you are marrying for a second time or if you are trying to ringfence inherited wealth. </p> <p>Irish courts are not required to enforce agreements - although there has been no case to set a prece dent yet - nor are they enforceable in Cyprus and Slovakia. But pre-nups are valid and enforceable in France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and Latvia, and to a limited degree in Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic. In France, there is no need even for the couple to disclose details of their finances or to take separate legal advice. </p> <p>Agreements based on Italian law are not enforceable, but Italian courts will respect those that are valid and drawn up according to the laws of other jurisdictions. </p> <p>More worrying for the lower earner of the couple, usually the woman, is that the right to claim maintenance in several EU countries is linked to the claimant's ability to fend for herself and even then can be limited to a relatively short period. It is not guaranteed unless she cannot work because of age or health or has young children. Even then the maintenance will be paid for the children rather than the spouse. </p> <p>In the Netherlands, Angela Kluivert would have no right to maintenance if she could be reasonably expected to maintain herself through her modelling career - but because she has children the maintenance could last up to 12 years. </p> <p>German spouses are responsible for themselves financially. Limited maintenance payments are made if one party cannot pay for themselves and the other can. </p> <p>Even if there are children, the wife is expected to work part time by the time the youngest child is eight, and full time when the child hits the age of 15. </p> <p>And woe betide the spouse who misbehaves: some countries (not the UK) place emphasis on fault, which can lead to a reduction of maintenance. In Latvia, if both parties are at fault, no maintenance will be paid. </p> <p>Estonia is probably the worst place for the lower paid of a couple to get divorced. Maintenance is paid in only two circumstances: if the receiving spouse is disabled or of pensionable age and therefore unable to work; or where there are children under three. </p> <p>It all sounds pretty unedifying. As Kingston comments, forum shopping generally means the person with more money will have better access to legal advice to work out which is the bet ter jurisdiction if applicable. </p> <p>It's all too possible to imagine the clouds of dust as husbands rush to issue their divorce papers first, ensuring they minimise the damage to their finances, regardless of the long-term effect it has on their wives and children. </p> <p>However, Kingston counsels: 'Before you make any fundamental decisions regarding your marriage, you should try to understand the implications. You can approach a situation much more calmly if you understand the potential outcomes. If you can take sensible legal advice, it might give you some confidence about the future.'</p> <p><strong>Home or away?</strong></p> <p>London solicitors Dawsons recently advised Mr W, an English citizen whose wife is German and still lives in Germany. Mr W could therefore choose between issuing divorce and financial proceedings in England or Germany. </p> <p>The couple had been married for 13 years and have one young child. They have a valuable property in London, a small flat in Germany and a big share portfolio - total assets estimated at \u00a32 million.</p> <p>Both Mr W and his wife earn about \u00a3120,000 a year, so spousal maintenance was not an issue. But the division of assets was; Mr W had brought the majority - worth \u00a31.3m - to the marriage.</p> <p>Dawsons advised Mr W that he would do better to issue proceedings in Germany, as there the assets he had brought to the marriage would be excluded from the financial division, although he might have to pay his wife a share on any increase in the value during the marriage.</p> <p>In England Mr W could argue that these assets should be excluded, and he might well get a division in his favour on that basis, but the court's primary concern would be to ensure that Mrs W and their child were suitably housed and their needs met.</p> <p>The court would want to see that both parties had a similar standard of living and would consider that 13 years of marriage would entitle Mrs W to a reasonable share of the assets.</p> <p><strong>Foreign affairs: how to get a divorce abroad</strong></p> <p>You can choose where to divorce in the EU only if you meet criteria dictated by the residence and domicile requirements of Brussels II (EU legislation). This says that jurisdiction lies with the courts of the 'contracting' state in whose territory: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the spouses habitually reside (live full time);</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> last lived, in as much as one of them still lives there;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the respondent (the person being divorced) lives;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the petitioner (the person filing for divorce) has been living for at least a year prior to filing for divorce;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> in the event of a joint application for divorce (not possible in the UK), where either of the spouses lives;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the petitioner has lived for at least six months prior to filing for divorce and is either a national of the member state or is 'domiciled' there. This means you were either born there or have chosen the country as the place where you intend to live permanently;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> is the country of the nationality of both spouses, or, in the case of the UK and Ireland, of their 'joint domicile'.</p> <p>Consult a solicitor to check that you have a choice and, if you do, which jurisdiction will best suit you. Then hightail it to court to file for divorce before your spouse gets wind of what you are up to. Under European legislation, the jurisdiction where a divorce takes place is decided on a first come, first served basis. He or she who issues proceedings first gets to choose the place.</p>",
  "For a while, Georges Lopez was the popular embodiment of everything that was once good about France's teaching profession. The quiet authority he exercised with his pupils, as he guided them gently through the difficult lessons of childhood, evoked potent nostalgia for an old-fashioned approach to teaching. As the star of Etre et Avoir, France's most successful documentary, he became a national hero, lauded for his modest reserve and unmaterialistic dedication to a badly paid profession. <p>But this idolisation of Lopez ended abruptly when he announced he was to sue the film's producers for a share in the \u20ac2 million (\u00a31.4m) profits. It seemed like a classic story of a newly created film star being corrupted by the pernicious effect of celebrity. </p> <p>Speaking for the first time since losing his claim for \u20ac250,000 compensation last week, Lopez said he was not motivated by a desire for money, but was simply determined to win recognition of his rights. He said he and his young pupils had been exploited by the film's producers and had been left permanently traumatised. </p> <p>Millions of people around the world were charmed by the pure vision of life in a one-class village school evoked by Etre et Avoir, which followed Lopez and his 11 pupils, aged between three-and-a-half and 12, over the course of a school year. </p> <p>Given its tiny budget and extremely obscure subject matter, no one could have predicted the extraordinary success of the documentary, which went on to win one of France's most prestigious film prizes and attracted praise from reviewers internationally, from America to Japan. </p> <p>But the atmosphere of calm tranquillity inside the village classroom, so beautifully captured by director Nicolas Philibert, began to sour as soon as the film was released, and has since disintegrated into an expensive and spiteful tangle of law-suits. </p> <p>The families of nine of the pupils feel so strongly about their mistreatment that they have launched legal proceedings against the film's producers. Lopez learnt last week that he had lost his own claim, but plans to appeal. </p> <p>'We were misled. The production company told me and the children's families that they were making a small documentary about the phenomenon of the one-teacher village school and that the film would be used primarily for educational purposes. </p> <p>'They said it would have a restricted screening and never discussed marketing the film to make it such a commercial venture.' </p> <p>He said the film's huge national and international distribution had had a very negative effect on the pupils. 'We had no idea that it would be in cinemas all over the country, released on DVD or distributed abroad. One child, who had been very stable and happy until the film's release, was so distressed by his unexpected fame, that he started wetting the bed, and became afraid of the dark. </p> <p>'Other children have been teased at their new secondary schools because of their involvement. All have been subjected to a great deal of stress as a direct consequence of the film,' he said. </p> <p>Lopez is relaxed about his fall from grace in the minds of the public. 'The media like to burn tomorrow what they adore today. Worse still, it's not socially acceptable for school teachers to seek money. I'm meant to live a quiet life in the countryside, eking out a reclusive retirement on my meagre pension. It's a cliche, but that's how people think,' he said. 'I think a lot of people haven't understood what's motivated my legal case. I'm not doing this for the money, I'm simply trying to make the film company recognise my rights.' </p> <p>Supported by fellow teachers, friends and the families of most of his former pupils, Lopez went to court last week to argue that he deserved payment for the use of his voice and his image in the film. His lawyers said he should be credited as 'co-author', in recognition of his enormous contribution to the documentary, and that he should also be remunerated as an 'actor'. Lopez claimed that his teaching methods recorded in the film were his own intellectual property, and so he deserved to be compensated for their dissemination. On Monday, a Paris tribunal ruled against him on each count. </p> <p>Roland Rappaport, lawyer for the director, argued that the film was much more than simply a homage to Lopez's professional skills. 'Clearly a film just about the teaching methods of a village teacher in rural France wouldn't have had the extraordinary international success Etre et Avoir has had,' Rappaport said. 'The film worked because of its portrayal of an entire community. ' While no one disputed Lopez's immense personal appeal, he was nevertheless not the creator of the film, Rappaport added. 'The Mona Lisa did not paint the Mona Lisa.' </p> <p>The court also ruled that Lopez's presence at the Cannes film festival and his repeated public expressions of satisfaction at its success, represented tacit acceptance of the use of his image. </p> <p>The case rapidly became a discussion of what constitutes a documentary, focusing on the central question of whether the subjects of documentary films can ever receive payment for their participation. The film-makers' lawyers took the broader argument that 'reality should never be paid for' and that to compensate Lopez would create a damaging precedent, and would also lead to the 'death of the documentary - economically and spiritually'. </p> <p>'By paying the subjects of the film, you change the relationship entirely. The director then gets the right to tell them what to do, to advise them on what to say, to film things over and over again. You leave the sphere of documentary behind and it becomes reality television, or even drama,' Rappaport said. </p> <p>He added that documentary budgets usually didn't stretch to paying subjects but agreed that Etre et Avoir was something of an exception because of the huge profits it made. This was why \u20ac15,000 had been donated to the school and Lopez was offered a one-off payment of \u20ac37,500 for his role in promoting the film, but he refused to accept the money, preferring to pursue his legal action. </p> <p>He is also supporting the separate actions by nine of his 11 former pupils to win \u20ac20,000 each in compensation.</p>",
  "<p>On the day her life changed, when she was 13 years old, Majlinda was on the way to help her aunt with the ironing of clothes in preparation for her cousin's wedding in their village in northern Albania. She was a little short of reaching the house when three strange men stopped her. They grabbed her, bundled her into a car, blindfolded, bound and gagged her; she was then driven to the southern town of Gjirokastra. Not until the men and Majlinda had crossed the border with Greece and reached Corinth was she told: 'Now you are going to work.'</p> <p>'At first I did not know what they were talking about,' recalls Majlinda, 'until they took me to a flat where there were other women and told me: \"You work here now.\" When I refused, they said they knew my family, and if I made trouble they would kill them. I thought of the possibilities. I was afraid to stay, I was afraid to leave, so I started to work - they forced me to, with violence.'</p> <p>Beaten and raped into submission by her traffickers, Majlinda began work, confined to a flat, from 8pm until 5am, obliged to meet a monetary quota entailing some 20 clients a night. 'And even if I made enough money,' she says, 'they usually found a reason to beat me when the clients had finished for the night.'</p> <p>Majlinda is scarred around the eyes and forehead. She talks at a shelter, back in Albania, to which she has escaped and at which she is hiding from her traffickers, trying to recover. Her expression is subdued, dead-pan. Outside the sun shines, but the room is leaden with her grief, and her story.</p> <p>She was in Greece for a year, until 'the police started catching up with them. So we came back to Albania and took a speedboat to Italy.' Majlinda was sold on to Florence for a price she doesn't know. By now, 'there were two new Albanians in the group running me, also one remained from Greece.' She was forced to work the streets on the scrappy edges of the city, well hidden from the beauty of its renaissance centre. After dealing with her clients, Majlinda handed over the proceeds, upon which 'all three would violate me at the end of my work. They would get high on drugs - marijuana and cocaine - and come at me. And every night they beat me - even if I made the \u20ac 1,000 [\u00a3685] they insisted on, they always found an excuse.'</p> <p>Majlinda's captors were part of a syndicate - it was clear to her that 'they exploited many other women as well as me, and had a number of houses, but would not let us meet.' There were 'good clients and bad clients,' she says. Good clients? 'I mean the ones who just wanted to have sex; the bad ones were the ones who beat me, or beat me and stole my money, so I had to work harder to earn it again.' The traffickers, she says, would 'compete against one another with the money they made out of me and the other women. They would compete for who could buy the flashiest car, or the best clothes.'</p> <p>After a year in Florence, Majlinda was moved by car to Amsterdam. In the bustle, she says, 'I was surrounded by people, but completely alone. I could speak to no one. I lost all hope. I thought there was no way out. I was afraid that if I talked to anyone, the traffickers would do something to my family.'</p> <p>Finally, a 'good client' from Afghanistan 'told me not to be afraid, and encouraged me to escape with him. I did, I trusted him, and became pregnant by him.' For a moment it seems that Majlinda's story will achieve some perverse redemption. 'But I was wrong,' she says, her hands kneading one another as she speaks. 'He wanted me to work for him instead, and he also beat me all the time. I gave birth to my child, and when that happened, I decided... </p> <p>'I told my story to a woman who used to come and see my husband [which is how Majlinda describes the Afghan] and she in turn told me about some Catholic nuns at Utrecht who rescued prostitutes. And I went to them. They helped me register my child and get a ticket back to Albania.' But still Majlinda stares down at the table, and at her hands, as she speaks. </p> <p>'I finally contacted my family and asked them to keep my son, but they didn't even want to see me, they were ashamed of me. My father said: \"So far as we're concerned, you are dead.\" Thus rejected, Majlinda and her baby took refuge at a shelter in Albania's capital, Tirana, but she was obliged to leave her child at a place she will not discuss, and move on alone, after the Afghan came looking for his quarry and his son. 'This place is my last chance,' she says of the second shelter to which she came. 'But I am terrified he will come. And that I will see the Albanian men before my eyes once more.'</p> <p>Majlinda's enslavement lasted four years. 'Men?' she ponders, 'I don't know what to say. All I know now is that I don't ever want to see another man in my life. All I want now is to be with my child, and to work. There were moments,' says Majlinda, now 17, 'when I thought I should not be alive, that I should be dead. But then I thought: why not? You have to be brave to survive. I have to be strong, otherwise I cannot get out of this.' And with that she smiles - the faint, hollow smile of the survivor. </p> <p>Majlinda is but one - bold and fortunate enough to have escaped - among hundreds of thousands enslaved and entrapped by a depraved and burgeoning crime, one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing: trafficking in young women and children for enforced prostitution. In terms of the income it nets, trafficking is believed to lie in third place behind drugs and arms. There is evidence that criminal syndicates are switching from drugs to women and girls, finding them easier to transport than an assignment of cocaine or heroin. Moreover, a woman can be sold and resold over and over, while drugs can only be sold once. </p> <p>The scale of the crime is impossible to quantify. The US State Department this year said it believed between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked across borders each year; profits are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. And of those hundreds of thousands, an inestimable but high proportion are, under international law, children - under 18 years of age, and therefore entitled to special protection under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Documents produced by Unicef and Save the Children have found up to 80 per cent of those trafficked from some corners of Albania and Moldova to be children, with reports showing 'a decline in the average age of children/women being trafficked for prostitution'. </p> <p>Trafficking is, crucially, distinct from people-smuggling or migration, with which it is often, erroneously - and disastrously - confused by policy makers. The pitiful business of smuggling occurs when a syndicate is paid to take a group of people across borders illegally but willingly, in search of work or asylum. And although some people may elect to be taken by their traffickers, a trafficked person does not sign up for the purposes to which they are put. Trafficking was defined by a UN convention in 2000 as meaning to recruit and transport people 'by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion', such as abduction, fraud or deception, or, indeed, 'abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability'. </p> <p>'We would all like specific numbers,' says Steve Ashby, programme director for Save the Children in Albania. 'But they are simply not available. What we can safely assume is that the numbers are high enough to warrant very serious concern. It is impossible to over-stress the level of oppression and brutality - the vicious abuse of human rights being inflicted by these traffickers. And the situation is going to get worse before it gets better. </p> <p>'The trafficker,' says Ashby, 'is invariably ahead of the authorities. They are always finding alternative means to carry on. The phenomenon is shifting all the time. The trafficking problem outstrips all the efforts being made to control it.'</p> <p>'This has become,' says Giovanna Barberis, Unicef's representative in Moldova - the main source of trafficking for sexual exploitation in Europe - 'a matter for dramatic concern'.</p> <p>So far as Europe is concerned, the countries in which communism collapsed tend to provide both traffickers and trafficked. Moldova, Albania, Ukraine and Romania are the main source countries from which women are abducted. They are countries where social structures have imploded, where large sections of the economy are controlled by criminal syndicates and where communist regimes have been replaced by corruption as a means of political power. Trafficking has become integral to the economies of these countries - it is the source for fortunes, for cash to buy champagne and luxury cars, for profits laundered into resorts and hotels. The misery of women and children like Majlinda is a foundation stone for many a new concrete tower in Tirana or Chisinau. 'All along the line,' says Ashby, 'there is a chain of people involved in this trade, if you can call it that. The traffickers themselves, transporters, forgers of documents, safe houses, speedboats that take them from Albania to Italy - a great network of commercial interests engaged in the business.'</p> <p>There are so-called 'destination' countries in Eastern Europe, too, but the vast, hidden and terrifying 'markets' are wider and elsewhere - across Western Europe and, ever more, into Russia, Turkey, Israel, the Middle East and the Gulf states. The victims, invariably, are drafted from the vulnerable and subjugated quarters of East European society - from desperately poor villages, from rugged mountains, from shanty slums. This is the new criminal power play in the new Europe. </p> <p>Albania is a land of dire poverty, fierce patriotism, rugged mountains in the north, olive groves and vines to the south - for decades cut off from the rest of Europe and now opened up to a Western dream world with which it is bombarded on television, to which its youth aspires. It is a country whence tens of thousands of girls are trafficked and through which women are brought from other parts of Eastern Europe to Greece or Italy, and thence across Europe. The same syndicates are opening up new channels, after a clampdown on the Adriatic sea route, through Serbia and the former Yugoslav countries into the West. </p> <p>'It is estimated,' says a report commissioned by Unicef, 'that over the past 10 years, 100,000 Albanian women and girls have been trafficked to Western Europe and other Balkan countries. Albania is also one of the main transit countries for the trafficking of women and girls from central and Eastern Europe.' In Albania, fear of abduction by traffickers is so great that the numbers of teenaged girls attending high school in rural areas has fallen dramatically. In remote areas, 'as many as 90 per cent of girls no longer receive a high-school education,' says a report by Save the Children. 'Even here in Tirana, they are afraid,' warns Svetlana Roko, who runs a day centre for trafficked children and children at risk in the capital. 'The Albanian pimp,' says the report, 'has a reputation for extreme ruthlessness, and murder is not uncommon.' In one case in which a woman agreed to testify to the police in Italy, her father returned home to find the mutilated remains of his other daughter splattered around the house. </p> <p>Some women are simply kidnapped, others are lured by promises of work. 'It depends,' says Vera Lesko, who runs a shelter for trafficked women in Vlora, in the Albanian south. 'They could be promised a modelling career, work in shops, serving in bars and, more recently, they have been enticed by promises of academic scholarships. However, when they come to me they are totally destroyed, physically and psychologically. What we try to do is give them back their lives, tell them that their suffering is past, that they should focus on their own value, on what they have. We try to re-integrate them, to teach them vocational skills. We send them to schools in Vlora, with other women who do not know their background.'</p> <p>But in spite of all this, says Lesko, 'The majority are simply re-trafficked when they return. They have nothing; they are annihilated. I had a woman who had been trafficked and re-trafficked for 10 years. She did not know how to live in a different way. Something inside her had changed forever.'</p> <p>Traffickers, says Lesko, hang around police stations waiting to pick up their prey as soon as they are released. In many cases, there is collusion between police and traffickers. However - in defence of her work and in praise of those who come to her - 'a not insignificant number make it. They re-integrate, they remake themselves, and that is when all this work seems worthwhile.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/magazine/story/0,11913,1318358,00.html\">Read part 2</a></p>",
  "<p>Katalina swaddles the baby she says gives meaning to her life, once shattered. She is staying with a family - which knows nothing of her past - in a rain-swept village in the north of Moldova, but will soon have a place of her own, she hopes. </p> <p>At the beginning of this year, Katalina - who had grown up in an orphanage - was abandoned by her boyfriend after telling him she was pregnant. Soon afterwards, she was invited by a Russian woman to a birthday party in a local bar in her village near Moldova's second city, Balti. There, Katalina was offered a future in Moscow, with an option to work as a house painter or line worker at a pasta factory. Katalina opted to give it a try - why not? There was nothing for her in Moldova. But events twisted strangely when she and her Russian minder reached the Ukrainian border.</p> <p>'A policeman met us and drove us across the frontier, avoiding the crossings. The Russian paid the policeman and we went to get false papers made.' They then proceeded by train to Moscow, where Katalina met another girl from near Balti, who told her what was expected. 'You can't get away from here,' said the girl. 'They will break your legs.'</p> <p>So began Katalina's life as an enslaved prostitute, working a beat beneath a railway bridge, for which her traffickers paid local police. 'I was told never to say that I was pregnant, else the clients would not want me, and I would be beaten to pieces,' recalls Katalina. Some clients, she says, 'kept me for a number of days, and invited their friends. One man kept me for three or four days in a basement and invited 20 men. When I objected they told me I was a bitch. They had bought me and could do whatever they liked to me. Another time, I was on the 11th floor of a building with seven Moldovans, all of them taking drugs. After they had had their way, they insisted I smoke some drugs, too. When I refused, they became violent, and one of them opened a window and threatened to throw me out. But there was one man less stoned than the rest, who said, \"You are just a dirty whore,\" and sent me from the room.'</p> <p>Time passed in this way, until Katalina's pregnancy could no longer be hidden. Clients, their sensibilities offended, would beat and insult her, demanding their money back. The Russian traffickers beat her, too, saying they would lock Katalina away until she was due, 'and that they would sell my baby, when it came'.</p> <p>Katalina has an expression full of guile; it comes as no surprise when she says that she elected to escape. The flat in which she was kept by day was watched by police officers on the pimp's behalf, to prevent the girls from leaving. But Katalina noted when the police watch went for its daily lunch break. That was when she, and the other girl from her area, made a run for it. </p> <p>Laughter comes hard while talking about these things, but now the artful Katalina has her company in unlikely stitches. 'We did a funny thing,' she says. 'After running away from the flat, we took a trolleybus to Red Square, thinking this is where the train to Chisinau would go from. Just imagine, two escaped Moldovan prostitutes lost in a tourist trap, asking smart people how to get the train back to their little village.' Having found the station, they were picked up by the railway police and sent home. </p> <p>Moldova is Europe's poorest country and, says Unicef's representative there, Giovanna Barberis, 'one of the main, if not the main source country for the trafficking of women and children'.</p> <p>This is how a briefing paper drawn up by the Swedish Foreign Ministry's aid wing Sida - which is active in counter-trafficking projects in Eastern Europe - describes the country: 'Moldova has probably suffered the most devastating peacetime decline in economic performance and living standards of any country in modern times. From a situation of relative prosperity, GDP in this country has fallen by more than 70 per cent within a decade - placing Moldova on a par with the poorest countries in Asia and Africa. For most Moldovans, life has become a daily struggle to satisfy the most basic needs against increasingly uneven odds.'</p> <p>The bus station in Chisinau, Moldova's care-worn capital, is a monument to the nation's reaction to its fate - mass emigration. The population is officially set at 4.5m, after a census in 1989, but, says Barberis, 'the reality is probably nearer 3.5m. Hundreds of thousands have simply left, to find work, legally or illegally, in the West.' Every week, fleets of heaving coaches leave this bus station - with its mosaic showing a happy socialist life in factory and field - bound for Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. As a result, thousands of children are left abandoned by their parents, becoming prey to the trafficker's eye.</p> <p>Under communism, Moldova, with its fertile black soil, was the orchard of the USSR, and its industry was locked into the trans-Soviet infrastructure. Now, Moldovan society has been ravaged by a corrupt neo-communist political class and an economy beholden to the profits of crime. The price of agricultural produce is so low that much of it withers - literally - on the vine. The average wage is $50 (\u00a328) per month. And the generation now growing up with no memory of communism or relative prosperity is prey to those engaged in Moldova's rapidly growing and infamous export - human beings. </p> <p>'There are about 1m Moldovans living abroad,' says Barberis, 'and among that 1m, a great many have left illegally and are exposed to trafficking. They go in different ways. The traffickers are getting more and more sophisticated. There can be direct contact with a relative, friend, or friend of a friend. There are advertisements in the newspapers for fake jobs as waitresses, babysitters or cooks. They are invariably jobs advertised for women and it becomes an attractive offer, given the fact that unemployment is extremely high, given the fact that access to health care and education is extremely low, given the fact that domestic violence is deeply rooted.'</p> <p>There is a correlation between the subjugation of women and children in Moldovan society and their vulnerability to trafficking, says Daniela Popescu, who runs the Amicul centre for 'at risk' children in Chisinau. Some 80 per cent of trafficking victims, she says, have also been victims of domestic violence. 'There are old sayings passed on from grandparents,' she says: 'they say an unbeaten woman is like an untidy house, or beating his woman is a man's divine right.' Women are held in low esteem, have low self-esteem and tend to accept things as they are, not to denounce their men. They are accustomed to hard physical work, so it is often the best and strongest of them who decide they can be free from emotional and physical abuse, and can handle hard work abroad.</p> <p>'The traffickers are very much aware of these subjugated conditions,' she continues, 'and, ironically, will make promises such as, \"You are working at home and being beaten - why not work away from the beating, and get good money?\"'</p> <p>The village of Biesti, an hour north of the capital, is typical - the effect is unmistakable and striking. This is a community where there are no adults; a place where only children and old people walk the main street and muddy tracks. The children have for the most part been abandoned by their parents, and are thus vulnerable to the traffickers. Angelina, aged 13, just about manages on what her mother and father send back - she explains that her parents left for Orvieto in Italy, leaving her to look after her 10-year-old brother. </p> <p>But unlike most villages of its kind, there is a quiet revolution under way in Biesti - proving that where there is initiative, the traffickers will not have it all their own way. That with the right resources and the will to battle the traffickers with knowledge, there is reason for faint hope in this woebegone landscape. For here is one of a network of day centres funded by Unicef, devoted almost entirely to raising awareness of trafficking and 'life skills' in a world without adults, or where adults do not care. Every child in Biesti has, as a result, seen a film called Lilja 4-ever by the director Lukas Moodysson, about a Russian girl trafficked to Stockholm. 'We all cried when we saw it,' says Veronica, aged 16. 'We talked about it, and wondered, what would we do?' </p> <p>Veronica and her friend Aksenia are prime targets for any trafficker, but both girls talk with disarming maturity about the dangers, the film and its message. 'It is not enough just to have the information to be on the lookout,' says Aksenia, 'it is a matter of having the skills to act when and if you find that you are in trouble.' Everyone, however, wants to leave the village, adds Veronica. </p> <p>There are 63 'residential schools' for what are called the 'social orphans' of Moldova, where discarded children learn and live. These are places like that in which Katalina was raised, and in all, they hold some 13,000 children, any one of whom could be said to be 'at risk' to trafficking. In these places, too, Unicef is working against the peril that awaits these children once they try - as they will - to leave. At the orphanage in Orhei, a group of 14-year-olds has also seen Lilja 4-ever and rehearse a play they will perform to the school and around town about social exclusion, with its obvious message about the return of trafficked victims. 'We are learning that we must have them back,' says Svetlana, 'even if they have HIV and Aids.' </p> <p>'It is amazing to me,' says Barberis, 'that this issue of trafficking is simply not a matter for the government in this country. Similarly, not only is there no support for the victims of trafficking when they return, but there is no effort to re-integrate them, to rescue them from their non-future.'</p> <p>Viorica, a child of 17 from southern Moldova, cannot finish her story. She wanted, she says, to go to music school and improve her singing voice, 'to learn to sing and play'. But life had other plans for her. Instead, she was lured from her village by a distant cousin, to Turkey, with a promise of work. When she arrived at the coastal resort of Antalya, she 'was told to put on some clothes and get ready. \"It's time for you to work,\" they said. I asked what work? They said I was going to a hotel to be with men. When I objected,' she continues, 'they said I would have to do this thing if I ever wanted to see Moldova again. They threatened me with a gun and made me get into a car. We got to the hotel. The thing is, I'd never been with a man before. I was a virgin, and that night, they made me go with 11 men.' At this point, Viorica stops in the tracks of her tears and her words. It is a terrible moment. </p> <p>The psychologist treating Viorica, Ana Chirsanov, tells me that the girl has tried to commit suicide. 'Her soul was destroyed that first night, with those 11 men,' explains Dr Chirsanov. 'She used to resist, spitting and pulling the clients' hair, but they thought it was all part of some erotic game. She was crying out, \"I don't want to do this\", and they just laughed at her, amusing themselves. After which she got into thinking that she was the one who was insane and that this was what the world is like. That the people doing this to her were normal and she was insane to be unhappy about it.' Most of the girls, when they return, says Dr Chirsanov, 'speak of their desire to die. We had a case of one minor who had jumped from a sixth-floor window... she survived, after six surgical operations.'</p> <p>There is a glaring problem in calling what happened to Viorica, or any trafficked woman or girl, 'prostitution', since the word can imply a degree of consent. 'Here, there is absolutely no meaningful consent at all,' says Sian Jones, co-ordinator for the Balkans at Amnesty International. 'It is clear that if you knowingly have sex with a woman who has been trafficked, that is rape.'</p> <p>'There is no consent in sex with a trafficked woman,' says Denise Marshall, who runs the Poppy Project in south London, Britain's only shelter for trafficked women. 'If a trafficked woman is forced to see 30 clients a day, so far as I am concerned, that is 30 rapes a day. The impact on the body and on the psyche is the same as rape. It is the same level of violence against that woman.' </p> <p>A website called www.punternet.com offers an insight into these clients' heads. It invites entries from men comparing notes on prostitutes. On occasions, there is every indication that the woman visited is trafficked and that the client knows this. 'Worst shag of my life,' laments one entry, 'the girl was a robot - felt sorry for her - kept thinking why is she doing this? - she said only a couple of words to me - gave me 10 mins of hand job while looking the other way and jumping when I tried to touch her - she lay down trying to cover her tits - 15 mins with me trying to grab her ... Why does she do it? I probably can guess.'</p> <p>When politicians turn their attention to trafficking and prostitution - as the British Home Office is now doing - little attention is paid to the 'demand' side, to the punters. </p> <p>The debate is most advanced in Sweden, from where money has been pumped into counter-trafficking abroad and legislation enacted at home, in 1999, attempting to fight trafficking by tackling all use of prostitutes. 'The problem of demand has been engaged here by criminalising the buying of sexual services,' says Nina Strandberg, East Europe area manager for Sida. 'Basically, that means it is not illegal for a woman to sell sex, but it is illegal for a man to buy it. It's an interesting position, introduced as something we regard as integral to the battle against trafficking.' According to Stockholm police, the measure has cut by more than two-thirds the number of prostitutes being operated in the city, with 754 convictions from 1999 until this summer, and fines imposed. </p> <p>'The Swedish law is controversial, but until countries of destination for these women and girls have some kind of legislation in place, we cannot begin to address the matter of trafficking,' says Steve Ashby. 'Prosecution of traffickers is not enough - another will always take his place. But if there were tighter laws on demand, then a lot of the so-called punters would think twice before they accepted the risk.'</p> <p>'The Swedish measure would make a great difference if it was more widespread,' says Lesko. 'It targets the right people - not the girls who come back damaged, but the people who damage them.'</p> <p>'This matter of trafficking,' says Giovanna Barberis, 'is becoming of dramatic concern. And yet I do not see governments in Western Europe wanting to address and find solutions to this issue. In some places, there does not appear to be any political will at all. There are many countries in Europe which have not even thought to undertake a serious assessment or analysis.'</p> <p>The 45 member states of the Council of Europe are currently drafting a convention on trafficking, providing an opportunity for binding minimum standards for the protection of and support for trafficked people. Most governments - including Britain's - tip-toe, however, confusing the issue with smuggling and migration, and are wary of the political liability in any discourse on arrivals from Eastern Europe. Within the Home Office, there are conflicting interests, between immigration services, which put a priority on removing people without proper documentation, and law enforcement, which requires willing witnesses and intelligence to prosecute traffickers.</p> <p>A triumvirate of organisations - Unicef, Amnesty International and Anti-Slavery International - campaign for three basic standards to be met by the European convention. They are: first, support, shelter and safety provision for women who emerge as having been trafficked. Second, a minimum period during which women can decide whether they want to co-operate with police investigations. (Protection at the Poppy Project, now funded by the Home Office, is conditional on agreeing to help the police. Italy has the most advanced legislation to date, with a 90-day allowance for reflection, and now suggests a six-month reflection period.) Third, resident permits - temporary or permanent - should be on offer in the country of destination 'whenever there is reasonable likelihood that a trafficked person will be subject to re-trafficking or other serious harm'. Italy already has such a system, which has proven effective not only in terms of protecting victims, but also in prosecuting traffickers.</p> <p>Britain's record is different. In autumn 2003, London and Tirana signed a bilateral agreement on repatriation to Albania of girls or women found to have been trafficked. 'I cannot respect a policy of repatriation,' says Vera Lesko. 'Since that year, I've had 16 girls sent back from Britain, 14 of whom have since been re-trafficked back into the system. Is it really so hard for you to take 16 people?'</p> <p>Mike Kaye of Anti-Slavery International argues that 'there is no conflict between protection and prosecution'. Quite apart from respect for the human rights of a person who has had them destroyed, he says, 'Protection of trafficked people three distinct advantages: it disrupts the trafficking system, because they do not get re-trafficked; it favours intelligence, because they are more likely to tell the support agency how they were trafficked; and in the long or medium term, it means that the trafficked person is more likely to co-operate with the police.'</p> <p>'What really irritates me,' says Denise Marshallat the Poppy Project, 'is that governments - not just the UK - put the responsibility on to the country where these women originate. The fact is this: if British men were not wanting sex with trafficked women, then trafficked women would not be here. I had a woman who was raped 88 times - no, not 18, 88 - on Christmas Day 2002. She is completely annihilated. She is a religious woman who dares not go to church. She has a child but does not think she deserves to see that child. The men who did that to her were British, and I think Britain has a responsibility to provide her with at least sometime and proper resources. There are no quick-fix solutions for a woman like that.'</p> <p>Eva, from southern Albania, fell in love with the man who took her to Naples, promising a wedding. But on arrival, her fiance demanded that Eva work for him as a prostitute. 'When I protested, he said he would kill my family and that his accomplices back home would do the same thing to my sister.' The trafficker worked alongside a 'group of his friends' while Eva and other girls enslaved into their operation walked the streets of Naples, taking up to 20 clients a night to meet her quota, and, if lucky, avoid a beating. Most nights, however, would end with her being violated and beaten by her trafficker and his accomplices.</p> <p>'I could see people living their normal lives,' she says, her eyes staring into mid-distance - 'shopping, going about their business. They had their families and children with them, they had their lives, they had all the things I wanted but could never have. It made my heart cry to see them. Instead, I became accustomed to being a slave, crying all the time, but always afraid to leave him,because he knew my family, he knew my sister. I was alone, I had no one.'</p> <p>Eva's trafficker was brother to one of Albania's biggest dealers in drugs and women, who was killed in a car crash. Eva duly managed to escape when her trafficker returned to Tirana for the funeral, successfully seeking out one of her brothers, living in Venice. </p> <p>Eva, who wears a cross around her neck, has two distinct and different faces: the one she wears when telling her story hitherto - bounden, staring blankly - and another, which comes suddenly alive, effervescent, when she gets to this point in her narrative. In Savona, she met her sister-in-law, an evangelical Christian, who took Eva to church and to see a film about Mary Magdalene, the reformed prostitute. 'She saved my life,' says Eva, 'a certain peace came into me. I began to think differently and became a believer. My fear left me. I realised that people judge you, but God can forgive everything.' </p> <p>Now living in hiding from reprisal, as does her sister, Eva is clearly the life force of the shelter in which she lives. 'For the moment, I have what I want. I have my sister with me, I tidy up, I plant flowers, I sew.' But Eva also urges her fellow victims and those still captive, out there in the hell of enslavement, whence she returned: 'I tell them, do not be afraid to do what is right. Go to the police. Testify against those who exploit you, for they deserve to be punished.' </p> <p>All names of trafficked women and children in this article have been changed for their own safety.

  "<p>Snowboarding, bless its thermal socks, didn't really have the easiest of upbringings. For a start, its biological father has never been confidently identified: was it Jack Burchett, who in 1929 rustled together a crude snowboard with a plank of wood, some rope and horse reins for bindings? Or Sherman Poppen, whose prototype 'Snurfer' in 1965 was originally a gift for his daughter Wendy, but went on to shift half-a-million boards the following year? </p> <p>Either way, early childhood was problematic. In a world dominated by officiously minted skiers, snowboarding went down like a bad joke: initial designs were modelled on surfboards right down to the tail fins (useless in everything but deep powder), and snowboarders were ridiculed as wannabe surf dudes way out of their depth. In most resorts they were banned outright, while places that allowed them forbade use of the lifts, as their non-release bindings failed to comply with the industry standards for ski equipment safety. </p> <p>So it was that snowboarding's anti-social tendencies were fostered from an early age; denied the pristine pistes of their more affluent Alpine cohabitees, snowboarders became pack animals with unofficial diplomas in backcountry DIY, huddled in groups, hiking the soft stuff and building terrain of their own. Snowboarding gathered an outlaw momentum quickly picked up on by the youth media; punk rock and skater style gave their mountain migration a worldwide momentum, and pretty soon the size of snowboarders' pants was beaten only by the size of their ramps. </p> <p>Attitude and altitude combined and, as an aggressive adolescent, snowboarding began to break free from its patronising stepfather (the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Ski), its catalogue of ever more insane tricks and powder lines making most skiers feel understandably middle-aged. But not any more: if anything, the image of freestyle skiing these days has made commendable progress, looking and sounding exactly like snowboarding did more than 10 years ago - from the dyed dreds down to the oversized threads. Skiers have infiltrated snowboard parks across the world (now called 'terrain parks' so as not to upset anybody), and have even adopted many of snowboarding's signature moves, from rodeo flips to rail slides, the latter especially coming under a regular barrage of ridicule from boarders. </p> <p>Politically correct tendencies aside, however, terrain parks remain snowboard-oriented affairs, much improved by recently increased investment and a range of specialist shaping equipment (the mighty Zaugg Pipe Monster, for example). </p> <p>The prevailing 'no falls, no balls' attitude of yesteryear has all but evaporated, and most parks contain at least a smattering of entry-level kickers and rails, if not an entirely separate beginners' area. Throw in a sizeable sound system, an on-site bar and a team of professional shapers, and you can see why so many snowboarders invest in reduced-fare, park-only lift passes for their trip. Europe is home to some world-class parks. </p> <p><strong> France</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Tignes</strong> has always been a popular choice with beginners, home as it is to a downsized half-pipe (always best in the first few weeks of the season, as the sun quickly takes the edge off it), a wide variety of smaller ramps and rails and a famously relaxed atmosphere (the communal barbecue certainly helps). The Tignes park is located on the Carline piste in Val Claret, although advanced riders are recommended to head for the Bellevarde/La Daille sector of neighbouring <strong> Val d'Is\u00e8re</strong>, where a decidedly more trouser-filling selection of obstacles awaits, including a burly boardercross course, two opposing quarter-pipes and a truly intimidating 30-metre tabletop jump. </p> <p><strong> Avoriaz</strong> is another firm favourite with the freestyle fraternity, and with good reason. It's not only the local architecture that's forward-thinking; the Arare snowpark was set up in 1993 - a year when most European resort managers still imagined half-pipes to be a kind of unsavoury drug paraphernalia - and to this day it continues to offer some of the biggest and best-shaped modules around, all of them perfectly situated to soak up the afternoon sun. </p> <p>Avoriaz is also home to the La Chappelle snowpark - better suited to beginners - and a park specially designed for the emerging sport of snowskating, of which locals Nico Droz and Sebastian 'Paco' Raban are emerging inter national ambassadors. France's best introduction to snowboarding, however, comes via the Kommunity summer camps in <strong>Les Deux Alpes</strong>. Run by UK snowboard legend Neil McNab, the camps have a British flavour, offering a non-pressure riding environment (with a huge variety of recreational apr\u00e8s-ski activities, from rock climbing to white-water rafting), and catering for a range of abilities, all coming under the expert eye of renowned UK riders like Jenny Jones, Gary Greenshields and Adam Gendle. The snowpark in Les Deux Alpes is also first-rate. </p> <p><strong> Switzerland</strong><br> </p> <p> Switzerland doesn't offer quite the same abundance of terrain, but <strong>Saas-Fee</strong> is a bustling hub of rider-related shenanigans all the same. This is never more apparent than during the post-season slush, when the Ice Ripper spring and summer camps (<a href=\"http://www.iceripper.com\">iceripper.com)</a> descend on the glacier for week-long snowboarding beanos, with hotels, lift passes and professional tuition included in the package, and with regular piss-ups at the notorious Popcorn Bar as standard. </p> <p><strong> Les Diablerets</strong> (00 41 024 492 3481, <a href=\"http://www.diablerets.ch\">diablerets.ch</a>) is a perfect spot for riders to stretch their legs in late autumn. There is a good range of ramps and rails - many of them suited to beginners - at the James B snowboard camp, which opens in October and operates from the Mon Abri dormitory, home of the infamous B-bar (<a href=\"http://www.monabri.ch\">monabri.ch</a> ). </p> <p><strong> Italy</strong><br> </p> <p> Italy's most snowboard-friendly resort is <strong>Livigno</strong>, and its extensive snowboard park - on the far side of the Mottolina gondola - sets an epic stage for the formidable Burton European Open freestyle contest each January. </p> <p><strong> Germany</strong><br> </p> <p> Germany, meanwhile, may not be renowned for its world-class terrain, but it has an excellent park at <strong> Garmisch-Partenkirchen</strong> (00 49 8821 180 700, <a href=\"http://www.garmisch-partenkirchen.de\">garmisch-partenkirchen.de</a>), and also hosts some top-notch summer camps courtesy of Gap 1328 (00 49 8821 52247, <a href=\"http://www.gap1328.de\">gap1328.de</a>). Bear in mind, however, that the resort isn't glacial, and the snow can be slushy. </p> <p><strong> Austria</strong><br> </p> <p> While Austria is best known for its extensive powder fields and immaculately groomed slopes, it also has some cracking parks: from the dramatic Skyline Park in <strong> Nordpark</strong>, just out of Innsbruck, to a variety of freestyle terrains in <strong> Mayrhofen</strong>, including the Penken Park and the 360m-long super-pipe on the Hintertux Glacier. </p> <p>Of course, a list such as this can never be comprehensive: most resorts these days have some sort of terrain park, and while individual set-ups will always have unique personalities - reflections of the shapers who shape them, the riders who shred them and the resort itself - if you've ridden one great park, you can pretty much guess what the next one will be like. </p> <p><strong> Finland</strong><br> </p> <p> There are still some rare gems out there, rough and uncut and offering more than just big speakers and well-sculpted landings. <strong> Talma</strong> (00 358 9274 5410, <a href=\"http://www.talmaski.fi\">talmaski.fi</a>), in Finland, has become something of a mecca for more fanatical snowboarders, rumoured as it is to have sold its soul to the satan of progressive freestyle. Despite Talma's diminutive scale (the hill itself - for mountain it most certainly is not - resembles a sort of oversized Xscape without the sanitised electric lighting), this tiny hamlet has produced some of professional snowboarding's most valued players over the last few years, including Jussi Oksanen, Heikki Sorsa and Wille Yli Luoma. </p> <p>Since then, riders have been flocking from around the world to sample the well-shaped kickers, soak up the small town atmosphere (the slopes don't open until 4pm on weekdays) and try to locate the source of all this seemingly inexplicable talent. </p> <p><strong> Norway</strong><br> </p> <p> For a road even less travelled, make a post-season pit stop at the <strong> Folgefonna</strong> summer camp in Norway (00 47 328 26000, <a href=\"http://www.folgefonna.no\">folgefonna.no</a>). Winters here are dark and depressing (and the cause of much aneurysm-inspiring black metal music), but summer is one long celebration, and the extreme northern latitude makes for roughly 20 hours of sunlight daily, with riding until the wee hours in an eerie perpetual twilight. </p> <p>Camp accommodation - five kilometres (three miles) from the small town of Jondalen - is rustic to say the least, but the sparseness of the place is half the charm. Expect jagged backdrops, misty mountain lakes and a notable absence of tourists - plus some of the friendliest people, best-shaped park facilities and, unfortunately, most overpriced pints you'll ever come across. </p> <p><strong> Iceland</strong><br> </p> <p> For the real back of beyond, however, it has to be the Iceland Park Project (<a href=\"http://www.icelandparkproject.com\">icelandparkproject.com</a>), set up in 2002 by a small team (including Glaswegian snowboarder and professional shaper Graham MacVoy), disillusioned with the stresses, strains and steadily diminishing soul of big-park riding and looking to set up a venture of their own somewhere more out of the way. And it doesn't get much more out of the way than IPP, straddling the <strong> Snaefells Glacier</strong> that inspired H.G. Wells to write Journey to the Centre of the Earth. You can forget about five-star restaurants and en suite PlayStations - there aren't even any lifts, as hiking is part and parcel of the Icelandic experience - but for a riding retreat with rewards as much spiritual as they are sports-related, IPP is in a league of its own. </p> <p><strong> Competitive thrills</strong><br> </p> <p> Turn up at these parks on any given day and you're guaranteed to see some astonishing riders pushing the boundaries of amplitude (see glossary at the bottom), hucking themselves off bigger kickers, soaring out of steeper pipes and stomping tricks sicker than anything you'll see on telly. But for the most memorable and dramatic display of skills, you'll want to get yourself along to one of Europe's premier snowboarding competitions. With rider performance so reliant on good visibility and clean, well-sculpted ramps, unpredictable winter weather can often put a bit of a dampener on things, but even then the after-show parties are some of the biggest and most booze-fuelled you'll ever not quite remember. </p> <p>One that's garnered a well-earned reputation for debauchery is the annual <strong> Snowbombing</strong> festival (<a href=\"http://www.snowbombing.com\">snowbombing.com</a>), claiming to offer 'boarding by day and beats by night', but in reality featuring DJs spinning till long after sunrise and leaving most punters reeling (or just plain sleeping) until late afternoon. Closer to the roots of snowboarding is the <strong> Verbier Extreme</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.xtremeverbier.com\">xtremeverbier.com</a>), which pits the world's most fearless backcountry riders against a chopper-drop powder face peppered with intimidating cliffs and chutes. </p> <p>And at the other end of the scale is the UK's homegrown <strong> AIM Series</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.aimseries.com\">aimseries.com</a> the qualifiers for which are staged at dry slopes and indoor snowdomes across the country, culminating in the annual British Championships in France. </p> <p>But few of these contests are self-contained events. Since the collapse of the International Snowboarding Federation (ISF) in 2002, the professional circuit has been dominated by the <strong> Ticket To Ride</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.ttrprosnowboarding.com\">www.ttrprosnowboarding.com</a>), a series of 'by rider, for rider' events leading up to the infamous Arctic Challenge. This end-of-season showdown, in the wilderness of Lofoten, Norway, is snowboarding's answer to the World Cup final, and it's similarly hard to secure tickets. </p> <p><strong>How to speak snowboard</strong></p> <p>It won't help you nail your first cab 900 (two-and-a-half rotations), but a rudimentary knowledge of snowboarder speak might stop you looking like a hopeless dork when it comes to buttering up the locals. </p> <p><strong>Amplitude</strong> A given rider's degree of sickness (see below). Most usually corresponds to the height of a particular trick.</p> <p><strong>Claiming</strong> Unnecessarily congratulating oneself on stomping a trick, either verbally or with immediate celebratory body language.</p> <p><strong>Corked</strong> A trick executed with off-axis, or inverted rotation. Often engaged accidentally, resulting in hospitalisation.</p> <p><strong>Garage sale</strong> The redistribution of equipment (goggles flying one way, gloves and hat another) that follows a bad fall: a recurrent problem with back-country spin cycles.</p> <p><strong>Hucking</strong> The act of launching oneself from a ramp, off a cliff or out of a pipe; group pursuits of the same are known as 'huckfests', 'jams' or 'sessions'.</p> <p><strong>Jibbing</strong> Shredding something other than snow, eg rails, rocks or cars.</p> <p><strong>Scorpion</strong> A kind of unintentional faceplant in which your legs rear up behind you and your board cracks the back of your head. Worthy follow-up to a tindy.</p> <p><strong>Shred</strong> To ride hard, to 'schralp'. A safe bet for skiers trying to look like snowboarders, as in: 'Dude, did you see me shred the rad/schralp the gnar back there?'</p> <p><strong>Sick</strong> An oft-heard cry of encouragement, as in: 'That cab underflip was sick' or 'Danny is such a sick rider'.</p> <p><strong>Sketchy</strong> A graceless and uncontrolled trick or landing; can also be applied to people's general outlooks on life (especially those who 'claim' tricks, or who actually say things like 'shred the rad/ schralp the gnar').</p> <p><strong>Spin cycle</strong> Involuntary cartwheels caused by coming a cropper on steep off-piste.</p> <p><strong>Steez</strong> Style. You have it or you don't.</p> <p><strong>Stomping</strong> To land solidly and with perfect control; also to 'stick', 'nail' or 'dial' a trick.</p> <p><strong>Tindy</strong> A hideous variation on the standard indy grab (grabbing the tail, rather than between the feet) by kids that don't know any better. Categorically low on steez.</p> <p><strong>Tweaked</strong> The emphasis of style in a given trick, usually involving a long and pronounced grab; also 'boned'.</p> <p><strong>1260</strong> The world record for most rotations in the air by a snowboarder (three and a half), which was set by Canadian rider Marc Andre Tarte at last year's Air and Style contest in Innsbruck.</p> <p><strong>Winding down the windows</strong> A spasmodic flapping of the arms mid-air that signifies excess amplitude. Often followed by a particularly painful scorpion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>To order a copy of Time Out Skiing &amp; Snowboarding in Europe for \u00a38.99 go to <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/shop\">timeout.com/shop</a></p>",
  "<p>Perhaps Everton are missing Wayne Rooney after all. Only Arsenal and Manchester United had taken points off them before this result, but David Moyes will not be making that proud boast again now his team have been rumbled by unadventurous Tottenham. </p> <p>Spurs came here willing to defend for a point, and found Everton unable to prevent them taking all three. Jacques Santini's side barely managed an attack of note or an effort on target until slack marking by the hitherto well-drilled Everton defence allowed Noe Pamarot to steal in and steal a lead in the second half. After that, the third-placed team looked much more like the pushovers of last season than potential qualifiers for Europe. Spurs simply kept things tight at the back to win comfortably, and Everton may find it hard to rebuild their confidence. 'We have been missing chances, but this time we only had one and we took it,' Santini said. </p> <p>The theory that Jermain Defoe is playing more football than Michael Owen and is a threat to the latter's England place took a battering during the first half. Defoe was on the field, though it was questionable whether he was exposed to any more football than someone watching Real Madrid from the bench. With Everton doing all the attacking, Defoe was exposed to the ball only three times in the first 45 minutes, and though he produced one elegant turn to baffle Alan Stubbs, on the other two occasions the ball finished high, wide and harmless. </p> <p>Everton made inroads down the flanks, even if their policy of playing Marcus Bent on his own up front reduced their potency in front of goal. Bent had a good shout for a penalty waved away after four minutes, when Erik Edman again got away with a reckless challenge, but afterwards the home side struggled to get the right man on the end of their most promising moves. Tim Cahill struck a post after outjumping the Spurs defence directly from Thomas Gravesen's long throw, then the Australian sent in a dangerous cross from the right that Leon Osman headed straight at Paul Robinson. Kevin Kilbane showed he had the beating of Pamarot on several occasions, yet when he rounded the full-back to leave himself a clear sight of goal, he could only drag his shot wide. </p> <p>One of these teams went through September without conceding a league goal, the other went without scoring one, so no one was expecting a thriller. At least Spurs were able to depart from the usual script early in the second half, Pamarot piercing a defensive shield that had held for almost 500 minutes with a free header when Simon Davies crossed from the right. </p> <p>Everton's response was to send on Duncan Ferguson, who might have done better with one or two of their first-half opportunities had Moyes trusted him to last 90 minutes. The manager is obliged to be conservative because of the paucity of resources at his disposal, which is what makes Everton's position in the table all the more impressive. </p> <p>Reinforcements will arrive after Christmas, but Everton's options were further reduced when Cahill limped off following an over-the-ball challenge for which Jamie Redknapp was lucky to receive only a booking. Defoe was also booked for a two-footed challenge on Weir, but Santini came up with a novel defence. 'When players are tired it is difficult for them to control their actions,' he said. 'I don't think they were trying to cause serious injury.' Cahill disagreed, judging by his reaction to Redknapp's attempted handshake, and so did Moyes. 'I don't think Jamie Redknapp is that type of player, but most referees would have shown him the red card,' he said. </p> <p>The only chance of an equaliser came when Osman produced a smart turn and a shot against an upright, with Kilbane not quick enough to the rebound. But Everton did not really deserve anything from the game and had Keane not been so wasteful with a good chance in injury time, the scoreline would have reflected that. 'We're disappointed but not sad,' Moyes said. 'If we carry on playing like that, we'll win more than we lose.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>My boyfriend and I have been living together for five years. I have a successful job whereas his is low-paid and menial.

I want to buy a house, but he complains every time it's mentioned - he says that I suffocate him and that it's too conventional for him.

The relationship is imploding and you're in danger of inflicting some real long-term damage on to one another. Your friends have probably been listening to your chagrin for some time and have exhausted their counselling ability. Also, it is so much easier to recommend leaving a lover than actually doing it. So while it's tempting, it seems pointless that I merely join their chorus. You need to take control of your own destiny rather than fuming with your boyfriend for not giving you the life you want. Go ahead and buy your house and discover then how 'conventional' he is.</p> <p>It's a perfect opportunity to sort out your finances as he can't really expect you to keep supporting him if you've got a mortgage to pay and he's so anti-property in the first place. Try living apart from each other during this period, as it may not feel like the break-up you dread so much. You'll also have plenty of distractions, sorting out your new house. You may even consider the possibility of a lodger to help pay the bills, and suddenly the lure of a live-in lover may lose its appeal.</p> <p>You haven't given one example of how this man enhances your life, but if the relationship is strong enough to survive, this move won't kill it. I'm certain your panic at the thought of his leaving you is the universal fear of loneliness. It's always the worst reason to stay with someone and will bash your self-esteem badly. Believe me, staying with someone who grinds you down on a daily basis is a far lonelier experience in the long run. Give yourself - and him - a breather, focus on doing something constructive and you'll soon work out what future you have as a couple. </p> <p> <strong>My girlfriend has put on some weight recently, although it doesn't bother me in the slightest, as I find her sexy and gorgeous at all times. She's recently asked me to help her lose the weight and stop her eating fattening food, but I've learnt from before that the weight issue is a topic that should be avoided with women at all costs.</strong></p> <p> You have my sympathy, my friend, as the first time you try to wrestle the Pringles from her grasp, you risk provoking the fatal 'Do you think I'm fat?' accusation. I'd be kidding you if I didn't tell you that you're in a game of very high stakes. However, we must give your girlfriend the benefit of the doubt, as she has taken an admirably sensible approach to the matter. Clearly she wants you to pipe up next time she reaches for her third slice of Black Forest. Her open attitude to eating will ensure she nips her perceived problem in the bud and prevents it from becoming a serious weight issue. If everyone in a household conspires in the slimmer's game, it diffuses the pain and shame. </p> <p>The moment weight becomes a taboo topic is when you've generally got a problem for Overeaters' Anonymous. If you're the person she shares most meals with, then it's perfectly natural to enrol your help. She would never solicit you if she felt you secretly saw her as a case for the local WeightWatchers. Because you haven't been sticking weighing scales in every available corner and clearing the fridge of all but low-cal yogurts, she trusts you merely to offer a gentle reminder the next time she falls off the wagon (wheel). </p> <p>You could also try to make the whole exercise a bit more fun by removing the focus from food and shifting it to some kind of activity - running/walking/cycling/sex are all fantastic calorie-burners you could enjoy together. Then you can join in her pleasure and feel some vicarious pride as the pounds fall off.

  "<p>Writing about wine is a fairly sedate affair. Booze hacks get lots of nice perks - travel, free vino and an all-year-round suntan - but we rarely enjoy the thrill of scoops or exclusives. I sometimes wonder what it must be like to report from a war zone or to be Woodward and Bernstein, meeting Deep Throat in a badly lit underground car park. I'll probably never know, but my pulse still quickened when I received an anonymous letter in a plain-brown envelope recently.</p> <p>The letter was from an Oddbins insider and had a lot of rude things to say about the UK's favourite wine chain. As a bit of background, I should tell you that Oddbins was bought by the French wine company Castel in February 2002. To start with, people (including your correspondent) felt this was a positive move. Oddbins was in the hands of people who were wine specialists, rather than bankers or venture capitalists. But two and a half years on, the chain is struggling.</p> <p>This might come as a surprise to readers who visit Oddbins' shops - still staffed by some of the brightest and most over-educated sales assistants in the world and still boasting a range of more than 1,000 lines. It might also come as a surprise to the judges of the 2004 Wine Challenge Awards, who made Oddbins their High Street Retailer of the Year recently. For all its problems, Oddbins remains one of the best places in the UK to buy wine. Just compare and contrast with Threshers or Unwins.</p> <p>So what did my anonymous correspondent have to complain about? Lack of direction was part of it, as was the departure of two of the chain's four wine buyers, most of its marketing department, its bond manager and its PR manager. It cannot be a coincidence, he or she argued, that so many good people have left at once. </p> <p>The main thrust of the criticism, however, was that Castel is using Oddbins as a place to sell its own wines. In this respect, it's arguably doing much the same thing as Oddbins' previous owner, Seagram, who sold its own wines and Champagnes through Oddbins, some of which were underwhelming. But my source feels that Castel is dumping a fair bit of 'crap' on Oddbins and thereby undermining its reputation.</p> <p>A glance at the shelves and an impromptu tasting of a few of the 50-odd Castel lines is a depressing experience: a few so-so clarets and vins de pays undermine the quality of Oddbins' French range. If Deep Throat is right, then there will be 'another 40 Castel wines sneaking in before Christmas' and, in 2005, '25 per cent of the entire ongoing range from Castel and friends'.</p> <p>I should point out that Oddbins' head of buying, Lynne Coyle, says that this is untrue, but she would say that, wouldn't she?</p> <p>I feel very protective about Oddbins. Its list isn't as good as it was five years ago, but neither is it as unwieldy as when its buyers indulged their enthusiasms with little regard for the commercial consequences. I don't begrudge Castel's desire to make a profit, or streamline the business to a degree, but I'm worried about the way things are going. Prices have increased under Castel, and the chain's profit margins are now the highest in the country. More to the point, some of those Castel wines really are crap.</p> <p>My anonymous letter ends with a single word - HELP. I don't share quite the same sense of panic, but I still hope Castel is listening. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tim.atkin@observer.co.uk\">tim.atkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Libra 23 Sep-23 Oct</strong><br> Feeling up to speed? The faster you can process the array of information and people that are heading your way, the better - this week it can easily become an overload. If all is quiet across your desk and in your diary, there's no better time than to make a bit of noise yourself. Either way, not the week for idling, even though, with Neptune strong in your 'scope, so is your fantasy life. </p> <p><strong>Scorpio 24 Oct-21 Nov </strong><br> You could do worse than play up to Scorpio's secretive, mysterious reputation while plotting out your next big move, which is probably not due until after the 23rd (unless you were born in 1980, in which case next week is hot). Good week for social encounters, nonetheless. The old pals act is fine, but quirky newcomers offer better prospects for a fling; especially yoga teachers, dotcom nerds, campaigning ecologists and other futurist types. </p> <p><strong>Sagittarius 22 Nov-21 Dec</strong><br> Newcomers arriving in your life are to be welcomed, even if it does feel like an invasion - among other things, they can help draw the sting from your pressured professional scenario. That is now easing, even though you seem to be stuck in the public gaze with Venus for the time being. Rather than fret about it, you might as well dress up and put on a good show. </p> <p><strong>Capricorn 22 Dec-19 Jan</strong><br> If you listened clearly to the voice announcing your vocation (whenever that was), you can now clamber up the rocky career slopes with the agility of that Mountain Goat of yours. If you weren't hearing that well first time round, it's time to tune back in - even by Cap standards, professional direction is currently everything. By way of entertainment, Venus highlights inspirational friends and long-distance lovers - or vice versa. </p> <p><strong>Aquarius 20 Jan-19 Feb</strong><br> It's a Neptune week. If bright ideas are your business, and especially if you're trying to surf the zeitgeist, here's the perfect week for a breakthrough. If you're more of a 'people person', as they put it overseas, here's a herd of folks to keep you hopping. If you're the artistic kind, here's otherworldly inspiration. And if you're a wannabe lover, make sure your latest dreamboat is who or what they say.</p> <p><strong>Pisces 20 Feb-20 Mar</strong><br> If you're lucky enough to be in a big-deal romance, now's the time to start talking how you might take it to the next level; sharing rent, rings, whatever. If you have just unshackled yourself, the obverse is true - start haggling about whose CD collection it is anyway. If you're single, here's a fine week for bumping into someone new, or at least someone you never knew you fancied. </p> <p><strong>Aries 21 Mar-19 Apr</strong><br> Your zodiacal opposite and alter ego is Libra, the sign of interdependency, fair play, and diplomacy - exactly the qualities you're looking for now that a bunch of planets is glaring at you from the Scales. Whether that means tip-toeing round your surly spouse or doing some devilish double-dealing with your adversaries - sleeping with the enemy if you like - depends on circumstance. Those of you casting round for playmates are directed to next weekend. </p> <p><strong>Taurus 20 Apr-20 May</strong><br> Pleasure or perspiration? Over the next few weeks you get both options. Sixth house planets are renewing your work situation, making a change of employment worth considering, and perhaps pushing you into a more directorial direction. Still, with sensual Venus - your governor - so helpfully sited for the rest of October, the temptations of chocolate nibbling and shameless flirtation are there to be surrendered to. Have your cake, eat it, then hit the gym.</p> <p><strong>Gemini 21 May-20 Jun</strong><br> Quicken the pace a little. The rare dynamic dominating your horoscope favours a work hard/play hard agenda - wrestle lovers and rivals into submission through sheer personality and thrash all-comers at ping pong/poker/your sport of choice. As the force with you is visceral rather than intellectual, emotions and instinct are your allies. By contrast, so-called hard information can prove decidedly misleading - best double-check anything that smells squiffy. </p> <p><strong>Cancer 21 Jun-22 Jul</strong><br> Good week to plan ahead, press your point with those who need it impressed, and generally remind the world that you are alive and prickly as ever. The major exception involves your family, where there's too much clamour and disinformation to get a clear idea of what's happening - especially if you're mixed up with builders or estate agents. The next week or so brings clarity to what is a long-term situation.</p> <p><strong>Leo 23 Jul-22</strong><br> Aug Imagining life as a Gemini may help you at this point; frantically chasing people and events, never shutting up, but never supplying a definite reply either. For a stately Leo, you're in a state of major flux, but given the ongoing clamour from third house planets, you better get used to living in a state of ambiguity. Next weekend, people and events chase you: all back to yours, then.</p> <p><strong>Virgo 23 Aug-22 Sep</strong><br> The must-do list is doubtless jam-packed, but try not to become as overheated as your Mercury ruler, which this week gets frazzled (metaphorically speaking) as it passes the Sun. Setting a few limits on your so-called obligations will help. As Venus arrives in your sign tomorrow, cool, carefree and glamorous (Lauren Bacall style) is the way to go. If you're too fretful to manage that, smiles and sensuality will do just fine.</p> <p><strong>If it's your birthday this week</strong></p> <p>Be bright, be quick. Mercury, sharpener of wits, lends clarity to your schemes. Since you spend winter and early summer under the beams of Jupiter, Lord of Enlargement, personal liberty, globe-hopping and influential folks are incoming themes. Jupiter expands ambitions, waistlines and possibly bank accounts - get on a roll but don't go gambling away the family fortune. You're better off spending it on the high life than speculating. Happy Returns.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine that Charles Saatchi had somehow been appointed chairman of the trustees of the Tate, and that after a year of bitter rows he suddenly resigned, blaming his director, Nicholas Serota, for an exhibitions programme that entirely ignored conceptual art, and you get some idea of the ugly mess that has engulfed the Design Museum and is now threatening its very existence. Saatchi would look like a self-serving bully, indulging in special pleading for artists in his own collection. But any director who let things get so badly out of hand would also face serious questions about their diplomatic skills. </p> <p>James Dyson, of vacuum cleaner fame, presented his resignation as the chairman of the Design Museum last week as a last-ditch attempt to rescue the place from the clutches of the fashionistas and the air-kissers. But his departure, along with his fortune, has left a worrying gap, and is really the result of a muddle about how the museum is run. </p> <p>The problem is not so much a question of whether the Design Museum exhibits engineering triumphs or Manolo Blahnik; it's a battle between three exceptionally strong-minded people for the future of an institution that they all care about deeply: Dyson, Alice Rawsthorn, the director, and Terence Conran, who established the museum 20 years ago. </p> <p>Dyson left after the other trustees refused to back his attempts to rein in Rawsthorn and her determination, as he saw it, to pursue a programme pitched more at Constance Spry and the readers of Wallpaper than Walter Gropius and vacuum cleaners. The last straw for Dyson was Rawsthorn's exhibition about flower arranging. As she saw it, Constance Spry provided a genuine insight into domestic life in the 1950s. Dyson didn't agree and the fact that it was Rawsthorn's replacement for a show Conran had set his heart on, and which she had cancelled, didn't exactly help matters. </p> <p>With Conran's support, Dyson demanded that Rawsthorn allow the trustees the chance to do more than rubber stamp her programme and that she agree to an annual meeting to look at the museum's objectives and programmes. 'We don't want to tell her what to do - the final decisions are hers - but we want to be able to discuss policies,' says Conran. When she refused, the other trustees offered her more time to consider her position. Dyson lost patience, and went public with his frustration, even though he had agreed to keep quiet for the sake of the museum. </p> <p>Design, he said, was about serious, technical things, not shallow styling. It should be about turbo fan jet engines and body scanners, not football boots, frocks and hats - an emphasis that was, 'ruining the museum's reputation and betraying its purpose. It's become a style showcase, instead of upholding its mission to encourage serious design, of the manufactured object.' </p> <p>Nobody is sadder about the row than Terence Conran, who has given the museum \u00a325 million over the years, and who still owns the freehold of the building in London's Docklands that he leases to the museum for a peppercorn. He is now considering walking away, cutting his support for the museum - last year he contributed another \u00a3200,000 to balance the books - and leaving it to sink or swim. 'It is not a case of Alice goes, or I go, in fact I want her to stay,' says Conran. 'But at the next meeting of the trustees on 28 October, if they agree with me, and say to her, \"You will do the job in a different way than you have been doing it\", she would either have to do it, or go. But if things go on as they are, then I can't stay.' </p> <p>Rawsthorn, who has maintained a cool silence since Dyson's outburst, would claim that design was about both style and substance. She has thrown all her energy into proving it. In three years she has boosted visitor numbers by 20 per cent, and has persuaded the Department of Culture Media and Sport to make a substantial grant toward the museum's education programme for the first time. Since the rows began last year, Rawsthorn has budgeted to do without Conran's money, but less than 40 per cent of its annual expenditure for 2004-05 of \u00a32.24m is expected to be generated by the museum itself. She is counting on \u00a3600,000 in public funding, with the rest coming from sponsorship and charitable trusts. But with such a public row, the museum will find fund raising much harder. </p> <p>Without Conran's support, financial as well as personal, it's hard to see how it could survive. If it did go under, it would be a huge setback to the cause of contemporary design in Britain that the museum was set up to promote. As Sir Christopher Frayling, a former trustee and now chairman of the Arts Council, says: 'It's been a bad two weeks for the modern and contemporary in Britain. Design has taken a knock. First the V&amp;A's spiral was abandoned and now the Design Museum is in trouble.' </p> <p>A group of trustees with more experience of public museums would not have let things get to this point, but then the Design Museum has no parallel in Britain, and few in the world. It exists only as the result of Conran's personal conviction and energy - as well as a succession of directors that began with Stephen Bayley. It has survived where other new museums opened in the last decade have gone to the wall because of Conran's money and its sense of purpose. On one level, the crisis is a sign of its growing maturity as it transforms itself from a private passion into a public institution. A director determined to make the museum in her own image is perhaps the natural successor to a hands-on founder like Conran. But if the museum is to secure its long-term future it must outgrow both of them. </p> <p>Despite Dyson's claims that he is interested in hard-edged design, it was his support for a fashion project that provoked his first major falling out with Rawsthorn last year. Dyson met the Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake in Tokyo, and promised him the Design Museum for a London exhibition of his work. Miyake's office duly called Rawsthorn before Christmas to make the arrangements, only to be told that the exhibition was 'inappropriate'. Relations between Rawsthorn, who was herself a trustee until she became director, and Conran and Dyson have been increasingly tense since this episode. In February, Conran was publicly humiliated when Rawsthorn declared she would no longer host the Conran Collection, an annual show that Conran funds personally. </p> <p>'The trouble is that both Terence and James own their companies, and are used to getting their way,' says one close observer. 'When they get angry they can seem like bullies, which is the worst way to treat Alice. She just digs in. But at the same time, Alice is a former journalist, who has no idea what trustees are for, or how to let her staff speak for themselves. She wants complete control.' </p> <p>The trustees, who include John Hegarty, Peter Palumbo, and designer Richard Seymour, are increasingly concerned about the damage done to the museum by these public disagreements. This summer, a majority of them were angered when Dyson wrote an article for a newspaper in which he criticised the frivolous tendency of the museum's recent exhibitions. A sequence of three shows that included Manolo Blahnik, Nike Shoes and a display of hats by Philip Treacy certainly left the place looking more like a museum of fashion rather than design. Most agreed that things were out of balance, but they criticised Dyson for speaking out, rather than representing the museum. </p> <p>To judge by visitor numbers, the public don't agree with Dyson's view of design. At his instigation, the museum mounted an exhibition on the Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 2001 and attracted just 27,299 visitors. Rawsthorn gave Manolo Blahnik the chance to stage a shoe retrospective, and clocked up 64,371 ticket sales. Faced with these figures, Dyson started to suggest that the museum shouldn't just go for easy popularity. </p> <p>What lies behind all this is a generational shift. Neither Dyson nor Conran made their reputations by following the somewhat strait-laced version of design they now seem to be advocating. It is as though - after pursuing with consummate success the art of elegant, well-made consumer products that seduce as much as perform - they feel uneasy at ignoring the message of form following function that they were schooled in, and are now expecting a new generation to go back to the Bauhaus. Rawsthorn has a different view: rather than preaching she wants to entertain. But that can't be the only objective of an institution that calls itself a museum. </p> <p>Over the past year, efforts have been made to repair the breach between the two sides. Before he left, Christopher Frayling tried to negotiate an agreement that would defuse tension with the trustees, who saw themselves deprived of a role in the museum's affairs. As one eyewitness said: 'Meetings had turned into a monologue at which trustees sat listening to Alice talking about her achievements, and refusing to discuss her exhibitions programme.' </p> <p>Frayling believed a compromise had been reached, but when the proposal was put to Rawsthorn in writing, though she claims to have accepted it, she did so in such a way that a number of trustees believed that she had rejected it. 'If Terence had wanted a sycophant in the role [of director], he absolutely wouldn't have chosen me, because he knew how stroppy and stubborn I can be,' Rawsthorn said in a newspaper interview in happier times. In the same article Conran said: 'Sometimes we disagree, but luckily we share most of the same views. I tell her, \"Alice, you are the boss. You decide.\" We have never fallen out, we agree to differ.' </p> <p>Conran still believes that Rawsthorn in her three years as director has transformed and energised the museum, which under its previous director, Paul Thomson, now running America's Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in New York, had been reduced to a pared-down budget simply aimed at survival. </p> <p>'She has been extremely good,' says Conran. 'She works too hard, and won't take a holiday. You can't criticise her for not being devoted to the museum - it's become her whole life. But everything has to be done her way. I try to explain to her that you are the director, but you are not here for ever. We have to see that the museum has a future after you. I cannot be involved if it goes on like this. I admire her dedication; the visitor numbers are up, it is more popular, but there is too much tinsel. I am sure James could be persuaded to come back if these matters were resolved. But she can't bring herself to say sorry.'</p>",
  "<p>More men should wear pink. I am not referring to fuchsia or acid pinks - the equivalent of wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt - but your old-fashioned Wall's strawberry ice-cream colour. I agree that on some men it's a colour that just doesn't suit, but on the whole, men look good in softer hues. </p> <p>As with all fashions, there are a few rules: avoid ending up like a City boy trying to do casual; never go near the combination of ruffles and pink; keep it classic and simple. Pink needs to be either dressed slightly down with a white T-shirt underneath a crisp shirt, or mixed with a subtle colour palette that tones it down - a grey jumper or camel cord jacket. It works well with old worn jeans and trainers, or a favourite worn-in pair of brogues and under a heavy navy winter coat - as cool as an off-set actor, Jude Law style (now there's a man that can do pink).</p> <p>This season, pink has cropped up throughout the menswear shows with simple pieces like the crewneck jumper by Moschino, or from our own British designer, Paul Smith, who has shirts in every shade. For something a bit more off-beat, logo T-shirts are a safe option - mixing soft colours with a harder logo. </p> <p>The Duffer of St George (020 7836 3722) is thinking pink, with shirts, jumpers and T-shirts for formal and casualwear. At Harvey Nichols (020 7235 5000) alone, you can choose from Nigel Hall's candy-coloured shirts, Iceberg's T-shirt and jumpers in a whole spectrum of pinks, and John Smedley's classic knits in pale pink. And for the ultimate in luxury, at Yves Saint Laurent (020 7235 6706) you will find baby-pink cashmere. So why not get in touch with your feminine side, and wear the shirt to prove it?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jo.adams@observer.co.uk\">jo.adams@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "White girls are more likely to skip school than pupils from any other group, according to a new government study. <p>Experts say the higher level of absenteeism among girls indicates they might be missing lessons to look after younger siblings but that more research needs to be done to understand the race factor. </p> <p>Although girls took off more days than boys - an average of 18 a year - their exam results were still better than boys'. </p> <p>'This is the first time we have been able to link individual pupil attendance data with both their background and their performance and it is safe to say we were surprised by the results,' said Marian Morris, co-author of the National Foundation for Educational Research report. </p> <p>'The results are sufficiently unexpected to warrant more research,' she added. 'It raises the question of whether boys need more time in school in order to achieve the same results as their female peers or whether, perhaps, other factors, particularly attitudinal factors, are contributing to this difference in outcome.'</p> <p>The interim report for the Department for Education and Skills is the first to combine findings from the annual schools' census, the National Pupil Database and individual attendance data from 343 schools in deprived areas. </p> <p>It found that girls missed an average of 13.45 days each year with permission, compared to 25.6 half days for boys. Girls were also fractionally more likely to be absent without permission, missing 4.9 days each year to boys' 4.8. </p> <p>John Bangs, head of education and equal opportunities for the National Union of Teachers, said he feared parents were forcing their daughters to stay at home. </p> <p>'It may well be that girls are under pressure to take responsibility for younger brothers and sisters, or for parents who need support and care in the home,' he said. 'If this is what is happening, it is unacceptable that they should be pressured in this way. </p> <p>He also warned: 'If there is any suggestion that parents are offering excuses for their children to stay at home, that is conniving in the truancy and not helping overcome the problems.' </p> <p>Analysis of different ethnic groups revealed that white girls had the highest levels of authorised absence. 'Young people who were non-native speakers of English had a better record of attendance than those for whom English was a first language,' said Morris. </p> <p>'But among girls, whose attendance records were generally poorer than boys, those who were bi-lingual had better attendance records than all other girls and boys.'</p>"
