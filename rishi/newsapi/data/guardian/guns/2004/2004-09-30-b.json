  "<p>Arsenal players may give the impression of being telepathic but even they can suffer a breakdown in communication. So it was in the 1-1 draw at Rosenborg on Wednesday night when a precious lead in a Champions League away match was squandered and never regained. </p> <p>Thierry Henry assessed the problem as being a lack of awareness, a fault that can seldom be ascribed to Arsenal. \"In a way we consider that we didn't play well and that's why the result is a bit frustrating,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think sometimes we needed to try and have our head up a bit more around the box. It would have made a difference. I think you can say it was a matter of us maybe not finding the right pass to be able to score.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Henry was making an oblique reference to his fellow forward Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, whose selections were often awry. When he should have passed to team-mates in better positions, twice he shot ambitiously from acute angles. </p> <p>It is difficult, though, to criticise a youngster for impetuosity when he is in his first full Champions League campaign and has been in such scintillating form this season. </p> <p>The lead was lost instead in midfield. Arsenal need to be more clinical in their retention of the ball in vulnerable areas if they are to make genuine headway in the competition this season. </p> <p>It was Edu, another of the more inexperienced players, who allowed Rosenborg possession 30 yards out from goal. The more senior Brazilian Gilberto Silva, who is about to be sidelined for at least six weeks because of a back injury, would not have been capable of Edu's swerving drive from 25 yards which almost clinched it for Arsenal late on, but he is a steadier influence in the centre of midfield than his compatriot. </p> <p>None the less, Arsenal are top of their group, unbeaten and in a much stronger position than at this stage last season, from which they went on to the quarter-finals. </p> <p>Even at 27, Henry is a veteran campaigner in the Champions League, and the Frenchman's disappointment is mollified by the remembrance of things past. \"I think we lost control of the ball in the area that usually we don't and [Rosenborg] did score a great goal,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You have to give them credit because they didn't make it easy for us in the second half. I remember Donetsk, where we lost 3-0 and we thought perhaps it was going to be an easy game. It's never easy. So if you get a draw away from home you cannot be that unhappy. I am unhappy in the way that it could have been better.\" </p> <p>Arsenal are still searching for their identity in Europe. The telepathy displayed when rolling over Premiership opponents can be scrambled in the Champions League, where the threats are more numerous. </p> <p>They have enjoyed better results away from home,most memorably last season's 5-1 defeat of Internazionale at San Siro. </p> <p>After Christian Vieri had opened the scoring for the home side in that match, Arsenal were heading for a first-round exit from the competition. Cautious instincts were necessarily abandoned and the results were devastating. </p> <p>\"We are an attacking side,\" said Freddie Ljungberg, whose sixth-minute goal set up the contest for Arsenal on Wednesday. \"Unfortunately we stopped playing attacking football after we scored. We just kept the ball. </p> <p>\"Maybe we should have gone for another goal. Of course we can concede a goal doing that but at the same time we are giving it a go.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong> Arsenal are the 7-4 favourites to win the Champions League</strong> with Chelsea the next British club on 15-8. Manchester United are quoted by William Hill at 2-1 with Liverpool 11-1 and Celtic 80-1.</p>",
  "<p>I have never seen a player in this country as good as Wayne Rooney at such a young age. I saw Michael Owen come through with his phenomenal goalscoring and Paul Gascoigne emerge at Newcastle United when he was a bit older but Rooney stands out even in that company. I can't think of anyone who has scored such magnificent goals as an 18-year-old. </p> <p>I was reminded this week that Rooney's reputation already stretches well beyond Britain. While Manchester United were playing Fenerbahce on Tuesday, I was at Bayern Munich's game against Ajax and the people behind me were on their phones saying: \"Rooney's got a hat-trick.\" Roy Makaay scored three for Bayern but people were still talking about Rooney. </p> <p>He has caught the imagination because he's a goalscorer and a footballer. Makaay got a great hat-trick but he's just a goalscorer. Players like Gary Lineker, Ian Rush and Denis Law were goalscorers. But Rooney plays as what the Europeans call a No10 and still scores loads of goals. </p> <p>It's a special type of footballer who combines the two. Roberto Baggio was a bit like that and so was Diego Maradona, although I don't count him because he took drugs all his life. </p> <p>What's phenomenal about Rooney is not just his talent but mental strength. You cannot appreciate the pressure of making your debut for Manchester United as a lad of 18. I was nervous when I played my first game for United, and I was 27 and had played all round Europe and in a World Cup. </p> <p>I wouldn't have wanted to handle the expectation of making my debut there as a teenager who had been bought for \u00a327m. When I went to Old Trafford the expectation on me wasn't that great because signings like Alan Brazil and Jesper Olsen had cost a lot more than I had. But the expectation on Rooney was huge. </p> <p>I suppose the mental side is a bit easier to handle when you are young. You have no fear because you have never felt failure as such. But the performance Rooney gave on Tuesday was incredible bearing in mind his injury and the stuff he has been through with his off-field behaviour splashed over the papers. </p> <p>Mental strength will be so important for him because he has to realise he's going to be in the papers every day, and not all the coverage will be complimentary or accurate. There will be times when it's too much. </p> <p>In some ways Rooney made a rod for his own back with his hat-trick against Fenerbahce. He's given a 10-out-of-10 performance right away and almost everything will be down from that now. I hope people are sensible but that's too much to ask. </p> <p>He'll have to put up with the same nonsense that Owen has. If Michael has a dip in form people say he's finished. All sorts of rubbish that have nothing to do with football will be thrown at Rooney as well. </p> <p>I wasn't a celebrity player so I didn't have that but the mental problem came when I reached 30. When you're under 30 and you have a bad game, you've had a bad game. When you're over 30, it's because your legs have gone. But that's nothing compared with what Rooney will get. </p> <p>A big thing for him is he has got the instant respect of the players at Manchester United. That's more important than winning over the media, fans or even the manager. But as well as their respect as a player, he needs their respect as a man. </p> <p>I've never heard anyone say a bad word about Rooney, which suggests he will have the support of his team when things aren't so great. I've known players who have been unpopular and the manager has said: \"Put up with him for the sake of the team.\" Then when things go wobbly for that player his team-mates are smirking and saying he deserves it. </p> <p>Rooney is at a great club to get the protection he'll need. Sir Alex Ferguson has everything in place. I think Alex will say: \"You're at Manchester United now. The advertising and personal appearances are finished. There are no interviews with the men's mags that might get picked up.\" </p> <p>Someone like Ryan Giggs, with all his medals, is a walking reminder to Rooney that it's worth listening to the boss even if he's tough at times. You're taught how to be a man at Manchester United and you cannot be a great player until you are a great man. </p> <p>Rooney has made a couple of mistakes but I don't think those will happen again. George Best is another that comes to mind when I think of exciting young players but we've seen what happened to him. Besty was on his own really. There's more protection now for players and Rooney is at the right place to make the most of his talent. </p> <p><strong>Gordon Strachan's best British and Irish young players:</strong></p> <p><strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> Showed he was a special talent with a superb goal against Arsenal in October 2002 at the age of 16.

  "<p>Rising levels of student debt in the US are not creating excessive burdens for most borrowers, a symposium in Oxford heard yesterday. </p> <p>The level of public alarm about student debt was \"unwarranted for most students\", said Sandy Baum, senior policy analyst at the College Board, which runs the American Sat tests for university entrance.</p> <p>But she warned that graduates from poor families were having more difficulties in repaying their student loans. They reported lower earnings after college and could not expect help from their parents with expenses, such as the deposit on a house. They might also have to contribute to the family budget, she said.</p> <p>The generally upbeat message from Professor Baum, of Skidmore College, on the basis of American experience of decades of student loans and rising tuition fees was in stark contrast to the fears expressed by Louise Archer, of London Metropolitan University, who said the UK government's introduction of variable fees would be \"disastrous for social equity and justice\".</p> <p>The symposium of British, French and American academics was organised by the Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies and the University of California Berkeley to look at funding and access as the UK moves into the uncharted waters of variable tuition fees for undergraduates.</p> <p>Professor Baum pointed out that despite the massive headline figures - \"sticker prices\" - for ivy league universities in the US, most students go to cheaper public universities or benefit from discounts and bursaries. She said 28% of students paid less than $4,000 a year and 68% paid less than $8,000.</p> <p>College Board figures showed that grants to American students have been rising, but not as fast as tuition fees as the cost of higher education has been pushed on to students and their parents from the federal government and the states. Of the estimated total student aid of $105bn in 2002/03, 45% came from federal loans and slightly less than 20% from the universities themselves in the form of scholarships or fee discounts.</p> <p>Average repayments for graduates were running at 9% (with a median figure of 6%), although higher debts were run-up by law and medical graduates, who expected higher earnings.</p> <p>\"Student borrowing is a reasonable means of finance for a portion of the cost of higher education. The level of public alarm surrounding the accumulation of debt in the range of $20,000 to $25,000 for current students is unwarranted for most students. However, there are clear warning signs relating to the most vulnerable groups of students and to rapid increases in the amount of debt students accumulate.\" These include students from poor families and those who failed to complete their degree courses. </p> <p>The current low interest rates were significantly easing the burden of repayment, she added. In the UK graduates will pay no interest on student loans. </p> <p>Dr Archer said fees made higher education \"risky and a bad deal for many working class and ethnic minority learners\". She argued they would reinforce the hierarchy of universities in the UK and channel students from poor families into the \"crap, sad, grey concrete urban institutions\".</p> <p>She said: \"We don't have horses for courses as the rhetoric of choice insists - we have completely different races going on....A few bursaries aren't going to address complex injustices. \"</p> <p>In response, Bruce Johnstone, of the State University of New York at Buffalo, said the cost to any government of rolling back private contributions to higher education, taking on the backlog of university maintenance and restoring generous grants for all would be huge. \"The tax challenge for this is horrendous and most of it would make no difference to enrolments - I see this as absolutely impossible.\"</p>",
  "<p>Do you want to know the secrets of buying underwear for a woman, but are too proud to ask? Do you want to get a review of a film while outside the cinema? The answer, say the founders of Kwickee, is to start downloading such nuggets of information to your mobile from their \"mobile information exchange\". </p> <p>Founder Julian Fisher says the idea for the service came to him when he was frustrated in his attempt to publish short \"how tos\" and travel guides. \"Publishing agents wouldn't even look at them, so I thought: why not do it on mobiles? And why not invite others to do the same thing?\" </p> <p>He describes Kwickee as a kind of mobile eBay, where snippets of information and pictures have replaced real things, and where most of the content for sale is from ordinary people who just want to sell their creative work. It contains 10,000 \"how to\" guides, facts, reviews, soap operas, life experiences and adult fiction. Each piece is downloadable in three chunks of about 250 words to most Wap-enabled phones using GPRS. </p> <p>The downside is the pricing. Each piece costs between 50p and \u00a31.50, which is not cheap when compared with the price of a newspaper, or a story printed free from the internet. </p> <p>Fisher disagrees. \"When people are out with only their mobiles, they are prepared to pay for something interesting or something that helps them at that moment - such as a review of an MP3 player they are thinking of buying,\" he says. Buyers can also reduce the cost by about 30% if they pay in advance on the <a href=\"http://www.kwickee.com\">Kwickee</a> web site. </p> <p> But Phil Taylor, director of consumer data services at Strategy Analytics, is sceptical. \"All the main operators are already doing this, and are tending towards less information of higher quality rather than offering work from unknown authors,\" he says. \"I think Kwickee is overestimating things when they say it is simple to download one of thousands of pieces of information.\" </p> <p>I had no problem using the service on three mobile devices - the Nokia 6600, Motorola V700 and a BlackBerry 7730. Unfortunately, the Wap address did not work, and this is being fixed. Otherwise, it takes only about 30 seconds to download a Kwickee. The menu is very basic, and although it is simple, it was easy to waste time moving back and forth between menus. The search option did not work when I searched for a particular writer, but downloading pieces from the menu was successful. </p> <p>If it becomes widely used, however, life could be one big party for wannabe writers who can create appealing Kwickees on a sale-or-return basis. </p> <p>But on the downside, its marketing budget is tiny compared with the likes of Vodafone live! and O2 Active. Kwickee expects writers to develop their own audiences by word of mouth and viral marketing to ensure healthy sales. Also, the service does not work with some phones - notably the XDA II, Sony Ericsson P900 and Treo 270 - though Kwickee says these problems will be solved shortly. </p> <p>Kwickee essentially provides the network services through an SMS operator, Wireless Information Network, and provides some support and advice to encourage writers to sell their content on the service. As soon as content is sold (and the operator paid about half), Kwickee shares the profits with writers, roughly 60/40 in its favour. So just like eBay, it gains revenue by skimming its percentage from each transaction. </p> <p>It has already created something of a community among its core writers - the ones it calls \"commissioned writers\" - and pays them a slightly larger cut. More than 3,000 contributors have registered and are expected to start adding material. </p> <p>It has signed up seven partners - reputable content providers - and 25 commissioned writers with varying degrees of experience. To provide quality control, some writers also act as editors, checking content before it is uploaded. </p> <p>Fisher believes the service is the first opportunity for novice writers to publish and let the public decide if their stuff is worth reading. Anyone can become a content provider by signing up on the Kwickee website, and inputting stories using a basic template. </p> <p>Hampshire-based part-time model and former media student Heather Whitbread writes most of the fashion content and has just covered the London fashion shows. \"It is very easy to upload my articles on their website, and I think once it's up and running, it will have its own niche,\" she says. \"I think this is great for new writers.\" </p> <p>But Nick Booth, a London-based journalist, was less impressed: \"I tried registering to be a writer but found it too fiddly, and it really wasn't that clear how much money I could make because they have a complicated system of payment.\" </p> <p>With mobile operators ensuring that downloading such content remains rather pricey, it looks unlikely that Kwickee will recoup its investment any time soon. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Text 'Hi' to 83238 to receive Kwickee services. No charges are made unless you download content.</p>",
  "<p>How often do you go into your bank branch to service your current account? Probably about as often as you visit your phone company to pay your bill. The swift growth of telephone and internet commerce means that anyone with a computer and a connection can orchestrate their personal \u00denances quickly, easily and with a cup of tea close to hand. The same is increasingly true in the world of business. </p> <p>Computer-based banking services aren't new. British and US institutions experimented with PC banking - where you download what is essentially accounting software on to your computer as opposed to simply accessing details on a secure website - in the early 1990s. </p> <p>The \u00derst fully online banking operations were tentatively launched by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Nationwide in 1997. The emergence of internet-only operations such as Smile and Cahoot in 1999 kick-started \u00deerce competition in the personal banking sector, which in turn has spread to business banking. Now, all the major banks offer online business banking to some degree, and the range of services is widening thanks to advances in mobile phone and digital television technology.</p> <p>A recent survey revealed that 90% more small and medium-sized businesses use online banking now than \u00deve years ago. Five years from now, the number of SMEs that conduct their banking affairs via the internet will outstrip those who use bank branches. The study of 300 businesses by \u00denancial intermediary Xbridge showed that 45% of SMEs are currently using the net for banking, up from 5% in 1999. Branch usage by SMEs has dropped by a third and 65% of businesses said they expected to switch to online banking by 2009. the \u00degures can be taken with a pinch of salt - XBridge has an interest in getting more businesses online - but the underlying trend is upwards.</p> <p>The most obvious bene\u00det of online banking is the convenience and flexibility it affords. No queues, no time wasted getting to and from a branch and more time to concentrate on the day-to-day business at hand. But the move from face-to-face dealings to electronic transactions raises important issues for banks and their customers. Isn't maintaining physical contact with your bank a valuable part of the relationship? Will less branches mean less personal advice and more call centre or email-based contact? Will security be compromised as the majority of businesses shun their branches and \u00dere up their internet connections?</p> <p>Steve Richards, head of business products at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"For RBS, internet banking is part of the broader choice of telephone banking and branch services. We see these areas as complimentary and don't push the online aspect any more than the others. The strength of our business service is centred around relationship managers, but we realise business people are busy and need to look in detail at their \u00denancial operations whenever they want. They are increasingly choosing to do this online.\" </p> <p>Branches are here to stay, according to Richards: \"Very few businesses are truly, completely independent of a branch. Many handle cash and many want face-to-face advice. We will continue to invest in our branch network because that is a core service that customers want. Local contact for local businesses is still very important.\"</p> <p>RBS can boast the highest proportion of business customers banking online, at 56%. This \u00degure is expected to rise to 72% in the next \u00deve years. Half of the bank's business customers currently use their branch but just 22% plan to do so in the future. It's a similar story elsewhere. Almost three-quarters (73%) of Barclays customers said they would switch to online services by 2009, compared to the present \u00degure of 41%. Lloyds TSB customers are turning away from branches, with 44% fewer expecting to use their branch in \u00deve years.</p> <p>What should you expect from an online banking service? The core services include being able to check your balances and statements, setting up monthly transactions, making and receiving one-off payments and paying bills and salaries. Most banks offer free \u00denancial planning software that you can use to organise your \u00denances in tandem with the internet service. Other services include secure messaging and PC banking or WAP phone options.</p> <p>Check you are being offered the same rate of interest as on a branch-based account, check the charges for electronic items such as standing orders and \u00dend out the level of customer service on offer in terms of technological support and business advice. Use the business account \u00dender provided by the British Bankers' Association and \u00denancial data provider Moneyfacts (<a href=\"http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk\">www.moneyfacts.co.uk</a>) to \u00dend the best account for your needs. </p> <p>Once you opt for an account, check the market each year to see if you can get a better deal.</p> <p>Security is understandably the main concern for those thinking about moving their \u00denances online. Recent headlines about so-called phishing scams (where bogus emails purporting to be from your bank ask for your account password and details) have raised questions about how easy it is for criminals to in\u00deltrate bank accounts. Before you get too alarmed, you should bear in mind that banks never send emails asking for your account details. If you get one, delete it, block the sender and inform your bank. </p> <p>As for criminals being able to tap into your account, banks use the strongest encryption available to protect your data, so the chances of anyone being able to breach your account are very slim indeed. If you are in doubt, ask to see the bank's online security policy.</p> <p>Xbridge says banks will have to respond to the change in demand from SMEs and treat online banking as the primary means to service small businesses as well as drive new customer acquisition. The explosion of personal internet banking meant banks had to raise their game, such was the competition for new customers. Will the same happen in the business sector? </p> <p>\"We must be doing something right with what we are offering, but we would make improvements if there was a demand,\" says Richards. \"It's about letting businesses do the things they need to easily and quickly, not about adding degrees of complexity.\" </p> <p>SMEs have been slower in their online uptake than the Xbridge \u00degures suggest, but the medium itself is helping to drive traf\u00dec. \"Small business were the last ones to get on to the internet,\" said Richards. \"The government is trying hard to get businesses to transact on the internet, but it's been a slow growth. What we are seeing now is that start-ups are information-hungry and are using the internet as a research tool. This use of the net as a core part of their business will bring more people to online banking in the future.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>GC: Tell me about the company.</strong><br> <strong>PE:</strong> HiFiBitZ has been going for \u00deve years this November. It was born out of a typical retail premises which was owned by my business partner. The company itself is reputed to be the oldest hi-\u00de retailer in the country. It was about 75 years ago that the premises \u00derst began selling hi-\u00de equipment.</p> <p><strong>GC:How did modern IT start playing a part?</strong><br> <strong>PE:</strong> The argument I put was that the internet allows you to expand your customer base with very little cost consideration. The actual cost of setting up the website in the \u00derst place was around \u00a3175 - of course, there was a lot of investment of my time to be able to sit down and generate the thing, put product on and so on. But the actual cost consideration was a bit of a no-brainer for us.</p> <p><strong>GC: Did you write it from the ground up or use a packaged system?</strong><br> <strong>PE:</strong> We used Actinic, which was a fantastic piece of software. It only takes you so far, but it took us far enough. We were able to grab market share very quickly - our forte has always been specialism, we don't go head to head with the big guys like Empire Direct.</p> <p><strong>GC: So the site was working. How did it go?</strong><br> <strong>PE:</strong> The way Actinic works is that you're running it from a single PC. The same was true of all the customer service emails we got - they were actually all coming to a central point. The problem then is: what do you do with them? We were in a situation where the girl doing customer services was receiving 150 emails. We could employ people, that's not a problem, but how do you actually pass those e-mails around? We had three people on customer services forwarding e-mails to other people, which was an absolute nightmare. Then customers would get in touch and say they'd emailed the other day about such and such a thing, and where were we up to with it, and the honest answer was that we hadn't got a clue.</p> <p>I'd have to rummage through three people's machines to \u00dend out what the original response was.</p> <p><strong>GC: Right. So where did you go for help?</strong><br> <strong>PE:</strong> Originally, we didn't know we had a problem. And even afterwards, we never envisaged that there would be a direct solution to the problem. You tend to \u00dend in this industry that you feel a bit isolated, you do feel as though your situation is unique. My solution to it, because I've got an IT background, was to do with IT. But I started from the wrong direction - I started looking at things like Exchange Server and email sharing programmes, which I now think are the wrong way to address this. RightNow Technologies (<a href=\"http://www.rightnow.com\">www.rightnow.com</a>) came to us and put its 'contact centre system' idea forward. It's an odd one for a company the size of ours - RightNow services companies like Pioneer, which we deal with, and you'd think it would cost a bloody fortune. But when we started talking to the guy and he put some \u00degures on the table, it was an absolute no-brainer. We could actually apportion the cost against employing someone.</p> <p><strong>GC: So what does it do?</strong><br> <strong>PE:</strong> RightNow, for us, is customer service through and through. It's a way in which we can actually allow the customer to communicate with us and we can respond to them in a timely and orderly fashion. We can put a uniform approach back to the customer, so if a customer asks about overseas delivery, we send the same response back to every customer who asks that question. </p> <p>Second, the incident will be coming to us through a couple of different channels: it can either catch emails coming to our customer service address, or they can go on to our support centre online and type it in. We don't care whether it's come through email or wherever - if it's about order cancellation we attach it to the order cancellation group, if it's stock availability we attach it to the stock availability group. </p> <p>When we arrive in the morning the most important incidents for us are the order cancellations - we don't want to be sending stuff out that's been cancelled, it costs us money. So the \u00derst thing we look at is the order cancellations, then the stock availability. So processing those in a timely manner is a revenue earner. Compared to where we were before, those emails were coming in and they were just stacked with all the others.</p> <p><strong>GC: So how long did it actually take to put the new system in place?</strong><br> <strong>PE: </strong>It actually took so little time I can't actually put a timeframe on it. It's on an external server so it's more or less \"here's your link, off you go\". We had a site redesign last year which was delayed, so we just put a couple of HTML links and that was it. </p> <p><strong>GC: And what did it cost?</strong><br> <strong>PE: </strong>The way I look at it is that it costs \u00a34,000 per year. If you want to talk about return on investment...</p> <p><strong>GC: That was the next question.</strong><br> <strong>PE: </strong>Well, the alternative would be employing someone and all the costs surrounding that. Once you've wrapped your head round it, it's a no-brainer - an extra employee all the time, 365 days a year from whom the customer gets a uniform response. And it doesn't make spelling mistakes, which can make you look unprofessional.</p>",
  "<p>It used to be just the two of us. When my partner and I hired a car, I'd navigate and he'd drive; since he has the driving licence and I have the A-level in geography, it seemed a sensible division of labour. In recent times, however, a third party has joined us in the car. She has made my navigational skills almost totally redundant.</p> <p>Welcome to the world of GPS navigation. The last few years have already witnessed a minor revolution in planning car journeys. Rather than consulting the atlas in advance, working out a route, and either annotating the pages or writing out the details, you can now rely on a variety of websites to do the initial planning for you and present it in a concise, printable format. The AA (<a href=\"http://www.theaa.com\">www.theaa.com</a>) and the RAC (<a href=\"http://www.rac.co.uk\">www.rac.co.uk</a>) produce their own versions, while Michelin (www.viamichelin.com) covers Europe and Rand McNally (<a href=\"http://www.randmcnally.com\">www.randmcnally.com</a>) does the same for the US.</p> <p>All have big advantages over paper atlases. The return journey, often surprisingly hard to deduce from a set of outward directions, is calculated automatically. Trying to pick the right lane while peering at an atlas at an unfamiliar junction should be a thing of the past. Best of all, online travel planners are free.</p> <p>None the less, there are drawbacks. You're still taking your eyes off the road to read the instructions. The real problems start, though, if you take a wrong turn. Unless you pull over and consult the atlas, you have no geographical context at all. This is where GPS in-car navigation really comes into its own.</p> <p>Once it detects that you've deviated from the route, a GPS system will recalculate it and, within a few seconds, will begin to guide you back.</p> <p>None of this comes cheap. Whether you decide to install a complete in-car navigation system, choose the RAC's voice-only option, buy a bundle of software for your PDA and a data card and connect it to the cigarette lighter, or buy a new PDA with integrated GPS, navigation systems have - until recently - been a substantial investment.</p> <p>What has changed that is the arrival of Bluetooth-enabled smartphones with bigger screens and larger memories.</p> <p>While cars in the US are increasingly sold with a GPS system built in, European navigation systems are technologically more sophisticated than their US counterparts.</p> <p>\"The ones in Europe have terrific information on traffic cameras, for example,\" says Dan Benjamin, an analyst with ABI Research in the States. Mobile GPS software, he predicts, could erode the market for the most expensive in-car systems.</p> <p>Drivers tend to appreciate the big touchscreens and visual mapping, but the trend - particularly in the light of the recent UK legislation on hand-held mobile phones in cars - is for audio-only systems which understand spoken commands from the driver.</p> <p>So should you jump in and invest in a GPS system now, or wait for prices to fall further? Much depends on the kind of hardware you already possess. With a smartphone or a PDA, you shouldn't have to pay more than \u00a3250 for software and any additional memory. Without them, you'll pay more for a larger screen and louder instructions.</p> <p>Do you tend to become flustered if you have to take your eyes off the road? If so, then an audio-only system might suit you better.</p> <p>\"If you're only an occasional user you might want to hang on for a year or so,\" says Benjamin. \"But if you're a road warrior then go for it, because these systems are pretty good.\"</p>",
  "<p>When a skills crisis takes hold, it's the small business that suffers most. Unable to match the remuneration packages and prestige of larger enterprises, many \u00dend themselves having to think far outside the box when it comes to attracting and retaining the people they need to develop their business.</p> <p>Because the UK is now nearing full employment, more than two thirds of businesses are currently having problems \u00dending specialist and experienced staff, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Holding on to good people is proving an even greater challenge, with 77% of companies reporting dif\u00deculties retaining staff during 2003, up from 72% in 2002, according to its June 2004 UK and Ireland survey report, Recruitment, Retention and Turnover 2004.</p> <p>So, when the competition is \u00deerce, how can smaller, lesser known employers make sure they don't lose out?</p> <p>The usual response is to focus on flexible working and a less hierarchical of\u00dece culture, where the chance to be part of a friendly team, and play out a vital yet varied role in a growing business, offers a refreshing contrast to the often sti\u00a4ing environment of a more established company.</p> <p>But the bigger players have responded to this with more \u00a4exible employment terms of their own. So where can the smaller enterprise turn next?</p> <p>The good news is that there are several possibilities - if companies are prepared to look hard enough. Because the buoyancy of the SME market is so important to the economy, schemes are being introduced all the time to enable small businesses to keep up with the corporate community.</p> <p>Take the DTI-funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) programme (www.ktponline.org.uk). This enables small companies to employ the services of university post-graduates and academics at a subsidised rate of just \u00a316,000 a year. The programme works particularly well where young but growing businesses need extra resources for a special project.</p> <p>Paints and coatings company Ludlow's of Luton, which has eight staff and turns over just under \u00a31m a year, was so happy with its KTP placement, Declan Duggan, that when the two-year arrangement ended recently the company welcomed him on to the payroll. </p> <p>Duggan, who was studying for an MA in marketing from the University of Luton, was brought in to spearhead the UK marketing of a new environmental paint product. He contributed directly to a 114% growth in business over the last six months, and the addition of 24 new trading accounts. </p> <p>\"It would have been hard to get someone of his calibre on the budget we could afford if we'd gone to the open market - especially for a limited period of time,\" says Ludlow's managing director Peter Wills. \"Declan has excellent marketing and customer relations skills, and has grown this part of the business substantially. After two years' experience here, he has a lot to give back to the company so we've offered him a permanent role with a good salary.\"</p> <p>Another option is to recruit an older workforce. A new report from the National Audit Of\u00dece (NAO) notes that, against the background of an ageing population, a high overall employment rate and skills shortages in the labour market, around 2.7 million people between 50 and state pension age do not work. Between 700,000 and one million of these would like to, with some 200,000 actively seeking employment. Barriers they face, however, include low skill levels and low con\u00dedence, as well as age discrimination among employers.</p> <p>Brian McKechnie, programmes manager for lifelong learning at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, is among those trying to turn this situation around. As well as managing an academic programme for mature students, McKechnie's department also runs vocational training programmes for the over-50s, to equip them for a modern workplace.</p> <p>So what can an older workforce offer? \"Because older people tend to be less aggressive, and more 'interested' and helpful, they tend to work well in service-based organisations like call centres,\" says McKechnie. \"They're also ideally suited to care-oriented environments such as nurseries and residential care, and to the tourist and hospitality industries.\"</p> <p>But what of modern of\u00dece skills? \"It is a myth that you can't teach an older person new tricks,\" he says. \"They just learn differently. Once they've got it, the knowledge tends to go in at a deeper level, often with better results.\"</p> <p>McKechnie, who sits on lots of committees on over-50s employability, is currently exploring ways of promoting \u00a4exible working practices as a means of enticing this section of the population back to work. \"One of the challenges facing older workers is their caring responsibilities, whether that's looking after a spouse, or grandchildren,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We're trying to promote different patterns of working, such as weekend work, job-sharing, and teleworking. So far, this is proving very successful, particularly as a means of holding on to experienced staff that might otherwise give up work.</p> <p>The same applies to working parents, too, of course. \"The waste of talent in this country is criminal,\" says Dr Gill Hunt, who runs Skillfair (<a href=\"http://www.skillfair.co.uk\">www.skillfair.co.uk</a>), an online meeting place for freelance business, IT and engineering consultants. \"You only have to look around a primary school in a middle class area to \u00dend highly skilled graduates working for \u00a36 an hour as teaching assistants because it \u00dets in with childcare. </p> <p>\"Whether you're a parent who needs to \u00det work around school hours, or someone deemed 'too old' at 40 to work in the IT industry, the problem is the same. Many employers seem unable to deviate from the 9-5 model of work, or consider employing someone with more skills or experience than they need,\" she says. A smart small business can call on the services of the specialists it needs, without making a permanent employment commitment, with all the risk this entails, if it is willing to manage people by tasks and results instead of hours spent in an of\u00dece, she notes.</p> <p>Similarly, if small businesses want to boost their top-level expertise, but don't have the budget, they could do worse than appoint an interim manager. Executives Online (<a href=\"http://www.executivesonline.co.uk\">www.executivesonline.co.uk</a>) is just one organisation offering an \"executive sharing\" scheme, aimed at giving smaller businesses access to \"big management talent\".</p> <p>Executive Online's database boasts over 4,000 senior managers, who are charged out at between \u00a3450 and \u00a3900 a day. This might not seem cheap, but managing director Norrie Johnston notes that there are none of the hidden recruitment costs to consider such as bonuses, holiday pay or employers' NI contributions - \"The sort of costs that can turn a \u00a360,000-a-year role into something which actually costs a company over \u00a3100,000,\" he says.</p> <p>The market for interim services has grown by 137% over the last four years, according to Johnston.</p> <p><strong>Tips for attracting and holding on to your best staff</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Consider flexible working, including flexible hours and the chance to work from home at least some of the time. A recent survey by Inter-Tel found that, while 40% of SMEs said they couldn't recruit the right skills from their local market, 49% had no flexi-workers, despite 30% agreeing it would be easier to attract staff if they offered this option<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Compensate for lower basic salaries by offering good performance-based bonuses<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Judge staff performance based on results rather than hours spent at their desks<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Acknowledge the need for internal development to keep staff interested<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Always acknowledge and reward success in any way you can, even if it's just in words<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Never underestimate the need for staff feedback, internal communication and group activities for raising morale</p>",
  "<p>The dif\u00deculty with job interviews is that so much advice is published on how to survive them - if you're the interviewee. Imagine the interviewer naked. Imagine the interviewer on the toilet. </p> <p>These will reinforce your sense of superiority - but if you're applying for a job in a small business that's not been running for very long, and which lacks a dedicated HR team, how about the ultimate? </p> <p>Imagine the interviewer has had little or no training in interviewing, has an idea of the job available but not the foggiest notion of what to do in an interview situation. Because this is actually by far the most likely scenario. </p> <p>The interviewer's role can be among the least supported in the body of a business. \"It's kind of taken for granted that people know how to do it,\" says Jaine Bentley, regional manager of recruitment agency Adecco. \"But nine times out of 10 it's not part of their main role.\" </p> <p>There are, however, a few common mistakes people make which can be worth running through. Bentley points to the timeframe as a starting point. \"People tend to want to see as many people as they can for a job, and they spread this over a few weeks,\" she says. </p> <p>\"The problem is that on one day you're not in the same mood and frame of mind as you may be on another. And by the time you get to the end of that process there are candidates from the \u00derst day you've forgotten about, or they're no longer available.\" The issue is that owner-managers in particular don't have the time to set aside a day for the process so they assume it can \u00det around their other responsibilities - and the inevitable result is a longer and costlier process than would otherwise have happened.</p> <p>The other hazard that crops up if an interviewer has only half an eye on the recruitment ball is inconsistency. Bentley has seen examples in which one candidate gets asked one set of questions which looked right on the day, and another candidate gets asked an entirely different subset. \"So you haven't got anything objective to go on.\"</p> <p>Adecco's advice is pretty basic. Plan a day from your diary on which you'll see all candidates - this may mean doing a great deal of whittling before arriving at a sensible shortlist - and make sure you see them all when you're in the right frame of mind, then ask them a consistent set of key questions. Give them the same amount of time. \"Often what we'd say is a good idea is that if you think someone is suitable, introduce them to other members of the company,\" she adds. \"That opinion of someone as regards a personality match can be absolutely key.\"</p> <p>Another useful screening technique is based on the speed-dating concept. Speed interviewing works, says Bentley. \"If you want to see 10 people and they all look quali\u00deed, you can give them all 10 to 20 minutes, because you'll tend to wheedle out the people you de\u00denitely don't want to spend longer on. What you'll often \u00dend is that after 10 minutes [in an ordinary interview] somebody's decided that, actually, this person isn't suitable for this job, but they feel they have to give them another half an hour. Speed interviewing eradicates all of that and they just invite back the people they feel are more suitable for second interviews.\"</p> <p>The questions themselves can be something of a mine\u00deeld. Elsewhere in this issue there is coverage of some of the legal issues surrounding recruiting a job candidate, but these don't stop when you're interviewing. Clearly you won't be asking something that deliberately sets up a discriminatory environment, but there are other questions not to ask, con\u00derms Bentley: \"Certainly at \u00derst interview stage it's key to avoid questions about status and home life in terms of having dependents - if someone has dependents but has good childcare arrangements they'll be just as reliable as someone who has no dependents.\" </p> <p>Adecco, along with the other reputable recruitment agencies, offers legal advice on do's and dont's for questioning and indeed disability discrimination in anticipation of the forthcoming legislation in October. \"If I'm honest, it's rare that people make mistakes in that \u00derst interview stage rather than when they take someone on, but we'd obviously advise some questions to steer away from like 'are you married' and 'do you have children'.\"</p> <p>A lot of it, in other words, is common sense. Scheduling, preparation and the thought that you don't have to see everyone whose application suggests they might conceivably \u00det into your organisation will all help, as will some sort of consistent approach to every candidate.</p> <p>And if that fails and you're still nervous, you could always try imagining them on the loo.</p>",
  "<p>If you're reading this supplement there's a good chance you're a business manager or possibly a business owner. You'll probably be working in a small business environment with very few employees, which is \u00dene from the point of view of keeping your company under control but a complete nightmare when anyone is distracted from their core task. </p> <p>And this doesn't mean there has to be a crisis. You can be growing successfully and need to take on some more people, and you don't have the time to dedicate to recruiting someone. You can train a successful employee, keep them on board for a few years, then watch them move on - it happens, it's reasonable and it can be a positive thing - and you need to recruit someone to replace them. Recruitment is one of the great hidden costs of a business. </p> <p>You need to be aware of a number of things:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> attracting the right candidates</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> arrangements for interview</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the interview process</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> preparing for someone to begin work.</p> <p>All of these will take time and you will need to be aware of this and the costs this time attracts. There will be the direct cost of the advert if you advertise a job, then there will be the cost of your time and that of your colleagues spent interviewing and selecting. And then there's the opportunity cost of the work on which your business would otherwise be focused while the recruitment process is taking place. </p> <p>Afterwards, you'll probably require some sort of induction process - this can be as informal as getting a colleague to show the new employee just what happens in the company, but it's another item that will distract from the core task of running your business and attracting revenue.</p> <p>Most small businesses start their recruitment cycles by drafting an advertisement. Even at this early stage, mistakes can creep in - such as when businesses do a great job of selling the position, but don't reveal enough about the kind of person needed to \u00dell it.</p> <p>The inevitable result - particularly when the economy turns around and jobs are in short supply - is a \u00dfurry of inappropriate applications. And you or an employee have to sit down and take up company time running through the lot. There are no short cuts, except to sit down in advance and work through some sort of ideal personal speci\u00decation for the candidate you want. Incorporating at least some of this into the initial job ad will help candidates screen themselves in advance of applying.</p> <p>But beware, dif\u00deculties can arise for the uninformed. You won't want to build any prejudices or exclusions into your process, for example, unless they fall strictly within those that are legally permissible. Stephen Levinson, specialist employment lawyer with legal \u00derm Manches, points to what's known as the Chinese Waiter exception for authenticity, in which it's reasonable to insist on hiring a Chinese waiter to serve in a Chinese restaurant (although he points to other case law in which public sector organisations have found the courts won't uphold insistence on a black advisor or counsellor for black clients - if you have a lawyer it can be worth checking).</p> <p>In accordance with this, many job ads state that the recruiting organisation is an equal opportunities employer, or working towards being an equal opportunities employer. This has no hard-and-fast de\u00denition, but the aim is to show that you're not going to exercise racial or sexual discrimination during the recruitment process, which can mean taking care about the language you use. \"So these days waitress, salesgirl, postman and stewardess are no-nos - not that they don't get used but, if you ask a lawyer, they're no-nos,\" says Levinson. \"Unless you have a separate statement, something like 'applications are invited from men and women'.\"</p> <p>This is a moral and legal issue at the outset, but it becomes a practical one when someone takes action: the Cardiff Woman's Aid Society once advertised for a black or Asian woman for a particular position and faced a lawsuit from a white woman who felt she had been discriminated against, for example. Levinson con\u00derms that she didn't get very far, mostly because she hadn't actually applied for the job, but it still took time and money from the organisation to \u00deght the case.</p> <p>The disability and advertising rules are less straightforward but will be brought into line next year, he continues. \"They're essentially chaotic at the moment because they require someone to have applied and been turned down for a job before they can bring a claim.\" The cover-all statement that you welcome applications from all sections of society is likely to get you around all of these areas as long as you don't discriminate during the rest of the recruitment process.</p> <p>Always assuming the basics of the advertisement are sound, the next stage is to work out where it's going to be best placed. Or is it? There are people who will suggest that a useful stage before that is to look into whether an ad is the best way to get a suitable recruit at all. Going through the agency route is perceived as expensive, but some of its exponents suggest - unsurprisingly - that this is a short-term view. </p> <p>Kay Fletcher of Select Appointments, for example, suggests the headline costs are not the ones to look at. \"Some small companies try to do their own recruiting but they haven't got the proper resources to be able to do it,\" she says. \"They will think 'OK, I need to recruit a member of staff, probably the easiest and cheapest way would be to advertise in a newspaper', not realising what the response is going to be - if there are just one or two people handling all the responses, it can be quite overwhelming.\" </p> <p>People expect a response quickly and will follow up by phone if they haven't heard - that's telephone time as well. \"An agency can take away a lot of the time and hassle. We might be deemed to be more expensive up front, but it can be money well spent.\"</p> <p>A lack of experience can also skew the recruitment process against the right candidate, she suggests. \"The advertiser often has in their mind exactly what they're looking for, their applicant must have this and must have that,\" she says. \"And, actually, when the person who's leaving started they didn't have all of those skills - you have to look at what everybody's got to offer and what they bring to the company. Very often when someone's leaving people only remember what they're doing now but not where they started from. In an ideal world we'd like to get the perfect replacement, but it might have taken that person two or three years to become ef\u00decient in that role.\"</p> <p>The issue of interviewing is discussed elsewhere in this issue, but after that comes the time to make the appointment. It's worth exploding a few myths about this. Positive discrimination is often seen as a good way of ensuring that your organisation re\u00dfects the society it's supposed to serve - but it's also illegal, except when you're bringing in someone with a disability. </p> <p>There's also the question of whether you can ask about any criminal offences - under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act you can't, unless you're working in one of the areas that's excluded. The argument is that if you were in a particular industry you'll probably know, which is quite an assumption if you're a start-up business. The best advice is: when in doubt, consult a lawyer.</p> <p>Once the interview is complete and the employee in place, there is the issue of how long someone should keep the notes from an interview, including references. \"People have got the right to request a body to disclose information held about them under the Data Protection Act, but there's an exception for references,\" explains Levinson. \"But you can't ask your former employer to produce a reference they've given to somebody else - you have to ask your current employer who received it. </p> <p>\"However, the person who is giving you that disclosure has to ensure they don't reveal the identity of any third parties, so the person who gave the reference needs to consent to their name being revealed.\" At this point, some potential employers might want to have a little lie down. </p> <p>\"It's all a bit much for a small business without an HR department,\" says Levinson, who concedes he has a job keeping up with it all - and he's a specialist. The good news is that very little of this crops up in practice and, with a bit of planning, the recruitment process should go smoothly. </p> <p>A useful checklist might read:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> plan your personal speci\u00decation for your ideal candidate</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> decide whether to recruit yourself or to outsource the whole thing</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> select your advertising medium carefully - don't neglect the online world, where Reed has 60% of job seekers logging on, TotalJobs.com has 53% and Fish4jobs has 50% (source: Nielsen/NetRatings, period: quarter ended July 04)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> allocate enough time and resources to complete the recruitment properly and legally - and consult with a lawyer when necessary.</p>",
  "<p>In 128 pages, the Oxford professor of medical ethics whets the appetite for his subject and demonstrates why the allocation of scarce medical resources cannot be a matter for the bean counters alone. </p> <p>Establishing quickly that we're dealing with life and death with a discussion of euthanasia, Hope also appeals to Auden's Old Masters \"who knew that the ordinary is what is important to us most of the time\". </p> <p>So we can be as concerned with coppers saved or spent in choosing how to treat an elderly woman with dementia, as with \"the welfare of a child who may exist at a later time\" when we consider who might benefit from assisted reproduction. </p> <p>Remember the outcry when a 59-year-old British woman went to a private clinic in Italy to be helped to conceive and subsequently gave birth to twins? The brouhaha was based on the argument that it was against the interests of the child. But can you compare existence and non-existence?

  "<p>IBM is pinning high hopes on its latest hardware strategy for its blade server products. Now anyone can produce blades for the IBM BladeCenter under an initiative called OpenBlade. </p> <p>The blade server concept reduces servers to their basic motherboards, or blades, which slot into an air-cooled box, the BladeCenter. Inside the box is a backplane connection board that provides links between the servers and onwards to the network. By allowing all-comers to design boards to fit this connection under the OpenBlade initiative, IBM is opening up a host of possibilities for the BladeCenter. </p> <p>Tikiri Wanduragala , the company's evangelist for the xServer series, describes it as the biggest development for IBM since the PC was invented in the early 1980s. It is certainly an interesting gambit to gain dominance in a market that is still in its infancy. </p> <p>What makes Wanduragala so excited are the possibilities that lie ahead. \"IBM was late to market with its blades and that has made us look at the market in a different way. With Intel, we have designed a packaging standard that means that anyone can design for the IBM chassis. This means we may see different proces sors, operating systems and even dedicated boards appearing in the future.\" </p> <p>The key to success for OpenBlade will be attracting enough computer manufacturers to its architecture. This could give customers a broader choice of blades, and lower prices through competition among OpenBlade partners. </p> <p>In the wider field, competitors for the blade server market include Sun Microsystems with its Sun Fire Blade System, Hewlett-Packard's HP BladeSystem, and Dell's PowerEdge server. Sun, Dell and IBM have limited their blades to server applications, but HP is broadening the concept by incorporating desktop PC boards. This brings it into competition with ClearCube, a start-up company that specialises in PC blade centres. </p> <p>IBM may be freeing up the blade market, but it plans to keep a tight, proprietary grip on the BladeCenter that houses them. Wanduragala's allusion to the IBM PC covers an era when IBM invented the platform but lost control of the market when PC clones appeared, notably those from Compaq. The company seems determined not to make the same mistake with OpenBlade. </p> <p>The first partner and co-founder of the initiative is Intel. James Gover nor, principal analyst at RedMonk, sees this as a major plus for IBM. \"You've got to view Intel as a king-maker. If IBM didn't have Intel on board, it would have no chance of making this fly,\" he says. \"IBM plays a very interesting role because it is building servers based on a wide variety of chips. It has Intel Itanium and Xeon machines, AMD machines and Power machines. The notion of having all those in a rack is something that every IBM customer in the world is going to be interested in.\" </p> <p>Intel is known as a chip manufacturer but it also makes motherboards for inclusion in third-party computers. The company has shown no real interest beyond this motherboard market, which makes it an ideal OpenBlade partner. For IBM, the fact that it can sell its BladeCenter for use with Intel boards adds credibility to the product. </p> <p>Wanduragala's dream is that the computing environment and network switching can be collapsed into a single chassis. Already, networking companies such as Cisco and Nortel have produced network switches for the BladeCenter. This means that a single mains lead and set of cooling fans can power several servers and their associated network. Additionally, full redundancy can be provided for all components so that failure of a system can be handled by management software to keep the system fully operational while the faulty board is replaced. </p> <p>Even hard disk storage can be housed on a blade. IBM has them and is considering using laptop-style 2.5in disks to provide secure RAID storage boards in the near future. </p> <p>Looking further ahead, Wanduragala sees no reason why a branch office or small business could not have a complete system of desktop PCs, servers, appliances, storage and networking in a single box. Wireless connections could provide cable-free links to desktop clients, thereby reducing clutter on the desk and simplifying management, installation and expansion. This would reduce the total cost of ownership. </p> <p>However, that is a hard argument to hang sales on, and the main hurdle is reducing the purchase cost. The current BladeCentre needs to be populated with seven server blades to make it price-competitive with standard servers. And PC blade sales will need to achieve very high volumes before they are competitive with standard PC prices. </p> <p>The OpenBlade pioneers hope that the concept will achieve the volume sales that will enable IBM to reduce the price of the BladeCentre itself. In the meantime, Sun, HP and Dell will be watching the progress of OpenBlade and may adopt similar strategies if IBM seems to be winning. It could even encourage a move to a genuinely open standard for blades, rather than one owned by IBM.</p>",
  "<p><strong> You invented the MP3 player?</strong></p> <p> I came up with the idea of downloading music (and data and video) down telephone lines in 1979 when I was 23, and patented it. With James Campbell, who was 21, I developed a working prototype. We had orders worth \u00a360m from the recording industry for our solid-state digital recorder when we lost control of the patent. There was a coup attempt within the company and we couldn't raise enough money to pay the patent fees in time. So the patent was voided. </p> <p><strong> Do you have an MP3 player?</strong></p> <p> No. I like the iPod, but it feels a bit unfair to have to buy one. I could show you my drawings from 1979-82 and there is an iPod - same size, shape. It feels like mine. </p> <p><strong> What gadgets and technology do you use?</strong></p> <p> I'm a techno nut.

I find it hard to imagine a world without instant access to information. </p> <p><strong> Does the British Inventors Society rely on the internet?</strong> </p> <p>Very much so. We have a new website coming online just before this year's <a href=\"http://www.thebis.org\">British Invention Show</a>). Inventors join online free and we have 4,000 members and nine affiliated inventors' clubs around the country who can access the facilities, support and links via the site. Inventors have always worked in isolation with almost no support from government. BIS is bringing everyone together and it is starting to make a difference. </p> <p><strong> What is your latest invention?</strong> </p> <p>Monicall (from Monitor Call) is a system for making a telephone call into a legally binding document. You dial a private telephone exchange, your conversation is digitally recorded and a copy encrypted and emailed to you. Three copies are stored in email format with a law firm, an accountant and Monicall. It is much cheaper than a lawyer and more convenient. Calls will cost 50p per minute and release of a verified copy about \u00a320. I think this will eventually be bigger than the MP3 player. </p> <p><strong> Anything else up your sleeve?</strong></p> <p> In the past 10 days, I have come up with the antidote to everybody pinching copyrighted material off the internet.

  "<p><strong> New formula </strong><br> AMD is planning to compete with Intel's Centrino architecture with a 64-bit mobile processor for notebooks. The Mobile Athlon 64 is a 2GHz chip that can also run 32-bit applications, but is ready to take advantage of 64-bit applications when they appear. It lacks the tight integration with Wi-Fi of the Centrino, but allows manufacturers to add their own wireless cards. The chip also takes advantage of the Enhanced Virus Protection offered by the Windows XP SP2 upgrade to protect the chip's buffer memory. Acer will be the first PC supplier to use the chip in its Ferrari-badged 3400 notebook, available next month.  <a href=\"http://www.amd.com/gb-uk/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_10220_10221,00.html\">www.amd.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Gone phishing </strong><br> Next Generation Security Software is tackling phishing attacks in its latest white paper. Gunther Ollmann, the professional services director at NGS, says he is surprised at the naivety of businesses and their lack of preparation for combating these attacks. Phishing is a social engineering email scam aimed at tricking customers into revealing their electronic identities and log-on details. NGS claims that 90% of the web services it has assessed contain trivial flaws that could be abused in phishing attacks. One third of these errors could also be used to access confidential customer information from \"protected\" back-end databases. The white paper offers practical advice on protecting customers and systems.  <a href=\"http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/NISR-WP-Phishing.pdf\">www.nextgenss.com/papers/NISR-WP-Phishing.pdf</a></p> <p><strong> Mismanagement</strong><br> Companies are being talked into buying storage they may not need, according to research commissioned by Computer Solutions and Finance Group (CSF), an IT services company. Management of resources appears to be the problem, with 45% of the 100 IT directors questioned saying suppliers should do more to help optimise existing storage and 42% wanting assistance with auditing. CSF claims vendors are recommending expensive management suites when simpler techniques could be used. The company recommends a \"do more with less\" strategy such as transferring old data from expensive high-end storage devices into less-expensive mid-range systems to create more space for mission-critical data.  <a href=\"http://www.csf.co.uk/articles/stop_buying_storage\">www.csf.co.uk/articles/stop_buying_storage</a></p> <p><strong> Tax dodge </strong><br> Inland Revenue is using Softricity's SoftGrid to simplify the deployment of applications to its 70,000 employees.

  "The family of a mother and son shot dead by the woman's estranged husband yesterday claimed police failed to offer her adequate protection even after she expressed fears that he would kill her. <p>Relatives of Julie Pemberton alleged police officers had failed to take responsibility for her case though she had been abused by her husband, Alan, for years. </p> <p>Mrs Pemberton's brother, Frank Mullane, also criticised the police for taking more than six hours to get an armed response unit to the scene of the attack after her panicked call to an emergency operator when she said she had \"about one minute before I die\". </p> <p>An inquest at Reading heard that Alan Pemberton, 48, a financial adviser, became obsessed with exacting revenge over his wife after their bitter separation. </p> <p>On the night of the attack, on November 18 last year, Pemberton arrived at the \u00a31m family home in Hermitage, Berkshire, armed with a 12-bore shotgun, of the sort used for clay pigeon shooting. He shot his son, William, 17, in the chest and back five times, as Mrs Pemberton, 47, hid in a cupboard, from where she dialled 999. </p> <p>During Mrs Pemberton's harrowing 16-minute call, the operator told her that police officers were on the way. But Pemberton found her. Her last words were: \"He's coming now.\" The operator then heard the sound of a door opening and a man's voice saying: \"You fucking whore.\" </p> <p>She was found with four shotgun wounds to the chest and lower back. After killing his wife and son, Pemberton turned the gun on himself. </p> <p>The inquest was told that police found a note in Pemberton's BMW addressed to \"Dear All\" which read: \"My anger for what she has done and the callous way in which she has done it left me with no alternative but to take my revenge.\" </p> <p>The note added: \"I have paid a substantial amount of cash to have her [Mrs Pemberton] killed if I fail myself\". The police, however, have found no evidence that he had hired a hitman. Also found in his car was \u00a336,000 in cash and a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. The inquest was told that Mrs Pemberton had become so afraid of her husband that she had handed in guns belonging to him to the police as well as kitchen knives. She had taken out an injunction against him and agreed to have a panic button installed. </p> <p>But after the hearing Mr Mullane claimed that Thames Valley police appeared to have \"a somewhat limited understanding of domestic violence\". He claimed that his sister received \"next to nothing, if not nothing\" in terms of support from the police. Mr Mullane said the way police kept records of abuse was so disorganised that someone looking at the case could not take an overall view of it. </p> <p>It emerged during the hearing that there had been a delay between the emergency call being logged and the police getting to the house. </p> <p>Mrs Pemberton dialled 999 at 7.11pm and officers approached the property at 7.50pm after struggling to locate the house. </p> <p>It was past 1am when police finally entered the house, after waiting for an armed response vehicle to reach the scene, which came from Oxford. </p> <p>Detective Inspector Steven Reschwamm, the investigating officer, said Mrs Pemberton's details of her complaints against her husband were stored on the police computer and would have been flagged up after the 999 call. But he said the house had been difficult to find in the dark. </p> <p>Superintendent Jim Trotman, of Thames Valley police, added: \"We understand the concerns regarding the police response on the night of the shooting.\" </p> <p>He said that since the incident the force had doubled the number of armed response vehicles in an effort to improve its response to such incidents. </p> <p>Mr Trotman said he was \"confident\" officers had offered Mrs Pemberton \"advice and support which we felt was appropriate at the time\". </p> <p>Mr and Mrs Pemberton's daughter, Laura, 20, who was at Cambridge University at the time of the shootings, said: \"It has been a very difficult time for me since the tragic loss of my family. Now that the inquest is over I would like to try to get on with my life.\"</p>",
  "Two of the most senior customs officials have been suspended after it was revealed that they are under investigation by a Scotland Yard squad investigating allegations of perjury and perverting the course of justice. <p>Terry Byrne, customs commissioner and its director of law enforcement - in effect number three in the organisation - was ordered to leave his desk yesterday at the Thames-side headquarters of Britain's oldest law enforcement agency. </p> <p>David Pickup, head of the customs solicitors' and prosecutions department, was also told to leave immediately. </p> <p>Both men, close colleagues for a number of years, were suspended on full pay by the customs chairman, David Varney, because the \"seniority of their positions and broad scope of their responsibilities make it impossible for them to remain in their posts pending investigation\". </p> <p>He added that the investigation was at an early stage and charges would not necessarily follow. Allegations relating to the two men are in connection with non-disclosure. </p> <p>Mr Byrne and Mr Pickup were among 20 serving and retired officers identified by Scotland Yard earlier this month as having come under scrutiny in the sensitive police inquiry known as Operation Gestalt. </p> <p>Five have been moved from their current posts to other duties \"to ensure the integrity of the police investigation and current customs operations\", six have retired or left customs, and another six have been allowed to remain in their jobs because their current posts have no bearing on the evidential chain. </p> <p>One officer, believed to be in a key senior role, is understood to have turned whistleblower and to be considering giving evidence against colleagues in any future trial. </p> <p>The dramatic decision to suspend Mr Byrne and Mr Pickup came after discussions with the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, and a personal briefing for Tony Blair. </p> <p>The Scotland Yard inquiry, first revealed by the Guardian in November 2002, was ordered after the collapse that month of the trials of 15 men at Liverpool crown court over duty evasion frauds at London City Bond (LCB) amid allegations that investigating officers had: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> lied in court; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> misled judges during secret public interest immunity hearings; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> withheld crucial evidence from defence solicitors; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> failed to register warehouse owner Alf Allington as a participating informant. </p> <p>But a special investigation by the Guardian revealed that customs had properly registered Mr Allington in 1994 but had regularly lied in court over his true status - a fact that should have been revealed the first time he gave evidence. </p> <p>In February this year the Guardian revealed that customs had failed to hand Mr Allington's registration document to a high court judge appointed by the attorney general to investigate circumstances surrounding the collapse of the Liverpool trials and other LCB prosecutions. </p> <p>After a six-month inquiry, Mr Justice Butterfield concluded he could find no evidence of criminality by customs. But he was not given the registration document until after his report was printed. </p> <p>Customs has historically been the most powerful law enforcement agency in Britain and the one with the fewest independent checks on its conduct. But when it is merged with the Inland Revenue next year the new agency will be subject to a new inspectorate regime to ensure compliance with the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Perry Nove, a former commissioner of the City of London police, has been appointed to give independent expert advice to customs on its handling of investigations, including liaison with police forces on joint investigations. </p> <p>The new agency will come under HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and the extended remit of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will \"provide independent advice, supervision or management of complaints investigations and have the power to investigate directly where necessary\". </p> <p>The letter also revealed that customs' London office is, for the first time, under inspection by the Crown Prosecution Inspectorate and this is to become a regular process with published inspection reports. </p> <p>The government, which is to bring in new legislation to cover these arrangements, has appointed a former City of London police commissioner, Bill Taylor, currently chief HMI in Scotland, to advise on these new procedures and the development of professional standards in customs. </p> <p>Norman Lamb, Liberal Democrat MP for North Norfolk, said last night: \"The customs investigation is a can of worms that appears to go right to the top of the organisation. Ministerial statements have not so far disclosed the full picture. </p> <p>\"It is clearly important for the minister, John Healey [economic secretary to the Treasury], to make a statement to Parliament as soon as the recess is over.\" </p> <p>Matthew Frankland, a solicitor who has handled many customs cases, said: \"This is the biggest scandal in the history of customs and must raise serious doubts over hundreds of convictions and ongoing prosecutions.\" </p> <p>Neither Mr Byrne nor Mr Pickup was available for comment last night.</p>",
  "<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when Andrea Dworkin thought her life was over. Just over four years ago, she wrote an article for New Statesman magazine about being drug-raped in a hotel room in France. She had been drinking a kir royale in the bar, she wrote, when she started feeling sick and weak. She made it back to her hotel room, where she was brought dinner by a waiter - the same waiter who had served her her drink - and passed out. When she woke five hours later, she was bleeding internally, bruised and disoriented. </p> <p>\"I couldn't remember,\" she wrote, \"but I thought they had pulled me down toward the bottom of the bed so that my vagina was near the bed's edge and my legs were easy to manipulate. I thought that the deep, bleeding scratches, right leg, and the big bruise, left breast, were the span of a man on top of me. I had been wearing sweatpants that just fell right down.\" The hardest thing to cope with, she said, was the not remembering: she couldn't be certain what had happened. \"They took my body from me and used it,\" she wrote, and ended, \"I am ready to die.\" </p> <p>This experience, and the strongly divided reaction to her article, led to a self-imposed exile from Europe. She is in the UK this week, but has not been back for five years. Her account of her drug-rape was questioned by some feminists. Why, people asked, had she not called a doctor, or reported the rape to the police? How could she be sure of the details of the attack when, by her own admission, she had been unconscious for several hours? And, most strikingly, why did Dworkin, a radical feminist, run through a checklist of reasons she might have been raped - a list she might otherwise have dismissed as a catalogue of myths about rape victims. \"I blame me no matter what it takes. I go down the checklist: no short skirt; it was daylight; I didn't drink a lot even though it was alcohol and I rarely drink, but so what? ... I didn't drink with a man, I sat alone and read a book, I didn't go somewhere I shouldn't have been ... I wasn't hungry for a good, hard fuck that would leave me pummelled with pain inside.\" </p> <p>Dworkin's account of her rape, like much of her writing (including the feminist texts Pornography: Men Possessing Women and Intercourse), polarised opinion. People believed her, or they didn't; they were either with her, or they were against. \"It was unbearable being disbelieved by my so-called sisters,\" she says. Even her long-term partner, the writer and feminist activist John Stoltenberg, found it hard to believe her, looking, Dworkin wrote at the time, for \"any explanation other than rape\". The article was not published in the US. </p> <p>There were those who stuck by her. \"After it happened,\" she says, \"Gloria Steinem sent a psychiatrist who specialises in post-traumatic stress syndrome to see me. I was drowning and took the offered hand. I still talk to her every week. At first I wanted very much to die. Now I only want to die a few times a day, which is damned good. I still feel intense suffering and loneliness. I have fought very hard to be able to work again.\" </p> <p>She is in London this week to visit friends and to find a British publisher for her autobiography, Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Militant Feminist, published in the US two years ago. </p> <p>Given that the past four years have seen her professionally, and to some extent personally out in the cold, it is an unexpectedly uplifting and hopeful book, a reflective and often funny journey through a life that charts her love of music, literature, rebellion and women. There are a number of surprises. For instance, considering her attitude towards sex (\"I don't have intercourse. That is my choice\"), there is the stand she took against campus rules during her time at Bennington College, Vermont, when she was 18: \"From 2am to 6am the houses in which the girls lived were girls-only,\" she writes. \"One could have sex with another girl, and many of us did, myself included. But the male lovers had to disappear, be driven out like beasts into the cold mountain night. The elimination of parietal hours was a huge issue, in some ways as big as the war. It was law and order versus personal freedom, and I was on the side of personal freedom.\" </p> <p>This episode is one of the many contradictions in Dworkin's life. Another is her friendship with the poet and gay liberationist Allen Ginsberg. \"To me he was like a god,\" she says. \"I plucked up the courage to visit him after we met at an event. He told me over and over again as I was leaving, 'I love you, I love you.' It was very strange.\" </p> <p>Dworkin and Ginsberg ended up sharing a godson. In Heartbreak, she describes the confrontation that turned them into sworn enemies. On the day of their godson's barmitzvah, child pornography was criminalised by the supreme court. Dworkin was delighted, but knew that Ginsberg had problems with the legislation. </p> <p>\"Ginsberg told me he had never met an intelligent person who had the ideas I did,\" she writes. \"I told him he didn't get around enough. He said, 'The right wants to put me in jail.' I said, 'Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you.'\" When I repeat this story to her, she chuckles, and says in her slow, throaty way, \"Oh good , I love that. Don't worry, you can print it now, he is very dead.\" (Ginsberg died in 1997). </p> <p>The myths that surround Dworkin - that she is hard, aggressive, a man-hating misery - contradict the reality. In person, she is shy, softly spoken and courteous, with a cracking sense of humour. (The critic John Berger described her as \"the most misrepresented writer in the western world\".) I have met her several times, and am always struck by how caring and generous she is. Once, we were having tea at a London hotel when I saw a mouse under the table and screamed. Dworkin held my hand and muttered soothingly, all the while screaming for a waiter to \"come immediately\". My pathetic phobia became her emergency - impressive in a woman whose writing deals with life and death. </p> <p>She is principled to the point where she will lose friends and alienate colleagues rather than sacrifice an inch of ground. The feminist author Robin Morgan says, \"Andrea is a dear friend, a fine writer, a fierce intellect, and someone with enormous personal, political, and literary integrity, and the scars to show for it. She is much misunderstood, but then compromise isn't really a working word in her vocabulary.\" </p> <p>She has a dark sense of humour. During the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, when Dworkin was having bitter rows with Clinton's feminist supporters, she told me, \"What needs to be asked is, was the cigar lit?\" Does she now lose much sleep over Bush? \"He needs to go. Half of the American people want him out.\" </p> <p>Even so, she figures she is still more unpopular than the president in the US, mainly for her stance against pornography, interpreted by many as an assault on the first amendment (freedom of speech). To libertarians and pornographers, her name has become synonymous with censorship and rightwing, Christian ideals, but Dworkin denies links with either camp. \"The power of the state and of the moral right seduced many feminists,\" she says, \"but I would never compromise my principles. They use the language of obscenity and decency, not women's equality.\" </p> <p>Dworkin has written 13 books to date, first achieving notoriety with Pornography in 1979, and until the drug-rape was a regular on the feminist lecture circuit. Her life, as well as her work, has been shaped by sexual violence: she was assaulted in a cinema at the age of nine, and her former husband was physically abusive. She says she first learned about \"social sadism\" from listening to her aunt, a Holocaust survivor. </p> <p>She wrote Heartbreak in four months. Was this because it had been inside her all along, bursting to be written? \"My other books were written with blood, sweat and tears,\" she says. \"This one almost just appeared, like a gift.\" The book is the result of a deal she made with her US publisher: she wanted to write a different book, Scapegoat, about the links between Jewish identity, antisemitism and misogyny, but they were more interested in her autobiography, a book she had not planned to write. So she spent nine years on Scapegoat, then four months on the memoir. </p> <p>For all the controversy and doubt that surrounded the New Statesman article, she is excited about being back in the UK and says she feels her work is better understood here. \"I can't get published in the US without great difficulty. They took my last two books, but I am literally censored by newspapers and television networks. I have heard from several people that they are afraid to be seen with my books. This is the kind of cowardice that is creeping up on Americans lately.\" Even so, she has another book in the pipeline, and has written two chapters of Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation, a look at the contribution that writers such as Hemingway and Faulkner have made to American identity, a move away from previous, more overtly political works. </p> <p>So what does the future hold? There are moments in Heartbreak that show us Dworkin at her most raw and emotional. \"I have a heart easily hurt,\" she writes. \"Apartheid broke my heart. Apartheid in Saudi Arabia still breaks my heart - I don't understand why every story about rising oil prices does not come with an addendum about the domestic imprisonment of women in the Gulf states. I can't be bought or intimidated because I'm cut down the middle. I walk with women whispering in my ears.\" Elsewhere, there is a sentence that reads almost like an epitaph: \"I think I've pretty much done what I can do; I'm empty; there's not much left, not inside me.\" But Dworkin wrote this two years ago, and she isn't giving up yet. \"I thought I was finished,\" she says, \"but I feel a new vitality. I want to continue to help women.\"</p>",
  "<p>UEFA TO INVESTIGATE MOURINHO SPIT SPAT</p> <p>You can't say the people who work for Uefa's disciplinary committee are faceless.

Meanwhile Mourinho was busily brushing off the incident with far greater ease than the offending catarrh. \"I had my back to the crowd as I was watching my players warming up when it happened,\" he admitted. \"I just went over to greet the supporters, but this is a normal thing.

  "The mutual admiration that ultimately led to the creation of the Brigade of Gurkhas in the British army was forged in the heat of battles between the British and Nepalese in the early 19th century. <p>Around ten years after achieving supremacy in India at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, British forces first encountered the Nepalese on the northern borders of their new territory. </p> <p>The name Gurkha derives from Gorkha, a feudal hill village in what is now western Nepal. At that time, Gorkha was a city state led by King Prithwi Narayan Shah.</p> <p>There were many skirmishes, border disputes and repeated raids by the Nepalese into British territory. The Nepalese successfully extended their territory, taking control of the hill country from the Kashmir border in the west to Bhutan in the east. </p> <p>The British declared war on the Nepalese in 1814, and two long and bloody campaigns ensued. </p> <p>Conflict ended in 1815 and, a year later, a peace treaty was signed, the terms of which meant that large numbers of Gurkhas were allowed to volunteer for service in the East India Company's army. Many of those in the East India Company had been impressed by the bravery of the Nepalese.</p> <p>The Brigade of Gurkhas was created in the British Indian army, and almost 200 years of close alliance between the countries have followed.</p> <p>When India was granted independence in 1947, four regiments of Gurkha soldiers were transferred to the British army, with the rest becoming part of the new Indian army. A memorandum of agreement, with the aim of ensuring the soldiers were treated fairly, was signed by the British, Indian and Nepalese governments, becoming known as the tripartite agreement. </p> <p>Around 100,000 Gurkhas fought in the first world war, most notably at Ypres, around the Suez Canal, and at Gallipoli. They also saw action on several continents during the second world war, and fought in the Malayan Emergency. Japanese soldiers said Gurkhas were their most dreaded enemies. </p> <p>More recently, Gurkhas have taken part in deployments to the Gulf, the Falklands, the Balkans and East Timor. They have also worked on operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Iraq, and have amassed 26 Victoria Crosses. </p> <p>Each year, thousands of young Nepalese compete for a place in the British army. The potential Gurkhas undergo a strenuous selection procedure which includes carrying 70lb of rocks up a two-mile hill in 40 minutes. </p> <p>There are as many potential recruits as ever - last year, 28,000 Nepalese competed for 230 places available in the British Brigade of Gurkhas. However, in recent years, calls for the government to give Gurkhas a fairer deal have increased. </p> <p>Last year, former Gurkhas lost a high court appeal against the government. They had claimed their pay and conditions were worse than those of other British soldiers. It had been argued that the tripartite agreement linked the remuneration of Gurkhas to the Indian army's pay code, resulting in a crucial disparity in the payment of salaries and pensions. </p> <p>When Britain left Hong Kong in 1997, the base for the Gurkha brigade was moved to the UK, and the soldiers' pay increased. However, during leave periods in Nepal, Gurkhas are paid the equivalent of 5% of their salary. </p> <p>Gurkhas retire after a maximum of 17 years service with a pension of \u00a391 a month, while British privates serve 22 years for a pension of \u00a3623 a month. The government defends the discrepancy on the grounds that the cost of living is much lower in Nepal. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence says Gurkhas form an integral part of the British army - as of last July, there were 3,443 of them in service.</p> <p>Today, the prime minister, Tony Blair, announced that around 300 of the 400 Gurkhas currently living in the UK will be allowed to settle and apply for British citizenship after leaving service, with the announcement coming after a long campaign to win the Nepalese soldiers the right to live in the UK. </p> <p>Although the move was broadly welcomed by Gurkha representatives, they said they were disappointed that the new provision would apply only to those who were discharged from the forces after July 1 1997.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jane Kirby writes for the Press Association news agency</p>",
  "<p>How many cats does it take to save one Mexican village from a plague of rats?

  "Tony Blair avoided an embarrassing defeat today when over 80% of Labour conference delegates rejected a motion calling for the early withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. <p>A compromise statement agreed by the party's national executive committee (NEC) urging the continued \"support of the efforts of the emerging civil society in Iraq\" was passed in its place.</p> <p>Party managers, alarmed by the prospect of delegates condemning the prime minister's handling of the war, had made strenuous efforts to achieve consensus on the issue.</p> <p>Their victory was secured when they persuaded the big four unions, who control 40% of conference votes, to oppose the rebel motion, proposed by local party delegate, Pat Healey.</p> <p>It described the \"continuing occupation of Iraq... [as] unjustifiably destructive\" and called on Mr Blair \"to name an early date for the withdrawal of British forces\".</p> <p>The vote came after the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told delegates that the British forces in Iraq were not an army of occupation, but there at the request of the interim government with the endorsement of the UN security council.</p> <p>\"The situation in Iraq is serious. But let us be clear about this. The agenda the Iraqis have started to follow is one set by the people of Iraq and endorsed by the whole international community.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There is no occupation. The US, the UK and other countries' forces can only be in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government. It is their call. If they ask us to leave, we leave.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw was speaking after Labour NEC member Shahid Malik urged delegates to unite behind an NEC statement \"designed to maximise common ground\".</p> <p>\"I believe it was wrong to go to war but it is equally wrong to abandon the Iraqi people when they need us most,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Malik concluded by calling on the movers of a motion calling for the early pull-out of British troops to withdraw their motion in the interests of party unity.</p> <p>His efforts to secure consensus were rebutted however by Ms Healey, who refused to withdraw a motion calling for the end of the \"unjustifiably destructive\" occupation of Iraq.</p> <p>\"Some people say it could lead to a bloodbath but the bloodbath is already happening,\" she told Labour conference, \"British troops in Iraq are part of the problem not part of the solution.\"</p> <p>The NEC agreed its statement - which detailed how the UN security council legitimised the British presence in Iraq in June - last night after days of behind-the-scenes negotiations.</p> <p>Speaking in the debate, the GMB union's Yvonne Ritchie said: \"My union opposed the invasion, and we remain opposed. However, we cannot rewrite history ... the consequences of us leaving would be to plunge Iraq into civil war.\"</p> <p>However anti-war stalwart Alice Mahon, the MP for Halifax, urged delegates to back the rebel motion, telling them that the \"credibility gap with the electorate\" is fuelled by the government's misrepresentation of the British presence.</p> <p>Meanwhile former Iraqi exile, Shanaz Ibrahim Ahmad, backed Mr Blair's handling of the war and called on Labour conference to support the British troops guarding \"freedom\" in Iraq.</p> <p>\"I beseech you to understand what it means to be free,\" she urged in an emotional address. \"It is your soldiers, your sailors and your airmen who have laid down their lives, their humanity, to give us the freedom to give me my dream.\"</p> <p> <b>Hostage crisis</b></p> <p>Today's debate comes as 40 people were killed in Baghdad in a series of bomb blasts and after the release of another video of British hostage Kenneth Bigley, who is now in the third week of his captivity.</p> <p>Shackled, caged and dressed in an orange jump suit, Mr Bigley appealed to Tony Blair to do more to secure his release. \"I'm begging you to speak, to push,\" he said.</p> <p>Questioned about the government's efforts to free Mr Bigley this morning, Mr Straw, promised to listen to what his kidnappers had to say but maintained that he would not negotiate with them.</p> <p>Speaking on GMTV, Mr Straw said: \"We've made it clear, we have a policy which we adhere to, strictly and always, that we don't negotiate with hostage takers.\"</p> <p>\"But we want Mr Bigley released. Were the hostage-takers to get in touch with us, we would obviously listen to what they have to say.\"</p> <p>He added: \"That in no sense undermines our position and it may be that they are saying things that are consistent with our position which can secure Mr Bigley's release.\"</p>",
  "When addressing the United Nations general assembly earlier this week, Indonesia's foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, described the current political events in his country as a \"magnificent transformation\". <p>For once, such prose is no exaggeration. Only six years after casting off the shackles of deeply-entrenched authoritarianism, Indonesians have gone to the polls three times in six months and elected themselves both a parliament and, for the first time in their history, a president. </p> <p>The orderliness of the elections, particularly the presidential run-off on September 20 - which was the world's largest direct presidential election involving some 155 million registered voters - was exemplary. Yes, there were hiccups and minor rule violations but nothing of great significance. </p> <p>Indeed, the archipelago with the nascent democracy, the country bedevilled by political, social, ethnic and economic crises, put the so-called \"more mature\" democracies in neighbouring Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines (where manipulation, if not blatant fraud are commonplace) to shame. </p> <p>That's the good news. The better news, for fans of presidential challenger Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is that he won a massive 61% of the vote, arguably the largest share possible in a free and fair election. </p> <p>How the retired general, who took time out from campaigning two days before the election to defend his PhD thesis in rural economics, will use his mandate is the question now on everybody's lips. </p> <p>Western logic suggests Mr Yudhoyono can throw his reformist weight around to ensure promised reforms get enacted, particularly if challenged by recalcitrant legislators. </p> <p>But Indonesia's culture of consensus-building and his own ministerial track record suggests he is more likely to tread a gentler approach, especially as his own Democratic party controls only 11% of parliament, while the coalition of parties that backed President Megawati Sukarnoputri in the presidential election have more than 300 of the 550 seats. </p> <p>Complicating the analysis is the fact that Indonesian politicians are playing with a new rulebook that has yet to be completed. </p> <p>Not only has the president been chosen directly for the first time but the new members of parliament, some 60% of whom are \"freshmen\", were elected in a more democratic way, making them more accountable to their constituents. Whether this means they will behave more responsibly remains to be seen but it is a step in the right direction. </p> <p>Moreover, the country also has a brand new upper house, the Regional Representatives Assembly. While its powers on paper are limited, no one has any idea how it will flex its \"advisory\" muscles. </p> <p>So everything is to play for but everyone will undoubtedly be waiting to see what sort of leader Mr Yudhoyono proves to be. </p> <p>That is still hard to gauge, despite the fact that the election results have been clear for more than a week, because he has refused to comment on much while Ms Megawati refuses to concede, pending the official declaration of the result. That is due on October 5. </p> <p>Titbits of policy direction are emerging, however. Aides say everything will stem from Mr Yudhoyono's ultimate priority of job creation.</p> <p>Some 40 million Indonesians are either under or unemployed and about 40% of the 220 million population are living on less than $2 (\u00a31.11) a day. </p> <p>His problem is lack of money. To set the foundations of a post-economic crisis recovery, Indonesia has over the last few years had to prioritise macro-economic stability. The result has been more money going into pay debts and stabilising the banking sector than funding development programmes. At the same time desperately-needed foreign investors have been leaving Indonesia, driven away by crippling legal uncertainty, unpredictable corruption and punitive labour legislation. </p> <p>People close to the incoming president say more money will be found from streamlining the notoriously venal customs and taxation systems, changing labour law by executive decree (and so bypassing parliament), and gradually raising fuel prices for all but the poorest in society. </p> <p>In parallel to this, the attorney general will be ordered to prosecute some of the \"biggest fish\" as an opening salvo in the war against corruption. The judiciary is also likely to face a radical overhaul. </p> <p>Issues such as resolving the 28-year-old separatist conflict in Aceh and the war on Islamist terrorism will almost certainly take a back seat. </p> <p>Will Mr Yudhoyono succeed in achieving his goals, such as raising GDP from \u00a3538 per capita to \u00a3962 in five years? It's impossible to tell because he is relatively untested. </p> <p>But if he can manage people's sky-high aspirations and persuade them to take some painful medicine early on then he has a good chance, because he has few political debts, much goodwill behind him and that massive mandate to fall back on.</p>",
  "In my lifetime, only one Democrat who was not from the American south has won the presidency. And the Democrat who did so, John F Kennedy, accomplished this feat when I was two months old. <p>Since then, many have concluded that it's impossible for a Democrat to win the south unless - like Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter - he has southern roots. (Al Gore, who hails from Carthage, Tennessee but who spent much of his childhood in a posh Washington hotel, apparently wasn't southern enough.)</p> <p>But why would that be? It can't be because southerners won't vote for people from outside the south. After all, they happily voted in droves for Ronald Reagan, a Californian transplanted from the midwest. Nor is it likely to be because of \"traditional values\", since southerners also voted for Bill Clinton, a Democrat whose commitment to monogamy was famously shaky.</p> <p>And, at any rate, the south's commitment to traditional values is, like Bill Clinton's, less strong than many might believe. Dayton, Tennessee - home of the Scopes \"monkey trial\", depicted entertainingly in Inherit the Wind, and more accurately in Ed Larson's book, A Summer for the Gods, - recently sponsored a <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/05/08/national1634EDT0574.DTL\">\"Gay Day\"</a> after overturning local anti-gay legislation. And, although driving around the rural parts of east Tennessee (which I do a lot, in the process of taking photographs like <a href=\"http://instapun.exposuremanager.com\">these</a>) will expose you to a lot of church signs, most of them are rather sweet, really, and hellfire-and-brimstone is much rarer than most foreigners, or even Americans from the east and west coasts, might believe.</p> <p>So what is it about the south? I think it's defence. Some time between the election of John F Kennedy, and the ignominious defeat of 1972 Democratic nominee George McGovern, the Democrats lost credibility on national defence. From Kennedy's stirring <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres56.html\">\"bear any burden, pay any price\"</a> language, to the \"peace at any price\" slogans of the anti-war left in 1972, the Democrats lost their traditional stature as the internationalist and interventionist war party. Instead, they became identified with the welfare-state liberalism of the north-east and west coast, and with the anti-military sentiments of the anti-Vietnam war movement. </p> <p>Southern candidates offer a presumption of manliness that offsets these problems, at least somewhat. (Having worked for Al Gore in 1988, and a bit for Clinton in 1992, I remember a phone call in which I told Clinton strategist Bruce Reed that they needed to push Clinton's masculinity in that campaign. Show him lifting weights, or something. Don't worry, responded Reed, a shortage of testosterone isn't his problem. Truer than I realised, at the time.)</p> <p>To understand the American south's role on defence, it's helpful to look at what political scientist Walter Russell Mead calls the \"Jacksonian tradition\" in foreign affairs. Because when Zell Miller - a Democrat from Georgia who is deeply unhappy with his party on matters of national defence - delivered the <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/rnc/nyc-zellspeech,0,2788444.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-headlines\">keynote address</a> at the Republican national convention, he spoke in the purest tones of Jacksonian America.</p> <p>Jacksonians (as Mead explains in <a href=\"http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people3/Mead/mead-con3.html\">this interview</a>) aren't very interested in foreign affairs, but respond vigorously to threats:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[The idea is]: Don't bother with people abroad, unless they bother you. But if they attack you, then do everything you can ... When somebody attacks the hive, you come swarming out of the hive and you sting them to death. And Jacksonians, when it comes to war, don't believe in limited wars. They don't believe, particularly, in the laws of war. War is about fighting, killing, and winning with as few casualties as possible on your side. But you don't worry about casualties on the other side. That's their problem. They shouldn't have started the war if they didn't want casualties.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>How much this idea has to do with Andrew Jackson, really, is open for debate. (He was rather abominable to my Cherokee ancestors, even though they had long since turned non-threatening.) But as a strain of American thought it's quite strong. And it's particularly strong in the American south, perhaps because the south is the only part of America that knows what it's like to lose a war and be occupied. (There's a much longer explication of Mead's theories in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375412301/qid=1062393937/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-2870732-8742509?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846\">Special Providence</a>, which might profitably be compared with historian David Hackett Fischer's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195069056/qid=1094133446/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-1545606-9973455?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846\">Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America</a>, which links Jacksonian ideas about war with the experience of the \"Scots Irish\" - really English/Scottish borderers - who settled the American south, and who brought experience of being on the losing side in rather brutal warfare with them when they came.) </p> <p>Whatever the reason, it seems that not just southerners, but many other Americans, believe that a president from the south is likely to be tougher in wartime than one from the north, enough so to offset Democrats' generally weaker credentials in this area.</p> <p>Do southerners deserve this additional credibility? Perhaps not. One of the strongest Jacksonian statements in American history came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who, like John Kerry, was a wealthy north-eastern aristocrat. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt <a href=\"http://www.pearlharbor.org/speech-fdr-infamy-1941.asp\">declared:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"As commander-in-chief of the army and navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defence. But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.</p> <p>No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.</p> <p>I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the People when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's hard to imagine similar words from the lips of Jimmy Carter, notwithstanding his southern roots. The challenge for John Kerry will be to convince American voters that he has more in common with Franklin than with Jimmy.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, runs the <a href=\"http://instapundit.com/\">instapundit.com</a> US political blog</p> <p>Respond to this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/09/songs_about_the_southland.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Airport managers loaded passengers' luggage at Gatwick today as hundreds of workers went on strike. </p> <p>The Transport and General Workers' Union said there was \"solid support\" for the 24-hour walkout in a dispute over workloads and the suspension of a union official. </p> <p>Pickets stood outside three entrances to the airport from 3am and the union said it would be another expensive day as managers and other staff were drafted in to provide cover. </p> <p>The workers staged a one-day walkout at the weekend and are planning two further stoppages next week if the dispute is not resolved. </p> <p>Workers have complained that new rosters introduced earlier this year have increased pressure on baggage handlers, who say they are not taking proper rest breaks. </p> <p>The dispute worsened when a local shop steward was suspended.

  "<p>Radical proposals for the future of public service broadcasting were outlined today, including a completely new public service TV channel to keep the BBC in check, which could be run by Channel 4, ITV or any other group including a newspaper frim.</p> <p>The channel is the \"big idea\" in media regulator Ofcom's long-awaited report on the future of public service broadcasting in the UK. </p> <p>In a surprise move, Ofcom says the competition from a new Channel 4-type operation is needed to help incentivise the BBC to continue operating as a public service broadcaster when analogue TV is phased out in 2012. </p> <p>The BBC will be barred from running the service, but any other organisation including rivals such as ITV, Channel 4, BSkyB and Five could bid to run the channel.</p> <p>Stephen Carter, the chief executive of Ofcom, said: \"It is not intended to be a conventional TV channel. It will be a content producer, a commissioning house, and a generator of public service provisions.\"</p> <p>Ed Richards, a senior partner at the regulator, added: \"We want to create a vibrant, dynamic system, rather than a situation where it [public service broadcasting] is provided by just one organisation.\"</p> <p>The new channel will have a budget of \u00a3300m - nearly twice that of Five and two-thirds of Channel 4's - and could launch as soon as 2012. The money will come from either increased licence fee, a World Service-style government grant, or a tax of the turnover of UK broadcasters.</p> <p>Dubbed a \"public service publisher\" by Ofcom, the new channel would signal a seismic shift for broadcasting in the UK and heralds a return to the bold visions of the 1980s when Channel 4 was set up to serve audiences not catered for by the BBC or ITV.</p> <p>By proposing a new station, Ofcom today tacitly recognises that Channel 4 is finding it increasingly difficult to achieve its remit in the face of competition from other broadcasters.</p> <p>It firmly rejects privatisation of Channel 4 but says in future it may need to be bailed out by the BBC, which could transfer some of the income it makes from commercial operations - such as magazine publishing - to help it remain a public service broadcaster.</p> <p>The report also recommends that the BBC's licence fee should be retained until 2016 but there should be a mid-term review in 2011. </p> <p>It also rejects the idea of an \"Arts Council of the airwaves\" - a fund that any channel could dip into for public service broadcasting programmes such as religion or arts programming. </p> <p>But it is the concept of a new Channel-4 style channel that will be most controversial.</p> <p><strong>Viewers will be the losers if new channel not launched</strong> </p> <p>The station will broadcast a \"deliberately limited quantity of high quality content\", says Ofcom, with a programme budget of around \u00a3200,000 an hour. </p> <p>\"Many of the previous big innovations in broadcasting have resulted from new entrants shaking up the market,\" says the regulator. \"Just as Channel 4, in its early years, had guaranteed public funding and a remit to pursue public purposes with innovative ideas, we believe a new PSP could be created with similar ambitions for the digital age.\"</p> <p>The channel must be based outside London and will be required to be at the forefront of new technology, broadcasting on broadband, mobile networks and personal video recorders. Like the BBC, it will operate on a 10-year charter with a five-year review. Unlike the BBC, it will be barred from publishing books, magazines or newspapers.</p> <p>Ofcom says the new channel is required because ITV, Channel 4 and Five would struggle to meet their public service obligations in the digital age. </p> <p>\"If no action is taken, the BBC will emerge by default as the only PSB provider of any significant scale. Such an outcome would undermine the TV broadcasting environment, which has relied on a plurality of PSB organisations and has served the UK well. Viewers would be the losers.\"</p> <p><strong>Licence fee for next 12 years </strong><br></p> <p>Ofcom has rejected proposals to \"top slice\" the licence fee or to create an \"Arts Council of the airwaves\" - a pool of funds that commercial broadcasters such as ITV could use to provide public service programming such as religion and arts shows. </p> <p>The review says an Arts Council-style body would involve \"excessive bureaucracy\" and would \"struggle to distribute public service broadcasting content on TV channels which had different core values\".This will come as a blow to ITV, which had been looking to reduce the amount of money it spent on religion and the arts.</p> <p>Ofcom says the BBC's licence fee should be retained until 2016 but there should be review of the exact cost of the licence in 2011.

  "In the rolling plains of Minnesota, Lois Quam enthusiastically displays to her visitors a large wall-mounted portrait of Nye Bevan. That socialist firebrand who founded the British national health service in 1948 might seem about as unlikely a guru for the corporate soul of the US midwest as, say, Fidel Castro. <p>But this is the soft sell with which this giant corporation is hoping to Americanise the NHS. </p> <p>Ms Quam is the friendly face of UnitedHealth Group, which makes $1.8bn (about \u00a3990m) a year profit. She is of Norwegian extraction, and did research at Oxford: \"I loved living in Britain,\" she said. \"I had a GP, and a Labour council with progressive values.\" </p> <p>Ms Quam said her state of Minnesota stands for social progressivism and medical innovation, partly because of its history of Scandinavian settlement. She and her husband are both Democrat activists. </p> <p>\"I have always loved the NHS,\" she said. \"I believe in universal coverage.\" </p> <p>But her company makes its money in the very different US system - from health insurance premiums paid by big employers for their workers; and by collecting Medicare cash from the US government, which subsidises healthcare for the over-65s. </p> <p>US healthcare is widely criticised for being expensive and unfair to the poor. But in the course of that business, United has developed some sophisticated schemes to save money, both by keeping doctors in check, and by keeping its most costly customers out of hospital. </p> <p>Now it wants to market its ideas to Britain, with an equally sophisticated lobbying operation. It first boasted in May that it had poached not only the editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr Richard Smith, an old friend of Ms Quam's, but also Simon Stevens, Tony Blair's (and before him Alan Milburn's) own adviser. </p> <p>Mr Stevens, 37, is an Americanophile who has helped to write much of the current NHS plan for modernisation, computerisation and \"choice\", which his new employers hope to exploit. He has an American wife and began his career as a hospital manager with a spell in New York on a Harkness fellowship. </p> <p>It was in a US health conference in New York last October, alongside the health secretary, John Reid, that Mr Stevens told his audience: \"The era of English exceptionalism in healthcare is over\". He pointed out the similarity between UK trusts now set up to \"buy\" health from doctors and hospitals, and US \"managed care\" organisations such as UnitedHealth. \"Indeed,\" he said, \"pilot programmes are now testing the partnering of US managed care plans with primary care trusts.\" </p> <p>He promoted \"choice\": \"Freestanding surgical centres run by international private operators ... are a first step. Private diagnostics and primary out-of-hours services are next\". And he took some swipes at doctors, saying there was an \"increased challenge to the medical profession's power\" in an NHS which needs \"constructive discomfort\". </p> <p>Thanks to Whitehall unease, Mr Stevens is not now this month installing himself as the new president of United's British subsidiary, Ovations (UK) Ltd in London. </p> <p><b> Lobbying power</b><br> </p> <p>But Ms Quam, who heads United's Ovations subsidiary, still has plenty of lobbying power. Shortly before Mr Stevens' New York speech, she was in health minister John Hutton's London office for an \"informal\" discussion (without minutes) on ways to track the performance of GPs and \"managing patient choice\". </p> <p>She brought along a representative of another US firm to make a pitch - Vitas, based in Florida, which specialises in hospices and \"end-of-life care\", another expensive aspect of the NHS. They also met Barbara Hakin, a Milburn adviser. </p> <p>As Mr Stevens' hiring was clinched, another of United's political stable was brought on - Bill Clinton's former health secretary, Donna Shalala. She already knew some British ministers, thus demonstrating the seamless way politicians and political advisers can metamorphose into commercial lobbyists. </p> <p>United \"have asked me to serve as a liaison\" she wrote to Mr Reid. \"I will of course also be happy to discuss any elements from my experience ... under President Clinton which may be of assistance to you in your duties\". </p> <p>Ms Shalala failed to get in to see Mr Reid, but she did see Mr Hutton, on July 1 this year. The agenda - again no minutes were taken - was: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Knowing his keen interest in US political developments, she will be happy to provide an update on events in Florida and elsewhere </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Congratulate him on the progress of the NHS and hear his thoughts on opportunities and challenges ahead </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Share thoughts on healthcare modernisation in the US and the UK. </p> <p>\"Dear John,\" said her thank you letter afterwards: \"Best wishes on your upcoming wedding. You and your bride have a standing invitation to visit.\" </p> <p>Ms Quam herself meanwhile talked to a junior health minister, Stephen Ladyman, at a behind-the-scenes ministerial seminar with \"private providers\" on adult social care. Mr Ladyman is planning a green paper on the subject this year \"to shift the balance from welfare to wellbeing - promoting independence and choice\", according to documents released to the Guardian under the open government code. </p> <p>United has already acquired two contracts from the NHS, to tackle the \"bed-blockers\" who cost NHS hospitals the most. </p> <p>The first scheme is called Evercare, for which Mr Milburn, then health secretary, handed out pilot contracts in autumn 2002. The principle is simple. Using a computer and specialist nurses, it identifies a small group of sick elderly people who it believes soak up immense resources. The specialist nurses visit them, liaise with family and doctors and, by spotting infections or early problems, save a fortune. The firm claims that Evercare in the US has \"reduced hospitalisations by 50%\". </p> <p>United gets a flat fee from the US government for each Medicare patient whose healthcare it insures. So the fewer times each patient goes into hospital, the more money the company makes. </p> <p>Evercare has been undergoing trials at nine British local health authorities (now called primary care trusts). United's own assessments claim that it discovered a hitherto unknown \"high-risk population\" which, although only 3% of the over-65s, was responsible for 35% of unplanned hospital admissions in that age-group. </p> <p>The plan for what United terms the \"new NHS\" provides for Evercare-type projects across the country, although it has not yet been independently assessed whether they work. </p> <p>This month, United was handed another contract, worth \u00a36m, from the Department of Health, to perform similar pilot exercises on cancer patients, identifying them, and trying to keep them out of hospital. </p> <p>It is only a starting point. United has presented the British government with its own \"white paper\", outlining a whole shopping-list of projects. It says the contents cannot be disclosed because they are \"commercially sensitive\". The Department of Health also refuses to disclose them. </p> <p><b> Chronically ill</b><br> </p> <p> United is not the only US corporation in the market. The Department of Health is also funding trials of \"managed care\" for the chronically ill with the US firm Kaiser Permanente. </p> <p>Taken to its logical conclusion, US firms such as United could end up eating into the role of health authorities themselves, getting funds from the taxpayer and then deciding which treatments, which doctors, which NHS hospitals and which commercial providers offer them the \"best value for money\". Jennifer Dixon, director of the King's Fund, a health thinktank, said: \"They could bid to hold a budget to commission for an entire population - although that at the moment is a step too far for government policy\". </p> <p>The problem, however, is that in the US, it is only by playing to United's commercial interests that schemes like Evercare can be made to work. And companies like United are not altruists. Bill Maguire, head of the group, collected a $94m package last year, including stock options. </p> <p>The firm is one of several embroiled in class actions in the US, brought by private-enterprise doctors who complain they can not get paid for expensive treatments they prescribe, and by patients denied approval for such treatments. US employers protest at the way insurance premiums are jacked up by the healthcare industry - an estimated 22% last year. And the US government complains that companies such as United are profiteering from Medicare, because they attract too many healthy customers, leaving the sick ones to Medicare. </p> <p>The firm deals with this by spirited lobbying. It makes donations to Republican causes and Mr Maguire has been commended by George Bush for putting his hand in his pocket to get him re-elected. </p> <p>This summer, the company and a former subsidiary paid $20.6m to settle without liability an action brought against one of their subsidiaries for allegedly submitting false expense figures for Medicare recipients in order to get bigger reimbursements and incentive payments than it was entitled to. </p> <p>All this makes some people cynical about the claims that such \"health maintenance organisations\" (HMOs) are a miracle road to efficiency. </p> <p>In Minneapolis, Kip Sullivan, of the Minnesota Physician Patient Alliance, has a thick file on United. \"It's a great big canard that managed care saved anybody money,\" he said. \"HMOS are hated. They are despised. They are the butt of cartoons and late-night comedy shows.\" </p> <p>He tots up the extra overheads. First, marketing costs. \"Every fall, employers let employees decide on their choice of health plans. The nation is blitzed with ads\". </p> <p>Second are heavy underwriting assessment costs for employee insurance - huge questionnaires about whether would-be beneficiaries have Aids or cancer, for example. Then there are the inevitable costs of \"managed care\" - profiling doctors, analysing hospital track records. Lobbying costs are another extra. Finally, there are huge executive salaries and the profit that has to be generated for shareholders. </p> <p>\"So before they even start, they have to climb a hill to make a buck out of Medicare,\" Mr Sullivan said. </p> <p>But these are the kinds of cash-driven institutions which ministers now have on the agenda as models for the \"new\" NHS. </p> <p>Some GPs say they could easily do the work themselves, given enough cash. Phil McCarthy is a GP in Bristol, where three Evercare schemes are being piloted. He objects to \"the privatisation drive in the NHS\", saying US firms will get an unstoppable foot in the door with local NHS trusts. \"They are like minnows in a pool with an enormous shark,\" he said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Read the documents on UnitedHealth at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/foi\">www.theguardian.com/politics/foi</a></p>",
  "<p>Depends what you want to do. If you're planning to take a ride on Sir Richard Branson's proposed Virgin Galactic service, the plans are that you'll need a week, as opposed to the years it takes to train as an astronaut. </p> <p>What that training will involve is unclear at present but David Ashford, director of Bristol Spaceplanes, reckons that a week is overkill. </p> <p>\"You could do it in a day,\" he says. \"All you're doing is sitting in a seat and you're strapped in - you've got no control over anything. What Virgin Galactic are talking about is a very brief whip up to space and back, being out of the atmosphere for maybe a few minutes.\" </p> <p>The training you need will mainly get you used to the g-forces experienced during the trip. </p> <p>\"When you come back in from space, you pull out of a [steep] dive,\" says Ashford. \"You're talking about four or five g for 10-20 seconds. That's quite a lot. You probably have to go in a centrifuge [in training] to check out you're OK.\" </p> <p>Prospective passengers will also need a medical exam, but Ashford says this will probably be straightforward. In any case, a lot of the training will be just a precaution. </p> <p>\"Because this is a new industry, the authorities will start off being cautious and only take fit people and give them a lot more training than they need,\" says Ashford. \"We'll find out by trial and error what training, what medical tests are needed.\" </p> <p>Ashford says that if the Virgin plan is successful, it could trigger the far more tantalising idea of developing commercial spacecraft that can go into orbit, and potentially send people into space to stay in hotels there. In this case, passengers would need lots more training. They would be wearing pressure suits (so they'd need to know how to operate those) and would need to be happy with weightlessness by training in aeroplanes on parabolic flights - the so-called \"vomit comets\". </p> <p>Ashford says: \"In 15 years' time there will be a million people a year going to space hotels.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Laurence Davis</strong><br>Did you read Dostoyevsky while you were incarcerated? If so what are your reflections on Crime and Punishment?</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>Yes I did. I read it a couple of times. It's a dour book that wrestles admirably with the question of individual responsibility. It explores interesting ideas, particularly with Raskolnikov's argument that the superior or \"extraordinary\" man is exempt from moral responsibility, though to a certain extent I also found this idea lacked merit. But why we act the way we act and how we become who we become are questions I spent a lot of time thinking about in prison. In this regard I found Crime and Punishment helpful. I entered the prison system uneducated, inarticulate and bearing a chronic lack of self-worth. The most brutal aspect of my imprisonment was the discovery that potentially I could have had a much more worthwhile, appropriate life. It was in this latter respect that I found myself relating very much to Raskolnikov. . </p> <p><strong>John Ames</strong><br>What is your attitude to the \"broken window\" or \"zero tolerance\" theory - that if you take a tough line against comparatively minor acts of incivility you prevent the growth of more serious crime? Would encountering such a policing attitude early on in your life have prevented you from committing the crime that resulted in your life sentence? Thank you.</p> <p>PS: I have enjoyed your column for many years, will be buying your book and placing it next to Jeffrey Bernard on my book shelf, and following your future writings with interest.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>I may be wrong, but to me, a \"tough line\" usually means coming down heavy on vulnerable and easily targeted people. And anyway, to my mind \"getting tough,\" is disingenuous rhetoric that doesn't really help anyone. If anything it only muddies the water and makes it harder for many people to look beyond the unacceptable actions of others to the reasons for them. I received a lot of punishment in my formative years. It produced little that was positive in my later life.</p> <p> <strong> Roger Fletcher</strong><br> If you were home secretary, what three things would you do to reduce the number of prisoners in UK jails? That is assuming you think there are too many already.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br> There are too many people in prison but I think it would take more than three things to have any real impact on the numbers. However these are the first three things I'd do if I were in the home secretary's shoes:<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> I'd take a little more thinking time before reacting to \"public concern\" as generated by headlines in the popular press.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> I'd introduce measures to ensure that people were not spending more time in prison than was strictly necessary, (and ensure that while they were there they were offered every opportunity to gain appropriate work skills).<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> I'd talk to the minister for education to see if we could introduce programmes into schools that would better prepare children for adulthood, ie parenting skills, thinking skills, social skills. A long-term strategy, way beyond the four or five-year term of a government is the only way we are ever going to create a prison system that future generations might be proud of. </p> <p><strong>Lucy Gampell</strong>, director <a href=\"http://www.prisonersfamilies.org.uk\">Action for Prisoners' Families</a><br>How difficult is it for prisoners to maintain good family relationships while in prison, and what could the Prison Service do to improve the situation?</p> <p><strong>Erwins's answer</strong><br>Very difficult. Following the 1990 Strangeways riot the Woolf report on prison disturbances recommended that every effort should be made to hold prisoners in prisons as close to their home towns as possible, yet prisoners are still regularly located in prisons hundreds of miles away from friends and family. In spite of the pressure of prison numbers, locating prisoners nearer their homes should be of paramount importance. Many prisons still do not have visitor centres where visitors can relax and compose themselves before entering the visiting hall. All prisons should have visitor centres manned by non-uniformed staff. Visiting start and finish times should be respected by all prison staff, who should also ensure that visitors are treated with the utmost courtesy at all times. One major improvement over recent years is the introduction of occasional \"family visits\". Such visits can last up to six hours and in the summer months may even take place outside, depending on the facilities of the prison. Such family visits bring great relief and strength to people in prison and their families and also offer prison staff a terrific means of gaining positive job satisfaction. Family visits should be available in all prisons. </p> <p><strong>Alan</strong><br>Can I first of all take this opportunity to wish you every health and success to enjoy your new found freedom. As a serving Samaritan volunteer who also undertakes visits to Maghaberry Prison and a young offenders centre here in Northern Ireland, I would be interested to hear your views on whether you feel Samaritans can play a greater role or have more positive input through our weekly visits and our involvement in the listeners scheme.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>Samaritans already play a vital role in prison life. The weekly sessions and support for prison listener schemes is one of the most refreshing and encouraging developments in the prison system in the last 10 or 12 years. I think they give as much support as is practical. At present, though I'd like to hear the voice of the Sams shouting louder in protest at the disgracefully high numbers of self-inflicted deaths in British prisons. </p> <p><strong>Sheila Keighley</strong><br>Do you not feel that most people serving sentences in prison would repay their debt to society more effectively, both personally and publicly, within the community, attending a more potent, highly financed probation service?</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>It depends on the nature of the offence committed. It makes sense to me that anyone who causes or threatens harm to others should lose their right to be a part of the community for a relative period of time. What concerns me greatly is that prison life is not conducive to the creation of responsible, considerate human beings. Having said that, many programmes exist in prisons which do offer opportunities for prisoners to make an effort to contribute to the wider community. Workshops where items for the disabled are manufactured and Braille transcription undertaken in cells or in special workshops are just two examples. As for the probation service, there has been so much ill-thought out political interference over the last 10 years or so that I think it has struggled to hang on to an authentic sense of purpose. I was lucky that during my time in prison I had just two outside probation officers both of whom contributed a great deal to my development by their supportive, encouraging, understanding attitude. To my mind that is the kind of attitude that should epitomise an effective probation service.</p> <p><strong>Mick Furey</strong><br>Good to hear you're out, mate. I followed your articles all the way, not knowing that my own grandson would finish up in Lincoln after a motiveless assault on an elderly woman while high on cocaine and beer. Like yourself, he's making no excuses; he's ready for sentence when it comes (after psychiatric assessment). We just hope it's not too long. He appreciated your book after I sent it in; I hope he's learnt something from it. I'd appreciate your thoughts on the future shape of prison policy, especially young prisoners (he's 21). I don't want to think that he'll come out worse than when he went into the system, as so many others have. Any ideas? As to the future, I wish you every success rather than good luck because I don't believe in luck. Thanks for your insights.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br> I'm really sorry to hear about your grandson, but pleased for him that he has such a caring and supportive family. For a young man to act in such a way towards an elderly person is almost beyond comprehension and I know it is a hell of a thing to happen to you all. Hopefully the victim is receiving lots of support to aid recovery. As for your grandson, so long as you don't give up on him there is hope. There will be opportunities for him to grow in prison and he'll meet some inspiring people who'll be able to help him. But how he is when he comes out will depend largely on how he reacts to difficult times and the efforts he makes to sort himself out while he's in there. I wish you all well. </p> <p><strong>\"blindern\"</strong><br>I am a French reader and I have discovered that you wrote in the Guardian when you were in jail. My question is about the problem that faces the young. I have been surprised about the invention of the antisocial behaviour order (ABSO). It made me afraid at first, because it can be used to control the young of the lower classes, creating special treatment for them.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>I worry too about ASBOs. As a society we seem to be too quick to blame young people for their bad behaviour. I'm afraid that's just the easy way out. Adult influence is the biggest deciding factor in the type of adults that most children grow up to be. </p> <p><strong> Christine Holland</strong><br>During your time inside did you have an official prison visitor? If so, what did you think of them? Very keen to find out what you think here as I'm an official prison visitor.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>Official visitors - or \"prison visitors\" - are people who visit prisoners who normally do not have much contact with the outside world. Prison visitors are usually well adjusted regular people who are able to offer isolated prisoners conversation and an idea of life beyond the prison landings that they might not otherwise have. It is often a mutually beneficial relationship. And so it should be.</p> <p><strong>Diarmuid Fogarty</strong><br>What kind of person becomes a screw?</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br> It's a difficult job, but somebody has to do it. During my 20 years inside I met many very good people who worked as prison officers, not all were just \"screws\". </p> <p><strong>Svetlana Sellers</strong><br> How do you handle issues of confidentiality when writing about other prisoners? (I know you use nicknames but do you get their permission?) And any advice for a trainee probation officer? </p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>If the story is a particularly sensitive one but I thought it deserved to be told I would mention to the people involved that I wanted to write about it to get their approval. I've never had anyone tell me they didn't want me to write about something concerning them. If I need to put someone in a not very good light and can't really ask for permission I rely on what I have always done anyway: changing names, locations and time frames. The people and events I have written about are real and true in every other way. </p> <p>On being a prison officer, never forget that the people who you will have to supervise are real people, not just \"clients\" or \"offenders\". If your life had been different you might have ended up sitting in their seats.</p> <p><strong>Helen Grayshan</strong><br>Having been a victim of several minor crimes recently, I am interested in the idea of confronting the perpetrators and trying to make them understand my point of view. What do you think about schemes that encourage offenders to meet with their victims? Have you thought about doing it yourself, or have you any plans to find out what happened to those you offended against 20 years ago?</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>The concept you are talking about is one that is being explored already in different parts of the country and is commonly known as \"restorative justice\". In principle it appears to be a very good idea. But I think whether it achieves anything positive depends totally on the individuals concerned. I do know however that there are many people in prison who would dearly welcome the opportunity to apologise to their victims. </p> <p><strong>Eileen Menzies</strong><br>Firstly, good luck. My question is about a system to \"employ\" literate prisoners to teach illiterate prisoners to read using a special training manual - designed to be used by untrained \"teachers\". They do this at least five times a week. The \"teachers\" gain as they help others and of course pupils gain immeasurably. Although there is little for prison staff to do once the system is up and running it obviously takes official authority, organisation and monitoring (a prisoner coordinator does the daily recording of progress) although it does need good will from busy prison staff. In some prisons, furthermore, prisoners have to be unlocked and escorted to the place where the lesson will take place. Although, in others prisoners are released from workshops for a lesson or can have lessons during free association. There is more, but briefly, have you heard of it? Do you have any suggestions on how to get governors to support it? We are having some success in two (at least) London prisons and in about 80 UK-wide, but if prison officers move on or up, it is often difficult to maintain momentum. This is a cheeky question but will you be writing any more articles on prisons? If so, or when, I would be so pleased to put you in touch with the head and founder of the trust if you thought the subject was one you might pursue.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br>I have heard about a scheme called \"Toe by Toe,\" whereby literate prisoners act as reading and writing mentors to those who are not so able. Perhaps this is the scheme you are talking about. <a href=\"http://www.toe-by-toe.co.uk/prison_project.html\">Toe by Toe</a> was set up by the Shannon Trust which was created from the proceeds of sales of one of the most remarkable books I have ever read: Invisible Crying Tree, by Tom Shannon and Christopher Morgan. I think it is a wonderful idea, offering prisoners, as it does, an opportunity to share responsibility and in the process regain some self-respect. Perhaps it should be an initiative that is specifically measured as an auditable key performance indicator. That way the prison governor would have to ensure that resources were available to support it. </p> <p><strong>Chris Dabbs</strong><br>First, many thanks for your column - it has been a highlight of the Guardian and I am really glad to know that you will continue to write. I am particularly interested in your view on the well-being of prisoners. It is suggested that some 90% of prisoners have a mental health problem (including personality disorder) and/or substance misuse problem. From your experience, what would be the best thing to do to support people to improve their health and well-being, physical, psychological and otherwise? And what more creative alternatives to prison are there that would benefit both offenders and the public more than the current set-up? Finally, my very best wishes to you for the future. I look forward to reading A Life Outside.</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br> The well-being of prisoners is something everyone should be concerned about. Most people in prison are there because they have caused some level of suffering to someone else, that's why for many on the outside their well-being is not something to be overly concerned about. But we should do our best not to let our anger cloud our ability to reason. I' m not sure about the percentage you quote, but there are certainly a high proportion of people in prison with mental health and behavioural problems - it is a situation that contributes largely to the unusual reality of prison life generally. The authorities are well aware that it is a serious problem but I think nobody really knows how to address it. Ordinary imprisonment is not a good way of living for healthy people. For those whose health - mental or physical - is not strong, it is particularly damaging, despite the efforts of the many good people who work in the prison system who do their best to help. I'm in the same camp as the authorities on this one as I also don't know the answer. </p> <p><strong> Ian Andrew</strong><br>I have followed the column every week, and found it an absolutely riveting insight into how to survive such a long sentence. Hope there'll be many more to come ... do you plan to continue writing - apart from in the Guardian?</p> <p><strong>Erwin's answer</strong><br> It is rare that the voice of the prisoner is heard beyond the prison walls. I consider myself greatly privileged that for four years through A life Inside, mine was allowed to be heard. Writing has been very good for me. I have loved writing for the Guardian. The response from Guardian readers to my contributions has been encouraging and inspiring beyond measure and I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has taken the time to send me good wishes in cards, letters and e-mails. I do intend to explore the possibility of other writing projects, but for now I'm happy to continue chronicling my observations on this odd experience in my favourite newspaper.</p>",
  "<p>Porto are facing disciplinary action from Uefa over the incident in which a fan spat at Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho during the warm-up at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p> The incident has been mentioned in the report by the Uefa delegate at the game and European football's governing body today opened a disciplinary investigation into the matter.</p> <p> The fan was ejected from the ground and hosts Chelsea are not expected to face any repercussions but it is likely that Porto will be fined.</p> <p> Mourinho, who guided Porto to become European champions last season, brushed off the incident after the 3-1 victory. </p> <p> He said: \"I had my back to the crowd as I was watching my players warming up when it happened. I just went over to greet the supporters, but this is a normal thing. </p> <p> \"I can understand it. Some people love me, and others don't love me that much. But that's just life. </p> <p> \"The opposing fans do this many times. Unfortunately, these things happen. But there were also many people who wanted photos and paid me compliments.\"</p> <p> A Uefa spokesman said: \"It is mentioned in the referees report so we will open a disciplinary case against Porto. </p> <p> \"Usually it is the home team that has to control the fans but teams can be fined for the behaviour of their fans in away games. </p> <p> \"The punishment will probably be a fine.\"</p>",
  "<p>The base of the natural logarithm and truly one of the most important numbers in all of mathematics, the number e, is approximately 2.71828182845904 (approximately because its decimal expansion continues without repetition). Despite lacking an impressive Greek moniker, e plays an important role in complex analysis, finance, physics and geometry, and pops up in unexpected ways in a variety of situations. As far as I know, however, it has never played a role in marketing or recruitment until now. </p> <p>Google, the internet's most popular search engine, announced this year that it was intending to raise $2,718,281,828 (roughly e billion dollars) during its much-vaunted initial shares offer. The company fell short of this, but it apparently has deemed association with the number to be a good thing. Perhaps this is because the number e is transcendental (it is the root of no algebraic equation), and the company aspires to transcend normal business practices. Or maybe e's role in finance and theoretical mathematics made it an appealing numerical mascot for Google, a company trying to straddle the worlds of finance and high technology. The company derives its name from another number, googol, a term for a one followed by 100 zeros. </p> <p>This summer Google again used the number e, this time to attract potential employees. On a prominent billboard in California's Silicon Valley on July 12 there appeared the following mysterious puzzle: \"(first 10 digit prime in consecutive digits of e).com\" </p> <p>Finding the first 10 digit prime number in the decimal expansion of e is quite a trick, but with various software tools, one can determine that the answer is 7427466391. </p> <p>Then if you visit the website <a href=\"http://www.7427466391.com\">www.7427466391.com</a> you will be presented with an even more difficult puzzle. Figuring this one out takes you to a web page that asks you, rather anti-climactically, to submit your CV to Google. The ad campaign is something of a shaggy dog story, complete with the requisite lame punchline. </p> <p>Presumably Google's conceit is that if you're smart enough to solve the puzzles, you're smart enough to work for them and they'd like to hear from you. And even if you're not, the billboard is an intriguing bit of advertising. Of course, anyone who really wanted to discover the answers without incurring a headache would merely have to do a Google search for them, since many solvers would immediately post their solutions online in order to crow about their brilliance. </p> <p>This adoption of an important number as a token might be taken up by other organisations. A mutual fund company, for example, could do something with the natural log of two (about .693), a number that might tie into an ad campaign about doubling your money. Maybe the Olympics could adopt pi, also a transcendental number, which, because of its connection to the circle, has universal connotations. Or a construction consortium could use phi, the symbol for the numerical value of the golden mean, to promote its concern for aesthetics. And Google might not be the only company to embrace the number e. It would fit in quite naturally with the online auction company, eBay. </p> <p>Google's use of e for recruitment might also lead to other numbers being used. A list of sports records might appear in an ad for sports reporters, for example. Similar practices have often taken place informally, such as when people slip an esoteric word into a job interview, or when estate agents check to make sure prospective buyers qualify for a loan. But mathematics as a gatekeeper gives the practice an intriguing new wrinkle. </p> <p>Of course, many companies already use maths puzzles to weed out the insufficiently number-savvy: if you want this job, quickly prove that the square root of two is irrational or that the lighter ball can be found in three weighings. </p> <p>A well-known mathematician comes to mind in this context. His computer has no password protection. Instead he's programmed it to spit a sequence of random dates onto the screen, and the user must give the days of the week corresponding to these dates within a couple of seconds or the machine shuts down. More in the spirit of Google's puzzle is another mathematician whose answering machine was programmed to ask callers for the first five digits of e and would hang up if they weren't quickly provided. </p> <p>Google's commingling of the e-thereal and the e-veryday is certainly not a big news story, but I find it an appealingly e-erie bit of e-business. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Allen Paulos is a professor of mathematics at Temple University, Philadelphia, and bestselling author of Innumeracy and A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market. <a href=\"http://www.math.temple.edu/paulos\">www.math.temple.edu/paulos</a></p>",
  "<p>The government should consider stripping private schools and hospitals of their charitable status, a parliamentary committee argues in report published today.</p> <p>A joint committee of MPs and peers makes the call in its scrutinty report of the draft charities bill. The legislation will make \"public benefit\" the cornerstone of a new definition of charity as part of a major overhaul of Britain's 400-year-old charity law.</p> <p>The MPs and peers stopped short of making a review of the schools' and hospitals' charitable status a formal recommendation, but the committee's report argues that taking the fee-charging schools and hospitals off the charities register \"has its attractions, not least in removing the confusion and controversy surrounding the charitable status of private schools\". </p> <p>The committee concedes that the idea is \"radical\", but says it nevertheless believes the government should consider reviewing the schools and hospitals' position, looking at whether \"the best long-term solution\" might be removing charitable status and making tax breaks conditional on providing \"quantified public benefits\".</p> <p>Controversy over private schools has hung over the committee's deliberations, with its former chairman, Alan Milburn, slamming the situation as \"a dog's breakfast\" after a row blew up between the Charity Commission - the watchdog to be charged with testing charities' public benefit - and Home Office ministers.</p> <p>Fiona Mactaggart, the charities minister, had pledged that the public benefit checks would be applied to private schools. But the commission argued that the new legislation would \"probably not change\" the schools' charitable status because it would not override case law.</p> <p>The report repeats the committee's criticism of the \"schism\" between the two. \"The [Charity Commission's] interpretation left the draft bill in the ludicrous position of promising to bite the public benefit bullet, without having the teeth to do so,\" it says. </p> <p>The committee recommended that principles for a definition of public benefit should be based on the deal hammered out between the Charity Commission and the Home Office, which saw a climbdown by the watchdog earlier this month.</p> <p>But in a belt-and-braces measure to ensure that the new law will be applied in line with its intentions, the committee also called for the principles to be set out either in non-exclusive criteria included in the bill or in non-binding statutory guidance issued by the home secretary. </p> <p>Divisions over the crucial public benefit clauses is likely to resurface when a bill finally reaches parliament, with some MPs likely to back the National Council for Voluntary Organisations' argument that the definition of public benefit should be purely a matter for the regulator.</p> <p>Labour MP George Foulkes, who has been acting chairman of the committee since Mr Milburn's return to the cabinet, said: \"We would like to see charities playing an even bigger role and believe that many have the potential to contribute to the modernisation of public services and the enhancement of civic responsibility. </p> <p>\"Our assessment of the bill and the recommendations we make are based on a desire to see charities - and charitable endeavour and income - grow not diminish in our country.\"</p> <p>The report was generally welcomed by NCVO and other voluntary sector groups, which will particularly welcome the committee's call to scrap a controversial new objective for the Charity Commission - to encourage charities to maximise their \"social and economic impact\".</p> <p>The committee has made a series of recommendations about the watchdog body, which came in for heavy criticism during the parliamentary hearings. The report says the evidence the committee heard \"has given us reason to question whether the Charity Commission is properly organised and properly resourced to make it effective in its new tasks\". </p> <p>There should be a review of the commission, looking particularly at \"the quality of its processes, methods and organisation\" and \"the calibre of its staff\" as well as its resources.</p> <p>The report also calls for a stronger statement on the independence of the Charity Commission from government and says the commission should appear each year before the Commons home affairs select committee and its annual report should be debated by parliament. The bill should include a duty on the commission to act fairly, reasonably and proportionately, the report says.</p> <p>The committee also wants to beef up the proposed independent appeals tribunal, giving it powers to review all the Charity Commission's decisions, including decisions to launch inquiries into charities.</p> <p>The report also contains a series of recommendation to ensure paid professional fundraisers make their status clear to the public, and calls for the bill to be amended to let charities trade directly and enjoy tax breaks on trading income, up to a point where it reaches 25% - or \u00a35,000 if greater - of the charity's total turnover. </p> <p>This would partially reinstate proposals to allow direct trading by charities, which were made by the prime minister's strategy unit in 2002 but rejected by the government.</p>",
  "Like its fellow colourful Italian label, Pucci, Missoni's distinctive patterns and shades have been lifted out of fashion ignominy. <p>Once a little too redolent of 70s excess, it has been enjoying for the past few years a happy renaissance thanks to the clever touches of current designer and leading member of the striped dynasty, Angela Missoni, who has shown that multicoloured horizontals don't have to look like TV test cards, but can be a beautiful thing. </p> <p>Many thanks for this are due to Missoni's teenage daughter, Margharita, who was present at the show yesterday, and who is proving an even better advertisement for the label than the current face of the house, Kate Moss. </p> <p>Margharita Missoni makes frequent appearances at high-profile fashion shows wearing a mix of her family brand and that favourite look for the pretty, young and wealthy - \"vintage\" - which encapsulates Missoni's current appeal: it is lovely, certainly, but also harks back to a fashion past. </p> <p>In today's fashion world, a reference to the 70s counts as canny respect for history. </p> <p>But now that Missoni's stripes are comfortably back in fashion the label seems anxious to prove it can consist of more than just horizontal lines. </p> <p>Too few labels are willing to take such risks and show they can do more than the predictable, but Missoni risks obliterating what makes it so distinctive in the first place. At yesterday's show, for example, in between the timelessly pretty candy-striped knitted dresses and long summer coats were a few too many long chiffon dresses with tropical prints. Although it seems women will always want another floral chiffon dress, this market is more than sufficiently catered for by the likes of Nicole Farhi and Diane von Furstenburg - not to mention the British high street in general. So for Missoni to add its two bits is not really necessary. </p> <p>It is understandable Missoni might want to do more than produce stripes - it makes economic sense, too, because a woman can only own so many striped dresses, demonstrating that the company is looking to encourage customers to make more than one purchase - but pretty, wispy dresses are not going to make the label look any more original. </p> <p>Better were the orange floral prints on a brown background, beaded fruit appliques, low and slouchy trousers, and cropped blazers with piping, all of which referenced Missoni's past but without looking like costumes from a homage to Studio 54. </p> <p>For the Missoni show's soundtrack, Coldplay's Yellow was the suitably colour-orientated choice, although it was put on a seemingly unending loop and repeated at least four times. A lesson, perhaps, for just as some things should stay the same others need a bit of a change, occasionally. </p> <p><b>Trend watch: Wedges and platform heels</b></p> <p>They're harder to walk in than flats and not as flattering as heels, but wedges and platforms are the shoe shapes to go for next spring/summer. Start practising your walk now </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> At Nicole Farhi and Clements Ribeiro, wooden strappy sandals had a slight platform sole, giving them a 70s appearance and making a nicely chunky contrast to all the chiffon dresses </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Marc by Marc Jacobs always makes shoes that look as tempting as sweets. For next season there will be a selection of wedge heels in eye-grabbing neon colours </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Burberry Prorsum will also be dangling similar style carrots before shoe addicts. Aside from the plain white wedges, there will be wedge platforms splattered with toile de jouy-like prints </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Emporio Armani played it predictably more subtle with simple white wedges</p>",
  "<p><strong>Fiona Mactaggart, the charities minister</strong><br>\"I welcome the committee's backing for the bill's proposals to reform and modernise charity law, to add to the support we have received from charities themselves. There is widespread support for the principle that public benefit should be the bedrock of charitable status, regulated by a strengthened, independent Charity Commission. I am very confident that we are on the right track to produce legislation that will benefit charities, will enable them to play an even bigger role as a force for good in society, and will encourage people to give their time, talents and money to charities.\"</p> <p><strong> Chris Stalker, head of campaigns, National Council for Voluntary Organisations</strong><br>\"We understand that the committee unanimously supported the recommendations in the report, which gives us great confidence about the next stage for the bill. We're really very pleased - it's 99% there. There is only one thing that we would urge the Home Office to think about, which is the recommendation that there should be guidance from the home secretary or non-exclusive criteria in the bill on the definition of public benefit. We feel strongly that should be a matter for the regulator. It's not about who is in the Home Office or the Charity Commission at the moment - this has got to be an act that lasts.\"</p> <p><strong>Nick Aldridge, head of policy, the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations</strong><br> \"We're extremely pleased that the committee has recognised the need for this bill in the voluntary sector. We'll be pushing for it to be included in the Queen's speech and implemented soon afterwards. We're particularly delighted that the committee has revisited the clauses on trading by charities, which is a golden opportunity to rid charities of unnecessary red tape.\"</p> <p><strong>Geraldine Peacock, chairwoman, the Charity Commission</strong><br> \"I think it's got most of the things we would have hoped for. It reinforces our independence. I'm pleasantly surprised, really, in the light of the knock-around at the beginning. The commission would be happy with either non-exclusive criteria or ministerial guidance on public benefit, while the recommendation that the commission's fitness for purpose and resourcing be reviewed was also welcomed, because it would give the watchdog a basis on which to appeal for more funding from the Treasury, which has frozen its income for the next three years, she added.</p> <p><strong>Sue Brumpton, chief executive of the Public Fundraising Regulatory Association</strong><br>\"Any guidelines issued by the Home Office for the regulation of the sector, provided they are practical, workable and not unduly burdensome to charities, are welcomed by the PFRA membership.

  "Transatlantic travellers who are fans of TV crime shows can look forward to their own encounter with US law enforcement under new regulations requiring mandatory fingerprinting for foreigners arriving at US airports. <p>From today Britons, along with travellers from western Europe and other countries who for years have enjoyed a relatively uneventful arrival in America, will be subjected to a security regime devised in the aftermath of the September 11 2001 terror attacks. </p> <p>On arriving at US airports, Britons, who previously travelled visa-free under a waiver programme, will be photographed at immigration counters and have digital fingerprints taken by sliding their left index finger and then their right into a white plastic scanning device. Britons working in America have been subject to the regulations since January. </p> <p>US authorities insist the process is fast - 15 seconds for each traveller - and painless. \"We have been taking finger scans of British nationals coming under the visa regime since January, and we have not had any negative pushback from that,\"said Bob Mocny, the deputy director of the new visitors' regime. </p> <p>\"There is no ink involved, it's not like a booking process. It's a very simple device - kind of like ET going home, where the finger glows red.\" </p> <p>But it is going to be difficult for travellers to dispel worries about flying to America in a year that has produced a slew of airline horror stories - all the unfortunate results of US efforts to prevent a repeat of the 9/11 attacks. </p> <p>First, there were the repeated delays and cancellations of British and French flights to America during the Christmas holidays, after US officials suspected a terrorist was on board. </p> <p>The long-suffering passengers of BA flight 223 to Washington Dulles eventually landed on New Year's Eve, escorted by F-16 fighters. As for the Air France flight from Los Angeles to Paris, it turned out that the three suspect passengers were a child, an insurance agent from Wales and an elderly Chinese woman. </p> <p>Next, the writer Ian McEwan was turned away at the US-Canadian border a day before he was to deliver a lecture in Seattle. The authorities later said the refusal was an error. </p> <p>But there were no apologies for Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, whose flight last week was unaccountably diverted to Bangor, Maine, where he was bundled away by government agents and deported. </p> <p>Aside from Britons, the new measures apply to passengers from western Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei and Singapore. Only diplomats, children below the age of 14, and adults over 80 will be exempt, along with Canadians and some Mexicans.</p> <p>From October 26 Britons will also need a machine-readable passport; travellers using older passports, or those issued abroad, will be barred from the visa waiver programme and will be obliged to apply for US visas. </p> <p>And a year from now Britons may be required to swap that passport for a new one with an electronic chip containing biometric data such as fingerprints. </p> <p>So far, the authorities have not intercepted a single known terrorist. But the system has scored hits against other \"undesirables\", mainly ordinary criminals. </p> <p>\"It's keeping people out that the British tourist doesn't want to encounter,\" Mr Mocny said. He added: \"The US has always been a welcoming nation.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Everyone travelling to the US must have a visa or visa waiver (the green form given out on the plane).

  "<p><strong>Q</strong> Despite careful reading of all the financial literature I still don't know if what I'm doing is legal. I have a two-year fixed rate Isa for 2004/05 with Portman. At the same time, I make monthly deposits into a maxi Isa with Fidelity Wealthbuilder. I have been making these deposits for some years after being advised by Saga Finance that this was a good investment policy. </p> <p>I also have \u00a32,000 in a Nationwide Tracker Fund opened some years ago but never topped it up because the financial press warns against tracker funds. I also have a 30 day mini cash Isa for 2003/04 with Northern Rock. My Tessa maturity Isa bond with Nationwide, which I started years ago accrues interest but I have not made any additional payments into it for some time now, largely out of ignorance and fear of falling foul of the law. Can you please help me sort this mess out or recommend an advisor who speaks in plain English?</p> <p><strong>VB</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It does sound as if you have got yourself into a mess, but you are not alone. A major criticism of Isas is that they are surrounded by very complicated rules, which are difficult to explain in a simple manner. Basically you are allowed to contribute up to \u00a37,000 from April 6 to April 5 in any tax year. This can either be in a mini Isa, which has three separate components - \u00a33,000 in cash, \u00a3l,000 in an insurance policy and \u00a33,000 in shares or bonds. Alternatively up to \u00a37,000 can be invested in shares or bonds via a maxi Isa, which normally has no real cash element. </p> <p>You are not allowed to take out a maxi and mini Isa in the same year, although you can take them out in separate tax years. I assume the Portman investment is a mini cash Isa taken out this year, as a successor to the mini cash Isa for 2003/04 with Northern Rock, which is okay.</p> <p>You do appear to be breaking regulations with the monthly contributions to your Fidelity maxi Isa. Although not illegal, it does contravene rules laid down by the Inland Revenue, who can withdraw the tax concessions on all your Isas. </p> <p>I am a bit surprised you have got into this situation since all Isa application forms contain specific questions about whether you have any other Isas. However I agree the accompanying literature is very unclear and, in your case, extra confusion is added by the fact you have an Isa with monthly contributions and single lump sum cash Isas. </p> <p>As a start, I suggest you contact Fidelity and explain the situation. You will lose the tax-free concessions, but l don't suppose you have used up your capital gains tax annual exemption for the past two years, and the Revenue will probably take a lenient view if you own up to a genuine mistake made by many others. </p> <p>The TOISA (Tessa only Isa) with Nationwide should be allowable as an additional Isa, but it cannot be topped up. The tracker fund is not affected by Isa regulations and you can decide whether to keep it or not. The costs of tracker funds are usually low and even if you have no \"feel\" for shares, you might as well retain it just to give you some exposure to the share market.</p>",
  "<p>Anti-poverty groups yesterday called on the government to overhaul the tax credit system or risk increasing levels of hardship among Britain's poorest families. </p> <p>The charities, including Child Poverty Action Group and One Parent Families, said in an open letter to the Inland Revenue that \"fundamental deficiencies\" remain in the system. </p> <p>They said it was likely to come under further strain this weekend when the Revenue begins to stop payments to thousands of claimants who have not returned tax credit renewal forms. </p> <p>Six million families are eligible for tax credits and they were sent renewal forms in April. The forms are due to be returned by September 30, after which claimants could see payments stopped. </p> <p>The charities said they expected a flood of complaints next week when families began to feel the effects of the ruling. </p> <p>Thousands of families are also facing demands to return tax credit payments from last year. Many saw immediate cuts in their income in this tax year as the Revenue clawed back overpayments from the 2003-04 tax year. </p> <p>The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, a charity sponsored by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, has demanded that the Revenue take a more conciliatory stance in disputes \"because award notices are so difficult to understand, it is impossible for claimants to check whether they are being paid the right amount\". </p> <p>John Andrews, chairman of the charity, said: \"It is disappointing that 18 months after the implementation of the tax credits system we are still discussing fundamental deficiencies which we, and other bodies, identified as needing modification right at the start.\" </p> <p>A Revenue spokesman said: \"We will be studying the LITRG's points very carefully as part of our ongoing commitment to make our tax credits services as efficient and effective as possible.\" </p> <p>The Revenue admitted this week that it paid out \u00a31m in compensation to 10,800 people who suffered delays and errors in payments since the scheme was broadened to include nine out of 10 families in April last year. Welfare experts believe the complaints represented only a fraction of the people affected by the near collapse of the scheme, which the parliamentary public accounts committee called \"nothing short of disastrous\".</p>",
  "<b> City of rubble</b> <br> <p> It is only an hour's drive east from Ingushetia, where the fallout of one of the longest, most brutal wars of the last century has only begun to manifest itself, to the epicentre of the conflict itself, the Chechen capital, Grozny. </p> <p>So far, six of the Beslan militants have been identified as Chechen. Grozny's ruins, the gnawed skeleton of a city still breathless and flattened after being carpet-bombed twice in four years, embody the savage history of the Chechen people. My driver, Hussein, tells me, as we pass a graveyard on the 1st of May Street, of how its gravestones were ripped up during the mass deportation and executions ordered by Stalin in 1944. \"They were used as paving stones for the street in front of it,\" he says. \"But in 1991 [when Chechnya began to find its independence after the break-up of the Soviet Union], the president had them replaced and the cemetery turned into a memorial for the 1944 genocide.\" </p> <p>It is a fitting metaphor for the city, whose ruins still lie where they fell and whose people live among the rubble where their relatives died. Moscow's disregard for the city it has flattened twice reached almost comic heights earlier this year when President Putin said, after flying over the city in a helicopter, that it \"looked terrible\". Its residents, who live amid windowless shells of buildings with erratic electricity and gas and no water, are now oblivious to such Russian sympathy. </p> <p>The city's graffiti reflects the political turmoil of the past five years. In 1999, Russian troops marched back in to restore federal control after three years of independence had led the republic to collapse into a series of feuds between local warlords. One block of flats - gutted to the point where its sooty windows and the holes left by shells are indistinguishable - bears the slogan: \"Our president - Aslan Maskhadov\", the republic's separatist president, elected in 1996. Moscow has now put a $10m price on his head and said that he ordered the Beslan siege. </p> <p>Another wall proclaims their man as \"Akhmad Kadyrov\", the pro-Moscow president installed by the Kremlin in October, yet assassinated in May by separatists. Another refers to a candidate in last month's elections, staged again by Moscow to install their successor to Kadyrov. Yet the most telling speaks of the republic's thirst for autonomy - after peace. Sprayed in red paint on the underpass on a main avenue, it reads: \"Our President - Our choice.\" </p> <p>The city is livelier these days than it has been in years. Violence is never far away, Russian troops patrolling the streets at daybreak, walking in columns along the sides of the road, nervously close to their APCs and tanks. But the incessant gunfire that rattled through the night six months ago has died down. Now people sell music cassettes on the central street and Tajik children - who consider the poverty of Central Asia worse than that of Chechnya - beg on street corners. </p> <p>In the days after Beslan, Russians interviewed by their own media often blamed the massacre on the Chechen people, an ethnic group widely distrusted, mostly due to ignorance and fear. Yet most people on Grozny's main streets last week expressed their disgust at Beslan. </p> <p>Ruslan, 21, said: \"It's not right. They are kids and not to blame. If we have an argument, what does your son or my son have to do with it? It was some sort of hell there.\" </p> <p>Malika, 53, walking alongside her daughter with her granddaughter in a pushchair, said: \"It's hard to say what it was about. You know, before [the wars] nobody bothered us here and we lived in peace. Beslan is not connected [with separatism], and was probably international terrorism. But the only people who really know what happened are the very stupid, and the very clever.\" </p> <p>Grozny knows about loss. I remember the small wall of posters of the missing from Beslan - a glass window near the school where anxious parents put up pictures of their children. Such pictures, torn from the family photo album to serve an immediate practical purpose, are a common sight in Chechnya, where human rights groups, politicians or officials readily show you a thick folder of the missing - young men who have been abducted and vanished in the republic. </p> <p>In the busy market, middle-aged traders Fatima and Zura appear torn between their disgust at Beslan and their hatred of Moscow. \"The [Beslan militants] were not boeviki - the boeviki fight the Russians, not children. Muslims do not kill children. Putin and the FSB organised it all to help them extinguish the people of the north Caucasus. During the siege, the Russian special forces shot at the children. We are not the sort of people to do that. We build and build again whatever happens to us,\" she says, pointing to the wrecked buildings around her. </p> <p>She says that after the last war, Moscow deliberately let top Chechen separatist leaders go because they wanted a continued \"reason to extinguish us as a people. The federals took away two of my sons, Rizvan, 30, and Ziyaoudi, 24, in October 2000 [at one of the main checkpoints on the Ingushetian border]. I know nothing of them. Even two weeks ago, they shot three men dead at the same place, a controlled shot to the forehead finishing them off.\" </p> <p>Zura breaks down, too. \"My neighbour was taken away only yesterday. On every second floor in every block of flats there is a mother who is crying for their missing. Putin says that everyone who supports terrorists should be wiped out. But he has been trying to do that to us for years. We work all day for a piece of bread, and at night end up crying again.\" </p> <p>Across Grozny Moscow's control is enforced by large groups of Chechen police and militia, many of whom have chosen to be on the Kremlin's payroll rather than fight for inde pendence in the country's thick woodland. Some separatists are exhausted by war or disillusioned by the Islamist extremism in the movement, and Moscow has capitalised on this to bolster recruitment. </p> <p>This tactic came to a head when pro-Moscow President Kadyrov was installed in October, allowing the Kremlin to keep control but use loyal Chechens to do their fighting. Chechen turned on Chechen, and separatists began to turn on each other, or turn to Islamist extremists for ideological or financial fuel. </p> <p>In a dark cafe, a senior police officer in charge of fighting organised crime offers me a thick cup of instant coffee. He tells me: \"In essence the dynamic of the conflict has not changed here since [the start of the last war in] 1999. There are as many recruits [to the separatist cause] as then. Now you can call yourself a Jihadist, a Wahhabite, a separatist, a pro-federalist - whatever you want. There are no clear sides any more.\" </p> <p>Asked why he thinks Beslan happened, he says: \"I am a military man and cannot say,\" before he launches into a long comparison of how the American military-industrial complex propitiously persuaded Washington it needed to fight the Vietnam war, and that the Beslan massacre was intended to spark a regional multi-ethnic conflict. </p> <p>He echoes the blank distrust of Moscow felt here. People's loathing of power is so complete that they need little evidence before hatching the wildest of conspiracy theories against their federal government. He brims with tales of infighting among the presidential security services and of rising crime and unemployment, local police and security men bolstering their income through kidnapping and crime. </p> <p><b> The road to Engenoi</b><br> </p> <p> Grozny is a melting pot where the varying beliefs and allegiances in Chechnya clash. But four of the estimated six Chechens among the Beslan militants came not from its busy streets, but from the south-eastern hills, a two-hour drive away. En route to Engenoi, we pass through the town of Shali. We pause for half an hour, and I fall asleep in the hot car. A Chechen policeman wakes me to ask me to move the car. We talk. \"Here it's calm\", he says. \"But two to three kilometres down the road,\" he points, \"it's completely out of control.\" </p> <p>He speaks of how two weeks ago a group of boeviki attacked three schools where the local police and some of the Kadyrovtsi - the personal security service of the late president Kadyrov - were stationed. Four died in the attack, and the policeman's eyes remain wide at the alien enemy he says he faced. \"There were Arabs and nigres [Russian for African blacks] among the boeviki . They had weapons like those the Americans carry in Iraq. It was like nothing I have ever seen before.\" </p> <p>We drive through endless villages in the Chechen hills - settlements that seem so bucolic and remote that they should be immune to war. Ishkoi Yurt, Balansu - towns separated by checkpoints manned by tense Russian troops, wearing vests, shades and listening to Colombian pop star Shakira on the radio. </p> <p>The village of Engenoi, near the border with Dagestan, is at one of the highest points of the Chechen hills. The rickety road to it runs past lines of edgy Russian troops, each with their dugout, or APC, a slight refuge for when the boeviki come. One reads a book on top of a tank; another chops wood, he and his colleagues all in grimy vests and civilian tracksuits. Further up the road, a nervous line of conscripts, no older than 23, form, their officer barking them into order as they pile off the back of a troop carrier. </p> <p>This is the heart of rebel country, a region only nominally under federal control. \"The boeviki come here to escape from the Russians,\" says a local. \"Among these trees and hills, they can never find them, and the boeviki can rest.\" </p> <p>The sun is bright and fierce on the winding road, and a few hundred metres away from Engenoi stand two Russian troops. One bears the patch - worn by most soldiers in Chechnya - of the Russian interior ministry. The other bears no markings at all - an \"FSB-nik\", or member of the security services. He patiently writes down the details of those who pass him. </p> <p>The reason for the checkpoint becomes clear inside Engenoi. A group of Russian troops are slowly and calmly going from door to door. A zachistka - a Russian word that literally translates as \"mop-up\" - is under way. Zachistkas became infamous in the two years immediately after the second war as the favoured method of federal troops to repress the separatist population. Young men - or any of fighting age or considered suspicious - were rounded up from their homes, detained, sometimes tortured, often executed. Memorial, which documents abuses on only a third of the territory of Chechnya, estimates that since the second war ended in 2000, nearly 3,000 people have been abducted. From January 2002 to August this year, it can list 1,254 people who have been abducted, 148 of whom are known to be dead, and 757 of whom are still missing. </p> <p>The zachistkas go on, much of the work now done by loyal Chechens. But here in Engenoi, Russian troops are still at work, their faces not masked and their approach a lot calmer than nightmarish accounts of the zachistkas of years ago. They plod from house to house, politely opening doors. A large armoured van travels along the road with them, perhaps intended for anyone suspicious they find as they search houses for men, weapons or a sign of dissent. </p> <p>The Kulayev family live a few houses up the road from the troops and are not bothered. Obughash, 69, first learned that his two sons, Hanpashi and Nurpashi, were among the most loathed men in Russia when he saw a tape of Nurpashi in police captivity on television. Nurpashi was one of the only militants taken alive, his brother one of the 32 killed in the storm. </p> <p>Obughash, who mumbles his words into his grey beard as he stares at the floor, says the zachistkas have been going on in Engenoi for six months. Little is known in town about Mairbek Shibikhanov, one of the Beslan militants and another Engenoi resident, whose wife was reportedly also one of the suicide bombers in the school. </p> <p>Obughash speaks only of his elder son, Hanpashi, leaving references to the younger Nurpashi as footnotes to a greater loss. He speaks of how Hanpashi attended the redbrick school down the road - a similar building to that which now lies gutted in Beslan - and particularly enjoyed history. </p> <p>\"He prayed a lot and loved the history of Islam.\" I ask what historical periods he liked. \"There is no end or start to the history of the Koran\", he replies. </p> <p>He continues: \"He was not a Wahhabite, but a pure Muslim.\" </p> <p>Hanpashi served in the Russian army once he left school in 1991. He then fought in the first Chechen war for the separatists, his father says. He is vague about Hanpashi's involvement in the second war, saying it was all over so fast. </p> <p>In mid-August 2001, Hanpashi was shot in the arm during a roadside dispute. He was subsequently arrested, and tortured, his family say. His interrogators put sand in his wound and sat on him so he could not breathe, they claim. He was later transferred to hospital, where his arm, which had turned gangrenous, was amputated. </p> <p>\"He was arrested for being part of an illegal armed group\", Obughash says, \"but amnestied [as part of a government programme to let separatists return to normal lives] on December 18 2001.\" </p> <p>Obughash said his sons then went to live in Ingushetia, where Hanpashi could get better treatment for his arm, which required constant medical attention. The last time he saw Hanpashi alive was on August 26. His son looked broken. \"I asked him why he did not come home, and he said he felt like half a person\", Obughash says. \"He was helpless without an arm. It was a kind of death penalty. He could not go back to fight [for the militants] and he could not return to a peaceful life. They did not say what their plans were.\" </p> <p>He leans towards me and adds: \"But now I will tell you something he said that I have kept from my wife. That last time we met, Hanpashi looked at me and said: 'I don't want them to take these hands alive.'\" </p> <p>Three days later, as 32 militants stormed into the Beslan school, his third son went to Hanpashi's Ingushetian home to find it empty. </p> <p>Hanpashi's disability and desperation does not, even for his father, appear reason enough for his actions. Obughash has identified them both from pictures shown him by prosecutors, and reluctantly accepts their infamy. He says: \"I did not expect this from them. They probably thought the Russians would never storm the building because they had kids in there with them.\" He appears to absolve Nurpashi of blame, saying: \"He was just his brother's bodyguard, looking after him.\" </p> <p>I ask him why he thinks Hanpashi did it and he replies with a wry half-smile:\"We have to learn from the experience of Lenin. He said, 'There is red and there is white' [in reference to the civil war between the revolutionary Bolsheviks and the White generals seeking to preserve tsarist rule]. There is red and there is white. They [the Beslan militants] did not ask for money, but for two words. It was all about two words. 'Free Chechnya'.\" </p> <p>As he speaks, the sisters of the two men sit quietly, and one of their young sons rushes about the room. After 20 minutes, Obughash runs out of things to say and stares at the floor. The zachistka is nearing and I return to my car. As we drive out of the village, the distant sound of machine gunfire echoes through the hills.</p>",
  "In Beslan, they are filling in the holes. The cemetery on the road from the airport is a sprawling mass of upturned earth, each fresh grave marked out from the surrounding mud by a perimeter of red bricks. The flowers and bare wooden stick crosses jut out from the rough grazing pasture. <p>A fortnight after the Beslan siege, the funerals are still going on, and 70 graves remain unfilled. The empty soil trenches are a reminder of how many families still face the gruesome process of identifying the scorched remains of their dead. </p> <p>Lubov Salamova, 58, weeps at the grave of her grandson, Sergei Alkaev. \"He would have been 15 this month. His mother died in a gas explosion at home years earlier, and now he has left me. He was found dead in the gym, his head and hands partly missing. He was such a good boy\". Across the 188 fresh graves, the sound of wailing hangs in the country air. </p> <p>They are also filling in the holes outside Middle School Number 1. Aslan and another workman drill away the surface of the road near the garages on the school's left. Here, a fortnight earlier, Russian special forces and hysterical locals had broken a hole in the garage walls, giving access to the school's courtyard, where the bloody siege was into its second hour. Through the hole poured grimy, bloody children and parents on to waiting stretchers and into local cars, requisitioned for want of ambulances. Aslan explains that his orders are to dig up the pock-marks and make the road smooth again, to remove the traces of the grenade blasts and bullets. </p> <p>No such cosmetic considerations are in evidence at the school itself. It remains an open monument to the town's grief and catalyst for its anger. For two weeks, locals have simply trudged over its ruins, mindless to the human remains and unspent ordnance buried under them. The remains of \"Boevik 3\" - the Russian prosecutor's ID for \"militant 3\" of the 32 who seized the school - still lie outside. His mortar shell, webbing, gloves, the dusty knot of his gristle, are turned over by a curious youth's trainer. </p> <p>The school's serene calm is punctuated by the indelible smell of fire and the mourning of local mothers. Revenge is part of the vocabulary of grieving here; amid the rubble, there has been talk of war. Zaur Rubayev, 16, stands hunched with four other teenagers, mulling over the loss of his brother, Hassan, 14, in the shade of the school walls. He tells me: \"Of course I want revenge, but against who?\" </p> <p>Anger has grown against the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia, from where some of the terrorists came, and against whom North Ossetia fought a bloody war in 1992. Many fear Beslan's grief could eventually spark conflict in a region as ethnically diverse and tense as the former Yugoslavia. But Rubayev says: \"What's the point of attacking them? We can't go and kill their children.\" </p> <p>Instead, around them are signs of how their grief has been internationalised, appropriated by the various\"wars on terror\" fought worldwide. The Israeli government has sent hundreds of bouquets that now line the walls along the gym. </p> <p>Beslan's scars are rarely far from the surface. Near the gym I meet Diana Gagiyeva and Borik Rubayev, both aged 7. They play together despite the terrible gulf that the siege has created between them. Diana escaped from the gym with her mother, and grins, \"I don't know,\" when asked about her return to school. Borik was dragged from the wreckage by a rescuer whose face he cannot remember. He is clearer on another fact. \"I don't have a father or mother\", he says. \"Well, I did, and he was called Arthur, and she was called Lena, but they both died there.\" He points towards his school. </p> <p>There also remain many gaps in the town's grasp of events. Why did the first bomb detonate, sparking the chaotic storming of the building? Few believe that the government is telling the truth about the number of dead. The local administration says 1,347 people were taken hostage, while the prosecutor insists that only 329 of the 1,156 hostages died. </p> <p>At the Palace of Youth, a rickety, unmaintained theatre hall, a private, local meeting is taking place at 1pm on Wednesday. Outside, bearded, husky men gather in circles. \"Of course the real number of dead is higher than 329 - just look at the number of graves there are\", says one. The unemployed, the grieving and angry, and even the prosecutor and local mayor, pile into the theatre. After a 10-second, respectful silence, some take it in turns to speak. Most talk in soothing truisms. Yet a war veteran from the 92 war against Ingushetia stands, a crutch in place of his missing leg, to interrupt one speech. \"We need revenge. We need to mobilise the youth\", he says. \"We need to get rid of our local president\". </p> <p>Above all, what the people of Beslan crave is answers to the countless questions that followed hard on the heels of the grief and shock. Who were these people who were prepared to turn a school into a charnel house? Why Beslan? Why our school? Why was the siege so catastrophically mismanaged?How on earth did it come to this? </p> <p>It will take months or even years to produce meaningful answers, if it is ever possible to answer adequately such questions. But to try to fill in a few of the unfilled holes in the story of Middle School Number 1, I head east from Beslan, along the sparse highways across Ingushetia, and into the hills of Chechnya where the seeds of Russia's September 11 were planted. To understand the road to Beslan, I follow the road out of it. </p> <p>In the days following the massacre, Beslan's anger focused on neighbouring Ingushetia but the first piece of this bloody puzzle lay uncomfortably close to home. Twenty minutes drive south through barren, green plains and dejected roadside houses is the town of Elkhotovo. It's a sleepy place, an armed policeman guarding a nursery school the only sign of its proximity to the horrors of a few weeks ago. </p> <p>In the leafy courtyard of one Soviet-era housing block is the groundfloor flat where Vladimir Khodov lived. My driver, Timur, knows of Khodov, and takes me straight there. Some time ago, Khodov's brother, Borik, had abducted one of Timur's relatives, Sveta Gabisova. Later, he was killed in revenge by another of Timur's relatives, Sveta's brother, Iriston Gabisov. Yet Vladimir went on to eclipse his brother's parochial notoriety. </p> <p>Khodov is the only North Ossetian who has been identified so far out of the 32 militants who seized the Beslan school. Now his old, starving cat, Dima - sipping a watery-yellow liquid from the cut off-end of a plastic bottle - is the only sign of life at his former flat. Here, his mother, Alexandria, and father, Anatoly lived, their two sons occasionally coming home from prison or elsewhere. </p> <p>When I arrive, neighbour Lyda Darakhokova, 50, is in her garage, busy forcing homegrown cucumbers into large pickling jars ahead of winter. She tells me that Anatoly was a good man, but recalls little about the mother. \"Vladimir was a character,\" she says. \"Both the brothers were underhand and cunning. Vladimir was not an Ossetian,\" she insists, \"he was Russian.\" </p> <p>She says he was converted to the Muslim faith when in jail and left the family home in 2003, coming back only for three days to bury his brother in June. My driver Timur recalls how his mother watched at Borik's funeral while Vladimir burst in. Outraged at the Orthodox Christian funeral, he carried away the corpse to give it a proper Muslim burial and then disappeared again. </p> <p>Vladimir became a wanted man when he set off a bomb in the market of the main city of Vladikavkaz in February, according to locals and media reports. He next appeared in Middle School Number 1. </p> <p>Lyda adds: \"The police took Alexandria away at 5pm on the night of the siege and we have not seen her since. We know nothing about her now.\" </p> <p>I peer through a gap in their flat curtains to see ageing flowers in a vase on the empty flat floor. \"It's hard to understand\", she adds. \"Children?\" </p> <p><b> Crossing the border</b><br> </p> <p>It is 30 minutes' drive east through rows of fallow cornfields and verdant sloping hills to the border with Ingushetia. The frontier is closed to cars - a weak bid to keep putative hordes of vengeful Ossetians out. Yet I manage to cross on foot, walk past the open door of a Russian military armoured personnel carrier (APC) parked at the border post's tranquil roundabout, and then the capital of Nazran is only 10 minutes away in a taxi. </p> <p>Two years ago, Ingushetia was a quiet haven to which Chechens fled to escape the ongoing violence of their shattered homeland. Tent-camp cities of refugees emerged on the border, their inhabitants quickly discovering that the horrors of Chechnya followed them. Moscow has for centuries lumped the Ingush and Chechen people together. Stalin sent them both to Kazakhstan in 1944, considering them an equal threat. Brezhnev eventually allowed them home. After the second Chechen war, Russian officials began to suspect that the Ingush president, Ruslan Aushev, was allowing separatists to shelter in Ingushetia, and installed a former KGB officer, Murat Zyazikov, as president. His hardline regime has attempted to send the refugees home, yet also allowed Russian troops to begin replicating in Ingushetia the brutal tactics of their Chechen campaign. </p> <p>The past year has seen the republic transformed from a quiet farming community into the new frontline in Russia's purported war on terror. It began with occasional disappearances and abductions. Then, four students who were quietly sitting and smoking by a river one March evening, were shot at by a Russian military helicopter. Two of them were killed. Days later, the military surrounded a house where they claimed militants were sheltering, and blew it to pieces with grenades. Tensions rose, and Ingushetia became a more dangerous place to be than neighbouring Chechnya, where a decade-old war still rages. On June 21 at 8pm, up to 200 militants burst into the republic's capital, Nazran, and began murdering local policemen. They easily gained control of the capital and some of its major buildings, setting up checkpoints, where they stopped cars, and shot dead local law-enforcement officials. Up to 100 people died in one night. By all accounts, the well-equipped Russian troops stationed there did little to confront the militants. </p> <p>Now Ingushetia has been reluctantly dragged into the spotlight again. At least three of the Beslan militants lived, or were born in, this tiny, volatile republic, which you can drive across in 20 minutes. I drive north from Nazran to thetown of Sagopshi. For much of this year, Sagopshi has been a peaceful place, though it has been bequeathed a modest infamy by its former resident, Bei-Ala Tsechoyev, 27. </p> <p>Tsechoyev lived on a broad, sparsely populated road here. Some men selling motor parts at the market point me immediately towards his home, and local hospitality soon has me standing in the courtyard of his uncle, Magomed, 70, who fumes at his people's fate. </p> <p>\"I served in the army and was sent to Kazakhstan for 13 years. I worked 24 hours a day for the Soviets. I fought in the 92 war where the Ossetians killed children and pregnant women. Nobody cared then. But now we have the KGB and the FSB all over us. And everybody suddenly cares - but about Beslan. I want to live like a man here and for a woman to be able to live like a woman. Without that, it is better not to live.\" </p> <p>His supposed neighbour goes next door to ask if Tsechoyev's family want to speak, and returns with an emphatic \"No\". A few minutes later, I approach their door myself and the supposed neighbour answers. \"OK, so really I am his brother,\" he admits. \"What do you want?\" </p> <p>At first, Hussein, 25, insists that he has seen his brother since the siege but after a while he softens. \"Look, you are English. Where do you live? England. The [Chechens] are fighting for their independence, too.\" We begin to talk about the supposed influence of foreigners - namely Saudi Arabian Wahhabite extremists - on the Chechen separatist cause. Moscow has long maintained that the independence movement sold out to well-funded Wahhabite groups once the separatist core began to flag in the late-90s. Yet Hussein insists: \"There are no Wahhabites, no Arabs here. We do not need Arabs.\" </p> <p>I ask for a photo of his brother and, now friendly and open, Hussein insists that there are none as Bei-Ala feared the police. \"He was part of an independence movement,\" he says. </p> <p>The media have reported that he fled town before Beslan because locals thought he was a Wahhabite and wanted him dead. As he fled, he reportedly shot a local police chief in the neck, wounding him and making his return impossible. </p> <p>Hussein will not fill in the gaps in his brother's story. No photo, no personal details, no fond memories. It is as if, for Hussein, his brother no longer exists. I ask Hussein where Bei-Ala may be now. He answers: \"Allah knows he is alive.\" I leave a phone number that Bei-Ala never calls, and head for Malgobek, a few kilometres down the road. </p> <p>The involvement of some Ingushetians in Beslan and other terrorist acts has fuelled Russian theories that Islamist extremism has spread across the Caucasus, involving them in a war on terror on their own soil. But across the region, most locals see the extremist violence as a radical extension of the Chechen separatist conflict, not some foreign, imported evil. </p> <p>A local prosecutor confirmed to me media reports that the other Ingush militant was called Isa Torshkhoyev, 26, and that he lived in Malgobek. It takes about an hour to drive up the long and dusty roads, often blocked with cows, to the small village, Stari - or Old - Malgobek. The town's idyllic setting does little to soften its poverty. Media reports have laid much of the blame for Torshkhoyev's extremist fate upon the collapsed economy here. A turner like his father, he could not find work. They reportedly ended up cutting down hay - a car's worth can be sold for \u00a330. Isa's cousin, Kazbek, dug up bricks at an old, disused tile factory, selling them for 6p each. When the money ran out, the Wahabites were reported to often be the only source of income. Some of the bus stops here have Arabic writing on them. </p> <p>Torshkhoyev's mother, Luba, 64, answers the door of her ramshackle cottage, wearing a green headscarf and a pair of cut-down Wellington boots, her toe poking through a hole in the left shoe. She points to the small shed behind her home, now a wreck of bricks, collapsing walls and rusted doors, where her son used to live. </p> <p>In March of last year, Isa welcomed in six friends, apparently fellow Chechen refugees aged 16 to 22. He reportedly asked them for 300 rubles each, but they paid double. At 7.20am on March 5, according to testimony collected by the human rights group, Memorial, local police and Russian troops blocked off the roads to the house and approached the shed. Isa and his friends opened fire. A two-hour gunfight ensued, during which five of Isa's guests were killed, while he and another escaped. One policeman died. </p> <p>The FSB apparently believed that the men were \"boeviki\" - a catch-all word that epitomises the gulf in perceptions in the conflict. It translates directly as \"fighter\", but means to some locals \"separatist fighter\", yet to Russian officials, \"terrorist militant\". </p> <p>Luba says that her son never came back and that her husband and second son went to live in the village. She has nothing to say about him except that he had no friends and was \"a good Muslim boy\". The prosecutor had come to take away his possessions and a blood sample from her to help identify her son, she says. Her husband had been asked to identify a corpse in Beslan and said that it was not their son's.</p>",

  "Tony Blair came to Brighton with one key aim: to prove that his government is fizzing with ideas that will persuade voters to put aside their anger about Iraq and award him a third term in Downing Street. <p>With memories of the 1980s seared in his mind, the prime minister has deliberately modelled this year's conference on the Tories' last gathering before Margaret Thatcher's third electoral triumph in 1987. </p> <p>Where Norman Tebbit transformed Tory fortunes by presiding over the \"next move forward\" conference in 1986, the prime minister hopes that his 10-point plan will convince voters that Labour has still not run out of steam. </p> <p>Downing Street is said to have thought long and hard about whether to devote such a large part of Mr Blair's speech to reciting a series of policies which were mostly not new. There were fears that the policies, most of which were included in the government's summer five-year plan or announced in the run-up to the conference, would be greeted with a collective yawn. </p> <p>Aides eventually decided to go for repetition because, as the latest buzz phrase says, \"boring is the new cool\". </p> <p>One government source said: \"There was a risk the 10 point section would be seen as dry. But we decided it is best to keep going until the media are bored to tears. Voters don't care about obscure new details of policy but they are interested about how their community is policed.\" </p> <p>Policy wonks, who cannot bear the thought of not having a new government initiative to analyse, will have been pleased yesterday when a series of cabinet ministers did announce new ideas. </p> <p>This week's policy announcements in Brighton fit into three categories: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b> The dog-eared policy</b> </p> <p>Parents who were delighted to learn in the summer that Sure Start children's centres will be open from 8am to 6pm may have been surprised when Mr Blair repeated this pledge in his fifth point on Tuesday. This was a vivid example of how No 10 is unabashed about repetitive announcements. The policy was first announced in the education department's five-year plan before the summer recess, only for it to be re-announced a few weeks later when ministers felt that it had been ignored. As he geared up for the conference, Mr Blair announced it again, only for it to pop up again on Tuesday.</p> <p><b> <b>\u00b7</b> The familiar policy</b></p> <p>Other elements in the prime minister's speech, which have been announced in recent weeks, will be familiar to policy wonks but not to many voters who do not scour the inside pages of newspapers every day. An example of this was the prime minister's pledge to provide special help for first time homebuyers, a policy that was trailed at the weekend. </p> <p><b> <b>\u00b7</b> The shiny new policy</b></p> <p>Mr Blair did include brand new policies on law and order, which Downing Street believes will be one of the election's defining issues. In his eighth point he outlined extensions of compulsory drugs tests for offenders, doubling of investment in drug treatment, and electronic border tests by December. The section of his speech on Iraq included a pledge to extend anti-discrimination laws to Muslims and people of other faiths. </p> <p>New policies tumbled from the stage yesterday. David Blunkett, home secretary, announced a major extension of police special branch and of prisons places. Charles Clarke, education secretary, announced plans to shake up schools admissions. </p> <p>Downing Street hopes the energy of this week - if not the substance - would have done Lady Thatcher proud. But there is one mistake they hope not to repeat -making a policy, the poll tax, the centrepiece of the manifesto against the wishes of the chancellor.</p>",
  "Should we trust him? It is, as Tony Blair himself admits, the critical question now. That he has lost trust over the war in Iraq is indisputable. Equally indisputable is that, for now, his party is giving him the benefit of the doubt. The support, though, has come at a price - some significant shifting by the party leader. <p>What's been apparent this week is that for the first time in his 10 years as Labour leader, Blair needs the party more than the party needs him. And so, this week, we have seen a very different Tony Blair. His speech to the conference was, thank God, not the usual vaulting, attitude-striking Tony. Instead of picking a fight with his party, he has been forced to adopt a tone we have never heard from him before. His aides called it \"conversational\". And what is a conversation? Two-sided, that's what.</p> <p>For many of us who opposed the war on Iraq, Blair's sort-of apology was not enough. He did go much further than he has ever done before in admitting mistakes, but to shrug and say: \"Oh well, we're better off without Saddam\" is just not good enough. He didn't apologise for the great blunder of going to war, not against the international terrorist network of al-Qaida, but against Bush's own personal demon of Saddam's Iraq - horrible, but not a threat to us. </p> <p>He declined to address the crucial issue of his relationship with, and uncritical support for, the most rightwing president America has seen for many years. And Blair did his case no favours either by his fundamentalist division of the world into \"us and them\", goodies and baddies. Lumping in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Iraq and many points east into one evil cauldron was a gross over-simplification of world affairs. Talking around the conference afterwards, many people seemed to think that too. </p> <p>Yet, as yesterday's manoeuverings to prevent a conference vote on Iraq showed, there is no real appetite in the party for humiliating Blair further on this issue, and certainly not for ditching him. The reason, and the big unspoken story of this conference, is the power of the trade unions. They may no longer dominate the television coverage, with their block votes and their smoke-filled rooms, but four union leaders are now more influential at the Labour party conference than ever before. </p> <p>With the mergers of so many of the smaller unions into four big giants, Tony Woodley of the Transport Workers, Kevin Curran of the GMB, Dave Prentis of Unison and Derek Simpson of Amicus between them carry 42% of the votes at conference. And they have decided to stick with Blair.</p> <p>They have won concessions. Partly because Blair is so aware that he's lost trust, he has had to turn and appeal directly to the party as a whole, jettisoning the \"new\" through most of his hour-long address, and return to that old, fine notion of plain Labour. For once he spoke about cleaners, dinner ladies and security guards rather than middle England. </p> <p>He offered the trade unions a long list of what the government has done for them, and reasserted the deal done at Warwick. He talked the Labour language of greater equality, and smashing glass ceilings, and he articulated the priorities of ordinary families. He managed not to bang on too much about complex market mechanisms and choice, except to insist it wasn't a Tory word. Instead, we got a meaty list of commitments about 18-week maximum waiting lists and 200 new hospitals, about childcare for a full working day, about equal pay, about more school sport, and about a better deal for pensioners. </p> <p>I can see a big row looming over incapacity benefit, and it isn't clear what he means on pensions, but it sounded like common sense, Labour ambitions - not clever-dick ideology. For most Labour people, Iraq apart, this had not a divisive syllable. It was Blair's gift-horse to the party. The question is: how should the party react? </p> <p>Check out the dentures very carefully is one obvious reply. The speech could simply represent a moment in Blair's era when he happens to feel insecure and beset, a blip during which he thought it politic to be polite. Maybe, following a thumping election victory, he will simply revert to type, and we'll be back to Blair the market radical, openly disdainful of many Labour instincts. Maybe there will be some attempted ideological putsch of Blairite ultras to come. </p> <p>But I don't think so. To reject this gift-horse, curmudgeonly and suspicious, is the wrong response. Better, and shrewder is to take him at his public word. For the truth is that after Iraq, Blair can never quite recover. That little core of wonks, market liberal advisers and clever-dicks is now too fragile and uncertain to control the rest of the rocket. They are scattering, to Brussels and private-sector enrichment. </p> <p>Blair, left behind, really does need the solid instincts and power of the labour movement to win seriously well again. He knows it. So did the people in the hall. So the balance of power has shifted away from the ultra-modernising clique in favour of the real Labour middle-ground - all those decent, progressive, unshowy people who have been getting on with trying to drive forward equal pay, childcare, a better pensions deal. </p> <p>The likeliest outcome at the next election, everyone agrees, is a Labour majority, but a much smaller one than Blair enjoys now. Because many of the ultra-Blairite loyalists are in seats which are likely to be lost, the back-Blair-at-any-price section of the PLP will be even more reduced. By erosion, the party is going to get its government back. By force of gravity and time, the abnormal landslide politics of the past seven years, which gave No 10 such leeway, are going to settle down. </p> <p>Those who argue that, really, there's no difference between Blair and Brown, are wrong. We know that their basic political instincts are different, and that Blair is far more comfortable in the world of consumerism and private enrichment than is the chancellor. Brown believes in the power of the state to reshape millions of lives; Blair says he does but, with his market instincts, never seems quite to believe it. And that is a real difference. So those tensions aren't going to disappear. Nor are the personal suspicions. </p> <p>But the idea that the Labour party can simply be captured and, like a huge dumb robot, have its wiring altered and be sent in a completely different direction for ever... that idea, so widely believed for so many years, has died this week. So, too, has the idea nurtured by some that Gordon Brown could be despatched to the history books. In the end, whether the Labour government is led by Blair, Brown or anyone else, is therefore now going to matter a bit less (though we can all have our prejudices).</p> <p>What matters is that the party remembers the tone and promises made here this week. They have chosen to trust Blair. The voters, of course, may see it differently, but that is the gamble the party has chosen to take. Now they have to make him keep his promises. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "After months of exchanging insults from a distance, George Bush and John Kerry will finally face each other tonight in a debate that is likely to be the challenger's best chance to turn the election around before the November 2 poll. <p>The debate, at the University of Miami, is the first of three, but it will have the biggest audience - up to 50 million Americans - and it deals with the issue at the heart of this presidential election: national security, Iraq and the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>Senator Kerry enters the 90-minute debate having consistently trailed in the polls for the past month, and is currently behind by about half a dozen percentage points. Democrats complain he has allowed the White House to define him - as a wavering, uncertain leader - and that he, in turn, has failed to define a president who continues to project steadfast resolve in the minds of a majority of Americans. </p> <p>The Miami debate will be Mr Kerry's best, and possibly final, opportunity to turn the tables on his opponent on the issue that matters most. </p> <p>\"This debate is by far and away the most important,\" said Thomas Steinfatt, a University of Miami communications professor, adding that the White House could even try to pull out of the next two encounters if it did not go well. </p> <p>The Bush camp has already hinted it might do that if television companies stray from the rigid rules on coverage, banning shots of one candidate reacting to the others remarks. </p> <p>\"Kerry certainly can't lose this one,\" Prof Steinfatt said. \"If the polls after two days showed that Bush has extended his lead, I would say Kerry was done.\" </p> <p>The second debate, in St Louis on Friday week, will be a less-focused \"town meeting\" encounter with questions on a wide variety of subjects from an invited audience. The final debate, the week after, will dwell on the economy and domestic issues. These have been displaced from centre stage by the bloodshed in Iraq and the ever-present fear of another terrorist attack. </p> <p>Both candidates are arguably unbeaten in head-to-head debates, but they enter the chamber tonight with vulnerabilities. </p> <p>The Massachusetts senator faces a particularly tough challenge. While President Bush just has to stay the same - stick to his message and avoid being knocked off balance - Mr Kerry has to change. </p> <p>\"He tends to be long-winded. As a TV persona he's a bit stiff and formal and it doesn't work well,\" said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor and the author of Presidential Debates: 40 Years of High-Risk TV. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has a deserved reputation for sentences tangled with parenthetical asides which have helped the Bush campaign paint him as a waffler. A comic radio sketch this week had his campaign aides inflicting an electric shock on the candidate each time he used a subordinate clause, until he finally spat out a declarative sentence. </p> <p>But the senator also a reputation for sharpening his game, and his vocabulary, in the last weeks of a campaign when his back is against the wall. He did it in 1996, when he was in danger of losing his Senate seat to a sharp-witted Republican, William Weld. </p> <p>Over the course of a marathon eight debates, Mr Kerry asserted himself, proving himself most effective when put on the spot. </p> <p>At one point Mr Weld challenged him on his opposition to the death penalty and pointed to the mother of a murdered policeman, asking the senator if he thought the murderer's life was worth more than his victim's. </p> <p>\"I know something about killing,\" Mr Kerry responded, in a characteristic reference to his Vietnam days. \"I don't like killing. I don't think a state honours life by turning around and sanctioning killing.\" </p> <p>\"Kerry is a master of the fine art of changing the subject,\" Mr Weld said recently. \"By the time he finished, everyone had forgotten what the question was.\" </p> <p>Jeff Shesol, a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, agreed that Mr Kerry's verbosity was being overplayed. \"He's not going to fall into sort of meanderings he makes in a speech. He's less likely to do that in a debate format. He seems to have a real understanding of what that format requires.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush has also shown he is aware of what is expected of him. In past debates he has stuck with unerring discipline to his talking points and shown himself capable of projecting his \"regular guy\" image through the staged formality of such events to the studio and television audiences. </p> <p>But in the past he has always been the underdog, famous for his mangled use of English, and has successfully lowered expectations so he could beat them. His aides have attempted to do the same this year, even describing Mr Kerry as \"better than Cicero\", but it has not worked. </p> <p>A Gallup poll this week showed that 44% of Americans expect the president to win , compared with 32% for Mr Kerry. </p> <p>After four years in office, Mr Bush can no longer convincingly play the role of newcomer, and will have a record to defend. The president has been rattled before, most memorably when Senator John McCain attacked his campaign tactics in the 2000 Republican primary. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's background as a courtroom prosecutor could help him capitalise on that potential vulnerability. But the groundrules, hammered out over weeks of negotiation, help the incumbent. Neither candidate is allowed to ask the other a direct question. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest challenge both men will face tonight is overcoming the sheer weight of all their preparations. \"You want your candidate to be prepared but you also want him to be loose, and those two objectives are often at odds,\" Mr Shesol said. </p> <p>\"There's a danger of being so heavily coached that you're just trying to remember your lines rather than responding to the moment. You've got to be nimble, and you've got to listen.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b> September 1960</b> Richard Nixon v John F Kennedy: Nixon refused make-up. Kennedy's delivery was smooth and charismatic.

  "The mayor of Pitcairn Island was the first of seven men accused of sex abuse to stand trial yesterday as the historic case got under way in the Pacific outpost. <p>Steve Christian, a 53-year-old descendant of the Bounty mutineer Fletcher Christian, used his power as the \"leader of the pack\" on the island to rape and indecently assault girls as young as 12, prosecutors told the court. </p> <p>Mr Christian is accused of raping two women when they were girls and having consensual sex with under-age females. His son Randy is also accused of involvement in the alleged abuse, which stretches back over 40 years. </p> <p>In total, the seven have been charged with 31 counts of rape and other counts of indecent assault, gross indecency on a child, and unlawful sexual intercourse. </p> <p>The trial is only the second to have taken place under British law in the 214-year history of Pitcairn, an island halfway between New Zealand and Chile. </p> <p>Simon Moore, the New Zealand prosecutor in the case, said the defendant had displayed a \"callous and cavalier\" attitude to his victims. </p> <p>\"He [Steve Christian] is very much the leader and central figure of this small community,\" said Mr Moore. </p> <p>\"Even as a teenager, Steve Christian was a prominent and influential figure within his peer group. He was the leader of the pack. It was as if the accused was exercising some right which he believed to be his.\" </p> <p>Christian was 15 when he was alleged to have raped a 12-year-old as two other boys held her down amid some banyan trees, the court was told. </p> <p>Others accused include the mayor's father-in-law, Len Brown, 75, and brother-in-law Dave Brown, 46. Len Brown's nephew Jay Warren, 45, is also among those charged. </p> <p>A suppression order on their names was lifted by one of three New Zealand judges appointed to the court of Pitcairn to try the cases. </p> <p>The trial has split Pitcairn's population of 47. </p> <p>The community is entirely drawn from four families - the Christian and Warren clans are descended from mutineers from the Bounty, while the Youngs and the Browns trace themselves back to sailors washed up on the islands in the 19th century. </p> <p>The seven accused constitute almost half the able-bodied men on the island, and convictions would take away many members of longboat crews that bring essential supplies to Pitcairn, causing some to wonder whether the community would remain viable. </p> <p>The case blew up when an islander told a British policewoman she had been sexually abused. But on Tuesday, a group of women islanders said the claims had been blown out of proportion. </p> <p>\"There's never been a rape on the island,\" said one resident, Carol Warren, on New Zealand television. \"I was one of them, I had sex at 12. I went in fully knowing what I was doing and I wasn't forced.\" </p> <p>Mr Christian's sister Brenda, 50, has been sworn in as a court officer. She is Pitcairn's resident police officer. </p> <p>Six other non-resident Pitcairn men have been charged but will have to be extradited to the island before they can face trial. </p> <p>The names of the eight complainants, who will be testifying via video link from Auckland, will be withheld. </p> <p>The New Zealand defence team served notice yesterday that they would continue to challenge Britain's jurisdiction over Pitcairn and the legitimacy of the trials. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Part of this report was compiled from a pooled dispatch from Pitcairn Island</p>",
  "Parents whose children were killed by guns have called on the internet auction site eBay to change its policy on firearms sales. Campaigners are afraid that unscrupulous sellers are using the site to get around gun laws. <p>Although eBay says it does not deal in firearms, its customers have been invited to bid for empty boxes or gun mountings and have received air pistols as a \"free gift\". Deactivated guns - and the equipment and handbooks needed to reactivate them - have been offered in separate sales. </p> <p>At a fringe meeting at the Labour party conference in Brighton yesterday, Stephen McCabe, MP for Birmingham Hall Green, brandished a pistol to show how easy it was to buy guns. </p> <p>He called on eBay to honour its stated policy of not dealing in firearms. \"They should not be trading in this seedy business at all. It does nothing for eBay's reputation,\" he said. \"A company making the money eBay are making could afford to properly monitor the site.\" </p> <p>Mr McCabe produced a .22 air pistol he had received at a service station after paying \u00a380 for two gun mountings. He said that while what eBay was doing was not illegal, it had no way to ensure that those buying such weapons were over the age limit of 17. </p> <p>The MP was joined by parents whose children have been killed by guns. </p> <p>Jayne Atkinson's 13-year-old son George was accidentally shot dead with an air rifle by his 11-year-old cousin as they played with the weapon five years ago. </p> <p>Holding the pistol, she said: \"This gun makes me feel sick to the pit of my stomach. My son was killed with a weapon of the same calibre. </p> <p>\"These guns are accessible to young children and we as adults should keep our children safe. This is another way that people can get hold of guns. No one is doing anything about it.\" </p> <p>Linda Mitchell, a fellow campaigner from the Gun Control Network, said she had tracked 51 weapons on eBay in a single day. She compiled a dossier of her findings and reported them to eBay, but it seemed a lottery whether or not they were removed from sale. </p> <p>Among the weapons for sale was a Czech CZ75 pistol priced at \u00a3650 which campaigners feared was a working firearm. It was removed from sale after 24 hours when eBay was warned. </p> <p>But Mick North, whose daughter Sophie died in the Dunblane massacre, said 24 hours was long enough for a private sale to be arranged. </p> <p>He said greater vigilance was needed by eBay to stop sellers offering potentially lethal weapons on the site. \"There is not always sufficient control in gun shops but at least there is a shopkeeper there.\" </p> <p>Mr McCabe said he had raised the issue with the Home Office, which was looking into the matter. </p> <p>Michael Yardley, a spokesman for the Shooting Sports Trust, said Mr McCabe's claims were misleading. </p> <p>\"An air pistol is obviously not the first choice of criminals,\" he said. \"He was referring to that air pistol as being lethal, but in any meaningful sense of the word an air pistol is a fairly low-powered weapon.\" </p> <p>He said the real problem in the UK was the use of dedicated firearms by criminals. </p> <p><b>Buy, buy, buy ... </b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In February 2001, a US student sold his soul on eBay for $400 (\u00a3222).

  "<p>The heads of Capital Radio and GWR vowed to make their partnership work yesterday after proposing a \u00a3711m merger that will split leadership of the combined group between the two executives. </p> <p>Ralph Bernard, executive chairman of GWR, will take the same role in the new company. Capital Radio's David Mansfield will retain his job as chief executive. </p> <p>The experienced radio executives will run the most powerful commercial radio group seen in the UK if the merger is cleared by shareholders and regulators. The combined group will own one national analogue station - GWR's Classic FM - and 55 local analogue stations, including Capital's Capital FM and BRMB in Birmingham. </p> <p>Mr Bernard said the division of executive responsibilities was the first topic of discussion when merger talks began in earnest. </p> <p>Hinting at the chaotic outcome of the Carlton and Granada merger last year, when Michael Green was ousted as chairman designate of ITV by investors, he said the boards of both companies also insisted on clarifying the executive roles. </p> <p>\"From the outset David and I said that this was only going to work if we could agree on the rules for each other because we were not prepared to go into the sort of argument we have seen in other mergers. That was an instruction from our boards as well,\" added Mr Bernard. </p> <p>Both executives yesterday stressed they would have separate lines of responsibility within the merged group. Mr Bernard will oversee digital strategy, regulatory affairs and management of the board. Mr Mansfield will take charge of meshing the companies together, nurturing brands such as Classic FM and running the operational side of the combined group. </p> <p>\"If Ralph and I can't work together, the business won't work,\" said Mr Mansfield. </p> <p>GWR announced one surprise executive move yesterday with the resignation of Roger Lewis, managing director of Classic FM and a GWR director. GWR said his departure was not related to the merger announcement. </p> <p>The proposed executive line-up met shareholder approval yesterday. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, a 29.9% shareholder in GWR, has given its blessing to the deal and the management structure. It will hold 14.5% of the group and a seat on the board once the merger is completed. \"They have given their full support and have pledged to remain as shareholders for the foreseeable future. I don't think you could ask for much more,\" said Mr Bernard. </p> <p>Capital Radio and GWR have yet to hold formal meetings with institutional shareholders about the deal but investors have been canvassed informally. One institutional shareholder in GWR yesterday said it was \"happy\" with the transaction and had no concerns about the dual leadership of the company. Another said: \"In principle, the ideal would be to have an independent chairman but we recognise the special circumstances in this case.\" </p> <p>Fidelity, the fund manager that played a pivotal role in Michael Green's removal, will be the second largest shareholder in the new group as the owner of 13% of GWR and 8.7% of Capital Radio. </p> <p>Capital Radio shareholders will own 52% of the combined group, with GWR taking 48% in a nil-premium merger. The weighting is in favour of Capital Radio investors because their company has a slightly higher stock market capitalisation than GWR's - \u00a3367m against \u00a3344m when merger talks were confirmed last week. Shares in both companies dropped on the merger announcement, with GWR falling 8.7% to 249p and Capital slipping 3.8% to 416p, re ducing the value of the deal to \u00a3683m. The radio groups also released cautious trading statements. Capital said it expected full-year revenues to climb 4%, while GWR said first-half turnover would rise 3%. </p> <p>Wendy Pallot, finance director of GWR, who will retain her role at the new group, said the companies had earmarked \u00a37.5m in savings from the deal, with about 100 jobs expected to be lost from a combined workforce of 1,540. </p> <p>Mr Mansfield said the new group would have a competitive advantage over rivals which had yet to take advantage of the Communications Act ushering in changes to radio ownership rules that made yesterday's announcement possible. </p> <p>The combined group will reach 18 million listeners and control just under 40% of the national radio advertising market with an annual turnover of about \u00a3240m. </p> <p><strong>Making waves: the road to merger</strong> </p> <p>Capital Radio </p> <p><strong> 1973</strong> Capital Radio launched </p> <p><strong> 1996</strong> Started Wildstar record label in joint venture with Telstar Records </p> <p><strong> 2000</strong> Finalised acquisition of Border Television, adding three radio stations to portfolio </p> <p><strong> 2001</strong> Sold the Border ITV licence to Granada in July </p> <p><strong> 2001</strong> Bought a 19% share in Choice FM </p> <p><strong> 2004</strong> Bought remaining 81% </p> <p>GWR </p> <p><strong>1982</strong> Began life as a single commercial radio station </p> <p><strong> 1985</strong> Wiltshire Radio joined Radio West to form GWR </p> <p><strong> 1989</strong> Merged with Consolidated Radio Holdings </p> <p><strong> 1991</strong> Ran consortium that successfully applied for national licence for Classic FM </p> <p><strong> 1996</strong> Took control of Classic FM by buying remaining 83% </p> <p><strong> 1999</strong> Bought Orchard Media </p> <p><strong> 2000</strong> Acquired DMG Radio from Daily Mail &amp; General Trust</p>",
  "The Gaza Strip was bracing itself for an Israeli military assault last night after a Hamas rocket attack on an Israeli town killed two children, one an infant. <p>Ariel Sharon vowed to respond \"with severity\" to the attack on the town of Sderot, which wounded another 20 people, some of them children. Late last night, missiles ploughed into the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing two Palestinians, one a policeman. </p> <p>Hours earlier a large Israeli force sent to reoccupy the Gaza camp to prevent rocket attacks killed two Palestinian schoolboys. Another boy was shot dead by soldiers near a Jewish settlement. </p> <p>The police said the Hamas rocket hit a house, killing the two children - Dorit Aniso, two, and four-year-old Yuval Abebeh. </p> <p>Another rocket hit a Jewish settlement in Gaza, lightly wounding a Palestinian worker. Sderot residents gathered near the area, some chanting \"Death to Arabs.\" </p> <p>A resident, Ronen Edri, told the newspaper Ha'aretz that he had seen a boy with head wounds lying in the street and tried to give him first aid. \"There was a great deal of hysteria all around. People were screaming from shock. I tried to stem the bleeding for the boy, and then [ambulance] personnel arrived and took him away.\" </p> <p>Another neighbour, Haviv Ben Abbo, also tried to assist the children. \"I saw one child without his legs. We tried to help the other one but it was too late,\" he said. The attack was launched even though the army had sent dozens of tanks, bulldozers and armoured vehicles to seize control of Jabaliya refugee camp in an attempt to stop Palestinian insurgents firing their rudimentary rockets, known as Qassams, into Israel. </p> <p>The army said it met stiff resistance in the camp, a stronghold of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, from Palestinian insurgents throwing grenades, shooting, and planting explosives. </p> <p>But two of the three people killed were 14-year-old schoolboys, apparently shot as they threw stones at the tanks. </p> <p>The deaths in Sderot, particularly coming at the beginning of a Jewish religious holiday, put further pressure on Mr Sharon to confront Palestinian insurgents before he forces Jewish settlers to leave the Gaza Strip next year. </p> <p>The mayor of Sderot, Eli Muyal, has said that if European countries faced similar attacks, Palestinian towns \"would have been wiped out off the face of the earth\". </p> <p>The prime minister called Mr Muyal to assure him that the government would respond with severity to the attack, according to Israel radio. </p> <p>The army has made a dozen incursions into the northern Gaza Strip in the past three months, occupying Beit Hanoun for a month. But mortar assaults on Sderot and the settlements have only intensified. </p> <p>The Israeli army fired several shells and rockets into Jabaliya, and bulldozers destroyed buildings. Gunfire was heard for much of the day. Palestinian sources named the two boys killed in the camp as Saed Muhammad Abu al-Eish and Ahmad Abdul Fattah Madi and said they were throwing stones when they were killed. The army said soldiers shot Palestinians planting explosives or attempting to fire rockets. </p> <p>Doctors said that nearly 20 people were taken to hospital with gunshot wounds, at least seven of them children in school uniform. </p> <p>Hassan Khalil, 15, who was slightly wounded in his hand, said: \"They shot at us before we could even throw the stones. </p> <p>\"The resistance couldn't stop the tanks so we know the stones won't either. But we want the Jews to know that we will not just lie down.\" </p> <p>The army killed a Hamas fighter on the edge of the camp, and in central Gaza shot dead a 13-year-old, Mohammed Jabber, who it said had emerged from a stone-throwing crowd which had entered a forbidden zone next to the Netzarim Jewish settlement and run towards the fence. Several other children were wounded by its gunfire. </p> <p>In a similar incident near Kfar Darom settlement, the army wounded four students. In the West Bank, it killed two Palestinian gunmen in raids on Nablus and Jenin. A third died when his car crashed as he fled. </p> <p>Hamas said it made the latest rocket attack on Sderot to mark the fourth anniversary of the intifada, which has cost more than 3,000 Palestinian and nearly 1,000 Israeli lives.</p>",
  "Rarely have delegates to a party conference had such potential to influence the course of history as they do today. In Labour's debate on the occupation of Iraq, the party will confront the biggest question facing the country: will Britain continue to follow the lead of President Bush, or will it change course and help to give the Iraqi people the chance to determine their own future? Ominously for the prospects of Labour and the government - as well as for the future of Iraq - it looks likely that delegates will vote to back the continued bloody occupation of the land of my birth to save the prime minister's political skin. <p>There are now two Iraq wars: the first is being fought with helicopter gunships and cluster bombs along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates; the second is being fought here in Britain and in the pre-election US. This is a propaganda war in which the hundreds of Iraqis killed every week by US bombardment fail to make the headlines, while the horrifying images provided by a Jordanian kidnapper and killer of British and US contractors is portrayed as the true face of Iraqi resistance. Thus the real human suffering, and the reality of the widespread resistance to occupation, is hidden from view, while bombing what US generals call Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's \"supporters' hideouts\" is portrayed as a necessity. And so Falluja, a besieged city of 300,000 people, is under daily aerial attack, and parts of Sadr City, the poorest neighbourhood of Baghdad, are being reduced to rubble. Many towns and villages across Iraq are encircled, and thousands of people arrested to crush popular resistance to occupation. </p> <p>The vast majority of Iraqis reject Zarqawi and his ilk - as do the resistance and its supporters in Falluja, Sadr City and across Iraq. Many even suspect that the occupation forces are somehow encouraging the likes of Zarqawi, or at least failing to prevent their crimes, as a way of obscuring the fact that most Iraqis now actively support a patriotic and widespread resistance movement. </p> <p> The occupation forces have admitted that the attacks on them by the resistance rose last month to 2,700. And how many of these 2,700 attacks a month were claimed by Zarqawi? Six. Six headline-grabbing, TV-dominating, stomach-churning moments. </p> <p>Just as Iraq's 25 million people were reduced, in the public's mind, to the threat from weapons of mass destruction, ready to be unleashed within 45 minutes, the resistance is now being reduced to a single hoodlum. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the name of building democracy, the Iraqi people's democratic rights have been crushed. Instead of an elected constitutional assembly we have a CIA-appointed puppet government. Trade union leaders have been detained by the occupation forces and their offices destroyed. The US proconsul Paul Bremer, and later the US-appointed Ayad Allawi regime, have reintroduced a 1987 law of Saddam's banning strikes in the state sector. </p> <p>Iraqi workers are nevertheless fighting back. Last month the Southern Oil Company Union staged a successful strike to halt oil exports and help force the US to lift its bombardment of Najaf. But Labour's conference will hear little or nothing of this, whether from Tony Blair and his ministers or from pro-occupation Iraqis masquerading as supporters of free trade unionism and self-determination in Iraq. </p> <p>Such insidious misrepresentation of reality helps keep people of conscience in Britain and the US from having sleepless nights about the children daily killed in their name or the trade unionists hounded by Saddamist torturers enlisted by the occupation. </p> <p>One might regret this \"collateral damage\", the government argues, but it is all in a good cause: fighting not against the Iraqi people, but to save them from Zarqawi. </p> <p>Britain is morally and politically responsible for the current US bombardment of Iraqi cities. Indeed, Britain's role in the war is now politically decisive. The announcement of a phased British withdrawal, to be completed by the end of the year, would be the desperately needed move to force President Bush to change direction. </p> <p>The impact of such a decision on the US public would be huge. Blair, speaking on behalf of the British people, played a key role in helping Bush dupe America about WMD. Were that support withdrawn, Bush would either have to change direction or risk losing the election. The impact on Democrat candidate Kerry's campaign would surely be no less dramatic, forcing him to accept that the Iraqi people's struggle for freedom is unstoppable. Once free, the Iraqi people would certainly sweep away Zarqawi's tiny gang, who appear to have little trouble slipping in and out of Iraq under the occupation regime. </p> <p>Labour delegates have it in their gift today to hold their leaders to account and uphold the cause of peace and self-determination. If they fail to seize that chance, we are all likely to pay the price. </p> <p>\u00b7 Sami Ramadani was a political refugee from Saddam Hussein's regime and is a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk\">sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<b> Daily Telegraph </b> <br> Editorial, September 29 <p> \"Tony Blair's conference speech ... his 10th as leader of the Labour party, demonstrated why he is still the political conjuror of the day. Nobody else would have persuaded the party of Attlee, Bevan and Gordon Brown to applaud 'the opportunity society, as opposed to the old welfare state'. Nobody else would have induced so hostile an audience to give him the benefit of the doubt on Iraq. Nobody else would have confided in the country about the existential choices that he, as prime minister, has had to make in the war on terror ... </p> <p>\"Michael Howard will have to face his first Tory conference as leader with Mr Blair once again firmly in the saddle. [Tuesday's] prime ministerial performance will be a hard act to follow, unless Mr Howard can deliver a speech that is not an act at all, but an honest attempt to address the real issues that keep 'hard-working families' awake at night.\" </p> <p><b> Times </b><br>Editorial, September 29  </p> <p> \"Winston Churchill once expressed disappointment with a pudding because it 'had no theme'. The same could be said of the prime minister's address to the Labour party conference. In previous such speeches, Mr Blair has succeeded in combining the details of domestic policy with a grand overview of the international situation. He did not, in truth, manage to do that [on Tuesday] ... There was material there for the uncommitted elector, notably the 10-point list of what Labour would do if returned to office, but that appeared secondary to his desire to engage with his party and mobilise his own troops for the general election contest ahead ...</p> <p>\"Having spoken to his party in an intimate fashion, Mr Blair needs to find his stronger voice once again. The policies that he outlined have merit but, for the moment at least, they look more like a collection of worthy ideas than a compelling programme. The whole, not unlike the prime minister's speech overall, is less convincing than the sum of the parts. Mr Blair will need a stronger message before embarking on the hustings. He cannot rely on his ramshackle opponents for assistance for ever.\" </p> <p><b> Independent </b><br> Editorial, September 29  </p> <p> \"The extent to which Mr Blair is still handicapped, and has handicapped his party, by supporting military action in Iraq was evident from the protests in the hall and the discomfort of many of in his audience. Iraq also accounted for the section of his speech that was strongest on conviction and rhetoric, while at the same time, politically and logically, the weakest. </p> <p>\"That Mr Blair decided to address the controversy over Iraq 'head-on' was courageous, even if, after Peter Hain was forced to retract his description of the issue as 'trivial', he had precious little choice. The terms in which he did it, though, were as evasive and manipulative as ever, and as irresponsibly heedless of the current reality in Iraq. Time and again, Mr Blair falsified the terms of the debate. He said he could apologise for the information (about Iraq's weapons) that turned out to be wrong, 'but I can't sincerely apologise for removing Saddam'. So why was it that this country went to war? ...</p> <p>\"Mr Blair's surprisingly muted address offered a mostly realistic appraisal of what Labour has to do to win a third term. Iraq was the conspicuous exception. It may also be the one on which the next election turns.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Mail </b><br> Editorial, September 29  </p> <p> \"In the real world, two more British soldiers lie dead. In the real world, Kenneth Bigley lives in torment from minute to minute, never knowing when or if he will be killed ...</p> <p>\"Only a politician of genius - and in his communication skills, Mr Blair comes close - could give Labour's faithful something to cheer in such circumstances. It is a tribute to those skills that his ovation was (mostly) unfeigned. But the operative word here is 'performance'. This wasn't a man speaking from the heart - as Gordon Brown did so passionately on Monday - but a brilliant actor (arguably the greatest actor-politician of our time) pressing the right buttons: now a pregnant pause, now an admission of human frailty, now the faux humility of 'I only know what I believe'. And it was just enough. For now ...</p> <p>\"But once the applause has died away, what will be most remembered about this speech is its threadbare content, its shameless disregard for truth and the chasm it reveals between the prime minister's rhetoric and reality.\" </p> <p><b> Sun </b><br> Editorial, September 29  </p> <p> \"Mr Blair told his party he wanted to deal with the Iraq issue head-on. And he did just that in a forceful manner. Mr Blair didn't flinch from uncomfortable truths - like his evidence that Saddam Hussein had WMD being wrong.

The world is a better place with him in prison.\" </p> <p><b> Paul Routledge </b><br> Daily Mirror, September 29  </p> <p> \"The lines of the election war debate are now clearly visible. The prime minister insists the invasion was right because 'the decision was taken genuinely'. This is emotional fraud. It requires total abdication of judgment. We must love Tony because he believes he is doing the right thing ... Sphericals. I cannot trust a politician who shuffles the facts like a greasy pack of cards ... </p> <p>\"This was the speech of a prime minister besotted with emotion, image and presentation. There was something grotesque about the prolonged applause, led by Cherie Blair, before the conquering hero even got to the rostrum. Once there, he performed as if victory is in the bag. It will take more than syrupy oratory to achieve that.\" </p> <p><b> Scotsman </b><br> Editorial, September 29  </p> <p> \"The bigger questions pertain to the inner paradoxes of Blairism, with which this speech was riddled. For example, there were fine rhetorical invocations of unity through 'the British people voting for change'.

If you talk up the rights of the individual to make choices, you must also allow them to make choices with which you might disagree. English foxhunters have spotted this flaw in Blairism ...</p> <p>\"In ever increasing areas of life, people are faced with an invading state, whether through obsessive petty regulation or through the relentless, incoming tide of EU directives in business and employment law.

  "Lord Falconer, the secretary of state for constitutional affairs, will make a manifesto commitment today to reform the Lords which goes beyond the abolition of the remaining 92 hereditary peers. <p>He will also accept, probably outside the conference hall, that there is growing agreement on a form of indirect election - also known as the secondary mandate - in which the majority of the second chamber would be chosen in proportion to how the electorate voted regionally at the general election. </p> <p>After years of impasse on Lords' reform, Lord Falconer is convinced that legislation must be passed early in the next parliament if it is to succeed. </p> <p>He believes the secondary mandate, recently championed by the singer Billy Bragg, is the best chance of restoring momentum to reform. </p> <p>Up to 80% of the second chamber could be drawn from lists framed by the political parties, and the rest appointed by a statutory independent commission. </p> <p>Lord Falconer will not say today how the peers should be selected, but his speech will mark the end of a period in which Downing Street appeared to have settled for the abolition of the hereditaries, leaving the second chamber entirely the creature of patronage. </p> <p>He will emphasise that he is not seeking to reduce the powers of the Lords to revise or even block legislation, but will say the Lords should be barred from in effect wrecking bills by refusing to set down the length of time that legislation is discussed. </p> <p>He is also expected to praise the government's plans to introduce freedom of information procedures throughout Whitehall next year. </p> <p>The government's argument is that it has tried to settle the issue of Lords' reform by a policy route, including royal commissions and white papers. It has tried a parliamentary route, but no single proposal for an elected second chamber found favour with MPs. </p> <p>The only remaining option is the political route of making a clear proposal in the election manifesto. </p> <p>Speaking at a conference fringe meeting yesterday Bragg said his proposals would retain the primacy of the House of Commons, but also lend greater legitimacy to the Lords. </p> <p>He said his system of a Lords selected in direct proportion to the votes cast in each region for the parties in a general election was a form of direct democracy. </p> <p>The proposal would also increase the turnout, he said, since voters would know their vote would never be wasted, because it would have an impact on the composition of the Lords. </p> <p>Bragg was supported by the Labour MP Graham Allen, who has supported Lords reform for many years. </p> <p>But Robin Cook, a former leader of the Commons, said he would seek to amend any bill tabled by Lord Falconer after the general election to provide for direct elections to the second chamber. </p> <p>He said Bragg's proposals might discourage tactical voting by Liberal Democrats determined to keep the Tories out, since they would know that if they voted Liberal Democrat their vote would have an impact on the composition of the second chamber.</p>",
  "<p>The International Monetary Fund last night issued a double warning on the UK economy, urging house buyers to beware a sharp fall in property prices and predicting that higher taxes may be needed to plug the hole in the government's budget deficit.</p> <p>Just two days after Gordon Brown boasted of Labour's record on the economy at the party's conference in Brighton, the IMF provided a more sombre view in its half-yearly health check of global economic trends. </p> <p>It told potential house-hunters to \"exercise particular caution\" and added to speculation that taxes may rise after the next election when it expressed doubts that Labour could finance its spending plans without putting its \"golden rule\" in jeopardy. </p> <p>Mr Brown has shrugged off fears that the housing boom of the past few years will be followed by a fall in prices of up to 30% and insisted this week that he would not surrender his reputation for prudence. </p> <p>The IMF said the expected improvement in the public finances as a result of the 3.4% growth in the economy this year would not be enough to restore the public finances to good health. \"Following the large increase in the fiscal deficit in recent years, some consolidation is expected in 2004, mainly reflecting higher revenues. In 2005 and beyond, stronger fiscal consolidation than presently seems in prospect would be desirable, both from a cyclical perspective and to reduce the risk of a breach in the golden rule in the future.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown's self-imposed golden rule states that over the course of an entire economic cycle - which may be several years in length - the government should only borrow in order to invest in long-term investment projects. While borrowing to fund the annual running costs of government is allowed in particularly tough years, this is supposed to be at least balanced by running surpluses in good years. </p> <p>The IMF's warning comes after similar judgments from the UK's leading experts on tax and spending - the Institute for Fiscal Studies - and by a number of City firms. Oliver Letwin, the shadow chancellor, has said that the consequences of \"big government\" will be higher taxes if Labour wins a third term. </p> <p>In its world economic outlook, the IMF reiterated its fear that the UK's strong economic performance could be tarnished by a steep fall in house prices and stressed that buyers should take special care. </p> <p>\"Despite higher oil prices, private consumption remains strong, underpinned by sustained income growth and rising housing wealth; private investment has turned up; and government expenditures have continued to support domestic demand.\" </p> <p>The IMF expects UK growth of 3.4% this year and 2.5% next, both 0.1 points lower than it was forecasting in the spring. \"The central risk remains an abrupt adjustment in the housing market, where - despite signs of cooling in recent months - prices still appear higher than can be explained by developments in fundamentals.\" It added: \"With interest rates on a rising trend, and most house purchases fi nanced with adjustable rate mortgages, house buyers should exercise particular caution at the present juncture.\" </p> <p>While some in the City believe that interest rates may have peaked at 4.75%, the IMF said that further tightening of monetary policy would be needed to keep inflation in check. \"While inflation remains low, the economy is now running at close to capacity and cost pressures are increasing; the Bank of England has appropriately raised interest rates five times since November 2003 and a continued 'early but gradual' approach appears desirable.\"</p>",
  "All politics may be local, but a parliamentary byelection is inevitably both a local and a national event at the same time. Today's Hartlepool contest embodies that double identity as few recent byelections have done, not least because of the exceptional profile of the man whose departure from parliament has caused it. But it is not Peter Mandelson's shadow which hangs over today's election as much as those of Tony Blair and the Iraq war. This byelection does not belong to Hartlepool alone. It also belongs to us. <p>A byelection is not a general election. It is not an occasion for selecting a government or for deciding a programme for a parliament. It does not even decide the fate of a government or its leader. Nor should it do so on this occasion. At its most basic, a byelection is simply an occasion to bring the parliamentary numbers up to strength. Labour's already massive majority will not be affected by the result tonight. But a byelection is also an opportunity for sending a modest but sharp message to the existing political establishment. That is the particular opportunity that has fallen to the voters of Hartlepool to deliver on our behalf today. </p> <p>Members of parliament always have two responsibilities. Their first responsibility is to represent their constituents. But their second is to hold the government of the day to account for its plans and actions. Since 2001, MPs have too often failed in that task. True, theirs is part of a wider failure. Britain's traditional institutions of scrutiny and accountability - parliament, cabinet government, the civil service, select committees, the law, public inquiries - were all found wanting both before and after the Iraq war. </p> <p>But MPs bear a particular responsibility. Their essential collective purpose is to control the executive. They are the highest court in the land. They could have stopped the war. They could have shone the light unremittingly on the government's actions before, during and after the conflict. When parliament returns the week after next, MPs again have opportunities. They can demand an immediate statement from the prime minister about the secret assurances of British support he gave to President Bush before the war. And they can force a commitment not to support future unilateral action against Iran. </p> <p>Today the voters of Hartlepool have the chance to send a message about the kind of parliament this country really needs. Such chances do not come often. Today, though, their town is in the spotlight and their message can make a difference. If they want to elect a 407th Labour MP, to add to the 406 already on the Labour benches at Westminster, then that is their privilege. On the basis of the domestic policies promoted at Brighton this week, there would normally be logic in such a choice. But before they do that, do the voters of Hartlepool not need to ask themselves whether one more Labour MP will make a difference? </p> <p>If this newspaper had a vote in Hartlepool today, it would go to the Liberal Democrats. It would go to them not because we have a view about the candidates' personalities. Nor because we think that Liberal Democrat policies for Hartlepool are demonstrably preferable to those of any other party. That is not the case either. Nor because we think that Britain should have a Liberal Democrat government. We still support most of the aims of this Labour government. The Liberal Democrats, though, are the one party to have consistently opposed the war and to have consistently tried to hold the executive to account. This election is about the effectiveness of parliament. Only the Lib Dems have provided any kind of effective opposition over Iraq. It would be a win they deserve. If you want a parliament that is a bit more worthy of this country, then Hartlepool should today send Jody Dunn to Westminster as its Liberal Democrat MP.</p>",
  "For the hardened London smoker, chased from the office by rules and disapproving company policies, the pavement has been the last refuge. They huddle together at break times, for a quick fag and a last stand. But now even that may be under attack. <p>Amid claims that they have been littering London with tonnes of discarded butts, the mayor, Ken Livingstone, is to get tough on the pavement smokers. </p> <p>He is writing to 300 companies telling them to stop errant staff dropping litter outside their offices and elsewhere. </p> <p>To make compliance easier the mayor and boroughs will distribute 15,000 heat-resistant cigarette butt pouches, so every smoker will have their own ashtray. </p> <p>But with the carrot comes a stick. Under the Capital Standards Programme, Mr Livingstone and the boroughs aim by 2005 to treble to 750 the number of enforcement officers issuing on-the-spot fines for littering and other anti-social offences. </p> <p>They are empowered under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act to write \u00a350 fixed-penalty notices. As with parking tickets, the culprit has a limited period to pay a fine or go to court. </p> <p>Huddling in the wind outside City Hall, cigarette in hand, Chris Taylor, a support worker for the Conservative group, says smokers are assuming pariah status. </p> <p>\"Of course it is not nice to drop litter but we do seem to be demonised,\" he said. \"We have been forced outside because there is no designated smoking area and now we can't even smoke out here in peace. It is bad enough that we all get colds from standing outside. I am sure the money they are spending on this could be used for other things.\" </p> <p>Mr Livingstone has made no secret of his support for a ban on smoking in public places but his officials claim that the thrust of the latest action is not anti-smoking zealotry but a desire to see a cleaner London. </p> <p>They claim the statistics are on their side and that 2,700 tonnes of cigarette litter - including packaging, cellophane, foil, lighters, matches, butts and cigarette filters - are dropped on the capital's streets each year. </p> <p>John Duffy, the mayor's environment adviser, said: \"We are seeing more smokers gathering outside their offices and more smoking litter on the streets. This campaign is working to persuade smokers to change their behaviour and dispose of cigarette butts in a safe, clean way.\" </p> <p>The mayor himself said it was important to act now to change the behaviour of pavement smokers. </p> <p>\"People think their cigarette butt is fairly harmless and will not make a difference to London's litter problem,\" Mr Livingstone said. \"But in reality smoking litter is one of the most commonly occurring forms of litter and cigarette filters do not degrade easily. </p> <p>\"If a smoking ban were to come into force, the problem of people congregating outside offices, restaurants and pubs to smoke and drop their cigarette butt will only continue and get worse unless the problem is tackled now. Smokers need to start taking more responsibility for their litter.\" </p> <p>It is estimated that 177,000 tonnes of litter is dropped in London each year, the cleaning up of which costs \u00a3100m. In the latest annual survey by the Greater London authority, 44% of those polled said they saw the litter problem as a priority for improving the environment. But the population is also in denial, with most believing they do not drop litter and looking to local services to clean the streets. </p> <p>Although a public smoking ban would require national legislation, the government is expected to release a white paper next month with provisions only for a selective ban. It is expected that pubs and clubs will be excluded. </p> <p>London officials look to Ireland where a public smoking ban was introduced in January. Reports suggest there has been 98% compliance. Fines stand at \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,000). </p> <p>Simon Clark, director of the pro-smoking group Forest, said smokers felt increasingly beleaguered. \"No one is in favour of litter but it is the inevitable consequence of banning smoking indoors,\" he said. \"In Ireland there was a report that litter is up 15% since the smoking ban. </p> <p>He added that many smokers could not even take refuge outside their offices because their employers did not want them there. </p> <p>\"It is just the triumph of petty rules and regulations,\" he said. \"The number of man hours being devoted to confronting this so-called problem of smoking is simply extraordinary.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last week President Bush held up a rifle at his ranch and declared that he was a conservationist. The man who wants to open the Arctic to oil companies and who has ripped up more than a hundred environmental protection laws was unapologetic. </p> <p>\"There's a big difference between conservationists and preservationists,\" he said. \"Conservationists care. And we take action.\" </p> <p>The gun clubs, fur trappers, turkey shooters and elk stalkers of America loved it. The president, they said, had claimed the high ground from the feared and hated animal welfare and environment groups - the preservationists - but he was also implicitly backing governments and industries wanting an end to animal protection. </p> <p>Mr Bush had highlighted a schism in the global wildlife debate between those who say that endangered wildlife is best protected when it is traded \"sustainably\" and those who argue that international trade neither helps people nor protects species. The divisions will be exposed next week in Bangkok at the annual meeting of Cites, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. </p> <p>Officials from more than 160 countries, representatives of more than 500 pressure groups and up to 10,000 observers will meet to debate whether to add some 100 plant and animal species to the 34,000 already listed. </p> <p>Illegal wildlife trafficking, with an estimated value of some \u00a32.5bn a year,is a massive industry. But while decisions on how to police this are theoretically made on the basis of science and rational debate, the reality is that dirty tricks, the political manipulation of poor countries by rich, widespread lobbying and downright corruption actually decide which species get protection and which trades are allowed to continue. </p> <p>The two-week meeting will see ritual battles over ivory exports and minke whales, and more protection will probably be given to great apes, some sharks, yellow-crested cockatoos, irawaddy dolphins and some snails and turtles. </p> <p>\"Trade has been the foremost factor in the decimation of scores of species ranging from tigers to cod,\" says Richard Leakey, who, as head of the Kenya Wildlife Service, has fought for years against the ivory trade. He deplores southern African countries' attempts to reopen it. </p> <p>He argues that even a limited version of the trade would damage wildlife, encourage poaching and would not relieve poverty. \"Sustainable use\" arguments, he says, sound reasonable but there is a big difference between ecological and economic sustainability. He believes that economic priorities will always take precedence. </p> <p>He is backed by groups such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the RSPCA, Wildaid, Greenpeace, the World Society for the Protection of Animals and Born Free, all with large memberships and the resources to lobby governments. More than 70 will work together in Bangkok in a global coalition known as the Species Survival Network. </p> <p>\"There is more and more frustration within non-government groups about the sustainability argument,\" says Dr Barbara Maas, chief executive of Care for the Wild International. \"The idea that it helps people is fashionable, but it doesn't stand up. It does not do anything for biodiversity or species.\" </p> <p>Care for the Wild this week published a report showing that income from southern African ivory sales is not enough to help communities. </p> <p>But the pro-traders are also campaigning aggressively. In Bangkok, governments from China, Norway, Japan and South Africa will link with business groups, coalitions of free traders, political libertarians and the exotic pet trade to protect their trade. </p> <p>Better organised and funded than before, the pro-trade groups increasingly use sustainability arguments and attack the precautionary principles that give Cites the legal basis to take action to protect species, even when there is doubt about their status. </p> <p>\"It's hand-to-hand warfare,\" said one Cites observer this week. \"No one dares offend China, the US is becoming more and more pro-trade and Britain is following. The pro-traders mostly know that they are talking rubbish, but there are a lot of clever, charismatic, well-connected people among them who can do a lot of damage.\" </p> <p>There is arguably no other international meeting which is so open to corruption or lobbying. With each country having only one secret vote for each proposal, and many having no interest in most of the species being debated, countries line up behind their diplomatic friends, or may be persuaded by anything from a good lunch to a brown paper envelope. </p> <p>The pro-traders say the protection ists are dominant. \"Cites is being hijacked by animal protectors. It is dominated by them,\" says Eugene Lapointe, former director of Cites and now head of the IWMC - the World Conservation Trust - and a leading lobbyist for sustainable use of wild animals </p> <p>\"Countries are being forced to take positions which are contrary to their own national interests. The dogma of protectionism is so powerful. These [protection] groups have billions of dollars for propaganda. Cites is now being used as a tool which is very unfortunate. It is being contaminated by inappropriate lobbying and pressure.\" </p> <p>Lapointe, a French Canadian lawyer, was fired from Cites in 1989 after being found campaigning against a ban on the ivory trade but later received a settlement after the UN found that his dismissal was \"arbitrary and capricious\". </p> <p>He now employs five former Cites officials and advises Japan, Norway, China, Canada,\"two small European countries\" and many industries on how to legally avoid animal trade legislation. \"I tell industry 'Wake up. You're being attacked',\" he says. </p> <p>He accuses animal and environmental campaigners of trying to destroy fishing and other industries and using species just to raise money. \"Organisations like Greenpeace have given birth to groups like the Environmental Investigation Agency and Wildaid. Each increases the necessity for more protection. We don't have the money like them,\" he says. </p> <p>He admits that he has been at the forefront of resistance to eliminate the secret ballot in Cites. This, he says, is needed \"to protect the sovereignty of small states under undue pressure from bigger trading companies\". </p> <p>The protection groups accuse the pro-traders of buying votes and hiding behind the secret ballot. A few years ago, Japan was found to have been buying the votes of small Caribbean countries with the promise of financial aid in return for the sabotage of protection measures at the International Whaling Commission meeting. </p> <p>\"This now extends into Cites,\" says Peter Pueschel, formerly of Greenpeace and now of Ifaw. \"There was one secret vote at the last meeting and you could see 20 Japanese men suddenly sit next to the delegates of certain countries, making sure they voted the right way. Vote buying clearly goes on.\" </p> <p>But Pueschel says Ifaw will be paying for some individuals from poor countries to get to Bangkok \"They have no voting rights but they will be on delegations. They are not necessarily even on our side. We believe that some central African countries are under-represented. So we have been helping Togo, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The countries would come anyway, but sometimes there are key people, like directors of national parks, who need to go.\" </p> <p>He adds: \"A lot of people are blindly hooked up to the arguments of the pro-traders. People have not had the facts.\" </p> <p>But Eugene Lapointe is confident that his arguments are winning. \"Immediately after the meeting I shall engage in the practical implementation of a sustainable use project,\" he says. \"Moose hunting.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cites only regulates the international trade in animals. It has no power to make countries protect domestic species. Species are listed on one of three appendices according to the perceived threat. They can be up or downgraded only at international meetings with the agreement of 50% of Cites' 165 members. </p> <p>Appendix I lists the species that are the most endangered. These are threatened with extinction and Cites generally prohibits all commercial international trade in any specimens. </p> <p>Appendix II lists species that are not now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled. International trade may be authorised by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate. </p> <p>Appendix III includes species which are traded, but countries need the cooperation of others to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation.</p>",
  "<p>Irwan Subrata's business card is appropriately vague for a man who spends only a tiny proportion of his working day in legitimate activities to provide cover for his myriad criminal dealings. Alongside pictures of a lizard, beetle and cobra, it states his name, mobile phone number, half his address in a medium-sized town in southern Sumatra and the ambiguous title Purchaser of Various Animals. </p> <p>\"If anyone comes asking I can prove that I'm a genuine trader,\" Subrata says, pulling out of a cupboard a flimsy file of dodgy-looking receipts, invoices and orders for an assortment of reptiles. \"I act as the agent for this company in Jakarta. I send them live reptiles to order.\" </p> <p>What the talkative, poorly educated dealer would not show a curious inspector or police officer are the contents of the cheap plastic bag stored next to the file. This would expose him for what he really is, a small-time criminal dealer in threatened species who cares little for the law and less for the fate of his environment. </p> <p>The bag's browny-grey contents are scales from a pangolin, an endangered mammal that looks like a lizard-shaped pine cone and weighs about nine kilograms. Its scales and the meat are considered crucial ingredients in many Chinese medicines. All trade in the species is banned. </p> <p>\"I've got plenty of this, why don't you take some?\" Subrata says. He is clearly keen to impress me after I tell him that I'm a London art dealer touring Sumatra to buy endangered species for a rich Arab sheikh. </p> <p>When Subrata - his name has been changed to protect the anti-trafficking organisations that use his loose tongue to catch hunters and other dealers - realises that I'm not interested in pangolins he quickly moves on to other species. Within 15 minutes he has insisted that he can get hold of tigers, leopards, elephant tusks, cockatoos and snakes; within a few weeks he would help me to get enough rare animals to start a creditable zoo. </p> <p>\"You just check with your client what he wants and we'll go from there,\" he says. \"The police are not too much of a problem at the moment because they're focusing on ensuring the election campaign goes smoothly.\" </p> <p>Subrata and the scores of dealers like him across Indonesia rarely go into the forests themselves. They mainly act as middlemen between the hunters, who are both professionals working to order and opportunists, and the more specialist dealers based in Jakarta and other big cities. </p> <p>These would include both Indonesians and foreigners; there is, for example, a well-known Russian syndicate based outside Jakarta that illegally exports reptiles to Europe. </p> <p>Dealers rarely ever own any animals, they usually facilitate deals between the hunters and the buyers and take their cut, which can be anything from 10% to several hundred per cent. </p> <p>\"The price of an animal can go from a few dollars to a few thousand in just a few trades,\" says Chris Shepherd, the south-east Asia programme officer for Traffic, an organisation that monitors wildlife trade. </p> <p>As Subrata is closer to the lower end of the chain, he needs a comprehensive network of hunters he can turn to. \"Look, if you want to go into the forest I can arrange it,\" he says. \"For tigers we'll go to one place, leopards another and so on. But it would be easier to bring the animal out to you and then you can decide if you want it. Then you wouldn't waste your time and it would also reduce the risk.\" </p> <p>The risk of arrest is definitely mounting, he says, and while it might just be a pitch to up the price it does have some truth to it. Increasing numbers of conservation groups are deploying teams to combat dealers like Subrata, and although they are recording some success they are being stymied on several fronts. </p> <p>\"Anywhere where there's a resource and people wanting to hunt stuff there will be people like Subrata wanting to act as brokers or dealers because it's easy money,\" says Debbie Martyr, of Flora and Fauna International, who works with a tiger conservation unit in Sumatra. \"We've joined the battle but it's far from won.\" </p> <p>That is also because, according to Shepherd, the law enforcement is so weak. \"A trader might be fined $150 (\u00a383) if he's caught, which is nothing to many of these guys,\" he says. </p> <p>Subrata also offers to help smuggle the animals out of the country. \"It's not cheap because the officials are aware of what's going on,\" he says. \"But I have the right contacts. Don't worry. Your client will get his animals.\" <br><strong>John Aglionby</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Aglionby is the Guardian's correspondent in Jakarta</p> <p>The deep blue hyacinth macaw is the largest bird of the parrot family. Each one can grow to around a metre long, and they are natives of the rainforests of central and south America. </p> <p>But these ones are not swooping over the Amazon. Instead, they are sitting on a piece of rope in a Heathrow warehouse, surrounded by a dozen concrete-lined cages that house an array of animals from dogs to black scorpions. </p> <p>The birds have been here at the airport's animal reception centre for the past few years, having been confiscated several years ago, from a smuggler who was trying to bring them into the UK. The macaws are listed under Cites and the smuggler has just been given a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence for his crime. </p> <p>Charles MacKay is the manager of HM Customs Cites team at Heathrow. He is one of the scores of people around the world whose job it is to catch the smugglers and enforce the strict treaties. For more than a decade, MacKay has been at the front line in Britain and now leads a team of experts who help to identify endangered animals and plants in shipments and to police the permitted trade. Mostly, MacKay's team deals with legal shipments of not just live animals but caviar and skins. </p> <p>But even legal shipments can get into trouble, due to Cites' strict conditions. \"Things have to be black and white,\" says MacKay. \"If you have grey areas you have problems.\" Because animals that are poorly looked after could suffer or die during transport, they must be packed according to strict guidelines governing, for example, how much space each animal gets in its cage. Where those conditions are breached, even legal shipments with valid permits will be seized. And if the permit is even one day out of date, the shipment is deemed illegal. </p> <p>But the permits are difficult to get, so MacKay's team has to deal with smugglers too. He cites the example of a man who wanted to smuggle rare birds' eggs to New Zealand. The smuggler was caught when he tried to board a plane wearing a customised vest to carry the eggs, which were carefully contained in layers of foam and cotton wool and stuffed into plastic tubing. </p> <p>Smugglers are often caught using implausible excuses. Customs officers once intercepted two cheetahs the importers claimed were destined for a breeding programme. They didn't have a valid licence, but the Cites team spotted a more obvious problem. \"They were both male,\" says MacKay. </p> <p>There are also unwitting smugglers - people on holiday in exotic places who want to bring home unusual souvenirs. MacKay's office has shelves of snakes and lizards squashed into bottles of alcohol. \"Some are drinks, some are rubs,\" says MacKay. \"You wouldn't want to mix the two.\" </p> <p>One bottle has a cobra-like snake sitting inside a murky brown liquid. The label says that \"snake whisky\" is a speciality of Laos that can cure rheumatism, lumbago and something ominously called \"sweat of limbs\". But these oddities are just a taste of the animal derivatives that people are intent on bringing into the country. A windowless room stores bags of illegal furs of unidentifiable animals, crocodile-skin handbags (with head still attached, of course), snakeskin shoes and a series of books covered in thick, grey elephant hide on how to hunt these giant beasts. </p> <p>These derivatives are regularly pressed into service to demonstrate the scale of trafficking in endangered animals to members of the public. The leather bags and illegal elephant tusks are often given to museums or exhibi tions. Working out what to do with the live animals is more tricky. \"Very few seized animals go back to the country they came from,\" says MacKay. </p> <p>MacKay says that if you have 200 tortoises, for example, putting them back into the wild would not be a simple case of releasing them altogether somewhere secluded. Each tortoise will want its own territory and there is the possibility that they will just be picked up and smuggled all over again anyway. For these reasons, his team normally contact scientists to work out what to do. If possible, the animals are sent into recognised breeding or conservation programmes in this country. </p> <p>It is tough to establish how much of the illegal trade the team catch because, unlike drug trafficking, there is no fluctuating \"street value\" for animals or derivatives. Between April and December last year, the team seized about 4,500 Cites-controlled plants and animals. They siezed a further 3.5m items intended for use as traditional medicines that contained endangered or restricted species. </p> <p>As more people become aware of Cites, MacKay's team has increasingly been called upon by airport staff to advise in situations where animals are being taken across borders. And, as long as people continue trying to check in rare four-foot high birds as luggage, they will have plenty of work to do. <br><strong> Alok Jha</strong></p>",
  "The Russian government will today announce that it intends to ratify the Kyoto protocol, the international treaty designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Russian media said last night. <p>The Interfax and Itar-Tass news agencies, quoting unidentified government sources, said a draft law would be approved today. </p> <p>If the protocol negotiated in 1997 comes into force, it will make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions legally binding for the developed countries signed up to it. </p> <p>Targets to reduce emissions have already been agreed by Europe, Japan and Canada. </p> <p>Ratification of Kyoto will leave President George Bush - who repudiated the treaty on coming to office - virtually isolated in the developed world. His only ally is Australia. </p> <p>The US is responsible for 25% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, but Mr Bush believes that to cut them would hurt US industry. </p> <p>Despite promises from President Vladimir Putin that he would ratify the treaty, there has been turmoil inside the Russian government for months. </p> <p>According to reports circulating yesterday, ministers will approve ratification of the protocol at a meeting in Moscow. Ratification documents will then be sent to President Putin, who will forward them to the parliament's lower house, the Duma. </p> <p>Within 90 days of the Duma's endorsement, the protocol will come into force. </p> <p>This will not be in time for the next meeting of the climate change convention, in Argentina in December, but it will give the process added impetus and force governments to take their legally binding targets seriously. </p> <p>They will face extreme political embarrassment and as yet unspecified international sanctions if they fail to meet their obligations by 2010. </p> <p>The EU, with a target reduction of 8%, has probably the most difficult target and, so far, looks unlikely to meet it.</p>",
  "<p>Ask someone to plunge their forearm into a bucket of icy water until the pain becomes intolerable, and they might last just five seconds. Ask someone else, and they might happily go for three minutes. It is no secret that people's perception of pain is as different as their taste in clothes, says Mark Hutchinson of the University of Adelaide, Australia. But Hutchinson thinks he just might have come up with the first objective test of that subjective perception - a development that could revolutionise pain treatment. How the test actually works remains a mystery. But it does suggest that traditional theories to explain the experience of pain are telling only part of the story. </p> <p>It has long been known that the immune system is linked to pain. In response to infection or a wound, certain immune cells can cause inflammation, which itself is often painful. But there are new, intriguing hints that other sorts of immune-like cells that are found packed around neurons and nerves might in fact have a large part to play in the level of pain we feel when we're exposed to a trigger like a dog bite, surgery - or cold water. These cells share most of the properties of the standard immune cells that circulate in the blood. </p> <p>The conventional idea that nerves transmit pain signals to the brain is true. \"But there is animal research that suggests these immune-like cells in the spinal cord can act a bit like a dimmer switch to control how much of a pain signal is sent by the nerves,\" Hutchinson says. </p> <p>The Adelaide research involved scoring healthy people for levels of pain tolerance, using the cold water test. Then, Hutchinson took blood samples, exposed those samples to a compound that triggers immune cells to replicate, and stirred morphine into the mix. </p> <p>When he added a high dose of morphine to the sample (enough to kill someone if their bloodstream were to reach the same concentration) the rate at which the blood immune cells replicated mapped directly on to the amount of time they had lasted in the cold water test. \"We did some more work to check this wasn't some kind of artefact, but, whammo, the two scores kept going into that beautiful line,\" he says. </p> <p>The best current objective tests for pain tolerance, based on a variety of markers, such as blood biochemistry and genetics, are only about 20-30% accurate. \"This was a small, initial study - but in these 13 healthy people, we had upwards of 90% accuracy,\" says Hutchinson. It is early days, and the test would need to be tried out in a much larger number of people, and sped up - it now takes 24 hours - but in theory, it could be hugely valuable. </p> <p>\"If you had the ability to predict how sensitive someone was to pain, it would revolutionise how you treated pain in that person,\" says Hutchinson. Since some people can last five seconds at the cold water test and some three minutes, the dose of painkiller they'd need for an injury being treated in the emergency room, or for childbirth or surgery, would vary hugely. </p> <p>\"At the moment, a lot of people are under-dosed, so they're still experiencing pain, but other people are getting too much medication, which, because their bodies are over-responding to the 'standard' dose, could get to toxic levels,\" he says. </p> <p>Dr Peter Cabot, a pain researcher at the University of Queensland, agrees that if the test is validated by trying it out on many more people and different groups, such as the very old and very young, it could be hugely beneficial, especially for treating people who cannot communicate their pain effectively, like children, patients with dementia or heavily sedated burns victims. \"Then, an objective test would be hugely valuable,\" he says. </p> <p>While Hutchinson is excited about the potential for a pain test, he is even more interested in how it might actually work. The immune cells isolated from blood are very unlikely to have any impact on pain sensation. It is those specialised immune-like cells in the central nervous system that would have to be involved. </p> <p>So perhaps the test works because all these blood and central nervous system immune cells share some characteristics, and the morphine is somehow tapping into these, he reasons. But exactly what those characteristics might be, and exactly what determines pain tolerance threshold, are questions still to be answered. </p> <p>\"That's the exciting thing,\" Hutchinson says. \"Every day, we go to work and go exploring into pain where no one has gone before.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ancient herbal remedies used for centuries in Indian cooking and in preparing dishes in the far east have the potential to control diabetes and treat cancer, according to a team of London scientists. </p> <p>Researchers from the department of pharmacy at King's College London say they have found scientific justification for the use of alternative medicine. </p> <p>Scientists believe that the Indian curry leaf - an ingredient in many curry dishes and used in traditional Indian healing, may contain agents that slow down the rate of starch-to-glucose breakdown in people with diabetes. The tree's leaves could control the amount of glucose entering the bloodstream. </p> <p>Professor Peter Houghton, who headed the research team of 20, told the British Pharmaceutical Conference in Manchester yesterday that plants used in traditional Thai and Chinese medicine appeared to have cancer-fighting properties. </p> <p>During the research six plants used in Thai cancer remedies were extracted according to traditional methods and showed \"promising activity\" against lung cancer cells. </p> <p>The best results were found in the aquatic weed known as Ammannia baccifera from Thailand and star anise, a plant extract which tastes of licorice and is often used in Chinese cooking. </p> <p>The findings also revealed that common cattle feed might contain anti-fungal properties and could be used in a cream to treat athlete's foot. </p> <p>Prof Houghton said the findings from three years of research were the first step in the discovery of new drugs based on plant extracts, but warned against people with diabetes or cancer taking the plant extracts immediately. </p> <p>\"This is the first time many of these plants have been looked at scientifically, but it is a long way from saying they will be placed on a doctor's prescription pad,\" he said. \"Pharmacists believe herbs are of value, but they are not completely safe. There is now a rapidly diminishing number of doctors who believe they are old wives' tales, and now see that herbal remedies must be treated with respect.\" </p> <p>He said although it was quite possible that people who ate curry leaf regularly as part of their diet could help control their diabetes, sufferers should first consult their doctors. </p> <p>\"When people find a new chemical of interest, there is a one in 10,000 chance of it becoming a good medicine,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Obviously if someone is eating the curry leaf regularly and is known to be diabetic there is no harm in carrying on taking it, but if someone is going to start taking it in conjunction with other medicines they should definitely check first.\" </p> <p>Researchers also interviewed traditional healers in Ghana to identify plants that are used to help wounds heal. The Ashanti, one of the largest ethnic groups in Ghana used a plant known as the climbing flower which was shown to have anti-bacterial and anti-fungal qualities and prevented infections. </p> <p>But Professor Edzard Ernst, who researches complementary medicine at the Peninsula Medical School in Exeter, said it was important for people to realise clinical trials had not yet been carried out on the plant extracts. </p> <p>\"This research needs independent confirmation, and even if it all goes like a flash of lightning, which it never does, we could see something in five years,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think it's very encouraging but I think any claims of a cancer cure or a diabetes cure are misleading to patients.\"</p>",
  "<p>Three Gypsy families won a significant human rights victory in the court of appeal yesterday which will put more pressure on local authorities to find private sites for travellers. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, joined them in successfully seeking to overturn a high court ruling which denied them a site in Chichester, West Sussex, where a planning inspector had decided that they should be given planning permission on human rights grounds. </p> <p>That decision, taken after a six-day public inquiry, was overturned by a high court judge in July last year. </p> <p>The inspector took into account the fact that Chichester council had failed to provide sites for Gypsies in line with government guidance, but the high court judge ruled that the inspector had misapplied human rights law. </p> <p>Lord Justice Wall and Mr Justice Pumfrey allowed the appeal on human rights grounds. Lord Justice Auld disagreed, but backed them on other grounds. </p> <p>The ruling was won by Grant Doe, Gregory Yates and Paul Eames and their families, who moved on to the land at West Ashling in 2001. </p> <p>Mr Yates, spokesman for the Gypsies and owner of the land, said: \"This is an important case for all Gypsies, because it will affect many other cases in the future.\" </p> <p>Lord Justice Wall said the inspector had found that the council had breached guidance on help for Gypsies, and \"that there was little credible prospect of any private gypsy site being permitted by the council\".</p>",
  "<p>The new \u00a36bn-plus NHS computer system aims to put all patient records online. This will let any doctor treat any patient, as well as allowing people to look at their medical records on the web. One of the obvious concerns is security, and two-thirds of doctors are worried about confidentiality. Many express the fear that hackers will get access to individuals' medical histories. </p> <p>Now, it is difficult to say with any certainty that this won't happen. After all, managing access to medical records is a very complex problem and complexity is the enemy of security. Simply trying to work out who is allowed to see what in which patient's record is incredibly complicated. In fact, \"who\" is logging in is complicated in itself. When logging in, there is a \"role selection dialogue\" (Mr Smith the consultant may be logging in as himself, for example, or as a Caldicott guardian for someone else) and goodness knows how many \"roles\" there are and what associated rights they have. </p> <p>This is not to pick on the NHS. It is just to note that big, complicated systems are notoriously difficult to protect. It's hard to imagine that someone, somewhere won't be able to get access to something they are not supposed to. But are doctors right to worry about hackers? </p> <p>Take a look at an industry that is already wholly computerised and online and spends considerable sums on IT security every day. Detective Chief Superintendent Ken Farrow, head of the economic crime unit at the City of London Police, has said that organised crime is infiltrating the UK banking industry and that the level of insider fraud is significant. He points to the introduction of chip and Pin (which makes payment card fraud more difficult) and the use of \"unvetted\" temporary staff with access to computer systems as major factors. The losses to hacking are a fraction of those from rogue traders with inappropriate access to back-office computer systems and the like. </p> <p>Hackers may make the newspaper headlines, but it is insiders who are the biggest risk. The annual fraud surveys from organisations such as KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young consistently show that around three-quarters of frauds are perpetrated by insiders. It is easy to see why: staff (and particularly middle management) have access to computer systems as well as an understanding of the business processes they are subverting. The people at the top may well understand the business processes, but they don't know enough about IT. The office junior may well be an IT whizzkid, but doesn't understand enough about accounts, sign-off and other business functions to convincingly fool audits and check-ups. </p> <p>Accidents uncover frauds more often than external auditors and have almost as good a record as internal auditors. </p> <p>So if - or perhaps when - the security of the NHS system is breached and some celebrity's medical record is splashed across the internet, we should take stock of who the likely perpetrator might be. It's a pound to a penny that it will be because they were rude to someone in a hospital, not because some master hackers have found their way into the NHS system.</p>",
  "<p>It may be a relatively new technology but local councils believe Wi-Fi has huge potential to improve the delivery of traditional services and regenerate deprived urban areas. </p> <p>In a move designed to find the best ways for local authorities to roll out wireless broadband networks in cities, the government is backing a major new initiative by Lewisham council to introduce real-time wireless access across the borough. </p> <p>The council is working in partnership with BT Openzone to set up a public wireless broadband network, which it sees as a way of enabling local citizens to interact with its online services. The planned network will also enable council staff to access computer-based files without having to be in their offices. If the project is successful, it could act as a catalyst for the introduction of mobile working across the public sector. </p> <p>\"Wireless is a channel that gives people the most freedom in terms of how they work, where they work and when they work,\" says Lorraine Trenchard, programme manager of Connected Communities for Lewisham. \"It takes away the shackles of council officers sitting at their desks from nine to five.\" </p> <p>The council's vision is that new wireless networks will provide efficient support for the likes of social workers, who will be able to carry out real-time assessments by remotely accessing files stored on back-office systems. And on a wider basis, officials feel the new network could play an important role in economic regeneration, by encouraging new IT businesses to be based in the area. </p> <p>Trenchard says the move to mobile communications is so developed in Lewisham that Wi-Fi is now essential if the council is to meet the needs of local people and businesses. </p> <p>\"More people have mobile phones in Lewisham than BT landlines. There is a move away from doing things plugged in - the people out there are going a lot faster than we are and we need to meet their needs.\" </p> <p>Private mobile suppliers, who have been badgering councils to adopt wireless applications to meet e-government targets have, not surprisingly, welcomed news of the pilot. \"It's a very good step forward. Citizens and businesses need to be able to connect easily to a council's services wherever they are,\" says Ruud Veltenaar, chairman of Parkmobile, which provides councils with mobile-based parking applications. </p> <p>As part of the first phase of the project, Lewisham is preparing to run a Wi-Fi network involving about 50 users. The plan is for staff to have access to a virtual private network (VPN), which will enable them to check email, visit intranets and download relevant information from the council's IT systems when out of the office. </p> <p>Security issues have traditionally deterred councils from enthusiastically adopting Wi-Fi, but BT is confident that Lewisham's experience will dispel those concerns. \"With any network service you have to think about security. It's no more of an issue than it would be for a fixed line. You have to use the same precautions. You have to use VPNs appropriately,\" says Chris Bruce, general manager for BT Wireless Broadband. </p> <p>Although Lewisham is partnering with BT Openzone, the council wants to explore how the council's network can be accessed through other providers. Trenchard says: \"What makes this worthwhile is being able to access your files when you're in Manchester. We know staff are out and about and we need to ensure they can access the network whoever the provider is. It's about working out the logistics of how we let people in when they are sitting in Starbucks.\" </p> <p>BT claims it is committed to helping councils by introducing wireless broadband roaming agreements. \"We know as an industry we have to move to a situation where people don't have to worry if this is an Openzone hotspot or someone else's hotspot.\" </p> <p>The Lewisham Wi-Fi initiative is being sponsored by the national project for mobile working (known as Nomad) and, despite the excitement at being involved in a high-profile IT development project, the council knows the technology could provoke many challenging issues. </p> <p>One of the attractions of wireless networks for financial directors is that mobile working gives councils the opportunity to generate considerable savings by reducing and selling expensive traditional office space. But mobile working will require council staff to give up traditional practices and there is likely to be some internal resistance. </p> <p>Many councils will be watching Lewisham's experiment closely. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\"> online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "'First it was the fags, now it's the drink,\" came the murmur from the street corners outside Ireland's pubs this week. With smoking banned from bars, drinkers are braced for a different government crackdown after statistics revealed a country killing itself with alcohol. <p>Ireland, which so bitterly denied the 50s racist stereotype of the drunken emigrant drowning his sorrows in a north London pub, now faces the fallout from reckless drinking spurred by its affluent Celtic Tiger society. </p> <p>A government taskforce reported this month that Ireland had the highest rate of binge drinking in Europe. Dealing with the resulting deaths, road accidents, crime and lost working hours is costing the state \u20ac2.65bn (\u00a31.8bn) a year. </p> <p>To make matters worse, doctors in the north-east of the country painted a worrying portrait of casualty units this week in which they said admissions of drunks had risen by 80% in five years. One in four people arriving at accident and emergency wards was inebriated, and some had suffered head injuries or were unconscious. The ages of these admissions ranged from 10 to more than 70. In the last five years, 14 people in the north-east died in casualty wards from acute alcohol intoxication. </p> <p>Once, boozy British stag parties spilling on to the streets of Dublin's Temple Bar were derided by locals. Now the Irish have overtaken what one columnist called the \"mad Brits\" in the drinking stakes. </p> <p>Binge drinking is the norm among young Irish men, who drink to excess on 60% of their nights out. Irish men are three times more likely than the European average to get into a drunken fight. </p> <p>The number of off-licences selling spirits has doubled in the last 10 years and those selling wine have risen more than six times. With alcohol consumption rising almost 50% in the last decade, the Irish now spend \u20ac6bn on alcohol each year, drinking more per capita than any European country except Luxembourg. </p> <p>As the vast super-pubs take over from the tight wooden snugs of traditional bars, commentators have been soul-searching. Fintan O'Toole, in the Irish Times, said the \"live fast, die young culture\" of a newly affluent nation had played its part. Ireland's relationship with drink had been problematic for some time, he said, although the state swept it under the carpet. John Waters wrote of a spiritual problem, the \"God-shaped hole in our lives\". </p> <p>The state and police are still considering how to respond. Yesterday police stepped in to try to stop late licences for clubs in Dublin. Bertie Ahern, the taoiseach, said he was not a \"spoilsport\" but making alcohol available to young people at five or six in the morning was not a good idea. </p> <p>Joe Barry, a senior lecturer in public health at Trinity College Dublin, said the situation was at crisis point. People who were not classed as alcoholics were dying from drink. </p> <p>In the decade to 2002, Ireland had more than 14,000 alcohol-related deaths. This figure does not include road deaths that may be linked to drink or the 15 deaths by drowning a month. Doctors say a rise in suicide rates, particularly among men, could also be linked to a rise in binge drinking. </p> <p>Dr Barry said: \"There are cultural issues that all of us have to address. Every child in Ireland is bombarded with alcohol advertising on the TV, at football and hurling matches. There should be some sort of watershed ban. We haven't always handled affluence well in this country. We have to say to people, think of other things to spend your money on.\" </p> <p>The government's taskforce on alcohol made 78 recommendations last week, which the department of health is to consider. They include limiting the number of shops selling alcohol, introducing ID cards and labelling drinks with health warnings, ingredients and calories. The taskforce also said gaelic sports should try to find sponsors other than drinks companies. </p> <p>The government is drafting legislation to limit the content of alcohol adverts and reduce children's exposure to them. The drinks industry spent more than \u20ac43m on advertising in 2002, double the spend for 2000. </p> <p>But the recommendations to increase tax on alcohol have sparked opposition from Fine Gael and the drinks industry. It says Ireland has the highest tax and excise on drink in Europe. A tax rise on spirits in 2003 resulted in a drop in consumption for the first time in 16 years. </p> <p>The taskforce also asked why soft drinks on sale in Irish bars are so expensive compared with alcohol. </p> <p>The government has instituted penalties on landlords who serve drunk customers. It has banned happy-hour promotions and reduced opening hours. </p> <p>Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society, a drinks industry group, said the government's alcohol policy, so far, had been fragmented and under-resourced. Community workers were adamant that changes must be made to a society which one said was \"in love with its own drunken image\".</p>",
  "<p>Chris Schofield, English cricket's great leg-spin hope when he was awarded one of the first central contracts four years ago, has been released by Lancashire. \"We feel it is an appropriate stage in his career for him to seek pastures new and secure more regular first-team cricket,\" said the county's manager Mike Watkinson. </p> <p>Schofield, 25, made 68 first-class appearances for Lancashire and won two Test caps in six years. But he played only three times for his county last season, and took one wicket in 27 overs, though he scored three half-centuries, which in addition to his fielding ability made him a one-day regular. </p> <p>\"The past three years have been a bit disappointing and a bit frustrating,\" Schofield said. \"If I had got a one-year contract off Lancs I would have signed it because I'm a home lad, but I think they're going to sign [Muttiah] Muralitharan next year so I'd probably be getting only one or two games of cricket. So maybe this is for the best.\" </p> <p>Sussex, whose coach Peter Moores worked closely with Schofield on an England A tour of the West Indies in 2000-01, are expected to lead the chase. Lancashire have also released Jamie Haynes, the long-serving deputy to their wicketkeeper Warren Hegg, who has signed a new one-year contract but is still considering his position as captain. </p> <p>Sussex have allowed the Pakistan pace bowler Mohammad Akram to leave halfway through his two-year contract, for personal reasons. The 30-year-old is expected to move to Gloucestershire. </p> <p>A decision on shifting the International Cricket Council's headquarters from Lord's to Dubai will be made soon, it was revealed yesterday. \"We have had a very good offer from Dubai, but we are waiting for a final proposal from the British government which will come in the next few days,\" said Ehsan Mani, the ICC's president. \"We have been based at Lord's since 1909 and it's only right that we don't get up and leave a country that has hosted us for 95 years without giving it an opportunity to come forward with a proposal.\" </p> <p>The ICC's global cricket academy will be located in Dubai Sports City. Facilities unveiled yesterday include a 30,000-capacity stadium, three other cricket grounds, indoor training and fitness facilities and an educational block. The project will be open in 2007. </p> <p>Ranbir Mahendra was voted in as president of the Indian board yesterday after an acrimonious election. Mahendra, a former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, and the politician Sharad Pawar were level before the outgoing president Jagmohan Dalmiya used his casting vote. </p> <p>However, Dalmiya is still expected to retain control after he was named as the board's first patron-in-chief earlier this month.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Erasing data </strong><br> I was intrigued to hear reports about organisations failing to erase data before recycling IT equipment. What level of security is required to make data unrecoverable?  <strong> Joe Lynch</strong> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield replies: </strong> Some data can be recovered from almost any drive, unless you smash it with a hammer and burn the remains. The real question is how much someone is willing to spend to retrieve it. If it is simply a failed or corrupt hard drive, prices start at around \u00a31,000. To erase files securely, you need to overwrite the disk sectors multiple times, to make data recovery prohibitively expensive. Many programs will do this, but I recommend <a href=\"http://www.heidi.ie/eraser/\">Eraser</a> for MS-DOS and Windows. It is easy to use, free (donations accepted), and is published under the GPL free software licence, so you can read the source code and check that it does exactly what it says. Set it up so you can select Erase after right-clicking on a file (ie as a shell extension), and you can specify the type and number of overwrites, including ones defined for the US Department of Defense. </p> <p><strong> Be prepared</strong><br> Do I still need my Zone Labs firewall, SpyBot and Pop-up Stopper etc now I've installed Windows XP Service Pack 2?  <strong>Kevin Bell, Steve Ballantyne, Adam Elgar</strong> and others. </p> <p><strong>JS: </strong> SP2 installs with a simple firewall switched on, to protect users who would otherwise not install a firewall at all. It is not intended to compete with third-party firewalls from Zone Labs, Sygate, Kerio etc. If you are happily using one of these, you can keep on using it. SP2 also adds a pop-up blocker to Internet Explorer, so you could uninstall your pop-up blocker. However, some stoppers offer other functions, and there's no reason why you should not continue to use, say, the Google Toolbar. I still consider SpyBot Search &amp; Destroy essential, and also recommend both Lavasoft's Ad-aware and Javacool's Spywareblaster. Many types of malware, including diallers, do not depend on security flaws but on deception or \"social engineering\" and some are bundled with file-sharing and other free software. SP2 does not provide protection against those. </p> <p><strong> Speed up XP</strong><br> I put Windows XP on my old ThinkPad 600e and it works incredibly slowly. Is there a way of going back from NFTS to Fat32/Win 98?  <strong> Susan Ellis</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Windows installations usually let you go back to the earlier operating system if you select the option to preserve files. However, DOS-based versions of Windows (3.x/95/98/Me) are incompatible with the New Technology File System often used by Windows NT/2000/XP. You cannot go back without reformatting the hard drive - destroying all your data - and reinstalling Windows 98 from scratch. Instead, try to speed up XP. Right-click the My Computer icon, select Properties, click the Advanced tab, go to the Performance section and click Settings. </p> <p>Choose the setting that says \"Adjust for best performance\" or use the Custom setting to remove all XP's power-hungry visual effects. A 600e usually has a 300MHz Mobile Pentium II and 64MB of memory - not really enough to run XP. You will need to add 128MB or preferably 256MB of memory, bringing it up to the maximum 288MB for \u00a372.83 from <a href=\"http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/listparts.asp?Mfr%2BProductline=IBM%2BThinkPad&amp;mfr=IBM&amp;cat=&amp;model=ThinkPad+600E+Series+%28Type+2645%29&amp;submit=Go\">Crucial</a>. A 600e running Windows 98 is only worth about \u00a3200-\u00a3225, but it's a nice machine and is probably worth the upgrade. </p> <p><strong> Moving Docs</strong><br> I have partitioned my hard drive under Windows XP. Unfortunately My Documents is residing on the half set aside for programs rather than data. Is it possible to move it?  <strong> Brian Law</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Right-click the My Documents icon on your desktop, select Properties, change the Target tab (eg to D:\\My Documents) and click Move. For full instructions, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310147 (search Google for Q310147). </p> <p><strong> Hotmail</strong><br> Where is this Hotmail upgrade?  <strong> Ian Chamberlain </strong> </p> <p> <strong> JS: </strong> It takes a while to upgrade 150m mailboxes and the people who are paying for a premium service are being upgraded first.

  "<p>The recent discovery of polar ice sheets on the moon reminds us that satellite Selene still has her secrets, but another of her mysteries has been visible from Earth for almost 500 years. </p> <p>In 1540, more than half a century before the first telescope was unveiled, stargazers in the German city of Worms saw a star-like object appear in the moon's north-eastern Calippus region. The Polish astronomer Hevelius in 1650 noted the appearance of a Mons Porphyrites, or \"red hill\", in the north-western crater Aristarchus. In April 1787, the astronomer Sir William Herschel saw so many red lights in this same crater that he thought he was witnessing a lunar volcano, and invited George III to take a look. </p> <p>More recently, Nasa records reveal several hundred spots and flashes of light, coloured glows, mists, unusual shapes and shadows have been observed on the lunar surface. They are known collectively as Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLP), a term coined by Sir Patrick Moore. </p> <p>Professional astronomers sniffed at these reports for many years, declaring them optical illusions or telescope errors. But a 1968 Nasa catalogue documented hundreds of sightings, the vast majority in and around Aristarchus. In July the following year, as Apollo 11 entered lunar orbit, earthbound German astronomers reported seeing a bright TLP in Aristarchus. Asked to check it out, Neil Armstrong noted unusual illumination in what he took to be the same crater. </p> <p>So is the moon, supposedly a lifeless chunk of basaltic rock, undergoing periodic volcanic activity? Most astronomers don't think so. In1963 Zdenek Kopal observed that a significant TLP event occurred during a major solar flare-up. He suggested particles from these vast electromagnetic emissions caused moon rocks to glow, particularly when the moon is passing through the Earth's magnetosphere. </p> <p>Another theory was put forward by Audouin Dollfus of the Paris Observatory in 1992. He identified glowing clouds emerging from Langrenus as moon dust, thrown up by underground gaseous emissions. The crater's surface is indeed cracked, and radon gas was detected in the atmosphere during the Apollo missions. Perhaps these moon burps are the source of some TLP, but it'll take another lunar landing to be sure.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?14@86.5saMbwZ81Sr.0@.4a911591\">Talk about bad science here</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I once saw a bloke at the opening of a Jackson Pollock exhibition in the Tate, wearing a T-shirt that said: \"my cat could do better\". What, you may be wondering, has that got to do with Dr Gillian McKeith (PhD)? Well now. Besides her PhD, which we have already discussed, there were a few other interesting entries on her CV. For example, she is proud to announce under \"Professional Associations\" that she is a certified member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants (AANC), which certainly sounds impressive. I bet you get a little certificate and everything. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In fact, I know you get a certificate, because I'm holding it in my hand right now. It's in the name of my cat, Henrietta. I got it in return for $60, and it's a particular honour since dear, sweet, little Hettie died about a year ago. So, coming in a bit cheaper than Gillian's non-accredited correspondence course PhD and Masters degrees (although she will have got a discount from \"Clayton College of Natural Health\" if she ordered them both at once), it looks as if all you need to be a certified member of the AANC is a name, an address, and a spare $60. You don't need to be human. You don't even need to be alive. No exam. No check-up on your qualifications. And no assessment of your practice. I guess that could be embarrassing for some of their certified professional members. Presumably, the diploma is there to certify that you have $60. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you know anyone else who is showing off about being a Professional Certified Member of the AANC, I'd like to hear about it. The only one I can find so far is a man called Dr Bannock who presented Why Weight on Channel 4 and Fat Academy on Discovery. No, I'd never heard of him either. He says he is a \"Member of the American Association of Nutrition Consultants (Board Certified Nutrition Consultant)\". Glad you added that bit at the end, Dr Bannock. His website mentions his PhD in Nutritional Physiology, but he doesn't say where it's from; his website also features the odd photograph of a stethoscope, although to my disappointment, unlike Hettie, he's not gone as far as dressing up in it endearingly. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> But back to the money: if anybody wants nutritional advice from the decomposing corpse of my ex-cat, I shall be setting up a small shrine at the bottom of the garden, where you can leave chewed mice, ready cash, and offers of a primetime TV series on Channel 4.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Please send your bad science to <a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Having reported on Manchester United for the past 46 years, I have witnessed the first games in a red shirt of numerous players destined to become household names, from the near-holy trinity of Charlton, Law and Best, through to Eric Cantona and David Beckham. But no-one has strutted his stuff with the same panache as Wayne Rooney displayed against Fenerbahce. </p> <p>George Best, reckoned by many to be the finest player they have ever seen, at least for United, slipped on almost unnoticed in September 1963. Matt Busby had named him as a reserve for the home First Division game against West Bromwich Albion, knowing that his right winger, Ian Moir, was injured and he could add the Irishman to the side without any fuss at the last minute. Best was 17 and four months old, and shared in a 1-0 win with the goal scored by David Sadler, his house-mate in Mrs Fullaway's digs. </p> <p>\"There was,\" I wrote at the time, \"the prospect of young George Best to brighten a dullish match, despite the ordeal of a League debut after only three reserve matches, a gruelling duel with full-back Graham Williams and a painful ankle injury. None of the handicaps could disguise a natural talent. I know manager Matt Busby is looking forward to seeing this Belfast boy in a team with Denis Law to help him. I agree - it is an exciting prospect that will brighten up even the dullest of games.\" </p> <p>Fast-forward three seasons to a sensational European night in March 1966, when Best went to Lisbon to play Benfica and came home a superstar as \"El Beatle\". </p> <p>United had won the first leg 3-2 and Busby sent them out into the Stadium of Light with instructions to play it tight for the first 20 minutes. Best simply ignored orders and streaked away on dazzling runs to score in the sixth and 12th minutes, mesmerising a team that had not been beaten on their own ground in 19 European matches. United won 5-1 to reach the European Cup semi-finals. </p> <p>It was a performance to put alongside Rooney's display and Best was still only 19. But in terms of a dashing debut Best was miles behind. </p> <p>Sir Bobby Charlton scored twice on his debut at Charlton Athletic in 1956 - promising, but he was still dropped for the next match to make way for the return of Tommy Taylor. </p> <p>Denis Law, also made his first appearance for United, on his return from Italy, in 1962 against West Brom and he got off to a Rooney-type start, scoring after seven minutes with a glancing header. David Herd had already scored but they ran out of goals and Albion hit back for a 2-2 draw. It was an OK debut by Law in a season when he scored 23 league goals from 38 appearances. But again compared with Rooney it was a modest start. </p> <p>Eric Cantona also made an ordinary entry when he came on for Ryan Giggs in a 2-1 win over Manchester City in December 1992. I recall some deft touches but the goals and the magic did not arrive for a couple of games. Then he scored in four successive matches and he was on his way to becoming Le Dieu . </p> <p>It was a similar story with David Beckham, who before he became a cult hero had to be content with occasional first-team appearances. He made his debut in a dour goalless draw at home to Leeds, and was on the bench for the next game. </p> <p>So in terms of debuts, no-one can match Rooney's sensational start. Old Trafford and the world are at his feet. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David Meek reported on Manchester United for the Manchester Evening News from 1958 to 1995</p>",
  "<p>This may have been a Chelsea performance notable more for efficiency and collective will than individual brilliance but Jose Mourinho is perfectly happy with that. As the Portuguese reflected on a win that means he has yet to experience defeat as the club's manager, he said he senses a mentality that can take the team far. </p> <p>Chelsea, he admitted, are not playing his \"ideal football\" but he believes they possess a togetherness and team ethic that provides the perfect platform. The finer points can be added over time. The former Porto coach does not see in his squad the selfishness that can be a poison. </p> <p>\"We have to work to improve but I have to say the mentality in my team is fantastic and we play as a team every moment of the game,\" Mourinho said. \"Most of the big teams in Europe, where the big players are, [you have those who] think more about themselves and less about the team. What I can feel, and for me this is amazing, is the way my big players play for the team and for the result. That's why over nine matches nobody can beat us.\" </p> <p>The defensive work by Damien Duff, a \u00a317m winger, was illustrative. The way Eidur Gudjohnsen was screamed at by his manager on a rare occasion when he failed to close down an opponent quickly enough showed the demands that Mourinho makes of his players. Alexei Smertin, who scored the first goal and never stopped chasing and harrying in the cause, epitomised what Mourinho was talking about. </p> <p>Seven wins and two draws is a fine start for Mourinho and it is plain that he has a basis from which to build something even better. A sense of the collective was pivotal to his success with Porto, with flair also part of the mix, and he is trying to achieve a similar balance. </p> <p>The signings he made this summer had a different emphasis from those made the previous year before he arrived - instead of Juan Sebastian Veron and Hernan Crespo, for example, came Tiago Mendes, Mateja Kezman and Didier Drogba - and much thought went into that. \"It's important to chose not just the players but the character,\" Mourinho said. </p> <p>The style he wants at Chelsea will see his team hold more possession and know better how to react to certain moments of a game. But he is delighted not just with the team ethic but the strength of his defence. The goal conceded here was their first in five matches. </p> <p>\"We are a bit far from my ideal football because my ideal football is a lot different from what they used to play,\" he said. \"But what I can say is from a defensive point of view our team is really compact and strong. </p> <p>\"In terms of ball possession I would like my team to have even more control of the game and I don't like the fact that I'm winning 2-0 and we still play the same way. There are different ways and paces to play football and when a team is able to control every second that's when it's perfect.\" </p> <p>Mourinho noted his team \"broke a few walls\" by inflicting Porto's first away defeat in Europe for some time and recording Chelsea's first Champions League win at home in five attempts. They also scored with more regularity than they have in the Premiership. </p> <p>\"Maybe it's because Porto didn't play like teams in English football,\" he said. \"I find sometimes teams in England are too afraid of us and they defend too much and make it difficult for us. Maybe because Porto conceded a goal in the first minutes they had to change the way they played and had to push up.\" </p> <p>It was hard to conclude that everything about Chelsea's attack is now working perfectly when one goal came from a midfielder and two from free-kicks. There was no stream of chances and more should have been made of late breakaways. But efficiency, power and teamwork are taking Chelsea a long way and there is doubtless better to come.</p>"
