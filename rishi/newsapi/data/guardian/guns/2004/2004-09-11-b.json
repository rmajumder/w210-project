  "<p>The next few days will be uncomfortable ones for scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico. They are about to spend the week on their hands and knees scrabbling over the Utah desert. </p> <p>Their goal is simple: they are seeking intact fragments of cargo from the $150-million Genesis spacecraft that plunged out of the sky last week and buried itself in a large sandy crater outside Salt Lake City. </p> <p>It was an ignominious end to a mission that had promised so much. For two years, Genesis - carrying suntraps made of wafers of gold, diamond and sapphire - had been hovering a million miles from Earth, gathering billions of atoms of primordial material as they streamed from the sun. This payload was to be used by scientists to gain key insights into the formation of the sun and the planets - our own world included. </p> <p>It was not to be. A parachute failed and Genesis, filled with its precious particles, hit the Utah desert, as dismayed scientists looked on. </p> <p>'There was a big pit in my stomach. This just wasn't supposed to happen,' Roger Wiens, Genesis's flight payload chief, said yesterday. 'On the other hand, we are still hopeful. We can see that some of the solar wind wafers still look intact.' </p> <p>It remains to be seen if these fragments are too contaminated to provide useful data. Most scientists remain gloomy. Indeed, it was noticeable that before the Utah sands had even settled over Genesis's wreckage, scientists were calling for a replacement mission. </p> <p>Such hopes may be naive, but they also reveal an intensity of commitment, not just for space science in general, but for solar research in particular. And this is a crucial point: Genesis was no one-off probe to the sun, but was one of a flotilla of spacecraft and ground-based missions that have recently transformed our knowledge of our nearest star. </p> <p>'This is the golden age of solar science,' said Professor Eric Priest, of St Andrews University. 'Losing Genesis was a blow, but there is so much more we are learning about the sun - and it is going to have a profound impact on all our lives.' </p> <p>In mines deep below the ground, scientists have created lakes of detergents which they use to trap phantom-like particles called neutrinos emitted by the sun; in orbit, satellites like Soho (the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) monitor magnetic sun storms big enough to swallow the Earth; and on mountain peaks in Hawaii and Chile, astronomers are studying the sun in unprecedented detail. </p> <p>And after all, no other object in the universe, outside our own planet, is more important to our well-being. The sun's emissions drive our weather and climate. It is our closest connection to the basic forces that control the universe. And of course, without the sun's warming rays, life would be impossible. Virtually every source of energy we possess - with the exception of nuclear power - is derived from solar radiation. Coal and oil are by-products of plants and animals that once thrived in ancient sunlight. </p> <p>Yet we now know the light that provided this precious sustenance has taken a very long time to reach us. The sunbeams that shine on us today began their journey before the last ice age and needed hundreds of thousands of years to push their way through the maelstrom of activity below the sun's surface. </p> <p>'It is incredibly hot and dense down there,' said Professor Richard Harrison, of the Rutherford Laboratory. 'Light is generated by particles and is then absorbed and re-emitted by other particles. The process goes on for aeons before light can reach the surface.' After that, it is a mere eight-minute skip across the 93-million mile gap to the Earth. </p> <p>'The sun is not a simple ball of incandescent gas in which hydrogen is quietly being transformed by nuclear fusion into helium,' he added. 'It seethes with activity. Satellites images make it look more like a great plate of writhing spaghetti. Great loops of energy shimmer and twist and occasionally break, hurling huge globs of matter, made up of millions of cubic kilometres of plasma, into space.' </p> <p>And when these coronal mass ejections, as they are known, strike Earth, we feel the impact. Powerful aurora displays appear over the poles, the electronics on satellites are fried, and entire power grids are disrupted. In 1989 a solar storm plunged Quebec into darkness, leaving seven million people without electricity. </p> <p>'Basically, when the sun sneezes we all catch a cold,' said Cambridge astronomer Paul Murdin. </p> <p>In an attempt to understand this solar influenza, a flotilla of four European satellites called Cluster is now swooping around the sun, analysing the streams of particles that pour from its surface. The aim is to predict storms that could otherwise devastate our modern electronically dependant world. </p> <p>But the sun does more than merely disrupt communications and power. Scientists have found that during the 17th and 18th century, sunspots completely disappeared. At the same time, the world plunged into a period called the Little Ice Age. Inuit paddled kayaks from Greenland to tour Scotland's icy coastline, snow fell in summertime, while crops failed and famines killed millions. Scientists believe the two phenomena - cold and lack of sunspots - are closely connected. </p> <p>'We still do not exactly understand the correlation, but it is clear that the sun does not behave in a static, unchanging manner and these alterations have a major impact on our climate,' Priest said. 'Given humanity's role in triggering global warming, it is vital we discover if the sun is going to mitigate or enhance man-made global warming.' </p> <p>Such interest explains the armada being sent, or about to be sent, to study the sun. As well as Soho and Cluster, new missions include Stereo - in which one spaceship will fly ahead of and another behind Earth as it orbits, creating 3-D images of the sun - and Solar Orbiter, which will swoop close to the sun's surface to gain a detailed view of its surface. The lessons learned will be of critical importance not just to understanding our own planet but in providing a key to the rest of the universe. </p> <p>'The sun gives us our only chance to study another star,' said the Open University's Professor Colin Pillinger, one of the scientists who had been hoping to study particles returned by Genesis. </p> <p>'The planets were all created from debris left over from the sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. We also know that the moon and Earth are isotopically very similar and must have a common origin. Mars is different, however. So we want to know which - Earth or Mars - is more like the sun. If Earth is different, we will then want to know why. Perhaps we are made of material left over from an earlier part of the universe's history.' </p> <p>It is a fairly dramatic prospect, and explains why astronomers are so fascinated by the sun. It also explains why scientists will be spending all that time and effort, scrabbling on their knees looking for fragments of Genesis's cargo on the Utah desert floor this week. A little bit of sunshine could tell us an awful lot. </p> <p><strong>Light of our lives </strong></p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The sun is 70 per cent hydrogen and 28 per cent helium. The rest mainly carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> It is 6,000C at its surface; 15,000,000C at its core. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Its diameter is 870,000 miles, 109 times larger than the Earth's. Over a million Earths can fit in its volume.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Average distance from the Earth is 93 million miles. The next nearest star is 24 billion billion miles away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Wayuu people of South America believe the sun and moon are procreating during eclipses and so avert their eyes.</p>",
  "<p>Beccy, 21, is about to become a student and wants to avoid getting into debt. She writes:</p> <p>'I will be starting a degree at art college in London in October. I left home over a year ago to do an art foundation course, but the art of budgeting continues to elude me. During term time, I never seem to have any money left at the end of the month, though I have managed to stay out of debt so far. </p> <p>I am aware that the London life comes at a price and that I will have to pay out a fair amount for art materials. I am currently working as a waitress to try and build up some savings but when I start my degree I hope to spend most of my time in the studio rather than behind the counter at the local kebab house. </p> <p>I need help in working out how to make the most of the funds available to me over the next three years or so, without storing up trouble for the future. </p> <p>My parents have remortgaged their house to provide a fund of \u00a320,000 for myself and my brother, who is also starting his university course this year. While I am very grateful, I am worried about the implications for them as regards interest and repayments. My childhood home was repossessed in the early 1990s when they could not keep up mortgage repayments, which has made me wary of getting into debt and unsure of how to use this money. </p> <p>I have applied for the full student loan (around \u00a34,500 a year, I believe, for students living away from home in London). I have roughly \u00a33,000 in savings from a friendly society policy my mother took out for me, and I also intend to work during the holidays. </p> <p>How should I manage these sums? I have around \u00a31,000 in a mini cash Isa and a current account with Nationwide, which does not provide a specialised student account. Do you recommend switching to a bank that does? </p> <p>Are there any good ethical choices? And finally, are there any steps I can take now to safeguard my financial future after graduation - apart from swapping art for accountancy?'</p> <p><strong>'Set yourself a budget - and stick to it'</strong></p> <p>The fact that you are thinking seriously about how to manage your money now before you get to uni is a good omen for the future. Some students who have not managed their own financial affairs start getting into debt almost immediately by going out every night. That you have kept out of the red in your foundation year also shows you must be on the right track. </p> <p>You are right to be wary about the cost of living in London. It is the most expensive option for students. The National Union of Students puts the cost of university, including tuition fees and living expenses, at an estimated \u00a38,500 a year, but in London that rises to more than \u00a310,000. So your student loan, if you qualify for the maximum of \u00a35,050 (in London), will only go half way to covering it.</p> <p>The best thing to do with your money is to give yourself a monthly budget and stick to it. Joanne Cox of Co-operative Bank Financial Advisers says the secret of budgeting is to keep it simple.</p> <p>She explains: 'The student loan will be dispensed in three parts at the start of each semester. Divide up how much you have by the number of weeks you need it to last. Similarly divide up the funds from your parents into the number of years and then months you will need it for. If you are not sure you can resist dipping into it, ask them to keep the funds on deposit and forward your allowance each month by standing order.'</p> <p>She suggests you write down how much income you will have available for the month or week in a notebook. Start by deducting any standing orders or direct debits and then make a note every time you spend money, withdraw cash or write a cheque. She says: 'It is amazing how natural it becomes to keep within budget if you can literally see the money going down.'</p> <p>To be really disciplined, you should note down every purchase you make, be it food, cosmetics or a night out. That way you can see exactly where the money is going and work out where you can make savings should you need to.</p> <p>Anne-Marie Blake, head of NatWest Student and Graduate Banking, recommends you withdraw your spending money on a set day each week rather than keep visiting the cash machine for a tenner here and a tenner there, which can easily push you over your financial limit. Look for ways of cutting costs: 'Shop for food with friends - buying in bulk can save money and lets you take advantage of \"buy one get one free\" offers. Make sure you claim discounts with your NUS card and also look in your Student Union for one-off deals,' she suggests.</p> <p>Opening a specific student bank account is probably a good idea as it will give you a built-in safety net in the form of an overdraft facility, which will usually be free if you keep within the limits. Free overdraft limits generally start at \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,250 in the first year rising to \u00a31,600 in the third year. Blake points out that as they are interest free, it may be worth using that facility rather than withdrawing savings, which will be attracting good rates of interest. But if you do not feel comfortable with that idea, there is no need to use your overdraft facility unless you really have to.</p> <p>Most of the main high street banks offer student accounts. Check out the incentives on offer - some will save you a lot of money. If you are expecting to travel home regularly to visit your parents, NatWest's free five-year young persons railcard could come in useful and will save you \u00a3100.</p> <p>If you want an ethical option, there is the Co-operative Bank's student account. This offers free overdraft facilities but no incentives. Full details of the bank's ethical policy can be found on its website <a href=\"http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk\">www.co-operativebank.co.uk</a>. Another useful website is <a href=\"http://www.hotcourses.co.uk/studentmoney\">www.hotcourses.co.uk/studentmoney</a> which also has guides to award funding, grants, budget planners and loan repayment tables.</p> <p>Cox advises that you make use of the services of the Students Union. They will have lots of useful advice and information on all aspects of college life.</p> <p>The good news, according to NatWest's research, is that the average starting salary for graduates rose 7 per cent from \u00a312,659 to \u00a313,600 this year. This proves, says Blake, that 'the cost of university is clearly an investment in your future earning potential'.</p> <p><strong>Beccy's to-do list</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Work out how much you will have available to spend each month. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Ask your parents to set up a standing order to your account.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Buy yourself a notebook and write down everything you spend so you know exactly how much you have left.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Make use of student discounts and other money-saving offers.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Open a student bank account that offers a free overdraft facility.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Remember that just because you have an overdraft facility, you do not have to use it.</p> <p><strong>Let us help you</strong></p> <p>Do you need some financial coaching?

  "<p>Broxburn industrial estate, under the flight path of Edinburgh's busy international airport, is not where you'd expect to find tranquillity, but that's where Glenmorangie - Scots Gaelic for 'vale of tranquillity' - is based, and from where the company is running a \u00a3300 million global auction of its business. </p> <p>This is a big thing in Scotland, and in the drinks industry, where good brands - and Glenmorangie is up there with the best - do not come on the market so frequently. And when one is sold, there is often an outburst of national indignation that another great Scots brand is being handed over to the global giants. </p> <p>So far, that has not been the case with Glenmorangie, although news of its sale - prematurely broken in the business pages a few weeks back - sent a temporary shock through the 111-year sold company. Paul Neep, chief executive for the past seven years, admits: 'It was a surprise to the board, but it was obviously a family decision.' </p> <p>The family in this case is the Macdonald clan, who founded Glenmorangie in 1893 and who have a holding equivalent to just over 50 per cent of the voting shares and one third of the value - making the the 15 or so family members worth something over \u00a3100m. </p> <p>David Macdonald, the 71-year-old family patriarch, could have been portrayed as a betrayer of Scotland's whisky heritage, but in fact he has had a largely sympathetic press. Old hands at Brox burn regret the need for change, but understand why it had to happen: 'If I had the chance of \u00a3100m in the bank I'd sell too,' said one long-term employee. </p> <p>Neep, and his deputy and finance director Iain Hamilton, recognise the reality of the situation: 'At the end of the day, the shareholders decide. And I can see why they'd want to sell now,' says Neep. </p> <p>It was no sudden decision by the Macdonalds. David, who retired as chairman 10 years ago, was the last of the male line of the family who wanted any executive role with Glenmorangie. Of his four daughters, two work for the firm, but not at an executive level. 'He had reached an age where he had to think of how the family wealth would be passed on,' says a financier close to the auction process. </p> <p>With family shareholdings becoming increasingly unpopular with City investors (see below), the Macdonalds really had only one option - to sell their stake - and this would inevitably trigger a change of ownership. </p> <p>Commercial considerations, of course, were high up the Macdonalds' priorities. The shares were approaching all-time-high levels as the markets got the message that Glenmorangie had been transformed under Neep and Hamilton, and was close to achieving 'superbrand' status within the multi-billion-pound Scotch whisky market. </p> <p>It is important to clarify from the outset that Glenmorangie is not just any old whisky, something to have with Coke or lemonade, or to add to the post-prandial coffee. It - and the other big brands in the portfolio, Glen Moray and Ardbeg - are single malts made with loving care at the Tain distillery in Ross-shire. According to the legend, the 16 'men of Tain' still hold the secrets of the distillation process that gives the whisky its characteristic flavour, highly praised by malt aficionados. </p> <p>Malt sales have been rising as 'ordinary' - blended - Scotch sales fell back in the Nineties. With the average age of drinkers getting higher, Scotch had an image problem: it was the drink your parents had in the cabinet, and therefore was not likely to appeal. </p> <p>The marketing slant of the malt whisky makers changed to reflect the unique 'matureness' of the product, and the customer. If you knew your single malts, you were a creature of serious sophistication. Discerning the subtle variations on the malt distilling process - ageing in different kinds of wood and for longer periods before bottling - became a skill similar to that of a wine expert in telling different grapes and vineyards. </p> <p>Take a look through the Glenmorangie annual report to appreciate the marketing technique. The happy-looking drinkers are thirtysomething metropolitans, discerning professionals who appreciate the heritage of single malts and the prestige of the brand. </p> <p>This upmarket strategy was the brainchild of Neep and Hamilton. 'We are focused and brand-driven, and there is a passion and belief inside the company that the brands can work for you,' says Neep. </p> <p>Under their regime, it certainly has worked for Glenmorangie. The eponymous brand this year replaced Glenlivet as the number one single malt in Britain, and it is making serious inroads into foreign markets - the US, Canada, Germany and Scandinavia all have a taste for the malt, while drinkers in Japan and Taiwan are also beginning to develop a liking for it. </p> <p>The Far East was the growth engine for the last great wave of expansion in whisky sales in theNineties, and Neep sees it as the big opportunity for malts too. 'A lot of young Taiwanese are drinking malts - it's an increasingly important area,' he says. </p> <p>So, under new management and with the hiccup of the Nineties behind it, the future looks good for Glenmorangie's business. It looks an attractive asset that in most sectors would command a queue of potential buyers - from the trade, venture capitalists, even management buyouts. </p> <p>But the se rules do not apply to the drinks business. The global spirits industry is dominated by the big international groups - Diageo, Allied Domecq, Brown Forman, Bacardi Martini, Pernod Ricard, and LVMH. Smaller groups such as Glenmorangie need to do deals with these giants to ensure all-important distribution overseas, and this is a decisive factor in the financing of a disposal. </p> <p>Put simply, non-trade buyers - including the management - cannot produce the synergies to make a deal work at the suggested \u00a3300m price-tag. So, despite all their experience and acumen, Neep and Hamilton will not get a chance to mount an MBO. 'It was obvious early on that a management buyout was very unlikely,' says Neep, 'so the priorities became getting the best deal for shareholders, and protecting employment.' </p> <p>There is some uneasiness among Glenmorangie's 360-strong workforce that a big multinational would axe jobs in Scotland and destroy the special relationship has with its workers - the firm was recently voted the second best company to work for in Scotland. </p> <p>But it is not inevitable this would happen. Brown Forman, for example, the American producer of Jack Daniels that has a 10 per cent stake in the Scots firm and distribution agreements all over the world, would not want to destroy the brand value by hacking back its Scots heritage. </p> <p>Of the other possible bidders, Diageo, which dominates the Scotch whisky industry, is probably out of the frame because of its huge market position; Bacardi could emerge as a serious challenge to the giant American, but industry observers believe Allied, LVMH and Pernod are less interested. The outside money is going on CL Financial, a big financial conglomerate that recently moved into wines and distillers. </p> <p>As for price, Glenmorangie's advisers are coy, but \u00a3300m seems eminently achievable. Hamilton is quick to point out that the company's stock of malt and other whiskies - carried on the book at historic cost of \u00a383m, but insured for closer to \u00a3500m - would be worth \u00a3230m on its own if sold on the bulk market. </p> <p>And that leaves out the value of the brand. 'Nobody else in the world can produce Glenmorangie,' says Neep, 'and it's taken us and the Macdonalds 40 years to build the brand. That must be worth a premium.' </p> <p>And what will happen to the duo when the new owner is named? 'We've both got a passionate affection for the business, but we're just employees, like everybody else. We'd love to stay on, but it's not up to us,' says Neep. Hamilton is in full agreement.</p> <p><strong>Why the Macdonald clan want to sell their heritage</strong></p> <p>The Macdonalds, benevolent owners of the Glenmorangie business for 111 years, are the latest example of a trend that has changed the face of British business over the past three decades, and which promises to lead to further transformations in the near future. </p> <p>The City does not like family-controlled companies. And it likes even less family companies with split share structures.</p> <p>For decades, family businesses dominated the stock markets. The Bernsteins, the Pearsons and the Fortes are all examples of families that started firms, floated them, and finally came under pressure to reduce their hold. The Sainsbury family is now feeling the same pressure.</p> <p>Some of them - like the Macdonalds - developed a weighted share structure in which different classes of shares had different voting strengths. At Glenmorangie, the class B shares have five times the voting strength of the more heavily traded class As, giving the Macdonalds majority control. In theory, this could have led to a conflict of interest with the senior management. If the executive board wanted to raise capital or make an expensive acquisition, it would have to go to the market for approval. But the City would be likely to insist on structural changes as a pre-condition of opening the purse-strings.</p> <p>There were other factors peculiar to Glenmorangie, however. David Macdonald, who ran the business until 10 years ago, is father of four daughters, but it appears that none of them wanted an executive role in the traditionally male-dominated Scotch business.</p> <p>At the same time, as advisers explain, he was conscious of his advancing years, and of the firm's advancing share strength. Earlier this year, on behalf of the 15 or so other family members who held shares, he decided the time for a sale had come.</p> <p>It may not be just the Macdonalds who get the benefit of the Glenmorangie windfall. The family's trust, which holds the majority of the shares, is a real charitable institution and may be able to make significantly bigger donations to its favoured causes - mainly cancer research organisations - on the back of a \u00a3100 million sale.</p> <p>As for the Glenmorangie workers, it is still unclear whether or not they will share in the Macdonalds' good fortune - but such an idea has not been ruled out.</p>",
  "<p>HBOS is gearing up to launch a \u00a310 billion hostile bid for Abbey National, possibly as early as this week.</p> <p>Provided that rival bidder Santander's offer document is sent to Abbey shareholders in the next few days, HBOS chief executive James Crosby will call a board meeting where he is expected to receive unanimous support for a bid offering Abbey shareholders about 700p a share. </p> <p>Observers warn that the timing of the bid could slip, but that HBOS is 'psychologically prepared' for hostilities to begin against Santander almost immediately. </p> <p>HBOS's offer would value the former building society at \u00a310.5bn against an all-shares bid from Santander, the Spanish banking giant based in Madrid, which values Abbey at just shy of \u00a39bn. </p> <p>But Santander is expected to sweeten its offer. A revised package would include a cash element, 'which could be worth several billion', said one investment banker. </p> <p>Crosby has the full backing of the bank's chairman, Lord Stevenson, and other non-executive directors. But City sources say HBOS may opt for a bid that would be conditional on its offer not being referred to the Competition Commission by the Office of Fair Trading. </p> <p>If HBOS stepped back in the event of a referral, Crosby would still have secured two objectives. The first was attained last week when Santander said it was selling half its shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and that its alliance with RBS would be scrapped should it acquire Abbey. </p> <p>Crosby has been worried that RBS could leverage its alliance with Santander to allow the two to work together against HBOS in the event of a Santander victory. </p> <p>His second objective, to force the Spanish to pay more for Abbey, would also have been attained. </p> <p>Investors expect HBOS to launch a bid, despite suspicions in some quarters of the City that Crosby could ditch his plans at the last minute. </p> <p>The only issue to be resolved is whether Crosby should pursue a bid for Abbey in the event of a referral, which would carry the risk that the authorities would block HBOS on competition grounds. </p> <p>If HBOS bought Abbey, the combined company would control 34 per cent of the mortgage market and 29 per cent of savings, but would speak for a relatively small part of business banking and current accounts: about 15 per cent. </p> <p>It was the potential impact on competition in current accounts and small business banking which persuaded the regulator to block Lloyds TSB's bid for Abbey in 2001. </p> <p>If HBOS bids, Lloyds and other high street clearers may also enter the fray.</p>",

After a couple of decades spent sating an unquenchable thirst for news, for the first time I'd hit the wall.</p> <p>I tuned, warily, into the BBC's 10 O'Clock News last Tuesday and noticed that the reliably chipper Huw Edwards looked a bit weary as he prepared viewers, already reeling from BBC1's Whistleblower, for perhaps the most horrific piece of footage I have ever seen: the Beslan hostage-takers' video from inside the school, which I viewed through my fingers, head-in-hands, shaking in disbelief.</p> <p>It does a soul no good to see images of such extraordinary cruelty, to know that so many of those terrified seminaked children, parents, teachers and carers huddled around the tripwired explosives guarded by hooded captors, were waiting to die and, as a result, I cannot be alone in having felt depressed and nervily on-edge all week. I even started wondering whether it was sensible to board the flights my family and I were booked to take on 11 September.</p> <p>Every synapse of my brain screamed: 'Don't be so bloody stupid!' Every sinew of my heart told me that this irrational, low-level, nonspecific, batten-down-thehatches kind of niggling fear is now as virulently contagious and incurable as the common cold.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, the third anniversary of 11 September might have been better marked with less in the way of alarmist documentaries (C4's The 9/11 Conspiracies), dramatised terrorthons (BBC2's The Grid) and undercover reporting with hidden cameras (the aforementioned Whistleblower, a depressing but somehow entirely unsurprising investigation into non-existent security at Manchester airport) and more in the way of... oh, I don't know, wildlife docs, comedies or just plain old-fashioned fun dramas, such as Sunday night's excellent ITV1 offering, Quite Ugly One Morning, which starred Jimmy Nesbitt as a dishevelled journalist who looked not unlike the way I was feeling.</p> <p>Once upon a fading memory, the grimmest thing that happened during the first week of September was returning to school. From now on it means recalling the Russian children who went to school and never came home, and watching that Twin Towers footage over and over, ad infinitum. And if you think these anniversaries may one day pass unmarked by television, forget it. Come the end of August, seven years after the event, there's still room for a few Diana documentaries; the fact that there's really nothing left to say on the subject of a woman who died in a accidental car crash notwithstanding.</p> <p>BBC2 nearly pulled The Grid, which ran over three nights last week, because it featured a Chechen terrorist, but they would have been better off taking it out of the schedule for the simple reason that, despite its $20 million of co-production cash and a starry cast, it had apparently been scripted by Spock at his most dementedly logical.</p> <p>A slick thriller focusing on transatlantic tensions in the field of joint counter-terrorism, the first episode kicked off with a Sarin gas attack and closed with a handful of bombs, but scarifying timeliness alone was not enough to engage this viewer's emotions or, apparently, even those of the actors. Julianna Margulies, in particular, delivered most of her lines as if she was reading from cue cards, while a let's-help-Middle- America-understand-the- Middle-East approach to the screenplay made for some of the most excruciating exposition ever committed to film.</p> <p>'Islam inspired a humane civilisation and made some of the greatest contributions to the culture of mankind,' corrected one counter-terrorism character, face full of po, after Margulies had embarked on a rant about the perceived subjugation of Muslim women. In response to being shamelessly patronised surely most viewers on this side of the pond would have shouted 'shut up and get on with the plot...' Or was that just me?</p> <p>Then it turned out that those few bits of the script that hadn't been penned by Spock and rewritten by the Inter-Faith Committee For Wearisome Political Correctness had been got at by an undercover operative disguised as a dandy highwayman: 'Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?' inquired Jemma Redgrave of another Goody Two Shoes spook; to which Adam Ant would have replied: 'Put on a little make-up, make-up / Make sure they get your good side, good side'.</p> <p>In contrast to The Grid, I tuned into BBC2's Crisis Command: Could You Run the Country? expecting very little and ended up gripped, not to mention exhausted. This clever little exercise in scaring us witless made three members of the public government ministers for a day, gave them access to advice and information from assorted experts and stood by as they attempted to handle a national emergency by making decisions on a multiple choice basis. In this case, the first of four manufactured crises, it was an outbreak of plague in a Liverpool hospital.</p> <p>The quasi-cabinet comprised Andrew Morris, the boss of Earl's Court and Olympia, Sahar Hashemi, the co-founder of a chain of coffee shops, and Carmel McConnell, the chair of a children's charity, assisted by the former assistant chief of defence staff, Sir Timothy Garden, the ex-Conservative Party spinmistress, Amanda Platell, and a former emergency services adviser, Charles Shoebridge. The latter all bustled with convincing authority and clearly relished their improvised scripts, which involved barking stuff like, 'Ministers, please make decisions based on the facts as they actually stand rather than as you would wish them to be', which had the ring of truth.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the plague scenario unfolded, with actors playing doctors in the hospital and riot police outside, the crisis cabinet made one bad decision after another, after another. Having ordered hospital staff to treat infected patients before contamination suits had arrived, rejected the help of the army, attempted to evacuate non-plague patients instead of sealing the hospital, vaccinated plague victims instead of emergency services staff and employed riot control measures to combat escapees but without authorising the use of firearms, they ended up making only two correct decisions: to be truthful with the media and tell them that there was an outbreak of plague, and to authorise the use of vaccines still undergoing tests. Bizarrely, this all made for genuinely edge-ofthe- seat viewing. As they failed to contain the outbreak and watched films of the hordes (well, a hordlet of about six people - but this was the BBC) of panicked rioters breaking out of the hospital and taking to the streets of Liverpool, the Cabinet's expressions said a great deal, though the results of their actions said even more: 75,000 people infected, 49,000 dead and a cost of \u00a356 billion to the economy. There's no room for humane approaches in this kind of crisis, apparently - it's strictly a shoot-firstask- questions-later-andthen- try-suing-us scenario. Next week it's flooding. Better start building that Ark.</p> <p>What with being holed up at home and subject to televisual outbreaks of terrorism and plague, I was more than ready for the on-themoney (titlewise at least) new BBC1 series Should I Worry About...? presented by Richard Hammond, the glove compartment-sized accessory from Top Gear.</p> <p>What, after all, could possibly be left to worry about - other than, perhaps, for Hammond, the fact that the BBC had given him something tiny, pastel-coloured, girly, hatchbacky (Ford Pingu? Daihatsu Tweenie? Nissan Noddy?) and quite obviously mortifying to have to be seen driving as he buzzed chirpily round the country trying to prove that mobile phones fry our brains. Unfortunately nothing was proved other than that prime time programmes about how mobile phones might fry your brains are capable of turning the discerning viewer's mightiest organ into something resembling chopped liver. As investigations go this was presumably meant to be the week's light-ent.</p> <p>Finally, deadlines preclude me from ever reviewing the most recent Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, on BBC1, or the new ITV1 Parkinson (indistinguishable from the BBC version), so I ask you to cast your mind back a week or so, when Ross, who gives great Radio 2 but can't do interviews, 'interviewed' Paul Newman, while Parkinson, who can do interviews, was stuck with Tom Cruise, who looks as though he might, but doesn't.</p> <p>A guest-swap would have worked. Ross and Cruise could have joshed their way cheerfully through 15 minutes or so, while Parky would have made the most of Newman, who doesn't like interviews much but might have been seduced none the less.</p> <p>After Parky was forced to indulge Cruise's soliloquy on the subject of Scientology while ignoring the stuff we really want to know about, namely Nicole, I noticed that ITV1 screened the risible John Travolta movie Battlefield Earth, from an original load of old codswallop by L. Ron Hubbard. Just who is this Scientologist scheduler at ITV1 and how dare they hijack Saturday, currently the most banal but, thankfully, also the least doomladen night of the entire television week?</p>",
  "<p>Journalism scrambles to keep up with the muddled, messy happenings of the day; history arranges the snapshots into a picture, or into what used to be called a history painting. Napoleonic soldiers gunned down Spanish protesters on 3 May 1808. Goya, painting the scene, organised the resistance into a martyrdom, with one victim stretching out his arms in a crucified pose as the bullets jolt him. German planes bombarded the Basque town of Guernica in April 1937. Picasso's grandiose mural treated the calamity as a classical tragedy, with tormented statues grimacing at the sky as mythic monsters rampage through the streets. Between the event and the representation there was, traditionally, a pause for thought. The images that commemorated such disasters, or the stories told about them, consciously took sides and pointed morals. They did so in retrospect, reviving a moment from the past in order to ponder its significance. Today, the technologies of news-gathering have accelerated the cycle and garbled it; the event is interpreted for us while we're watching it happen, and the interpreters are participants. In Beslan last week, photographers raced into the besieged school along with the rescuers, and reporters quizzed traumatised children on their way to hospital. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a continent away, erstwhile SAS officers who had been plucked from lunch and taxied to television studios opined about a story that was still taking place, pretending to see through the smoke and the agitated crowds. Picture editors scanned a gusher of digital images, and made impromptu choices about which incident to pick out of the affray and what meaning to attach to it. No one had time to wonder about the ethics or even the aesthetics of what they were doing. </p> <p>Should the hunters and gatherers of news have thrown down their equipment and helped the rescuers? However gamely they dodged bullets, they seemed unaware of the moral dangers that beset them. On the one hand, they were abetting the hostage-takers, who had made their own video record of the siege and expected the media to publicise their cause. </p> <p>On the other hand, they were entertaining a public at home that could watch the anguish of all these Caucasian strangers with a sort of theoretical sympathy, as if at a disaster movie: of course it was terrible, but - like fiction - it was situated at a safe, comfortable distance from our reality. The news has become another consumer item.The satellite receivers on our roofs are called dishes, and they feed us images. Have we developed an appetite for horrors like this? Susan Sontag, in her recent meditation on the pleasure we derive from reading about and watching the pain of others, contends that photojournalism was a product of war, and accuses it of being hungry for conflict, thirsty for gore. The US army shrewdly exploited this craving when it 'embedded' reporters with troops on the front line in Iraq. Closeness to the action makes the observer a combatant, and eliminates critical distance. It can also provoke a mad, self-dramatising bravado. The Life photographer Robert Capa waded ashore with the troops on D-Day, and played hide and seek with snipers during the Allied liberation of Paris. Was he supplying the magazine's readers with information, or with vicarious thrills? If war correspondents are heroic figures, that means that war itself is accorded a swaggering, reckless heroism. It's interesting that Sky News dispatched a female reporter to Beslan. Perhaps the aim was to neutralise Sontag's claim that war is a thing for guys, and to forestall butch attitudinising; certainly, as she hyperventilated her way through the commentary, Rachel Amatt sounded terrified. But there may have been another, more cynical calculation behind her assignment. The story was about children and their agonised, grieving mothers: did the bosses think that a woman would be a more emotionally ingratiating witness? </p> <p>For the people of Beslan, it made little difference. Unedited, unmediated, Sky's live reports couldn't help revealing what the locals thought of the contingent of electronic voyeurs who had descended on them. A rescue worker gruffly pushed a camera out of the way; a woman deranged by sorrow battered another lens as if blaming it for what had happened. If the journalists were present as extensions of our eyes, these gestures warned that we had no business to be looking at any of this. </p> <p>As the coverage continued on that Friday afternoon, I began to realise that the documentation on offer was not to be trusted. News doesn't unstoppably happen 24 hours a day. Only a few minutes of live footage was transmitted from the scene as the hostages escaped; looped, the same shots of children in their underwear fleeing down a smoky alley were endlessly repeated, like action replays of goals in football. On the soundtrack, ownerless and irresponsible voices confidently relayed what we were asked to accept as facts. </p> <p>A boy rushing out was asked whether there were any dead bodies inside. He mumbled something and ran on; he was said to have answered 'No, there aren't.' Later, an invisible reporter announced 'We are assured that all the children are safe.' Everyone was anxious to sort out the confusion into a story, and if possible to give it a happy ending. Hence this peddling of false, premature consolation. </p> <p>By mid-afternoon, as it became clear that the outcome would be grimmer, Sky produced another version of the story. One of its hourly news bulletins accompanied the same flustered, incoherent footage with a musical commentary: a Mahlerian threnody, as if a symphony orchestra had been sent to Beslan to assist the journalists. That mournful music exposed the purpose of such reporting. </p> <p>Rather than transmitting facts, it exists to stir up emotions - literally to orchestrate them. And those emotions, despite the misery that provokes them, are bound to be pleasurable, allowing us to congratulate ourselves on our capacity for fellow-feeling (and on our good fortune on not being Caucasian). </p> <p>Over the weekend, the newspapers defined themselves by the images they selected to encapsulate the story. The Sunday Times devoted its front page to three frames recording the fate of one victim. A little girl is ejected from the gym by an explosion, rocketed to safety by the blast. In the next frame, she picks herself up and - wretchedly skinny, stripped, with scratched and bruised legs - climbs back into the building. (The caption, with fussily intrusive empathy, attributed a motive to her irrational, disoriented act: 'perhaps she was seeking her relatives'.) The third frame has the brash eloquence of one of those cartoons that screech CRASH! BAM! POW! as Tom pummels Jerry. It simply shows a furnace inside what used to be the gym: blown free, the anonymous child returned just in time to die. </p> <p>Photographs have no fixed meaning until they are interpreted. That interpreting is an insidious process, because the decisions being made - how to crop an image, what text to underpin it with - remain out of sight. Hence the distress I feel when looking at and thinking about an image in last weekend's edition of the Paris paper Lib\u00e9ration. It's a photograph that is truly pictorial - almost a Nativity scene, just as Goya's painting of that political execution in 1808 was a crucifixion. A young, beautiful woman in black kneels on the grass and lays a soothing hand on the brow of her baby, wrapped in white on a stretcher. This woman had obviously emerged as one of the photogenic protagonists at Beslan: she can be seen from another angle in the Spanish paper El Mundo, so she must have surrounded by snappers, like Mary in the manger with her attendant wise men and genuflecting cattle. </p> <p>It looks like a tender vignette until you read the Lib\u00e9ration caption: 'Une femme devant le corps de son enfant mort' ('Woman with the body of her dead child'). That surely orders us, too late, to look away. Yet when the same photograph appeared in Aujourd'hui en France, the caption didn't declare the baby to be dead. How could it be, since its face is uncovered? If it were, wouldn't its mother have been cradling it rather than extending that soothing hand? Perhaps I am fondly clinging to a delusive hope. Still, I can't help wondering whether the picture editor at Lib\u00e9ration simply killed off the child in the caption to increase the photograph's payload. </p> <p>On the cover of that issue, Lib\u00e9ration at least had the delicacy to crop the close-up of another small girl - her face paralysed in a rictus of terror - being rushed away in the arms of a rescuer. The Russian newspaper Argumenty i Facty included some extra, subliminal details, censored by the placing of the frame in Lib\u00e9ration: the rescuer grabs the girl under her knees, so her bottom sags close to the camera, which unforgivably stares at her panties. The sexual flagrancy of the image is contradicted (or, if you like, intensified) by the way her bare feet are locked into position, as if frozen, like her face, by fear. I'd call the bottom half of this photograph obscene: it is, quite literally, something we should not be allowed to see. </p> <p>The image on the cover of Izvestia, whose reporting so angered Putin that he had the paper's editor sacked, is disturbing for similar reasons. What enraged the apparatchiks in the Kremlin was the visual evidence of mismanagement and confusion, grainily captured inside Izvestia by stilled frames taken from CNN and BBC World. Chaos is the natural condition of live coverage; it also damagingly demonstrates that no one is in charge. Yet the photograph on the cover of the paper could be posed, because it teasingly alludes to scenes of exotic carnage and blowsy carnality painted by Titian, Rubens and Delacroix. This woman is an adult: the tableau might be a rape not a rescue. Izvestia observed the decorums by air-brushing her nipple, though it's still visible as a bud of pixels. But why did they leave in the thin black tracery of the thong she's apparently wearing? Morgen in Hamburg ran a variant, with another grizzled rescuer leading out another nubile woman. Her hair is wet, tousled; she is wearing a denim skirt and a lacy bra. The German caption excused our salacious gaze by scanning her exposed body for information. 'Because of the heat inside,' it said with leaden Teutonic obviousness, 'she is half-naked.' Jean-Luc Godard once sourly remarked that all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun. Beslan, seen like this, was ripe for exploitation. The headline above the photograph in the Hamburg paper referred to the siege as a drama, and broadcast a line of dialogue in loud, bold type: 'We drank urine.' </p> <p>The other side of this brazen titillation is a sanctimonious sentimentality. The Italian paper Il Messaggero found it only too easy to classify the images it ran as specimens of baroque religious art, operatically distraught but piously uplifting. A naked boy in one photograph is clutched by a commando, who presses his rifle to the child's vulnerable, shivering flesh. Perversity into magicked into something more mawkish by the caption, which is 'Il Bambino ed Il Soldato'. You don't need the words to tell you that you're looking at a boy and a soldier; they're not informative but manipulative, since they turn the scene into another allegorical tableau, equating grace and goodness with the possession of a weapon. </p> <p>Ethical scruples may make us avert our gaze from such images. But are we then colluding with the politicians who want to suppress them because of the inconvenient truths they tell? Bush's aides scheme to keep the cameras away from the coffins of GIs killed in Iraq, believing that death has not really happened unless it is photographed; Putin, railing at Izvestia, hoped to make the problem of Beslan disappear by regarding it with blind, official eyes. </p> <p>Brought to heel on 7 September, Izvestia replaced broken bodies with a minimal list of names and faceless numbers. Its evasively artful front-cover photograph - cramped into a corner and surrounded by tracts of extenuating print - had two silhouettes pointing to some sheets of paper that tallied casualties. The shadows belonged to bodies that remained outside the frame; the names were unfocused and therefore unreadable. The human tragedy had been effaced. </p> <p>On an inside page, Putin was seen touching a child in a hospital bed. But photography is tactless and coldly candid; even tyrants (who prefer portrait painters) can't ensure that it flatters them. This image assaulted Putin more scurrilously than any caricature could have done. His hand cursorily rests on the sheet; there is no contact, because the sick child, perhaps unconscious, is facing the other way. And the uncropped version, which appeared in El Pa\u00eds last Sunday, included an additional snub. Beside the bed is a black-clad relative, a generic Russian babushka, who turns her back on the President and supports her face with her weary hands, lost in a private, incommunicable despair. This photo-opportunity proved inopportune. </p> <p>First impressions - as the children gulped water or were bundled onto makeshift stretchers and driven to hospital in derelict cars - were of mayhem and panic, conveyed with raw verisimilitude by the news channels. 'LIVE' in the corner of the screen means shapeless, anarchic. By Tuesday, when the funerals began, the story was tidied up, ennobled and beautified. The photograph by Sergei Chirikov on the cover of the Times that day could not have been further from those initial blurred, unintelligible documents of people running through rubble. The heads of two female mourners on a bus leaving a cemetery lean together, pressing cheek to cheek like one face duplicated by a mirror; between black scarves and black dresses, their skin is drained, pale. They are seen through the bus window on a wet day, so the blotched pane of glass is a veil of tears. The window muffles the siren song of their wailing, and the raindrops merge with the soft, liquid-looking beads of a necklace. The photograph's effect is intolerably decorative: its prettiness, I suppose, announces closure, since Chirikov was more worried about composition than commiseration. </p> <p>The reporters had now turned into narrators, laying the event to rest as if interring it. On Wednesday morning, Jonathan Charles in a BBC News broadcast referred to 'last Friday's denouement'. Debacle, I'd have thought, might have been a better word; a denouement is the untying of a knot, sorting out the snarled complexities in a literary plot. That same day a Times journalist came up with an anecdote that read like an excerpt from a novel. The hostage-takers had told one woman that she could leave the school with her two-year-old son if she left her six-year-old daughter behind. Bargaining was not possible: the only alternative was for all three to stay. </p> <p>Zalina Dzandarova agonised, then chose to save her little boy; as she walked out, her deserted daughter screamed at the betrayal. This is, of course, the situation examined by William Styron in Sophie's Choice. But art, as always, is more satisfactory and orderly than life. Sophie lets the Auschwitz guards take her daughter off to be gassed, and by her choice earns a reprieve for her son. Still she cannot forgive herself, and her suicide is a belated atonement. Zalina's daughter escaped, but it remains unclear whether this story will end happily. She will know for the rest of her life that her mother, in an emergency, chose to sacrifice her. </p> <p>Watching all this, I came to feel ashamed of my own tendency to see things aesthetically - the way I admired the weightless balletic elegance with which a fleeing woman, rendered legless by fatigue and fear, collapsed onto a stretcher, or my wincing reaction to the carious teeth and violently hennaed hair of the mourners. The truth is ugly, aesthetically irredeemable. Twisted, fragmentary bodies in Argumenty i Facty, sprawled beneath a pile of broken furniture. An open-air morgue in El Pa\u00eds, with corpses stuffed into transparent bin-liners, allowed no posthumous privacy. I derived some hope, however, from the cheerful resilience of two boys caught in the corner of the BBC camera's promiscuous eye during a bulletin on Tuesday. </p> <p>While adults placed candles in the burned-out gym and sobbed as they searched for the spot where their loved ones perished, this pair gambolled in the wreckage, jumping over a hole blasted through an upper floor. They didn't know that their town was the setting for a tragedy: how could they, since they hadn't watched Sky News or read the foreign press? For them, the siege was an adventure story, and the bombs had transformed their school into an excitingly perilous playground. </p> <p>Their nonchalance was as much of a rebuff as the anger of the woman who beat a camera with her fists the previous Friday. It served as a reminder that, whether we were watching these people live or die, we had no right to be there. At best, journalists in such circumstances are irrelevant. At worst, they act as publicists for the terrorists, guaranteeing them global coverage to the spectacle they stage. It is time we stopped looking at the agonies of others and began to scrutinise our own motives.</p>",
  "<p>We'd heard bad things were happening to the ethnic Albanian villagers inside Ljuboten, and a few of us had managed to get into the village, which was totally surrounded by Macedonian vigilantes and police. It was a very tense time - journalists were being beaten up by the Macedonians. </p> <p>The village was used as a transit route for the National Liberation Army to get up the mountain and the week before, 18 soldiers had been killed by a landmine, so this was a revenge attack on the villagers. The government claimed they were terrorists, but they weren't, they were civilians. The villagers were in a terrible state and had left the bodies where they'd been shot the day before, hoping journalists would get inside. Who do you turn to for help if it's the police who are killing your family? As a journalist, you're their lifeline. </p> <p>You often find in war journalism that it is the victims' families who show you the bodies and lead you to the pictures. The man in the photo, like many villagers, was pulled out of a basement by Macedonian troops and shot in the back;he then had his head run over by an armoured truck. The villagers had moved his body out of the road and covered what was left of his head with a bag. He was a good-looking young man in his early twenties. </p> <p>In situations like this, you really have to stick together as journalists. We didn't know how long it would be before the police realised their mistake in letting us in but we knew there was real safety in numbers, especially as we were foreign and from a number of different newspapers. </p> <p>The images stay with you but you've got to put them to the back of your mind and realise you're making a historical record of what happened. If you start thinking about it and stop taking photos, you're useless. It's tough and sometimes you just want to put the camera down and help. On occasions, I have, but you have to try and stay objective. You've got to be a little bit cold-blooded, I suppose, otherwise you'd never take a picture. It is difficult to know how to handle it - aid workers in war situations get counselling, but journalists don't. Most people would say we should since otherwise it all just gets bottled up. </p> <p>Lots of photographers fall into the trap of becoming war junkies, because it is very difficult to get back into normal life after being in a war. You're living on your wits, there's a high adrenaline level and you're having to get yourself through checkpoints and things such as that, so it is hard to adjust to normal life afterwards. Some people just jump from one war to another and get very jaded. </p> <p>I think people need to see graphic images such as these. The argument against it is that you get 'dead body fatigue', but cases such as Beslan are so shocking that they need to be documented. We need to be reminded that the Russians have a history of messing up hostage situations and hundreds of people end up dying. </p> <p>I don't see the problem with showing British bodies, either. It really depends on the seriousness of the event. With the killing of the workers in Falluja, did we really need to see the video of that? But it did show the extent to which the US had lost control out there, so it's important to see these things. Obviously, I understand people find it an uneasy subject. There needs to be a balance but not a blanket ban on pictures of dead bodies. Absolutely not. </p>",
  "<p>Jonny Wilkinson enjoyed an armchair ride in front of acting England head coach Andy Robinson as Newcastle brushed Bath aside in a sold-out match. Fly-half Wilkinson, favourite to captain England in their November Tests against Canada, South Africa and Australia, booted 13 points in a comfortable away victory. </p> <p>The injury-time sending-off of Newcastle back row forward Phil Dowson could not disguise a quality Newcastle performance that saw them score four tries and claim an important bonus point. </p> <p>By the time Dowson left, after a punch-up of both packs, Newcastle were home and dry as they built on their victory over Premiership new boys Worcester last weekend. </p> <p>With Wilkinson in the driving seat, Newcastle blew Bath away inside the opening 26 minutes as flanker Mike McCarthy, Tom May and Michael Stephenson capitalised on sloppy Bath defence. </p> <p>With Wilkinson kicking two conversions and a penalty during that early onslaught, Bath still had a mountain to climb despite lock Steve Borthwick crashing over from close range. </p> <p>Bath fly-half Chris Malone slotted a penalty before the break, and even though Newcastle had lock Luke Gross yellow-carded they were in total control approaching the second period. </p> <p>Wilkinson landed the first-half of a drop-goal double on 56 minutes to ease Newcastle's nerves and although that heralded Bath's best spell of the game, there was no way back for the home side. </p> <p>Bath wing Brendon Daniel scored two tries during the final quarter, but his contribution was disrupted by May's second try which made the game safe. Referee Steve Lander imposed discipline in the closing minutes after a brawl which owed much to Bath's frustration. Dowson was shown a straight red, and he can now expect a minimum three-week ban, while May was sent to the sin-bin. </p> <p> <strong> BATH: </strong> Maddock; Crockett, Davey, Tindall, Daniel; Malone, Wood; Barnes, Humphreys (Mears 55), Bell (Stevens 22), Borthwick, Grewcock, Beattie, Lipman (Scaysbrook 55), Fea'unati (Delve 35). </p> <p><strong> NEWCASTLE:</strong> Shaw (Burke 65); May, Noon, Mayerhofler, Stephenson; J.

  "<p>Rule Of Law made all in the hands of Kerrin McEvoy to win the 228th St Leger by a head from Kieren Fallon and Quiff on the Town Moor to give Godolphin their fourth win in the oldest Classic. </p> <p>It was the perfect pinnacle to McEvoy's first season in British racing as he rode a canny tactical race on the Kingmambo colt and a stark contrast to his first ride on Rule Of Law in the Derby in June. </p> <p>Riding at Epsom was a culture shock to the 23-year-old Australian as he and Rule Of Law failed to handle the gradients before finishing fast to be second to North Light and Fallon. Horse and rider have come a long way since then, although McEvoy has still yet to taste success at Epsom, and the way he dictated the pace here showed the level of his confidence. </p> <p>Even though the flying dismount \u00e0 la Frankie Dettori was missing, there was no disguising McEvoy's delight. 'It is right up there with the Melbourne Cup,' he said. 'It is an indescribable feeling.' </p> <p>The wind, which had been blowing behind the runners up the home straight during the first three days of the meetings did a complete about turn, so that Rule Of Law was running into the teeth of it as he was pestered, first by Mikado, then Maraahel and then finally by Quiff, on whom Fallon produced one of his trademark withering runs after pulling her off the far rail to mount a challenge. </p> <p>Despite the filly holding her head to one side, as if resentful of the very fast ground, it still looked as though Fallon would force her past Rule Of Law but, like every good front-running jockey, McEvoy had saved a little for the final stages and the colt did not let him down. Tycoon was a length-and-a-half back in third, having been held up in last place for much of the race and been in an impossible position turning for home. </p> <p>'I heard Kieren coming and, though the winning post seemed an awful long way away and I was fast running out of petrol, Rule Of Law was not going to let them past, said McEnvoy.' </p> <p>Fallon was to say 'it was too firm for my filly', but there was no excuse needed to be beaten by a Derby runner-up on only her fifth start. </p> <p>Godolphin's representative, Diana Cooper, was impressed with Quiff, saying: 'She is a marvellous filly.' But she was even more effusive in her praise of Rule Of Law's jockey. 'That was perfection. Kerrin deserves all the acclaim that is coming his way. He has adapted so well to British racing,' she said before stating that Rule Of Law would be kept in training next season and drop back to a mile-and-a-half. 'He is an incredibly honest horse who always gives everything,' she added. 'This was a very astute piece of planning by Sheikh Mohammed.' </p> <p>Godolphin's team have found their form in no uncertain terms in recent weeks and, as the number two behind Dettori, McEvoy seems to have relished to teamwork that goes into the operation. 'It is great to be part of the Godolphin team,' he said, 'and this track is actually a lot like Flemington, with a longer straight but without the hill on the far side.' </p> <p>Flemington was the scene of McEvoy's Melbourne Cup win on Brew in 2000 when, at 20, he became the second youngest jockey to win Australia's greatest race. </p> <p>One of the difficulties for any foreign jockey is adapting to the great variety of Britain's racecourses. Left-handed, right-handed; sharp, galloping; turf, all-weather, undulating, flat: they come in all shapes and sizes. McEvoy knows how tough it is but he has coped and is improving week by week. 'It took a while to adapt,' he said 'but I never thought it would be easy, that's for sure. You have to be a horseman as well as a jockey.' </p> <p>He might come from a country not always known for being gracious in victory but there was no showboating. Rather there was a tear in his eye as he said: 'I don't want this feeling to end.'</p>",
  "<p>Jens Lehmann was surprised when he emerged from his house in Totteridge, north London, one day to see one of his neighbours holding on to a young girl for dear life, coaxing her along on her new bike. Why surprised? Because the neighbour was none other than his boss, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and few ever imagine Arsenal's workaholic manager, who was teaching his daughter how to ride, turning his attention away from football for even a second. </p> <p>This is, after all, a man who, despite having lived in London for nearly a decade, only really knows three places: his home in Totteridge - a desirable, detached house but not a patch on the multi-million-pound residences of many of his neighbours - Highbury stadium, and the Arsenal training ground at London Colney, whose development Wenger himself oversaw. His two workplaces are half an hour's drive from home, journeys that are usually made in his middle-of-the-range Mercedes to the accompaniment of Classic FM. With his partner, Annie, their daughter, seven-year-old Lea (who bemoans 'papa's' long working hours, which is why she is often in his arms when they are together), and a recent addition to the family - Lilly, a Yorkshire terrier - home life is free of stress. </p> <p>Work life, however, is loaded with the self-imposed demands of a man obsessed by his job. Wenger is an idealist who wants to win football's big trophies in a style reminiscent of the Brazil team of 1970. And if he can somehow overcome the odds and lead Arsenal to Champions League glory with a team developed at a fraction of the cost of the other European super-clubs, then he can claim a place in the pantheon of great managers. </p> <p>Last month Wenger's Arsenal broke Nottingham Forest's record of 42 consecutive league matches undefeated, and he did it by building a team designed to play what he calls 'the football I love'. But to arrive at this point, he has had to evolve his playing staff with what the Arsenal vice-chairman, David Dein, describes as 'a seamless revolution'. More than 100 players have been moved in and out of the club. The latest revelations, the wonderfully precocious teenager Cesc Fabregas and sharp-witted attacker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, epitomise Wenger's penchant for spotting and nurturing young talent. It is a policy at the heart of his success and one he continues to believe in passionately. </p> <p> With Sol Campbell the only England-born signing to have proved an unqualified success (Matthew Upson, Francis Jeffers, Richard Wright and Jermaine Pennant failed to establish themselves), Wenger prefers to travel abroad for his shopping. Back at home in Totteridge, Wenger sat in his kitchen to talk about why, and how his talent-spotting network operates. </p> <p>Wenger is sanguine about bringing so many foreign youngsters to Highbury. He believes that 'the world is a much smaller place' than it was and explains: 'The differences between countries are less than 20 years ago. We watch the same films and listen to the same music. In the big cities, we have the same restaurants, everywhere is the same. The differences have been wiped out considerably, and it's not as much of a cultural shock any more. You can live in England in a Spanish area. I don't look at the passport. You are good enough or not good enough. </p> <p> 'We have an exceptional name in Europe now, and people here don't realise that. We have a fantastic attractive [pulling] power and we have a head figure like Thierry Henry, who so many young players admire. That gives us a huge advantage.' </p> <p>What about his lack of faith in the domestic market? 'It is always difficult for me to speak about that because I just think about what is right for players. The only thing I can say is that I started to scout very early in my career, for my academy [at Strasbourg]. I always had an eye for talent, and if I could travel, I could always find talent. </p> <p>'It's my big regret now that I cannot travel so much. I like to watch players and find people. I found Silvinho and Edu on my travels. Most of the young players we get, we scout them and then bring them back on trial, for example, Kolo Tour\u00e9. I knew him since he was 16. But it is slowly changing now in England. The young players are very good technically. I think that England was behind in work with youths and it has been corrected, but the results take some time.' </p> <p>If his signing policy tends to undermine the work of the Arsenal youth academy, Wenger offers a consoling counterpoint - 'Of course it is always a disadvantage to take a foreign player with the risk he doesn't like it here' - and he has high hopes for some of the current crop at the academy, several of them English. As well as David Bentley, impressing on loan at Norwich, and goalkeeper Graham Stack at Millwall, a string of names progressing through the ranks trip off the tongue. 'Ryan Garry, Justin Hoyte, Ryan Smith, Quincy, Djourou.' </p> <p>Pressed to repeat the latter name, Wenger replies as if he has let a cat out of the bag. 'A young Swiss boy, but ignore him!' Further down the age scale the prospects may be even brighter. The Arsenal under-15s and under-16s have a couple of likely lads. Even better, the centre that caters for the 8- to 14-year-olds has unearthed half a dozen precious talents. </p> <p>What might befall them in the next few years is anybody's guess, but maybe Wenger will not have to be jealous forever of Sir Alex Ferguson's good fortune when, in the Frenchman's view, three world-class players - David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes - not to mention three other internationals, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt, blossomed simultaneously. </p> <p>'I tell you, there are half a dozen who really have a chance, really promising players,' says Wenger. 'It thrills me, for one simple reason. Since I came here I feel that I've helped this club not only to win, but also to put the club on a different level. The training ground, the new stadium, the youth set-up - which has become international at the top level. But to think that nothing major can happen to the club now makes me sleep easier. For example, tomorrow, if the club has financial trouble, I can guarantee you it will not be relegated with the players we have.' </p> <p>For now it seems Arsenal will be his final club. 'Frankly I have no clear idea of when I want to stop or how much longer I can go on being successful.' It is unlikely he would be given the time to recreate the set-up he enjoys in north London anywhere else in the world - one in which he has performed a paramount role, a process that will reach its climax with the move to Ashburton Grove in 2006. He has had his frustrations, and were he not so committed, Wenger might have succumbed to enticing overtures from abroad. </p> <p>'I turned down offers when I was already conscious that we didn't have any money,' Wenger says. 'Big offers from huge clubs. That was not an issue for me. The issue was whether I could continue to develop players, because I think there is always a way to be successful with younger and older players alike. For me, what is important is improving the vision of the club.' </p> <p>A future in international management seems unlikely. 'I've worked so much in my life on a daily basis that I think I would be lost. Your actions and influence are much more limited than in a club. If you have a good generation in a country, you can do a good job. If you don't, you can do nothing. In a club you can buy a Spanish player and you can unearth a player in South Africa that nobody has seen and add him to your squad. This is not possible in a national side.' </p> <p>Even when they find a young player they like, Arsenal are cautious. 'We are very careful about the attitude of the boys we buy,' says Wenger. 'We even watched Reyes in training to see how he behaves. </p> <p>'I said at the beginning of last season to the board that it would be ideal to buy somebody in the winter. But I came out in the transfer window and said we will not go for anybody, because frankly, I thought Reyes would not be possible.' </p> <p>To persuade the directors, he urged them: 'Listen, this team is at a stage where if I add something, a player who has a really international dimension, he can give us a plus. Or we keep going and play on with Bergkamp and Aliadiere.' Dein was worried that the inability to recruit the previous summer was 'testing our director-and-manager relationship', and his efforts reaped dividends in Seville. </p> <p>'We got Reyes because we made first a financial effort,' says Wenger. 'I think we forced the door and David did an outstanding job in that.' Asked how he landed his man, Dein simply replies: 'Stealth.' He could have justifiably added: 'Cunning.' Arsenal were able to persuade Reyes's agent to switch sides and become their representative in the transfer, although they still had to break the bank in order to satisfy the selling club, Sevilla.</p> <p>'We went, were refused, came back with an improved offer and it was a very tense situation,' reveals Wenger. 'But finally we got him because we insisted so much that we got an opening and because we were in touch with the boy and he wanted to join us.' </p> <p>Despite the exorbitant outlay, \u00a310.5 million, Wenger feels that Reyes is 'a very small financial risk, because the boy is 20 and comes from a big football country. I've added somebody to the team I feel was needed, because he has the qualities and philosophy of the game we love. He can provide, he can score, he's fluent, he's quick, he's sharp - all the qualities I like to build in the side.' </p> <p>Even younger and already fulfilling Wenger's criteria, Fabregas joined as a 16-year-old from Barcelona, and started in the first team for the first two Carling Cup matches in the autumn of 2003. 'Footballistically,' says Wenger, reinventing the English language, 'he's ready for the first team. He's a very big talent, maybe not a flattering player but a good user of the ball at such a young age. He plays like he's 25, 26. We got him through our scout in Spain, and I met the parents in the summer to convince them.' </p> <p>Fabregas is rated as one of the brightest young Spanish players. Barcelona were unwilling to let him slip away, having developed him through their youth system, but under Spanish employment law, were powerless to stop him. This was not the first time that Arsenal, conforming to the letter of the law if not its spirit, had prised away a talented youngster from the club that had groomed him. Fabregas was only following in Nicolas Anelka's footsteps, leaving Barcelona fuming like Paris St Germain before them. </p> <p>When Fabregas and his parents met the Arsenal manager, they came to London. If he wants a youngster badly enough and has the time, Wenger travels to try to persuade him in person, visiting Philippe Senderos in Switzerland and Gael Clichy in the south of France. 'We did a good job there,' he says of Clichy, who left Cannes when they lost their professional status, having been relegated to the third division for financial irregularities. 'I flew out there just before the [2003] Cup final because he didn't want to leave the country. I met his parents and convinced them that I really would put him with the first team and that he would play some games, and finally they had the confidence in me to do it.' </p> <p>Wenger is not impervious to the occasional blunders that have blighted his managerial record. No man is perfect - 'certainly not me,' says Wenger - but he did not get much wrong last season. 'I don't think I made many mistakes; you can't if you go a whole season unbeaten. </p> <p>'Where I feel I have made them is in the preparation, the training. We don't do enough or we do too much, then sometimes you are punished on the Saturday because you didn't rest the players at the right period of the season.</p> <p>'In the FA Cup, maybe, I made a mistake in the semi-final. The problem is you have no chance to check if it is a mistake or not. You cannot play the game again. I kept Reyes and Henry out for the semi-final against Manchester United because I wanted them fresh for the Champions League against Chelsea. You can say it was a mistake but the best chances we had were at the start of the game when they weren't playing. The only realistic thing in football is whether you have won or lost. If you have lost you can say you made mistakes, but consider as well that if you win you can also make mistakes.' </p> <p>The failure in Europe still gnaws away at him. 'This Arsenal team has never won anything in Europe whereas Ajax won three European Cups on the trot. There are still many things we can improve and I leave it to other people to judge how good we are. But I feel we are very close now. </p> <p>'Last season, we were not knocked out by Juventus or Milan, but by Chelsea. And we know we can beat Chelsea. I hope the players don't get any sort of mental block about the Champions League. The important thing is to be doing well in your home championship and then form in Europe will follow.' </p> <p>If you asked any chairman or president in the world who they would most like to coach his club, many would vote for Wenger. The characteristics of a great coach form the core of the inner man: a clear and effective philosophy and the man-management and communication skills to impart it, attention to detail and a good memory, an eye for talent, being a workaholic, loyalty and integrity, a love of the game and perhaps, above all, as the man himself says: 'A competitive nature. I love to win. I always know the score. Football, tennis, cards, no matter what I play the score has a meaning to me.' </p> <p>What's next? 'To win it [the Premiership] again.' 'If you do that and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League that would be terrific,' I say. 'No, final,' Wenger says. 'But the semi-finals would be further than Arsenal have ever gone before, and it would mean you are one of the four best sides in Europe.' 'Final,' states Wenger. 'Final, final, final.'</p>",
  "<p>'Really Rubbish And Very Worrying for the Future' was the headline in last Sunday's Le Parisien, reflecting accurately, if not all that snappily, the feeling of the nation after France began their attempt to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 20 years with a dismal 0-0 home draw against Israel. </p> <p>Wednesday's unconvincing 2-0 win in the Faroes did little to lift Gallic spirits, prompting a ' C'est Grave, Docteur?' headline in l'Equipe. The usually docile French press have taken to blasting the not-so-long-ago world and European champions, who flopped at their last two major tournaments. </p> <p>Seeing and hearing the crowd jeer the players off the field eight days ago only fuelled the feeling that the French public's love affair with their football team is well and truly over. </p> <p>As if the sterility of France's showing in those two games were not enough, they followed a fascinating fortnight of navel-gazing, soul-searching and in-house squabbling. </p> <p>The new coach, 52-year-old Raymond Domenech, who was in charge of the under-21s for nearly 10 years before taking over from Jacques Santini, has lost Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu, Lilian Thuram, Zinedine Zidane and, yesterday, Claude Makelele, all of whom have retired from international football. For his first game, a friendly in Rennes against Bosnia-Herzegovenia, Domenech brought in a swathe of fresh faces. </p> <p>Domenech is famed for his love of astrology and penchant for acting and has worked in the theatre and featured in TV plays. He has introduced a set of rules for the players; many seem innocuous, but there followed a nationwide debate. Domenech was seen to be laying down the law to players who four years ago were super-heroes to the French but who are now, as any self-respecting Paris taxi driver will tell you, 'overpaid, spoilt brats'. </p> <p>Rumours are rife of player revolt, particularly among the older generation who did not like having to wear shinpads during training, being told to turn up to breakfast at 8.30am sharp, and having to turn off their mobile phones during massage. They particularly failed to see the funny side, or the point, of a post-game debriefing in Rennes in which every player had to stand in front of the squad and analyse both his own performance and that of the team. Perhaps it was because it went on until 2.30am. </p> <p>As pressure mounted at Clairefontaine last week there were 12 consecutive questions about shinpads at a Domenech press conference. </p> <p>Fabien Barthez gave an interview to L'Equipe to deny that the injury that stopped him playing against Israel was a diplomatic one. Robert Pires was raging, demanding showdown talks after Domenech dropped him to the bench for both games. Thierry Henry said he had briefly considered quitting the national team during the summer because of all the criticism. Then, after extending his dismal run with Les Bleus to one scoring game in the last nine, Henry slammed Domenech's decision to start with a 3-5-2 formation. </p> <p>Domenech's main work lies in rebuilding France's defence. He has tried PSG's Bernard Mendy and Monaco's Patrice Evra in wing-back roles and given other Monaco defenders, Gael Givet and Sebastien Squillaci, their chance. William Gallas is the only experienced international defender available now, though Bayern Munich's stylish right-back Willy Sagnol should be fit to face Ireland in Paris next month. </p> <p>The papers are asking if Mendy, Givet and Jerome Rothen will ever be up to replacing Thuram, Desailly or the beloved Zizou. Is French success a thing of the past, they wonder? </p> <p>France have not qualified for the World Cup through on-the-field exertions since 1986. They failed in 1990 and 1994 before qualifying as hosts, then champions, for the past two World Cups. After pathetic displays last week, you won't find many Frenchmen expecting their team to beat the Irish, especially as Vieira will be missing after being sent off for two yellow cards in the Faroes. </p> <p><strong>Then and now</strong></p> <p> <strong> FRANCE 0 GREECE 1 (JUNE) </strong> Fabien <strong> Barthez </strong> William <strong> Gallas </strong> Lilian <strong> Thuram </strong> Michael <strong> Silvestre </strong> Bixente <strong> Lizarazu </strong> Zinedine <strong> Zidane</strong> Claude <strong> Makelele </strong> Olivier <strong> Dacourt </strong> (Wiltord 72) Robert <strong> Pires </strong> (Rothen 79) Thierry <strong> Henry</strong> David <strong> Trezeguet </strong> (Saha 72) <strong> Subs: </strong> Coupet, Landreau, Boumsong, Vieira, Desailly, Pedretti, Sagnol, Marlet, Govou <strong> Coach: </strong> Jacques Santini<strong> </strong> </p> <p><strong> FAROES 0 FRANCE 2 (SEPT) </strong> Gregory <strong> Coupet </strong> Patrice <strong> Evra </strong> William <strong> Gallas</strong> Ludovic <strong> Giuly </strong> Ga\u00ebl <strong> Givet </strong> Sebasti\u00e9n <strong> Squillaci</strong> Beno\u00eet <strong> Pedretti </strong> Robert <strong> Pires </strong> Patrick <strong> Vieira </strong> Thierry <strong> Henry </strong> (Dhorasoo 64) Louis <strong> Saha </strong> (Cisse 9) <strong> Subs: </strong> Rothen, Landreau, Boumsong, Luyindula <strong> Coach: </strong> Raymond Domenech</p>",
  "<p>What a generation and team it was. Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary Neville, Sol Campbell and Robbie Fowler. David Beckham couldn't even get into the squad. The captain, who scored the winning penalty in the final of that European under-18 championship against Turkey in the summer of '93, was Darren Caskey. </p> <p>With a good range of passing from the heart of midfield and limitless energy as a kid, Caskey soon broke into the Tottenham Hotspur first team under Osvaldo Ardiles. Fifty caps would surely follow. From then on it was all downhill, however, to the point where he now plies his trade with Hornchurch in Conference South. </p> <p>His is an example of how young players can lose their way in an unforgiving professional game - and how players such as Beckham may develop later. But at least Caskey and Co got their chance in the Premiership. You wonder if it will happen again that such a number all come through - unless the English game takes remedial action, perhaps even lobbies harder for pan-European legislation. </p> <p>This week it is back to the Champions League, back to the glamour and glitz of England's top four sides competing against the cream of Europe with but a handful of English players. After an international week, though, it is worth considering where a new generation might come from. </p> <p>According to the accepted wisdom of the past four years, Germany 2006 represents the optimum time for the current crop to win a trophy. Given what is going on beneath the glitz and glamour, the potential for English players to emerge is lessening. </p> <p>The signs are worrying. There are, for example, only five English goalkeepers playing regularly in the Premiership. Only two strikers of sufficient quality for the national team, Alan Smith and now Rooney, are with one of the top five clubs, though Michael Owen and Jermain Defoe look well enough placed. On any given weekend, about a dozen English strikers perform in the Premiership. </p> <p>And while Peter Taylor may again be making the most of the under-21s, half of the squad come from the Coca-Cola League, few of the other half being Premiership regulars, and then not at top clubs. </p> <p>As Ars\u00e8ne Wenger outlines in some fascinating insights above, the Premiership has gone beyond simply recruiting foreign players for the first team. Now they are recruiting foreign players for the academies, the world becoming smaller, contacts improving. His wooing of the latest Highbury revelation, Cesc Fabregas, recalls college basketball coaches in the United States travelling a continent to meet small-town parents. </p> <p>It is undoubtedly a sign of Wenger's frustration with the domestic system's failure to produce enough home-grown players. G\u00e9rard Houllier felt the same at Liverpool. Manchester United are still bringing through the likes of Chris Eagles and Jonathan Spector, but will they cut the mustard? Luke Chadwick, like Darren Caskey, looks to have a great future behind him. </p> <p>Around the country, youth teams and academies are being disbanded or cut back. Bournemouth are just one club who released their entire under-18 team at the end of last season. As Premiership clubs count the cost, when the overseas option is cheaper, two have become one: under-19 and under-17 teams have merged into an under-18s. Having an academy is an FA rule for Premiership clubs, though they are now reasserting themselves. </p> <p>'There's been a tightening of the belts for academies,' says Birmingham City's academy director Stewart Hall. 'Everybody wants to run them but on really tight budgets. The FA's criteria have meant that we have had to put in place a hell of a lot of facilities in the past five or six years so now clubs are holding back.' </p> <p>Then again, some believe that slimmed-down academies produce a better quality. 'Our budget is not too bad but you always want more,' says Bobby Downes, academy director at Blackburn Rovers. 'The academy was set up partly due to the FA regulations, but also because Jack Walker always wanted to set one up. We have a number of part-time and two full-time coaches, but I think that is enough. The intake is getting smaller, but the smaller the number, the greater the quality.' </p> <p>Many clubs are looking to get just one or two players through per season, or even to make money by producing players who warrant transfer fees, either from the lower-divisions or the jackpot of a top-four club. Blackburn are quids in with Damien Duff and David Dunn. At Everton, more than \u00a340 million has come in from Francis Jeffers, Michael Ball, Gavin McCann and Richard Dunne. And Wayne Rooney. </p> <p>'I can't answer whether Wayne would have been as good a player if he hadn't been through the academy system,' says Everton's academy director Ray Hall, 'but we have helped him socially, mentally, physically, physiologically and intellectually. We focused his attention on where he needed to improve technically.' </p> <p>Hall points out another problem for academies - the travelling time. From nine to 12, boys are allowed to travel only one hour to an academy; from 12 to 16 an hour and a half. 'When, like us, you are in an area with nine Premiership clubs and 22 Football League clubs, you are all competing against each other. Also, what does that do for a boy who lives in Bangor who cannot travel more than an hour?' </p> <p>The recruitment system needs amending, he says. 'The top academies have started to look overseas and that is detrimental. That trend has started because clubs do not have to pay compensation for a Danish, American or Australian player, for example, but it would cost us a lot if we wanted to sign a boy from another English academy. </p> <p>'It can cost us \u00a3250,000 for a 15- or 16-year-old from a lower division club. If we were short of a striker, for example, then we would have to look to clubs in other countries. Our Youth Cup-winning side from 1998 had local boys, boys from the North-West and other counties, but it would now cost \u00a32 million to assemble a side like that.' </p> <p>This is not some anti-foreigner rant. The challenge is more for English coaching to improve and for young English players to show the same dedication to technical improvement, and the mental strength that comes with professionalism, as the best from overseas. </p> <p>At Southampton, where they have improved recruitment and performance to the point where they won the Premiership under-19 title last season, their academy director Huw Jennings says: 'We pay careful attention to players' personalities. They have to have the right mental make-up.' </p> <p>Emerging English talents do need help, though, just as Italians, Spanish and French do too. Uefa were surely on the right lines when they announced during Euro 2004 that they wanted to see clubs across Europe having at least eight home-grown players in their first-team squads, four born in the country, four having come through the youth system. </p> <p>It is a way round European labour laws that bar discrimination on the grounds of nationality. But then, football is not like plumbing; there are no international matches between plumbers. Unless or until World Cups are contested by the best of the leagues from each country, then domestic footballers of all nations do need some protecting. </p> <p>Uefa hope to have such a system in place in two seasons' time. For the English game, now adding overseas academy players to its growing portfolio, it cannot come too soon.</p>",
  "<p>Never mind Manchester United's worst start to a Premiership season, let's hear it for Bolton's boldest opening to date. </p> <p>Statistically this may not match the flying start of three years ago, when Bolton surprised everyone by taking nine points from their first three matches, but after five games it feels more solid. </p> <p>Sam Allardyce's team are only looking up at the metropolitan powerhouses of Arsenal and Chelsea, and in the space of two games have taken four points from their more illustrious neighbours, Liverpool and United. </p> <p>Not that United were all that illustrious here. Ordinary and vulnerable, more like, and Sir Alex Ferguson's reasoning about the Arsenal gap only mattering in March and April is already looking specious and desperate. It certainly seemed that way when amateurish defending by Mikael Silvestre gifted Les Ferdinand what appeared a certain winner in the 90th minute, and though United were reprieved through an even more shambolic scramble at a corner leading to another dubious equaliser in the final seconds, Ars\u00e9ne Wenger will be losing no sleep. 'It's always tough here,' Ferguson argued. 'But after going 1-0 in front we expected to show more authority.' </p> <p>The game only came to life after half time. Apart from a comedic scuffle between Alan Smith and Ivan Campo and a hugely popular cameo when Jay Jay Okocha bamboozled Roy Keane with his close control, there was little from either side until the visitors scored from a corner on the stroke of the interval. </p> <p>All Bolton had to offer until then was the predictable long ball in search of Kevin Davies. They had a brief chance of taking the lead after half an hour when Okocha found Kevin Nolan for a low cross that evaded both Silvestre and Wes Brown, but Davies was not quick enough to make the necessary near-post run. </p> <p>United had a rusty-looking Ruud van Nistelrooy back to partner Smith up front, the pair of them less sharp than their manager would have liked. Smith was not quite alert enough to read a sharp pass from Van Nistelrooy in the opening minutes, and when the Dutch striker finally had an opportunity of his own, from Ryan Giggs's cross across the face of goal in the 42nd minute, he produced a slow-motion header Jussi Jaaskelainen saved easily. </p> <p>The Bolton goalkeeper had had to act quickly when denying Paul Scholes 10 minutes earlier, in what appeared to be United's best chance until the home defence surprisingly lost concentration at a set-piece. Giggs swung over a corner, Silvestre won a back-post header to knock the ball back across goal, and Argentine Olympian Gabriel Heinze hooked it in for a goal on his debut. </p> <p>Bolton, with the aid of a stroke of luck, were back on terms within minutes. Okocha appeared to have let the ball run too far to take a shot from a short free-kick, but when the eventual attempt arrived a harmless drive was transformed by Nolan's instinctive nudge goalwards. Tim Howard reacted quickly enough to parry, only for Nolan to nod the rebound into an empty net. </p> <p>With El Hadji Diouf on for the ponderous Pedersen, Bolton were a different proposition in the second half. Davies and Okocha both missed by inches as United were forced backwards, leaving Ferguson little option but to send on Cristiano Ronaldo for the final quarter. </p> <p>The Portuguese stepover king did manage to flummox Campo and crash a shot against the bar from the edge of the area, but it was an isolated threat. When United withdrew Van Nistelrooy moments later, it was clear the game was up. It should have been when Ferdinand took advantage of fatal indecision by Silvestre and Howard to score, only for Bolton to produce a mix-up of their own to deny themselves victory. 'It squirmed in off Nicky Hunt or David Bellion,' Allardyce lamented. 'I would have preferred to see a 30-yard screamer from Ronaldo, because giving away two goals from corners hurts me as a former defender. We only have ourselves to blame for switching off, but overall there wasn't much between the sides.' Will the same apply when Bolton visit Highbury on Saturday?</p>",
  "<p>With less than a week to go to the Ryder Cup, it emerged that Padraig Harrington has suffered yet another shoulder strain. But before any alarm bells start ringing in the European camp, it should be noted that this particular strain did not prevent the Dubliner shooting a best-of-the-day 64 here in the third round of the German Masters. </p> <p>That round lifted him from joint eleventh into second place, three strokes behind Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell. </p> <p>Harrington led after his opening 66 on Thursday, but following a second round of 75 he spent four hours practising. </p> <p>\"I pushed it too far - for the last 45 minutes I could feel it and I had treatment this morning,\" he said of his strain. \"It's such a temptation to go on when you are working away on things and hitting it well. I know I should have left it, but I didn't. I never do. </p> <p>\"It's tight now, but I'm happy enough that with more treatment it should recover. I've just got to watch hitting balls in cold weather.\"</p> <p>Harrington produced a sizzling start. Eight adrift overnight, he went to the turn in 30, making four birdies and then pitching into the hole from 122 yards for an eagle three at the long 7th. </p> <p>It could have been even better - he missed a four-foot chance on the difficult 469-yard 9th, the hole Ian Woosnam failed to finish on Thursday after two balls went in the lake. </p> <p>Two more birdies followed over the closing four holes and when McDowell played the same stretch in two-over for a 69, Harrington's hopes of a first victory this year - and avoiding the twenty-fifth runner-up finish of his career - were boosted. </p> <p>McDowell, who just missed out on a Ryder Cup debut, stands on the 14-under-par total of 202. Having reached halfway three clear, he said: \"If somebody had offered me the same lead with a round to go I would probably have broken their arm off. To throw in two late bogeys was disappointing, though.\" </p> <p>He missed the green at the short 16th and then went into water on the next. </p> <p>A team-mate of Luke Donald in the 2001 Walker Cup victory in America, McDowell is seeking his third European Tour title, adding: \"If I can keep playing as I am, he [Harrington] is going to have to go low to catch me. </p> <p>\"This is one of our better events and I want to win it pretty badly. Nothing less will do right now. It always has a great field and there's a buzz around this week with the Ryder Cup coming up.\" </p> <p>Paul Casey, another of the Detroit-bound players, would have been joint second with Harrington but for a closing double-bogey six. Missing the fairway and then pitching into the lake meant a 67 after he had begun the back nine in sensational style with three birdies, then an eagle at the 509-yard 13th, then two more birdies - seven-under for six holes.

  "<b> Hard lessons </b> <br> If you really intended to give a 'true insight into Britain's education system' why did you give up straight away when it came to your choice of three first year undergraduate students - one Reading, one Oxford, one Cambridge? (News, last week.) <p>To reflect this year's new starters, one should have been starting at an FE or HE college linked to a university, one should have been going to a 'modern university' (typically former polytechnic), and one at most to an 'old' (pre-1992) university, and then probably not to a 'Russell Group' institution, and certainly not Oxbridge. </p> <p>And one at least should be living at home, and most of them worried about how they were going to pay for it all, and how they were going to juggle their studies with their part-time jobs (if working up to 40 hours a week can be called 'part-time').<b><br>John Old </b><br>Nuneaton, Warks </p> <p>Richard Killip's chances of fulfilling his hopes of making friends and feeling at home at Cambridge will largely depend on his choice of college - I hope that we will be told which college this is, as without it the diary of his Cambridge experiences will not make as much sense as it might.

  "<p>Tim Henman, the man who carries the burden of being Britain's most predictable loser, last night played in a semi-final of one of the world's grand slams, this time in the US Open. It's the sixth time he's been at such a level, but unless you live on Mars you'll know that's as far as he's ever got. The tabloid view is that he chokes, that he lacks the killer instinct. The amateur psychiatrists who populate the sports pages argue he shares the same psychological deformation as the England football team, a lack of self-belief so that he can't hold on in vital crunch matches. </p> <p>This is a grossly unfair assessment. Henman is the best English tennis player I have watched, and probably ever will. He is acknowledged by his fellow players and the international sports press as the world's best volleyer, the toughest part of tennis, calling for bare-faced nerve, incredible reflexes and certainty of touch. </p> <p>It is difficult enough at the humble level at which I play to judge when to follow in a stroke to the net and then have the agility to volley the return; to do it against players like Roger Federer, his US Open semi-final opponent and the world's number one, who will return the ball with stunning pace, flight and spin, is unbelievable. Nobody else on the tennis circuit has Henman's talent and sheer guts to build a game on volleying aggression - and yet the guy is called 'limp-wristed' (because he's never won Wimbledon) and psychologically weak. </p> <p>Henman bears the cross of English reserve and middle-class manners; even his clenched fist when he pumps himself up is constrained and self-consciously short of being exhibitionist. When he loses, he always promises to do better next time and to keep on trying, the reaction of the prep-school boy to the Latin master over disappointing homework. </p> <p>Tabloid sports writers are quick to see his manners and restraint as symbolic of a losing, wimpish streak; the trendy middle classes see in his ordinariness and lack of intellectuality (books are boring he once admitted) the same weakness. Champions, it is agreed across the social spectrum, have a special quality that Henman lacks. Plainly talented, his character lets him down at the last. </p> <p>In one respect, the laugh is on us. Henman is a rich man, more than amply compensated for the ritual beatings-up he receives in the media. The more interesting question is why we hunger for him to win so badly. Do you carry the burden of a nation's expectations? he was asked in New York before last night's match. Absolutely, came the reply. Of course, it would be magnificent if he could win a grand slam tournament, but to imagine that his career has been a failure if he doesn't is absurd. Already Henman's achievement is only topped by Fred Perry 60 years ago. Somebody, sometime should have a reality check. </p> <p>It is our obsession, now growing into a national neurosis, with our collective need to do down foreigners that is the problem and its corollary that, therefore, our men, women and team must win, win, win. Euro 2004 reached new heights. During England's games, London became a ghost city as the streets emptied of people and traffic. I have experienced nothing like it. Cultural commentators have been observing for some years that sport is becoming a contemporary replacement for war, a way of binding the nation together in a collective experience that is essential before the fragmentation of modern life. </p> <p>But the last few years have witnessed a tipping point into chauvinistic frenzy. Euro 2000 and the World Cup in 2002 and already touched new heights of xenophobia, but normal life continued more or less, during England games. Not in 2004. </p> <p>The mood swings over the performance of the English football team last week were a classic example of the new neurosis. David James's clumsy goal-keeping against Austria last weekend, conceding an unnecessary goal in a 2-2 draw, unleashed a national orgy of breast-beating and accusation. The goal-keeper is a 'donkey'; coach Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson is a washed-up, oversexed, over-cautious plonker; captain David Beckham is useless and uninspirational, distracted by celebrity status; the team has no self-belief. </p> <p>Football has always provided good, emotional copy, but we have moved to a new level of merciless criticism and name-calling. The team's reaction - not speaking to the media after victory over Poland in midweek - was petulant but understandable. Sportsmen are not superbeings who win every match with sustained brilliance. We should be more grown up in our expectations and reactions. </p> <p>Two forces are interacting to produce this sulphurous, harsh culture - the recoil from globalisation and noxious contemporary journalism. Globalisation, vastly increasing the power of markets and corporations, may be a source of wealth generation, but it also diminishes the sense that local and national communities can do anything for themselves or change anything. Workers have to accept the terms of work that companies offer; consumers confront ever blander high streets with the same chains offering the same goods everywhere - and there is nothing to be done. Governments cower before the might of 'the market' and 'business'. The expression of public purpose, a vital means of expressing collective identity, becomes ever harder. </p> <p>In its place, citizens look to express identity in the shared experience of their private family or group or the more nebulous concept of nation. The better our national team or national player can perform, the more solidarity we collectively feel with each other and the more anchored we feel in ourselves. Hostility to the stranger is a longstanding means of the group entrenching its own belonging; now we are hostile to the non-English team or non-English player, ridiculously expecting triumph of our own at all times, to achieve the same result. </p> <p>Our media, sensing this appetite, have applied the same spin, hyperbole and refusal to contextualise 'facts' they applies to sport. Thus is created a vicious circle in which our cities empty for England games, the St George's flag is ever more ubiquitous and our greatest tennis player for 60 years is characterised as a loser. Some see this as a small price to pay for the wider social glue that supporting our national sports contenders provides; I disagree. </p> <p>The culture is poisoning everything, reducing children's willingness to study foreign languages to our capacity to make common cause internationally. </p> <p>The xenophobia behind Ukip has the same roots as declaiming Tim Henman's alleged psychological failings - collectively advancing arguments and attitudes without reason. I'll continue to admire Henman's game whether he has won or lost last night's semi-final. </p> <p>That fewer of us can do the same is not just a pity; it's a form of collective insanity that presages little good ahead.</p>",

  "<p>Merrill Lynch has been forced to abandon a key part of its defence against Stephanie Villalba, the former executive bringing a high-profile sex discrimination claim against the investment bank.</p> <p>Raymundo Yu, Villalba's former boss, admitted last week that Villalba was not solely responsible for $46 million of losses sustained by her division in 2002.

She claims Merrill is 'institutionally sexist' and is demanding compensation of around \u00a37.5m. </p> <p>Merrill strongly denies her allegations and is presenting more than 20 witnesses to the tribunal in its defence. </p> <p>Yu, the bank's global private client chief, criticised Villalba's management last week, claiming she was not the 'strong leader' her division needed. </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>Frederick Winslow Taylor was a man obsessed with the idea of the 'one best way'; he was the father of scientific management, which in turn spawned organisation and methods departments throughout companies. But almost a hundred years ago, Taylor was savaged by a committee of the US House of Representatives. </p> <p>Congressmen with trade union backgrounds were out to settle a score. To them Taylor was a soulless slave driver, out to squeeze more from the worker than was justifiable. Taylor was devastated by the experience, feeling thoroughly misunderstood. He took a break from his hitherto busy schedule and died three years later. </p> <p>Despite his fall, Taylor's influence has been enormous: the notion of efficiency gained through better work design is the foundation of 'command and control' management. Taylor gave the world a systematic way of tackling method - how the work works. But he could not foresee that his method had a fundamental weakness. He made the separation of decision-making from work the defining relationship between manager and worker. Management has the good ideas and workers carry them out. </p> <p>People who work at the coalface of today's service organisations have the same problems as the American union workers of a century ago. In call centres people find it demeaning to work for managers obsessed with average handling time (how long they take on a call); they know it gets in the way of their purpose, serving customers. </p> <p>It will not be long before unions wake up to the reality that measures in use in call centres violate human rights, for the true causes of variability in call centre workers' performance are associated with the work rather than the workers. Any measure used to judge people has to be shown to be fair - and none of the measures used in call centres is. </p> <p>Management's obsession with activity measurement has its roots in Taylorism, but Taylor would be appalled; he taught that efficiency is a consequence of method; today's managers chase efficiency with little appreciation of method and the consequences are disastrous. In both the public and private sectors service is poor and carries high costs. </p> <p>Management's obsession with activity measurement is based on the assumption that activity is cost. If people can handle more customers in less time, costs fall. If work can be outsourced to low-wage economies, costs fall. But the true costs of service are end-to-end from the customers' point of view. Managers have no idea how many customers fail to get their problem solved and call again (or simply give up). Managers have no idea why customers call. </p> <p>In today's service organisations it is not unusual to find that as much as 60 per cent of customer demand is what I call 'failure demand', demand caused by a failure to do something, or do something right, for the customer. </p> <p>Outsourcing failure demand to low-wage economies might create an apparent reduction in transaction costs, but the real costs of ser vice become locked in. In pursuit of economies of scale, managers have created front and back office 'factories', breaking work down into functionally specific tasks. Yet customer demands for service are rarely functionally specific, customers find themselves having to find a route through organisational spaghetti to get what they want. </p> <p>Managers have no idea of the true end-to-end costs of service provision; instead they focus on bringing down functional costs and inadvertently push up the true costs. But managers remain unaware of this, for their current functional measures keep them blind. Top-down imposition of targets results in 'cheating'. Dysfunctional behaviour is ubiquitous and systemic because the requirement to serve the hierarchy competes with the requirement to serve customers. Peoples' ingenuity is engaged in survival, not improvement. It is a tragic waste of human talent. </p> <p>It ought to be the other way around. The people best placed to solve customers' problems are those in the front line. It is only in the front line that one can see the true nature of customer demands. It is the front line people who need the means to solve customer problems, prevent them having to repeat their calls and ensure that customers get what they want when they want it. </p> <p>The need for integrating decision-making with work is vital in service organisations - it is the only means by which service organisations can absorb the variety of customer demands. The consequences are improved service and lower costs, something command-and- control managers find counter-intuitive, because they equate better service with more resource; their whole world is one of resource (people) management versus activity volumes. </p> <p>The emphasis on method that Taylor inspired needs to be brought back to life where the work is done. Taylor saw knowledge as the prime productive resource. Today's service worker needs to be a problem-solver, not a procedures-follower. It is to put people back at the heart of the enterprise; it is the only way to compete effectively in the modern world. But it will first require a change in management thinking.</p> <p><strong>Taylor's speed trap</strong></p> <p>Taylor gained the nickname 'speedy' because he never relaxed, there was always something to plan, study or consider. He was consumed with finding the one best way to work and play. His book: The Principles of Scientific Management, 1912, is regarded by Peter Drucker as 'the most powerful and lasting contribution America has made to Western thought'. </p> <p>His principles were:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Efficiency, the modus operandi of industry and the cardinal virtue of industrial culture</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Time and motion studies</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Standardisation (the one best way)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mechanisation and automation; natural extensions of scientific management</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> People - managers and workers - cogs in the machinery of enterprise</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The separation of decision-making from work</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Seddon is the author of: 'Freedom from Command and Control: a better way to make the work work'</p>",
  "<p>First of all, Digby Jones introduces his 'shadow'. This is Anna, a slender economics undergraduate who, indeed, is but a shadow of the formidable proportions of her mentor. </p> <p>Cheap shots aside, however, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry these last four years has a serious point to make about Anna and her predecessors, who have each spent a week with him while the schools have been out for summer. He puts it straight: business does not do enough to train young people. </p> <p>On this, the man who has used the megaphone rather than the smoke-filled room to get results is prepared to turn that instrument on his own troops, while encouraging trades unions to support him. </p> <p>The cheek of it. Last week he was chastising the unions for wanting to return to the Seventies and dismissing them as 'irrelevant' in a widely reported after-dinner speech. This week he is urging them to join with him for a crusade against underachievement. 'Instead of Tony Woodley [TGWU] or Bob Crow [RMT] or Kevin Curran [GMB] saying \"I want secondary picketing\" and \"I want the Working Time Directive\", why don't they start giving people a really hard time on skilling the workforce?' he says. 'If you take a guy who is 35 years old and can't read, he is going to be isolated: he had a bad experience at school, he did not trust his teachers and he does not trust his business. The only person he trusts is his union. The union has a huge role to play.' </p> <p>It is true that since he came into the job in 2000 with his slogan of 'socially inclusive wealth creation', Jones has stressed the importance of improvement in training people for work. He has bewailed the 'abysmal' levels of literacy in school leavers and the lack of vocational training compared with European competitors. But he has also steadfastly opposed demands by trade unions for a training levy on businesses - one of the key demands made by the TUC. The government has, broadly, taken Jones's side of the argument. </p> <p>The interesting thing, however, is that the ground is moving, and that following summer policy meetings in Warwick, the government is now talking about 'post-voluntary' training arrangements, and is consulting with the unions about them.</p> <p>Although their styles differ, Jones, like the TUC's Brendan Barber is primarily a negotiator, and with Labour turning its thoughts to its manifesto and the general election campaign, he appears to have accepted where ground has to be given. There has been much territory that has been difficult to defend since he came into office: business has been an issue of controversy since the excesses of the US bubble, and in the UK 'payments for failure' and the pensions crisis have forced him to circle the wagons in difficultcountry. </p> <p>He has been prepared to bash bad businesses. 'I really did want to have a go at executive pay,' he says, pointing out that the CBI played an important role in framing the debate during government consultation on 'rewarding failure'. On pensions, Jones went to the TUC last year to say directors should not give themselves generous schemes while cutting back contributions to employees and transferring them from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes. The CBI has produced a best-practice guide for companies - to try, among other things, to get them to opt employees into schemes automatically. He confesses: 'We don't do ourselves any favours when you get the scandals.' </p> <p>'Sensitive Digby', however, is unlikely to impress many at Congress House. Jones is not a popular man in union circles. His use of words like 'dinosaur' simply indicate he comes from the other side of the argument. After all, he is a son of Middle England, born in 1955, educated at Bromsgrove High School before taking a law degree in London and returning home to practise. This would have put him in his early twenties during the high point of industrial militancy in the Midlands car industry, and the memories are still fresh. </p> <p>And, of course, Jones will not retreat from what he said in that after-dinner speech: 'If they [unions] don't change their priorities and if they don't understand where the modern workplace is going, they will become irrelevant. They currently represent 19 per cent of the private sector workforce, they would be down to below 10 per cent by the end of the decade, and if that happens they will be irrelevant.' </p> <p>Union responses to him range from the vitriolic to the faintly amused. One senior official at one of the 'big four' unions says: 'He doesn't really fool many people with his \"socially inclusive\" wealth creation. It is gobbledygook, and he is essentially a Thatcherite who has to deal with a Labour government. What do these things mean? He takes no responsibility for the grotesque pay rises and pension increases that these bosses give themselves. There has never been a time when wealth creation has been less socially inclusive.' </p> <p>Another says: 'Digby is a more authentic leader of the CBI than either of his predecessors. They were much cleverer, got in closer with New Labour and conceded some things, but persuaded on others. Digby is much more about talking to his membership and arguing in public. I think perhaps the government has got a little tired of hearing what he has to say.' </p> <p>Jones did not get where he is today - an office in London's Centre Point - by trying to be popular, and he is endearingly frank about this. He is happy to accept criticism of being too close to his membership. He said when he took over from the urbane Adair Turner that he would get out and about, and he says he still visits a regional branch in some part of the country every week - last Thursday it was Manchester. </p> <p>This, he says, has kept the idea of corporate Britain at the forefront of his mind. Since the explosion of corporate misdemeanours, and the protracted response to them - in the form, for example, of the Higgs code and pieces of government legislation - foremost in those thoughts has been keeping business clean on the corporate governance front. </p> <p>Again, Jones recognises where business cannot win, and has devised an alternative strategy. He says: 'All the feedback is that boardrooms are spending two-thirds of their time on compliance with corporate governance... The whole concept of regulatory compliance is taking the greater part of the board's time and what is going on to the back burner is wealth creation, investment and entrepreneurial flair. But there is no way that we are going to be able to deregulate - that is not something that is even possible to ask.' </p> <p>Instead, the CBI has put out a booklet explaining to businesses what is required of them. 'We have never had such a response,' says Jones. The original print run was 2,500; those have gone, and they are printing more. CBI booklets are not bestsellers - usually 500 satisfies demand. He also admits regulations are necessary because of the excesses of a minority of businesses. But he adds: 'There are three or four areas where we really have a problem.' </p> <p>Last week the Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, announced measures limiting the liability of directors to litigation. Jones says she did not go far enough by giving indemnity over legal fees and on damages for third party actions. He says there needs to be a cap on directors' liability - of three years' salary, he suggests. </p> <p>Otherwise, he warns, the government's objective of creating a more diverse boardroom culture will fail. If a boardroom newcomer who had been approached for a non-executive position asked his advice, he would say: 'We have got an atmosphere of blame, we have a compensation culture... you could lose your house, everything, for \u00a330,000 a year. Is that worth it?' </p> <p>His second concern is the relationship between business and the investment community. This has improved since the crisis meetings in the spring, prior to the AGM season, between fund managers and some company bosses, he says. But he worries that fund managers can be happy with explanations of a company's actions by the chairman, but then find they are advised to vote against motions at its AGM by the National Association of Pension Funds or the Association of British Insurers. These relationship need to be improved, he says. </p> <p>Last, he pleads for an end to health and safety regulation. If we don't take these steps, he says, 'we will find that business becomes too tough to be done in Britain - people will make investment decisions in other countries'. Some may see this as the idle threat of a megaphone negotiator. But even his most implacable foes cannot do so without a wry smile. 'Digby is combative compared with those who went before. He is more like a mirror of the union awkward squad,' says one. </p> <p>At the end of our meeting Jones confides two things: first, that he is off to a debate with the left-wing union chief Bob Crow on BBC radio; second, that he quite likes Crow.</p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Digby Jones </p> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Director-general, Confederation of British Industry</p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 28 October, 1955</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Bromsgrove School; University College London</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Married to Patricia</p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong> City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, rugby, skiing, military history, cycling to keep fit</p>",
  "<p>TThe chief executive of fund management group F&amp;C is to receive \u00a313m as a result of its merger with rival Isis. </p> <p>Bob Jenkins, who is to become non-executive chairman of the combined company, is in line for one of the largest payouts ever seen as a result of a company takeover. </p> <p>Isis has been one of the most vocal advocates of performance-related pay for directors. Yesterday, however, leading City institutional investors indicated that the payment to Mr Jenkins was unlikely to face opposition because it was a legacy scheme for F&amp;C and was being footed by its previous owner, the Dutch group Eureko. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins intends to use part of his cash windfall to buy 100,000 shares in the combined company, which are likely to cost him about \u00a3250,000, and said he would be paying tax to \"two taxmen\" - in the UK where he is based and US where he is from. </p> <p>His F&amp;C colleague Alain Grisay, who is also joining the combined company's board, has amassed \u00a36m under the same phantom share scheme. </p> <p>However, because Mr Grisay is staying at the combined company in a full-time role, he will not take his entitlement in cash. Half will be paid into his pension and the rest transferred into a share incentive scheme operated by the new company. </p> <p>The new group will be known as F&amp;C Asset Management and is technically being formed through a reverse takeover. The details of the payments were contained in the listing particulars for the new shares, which are due to begin trading on October 11. Isis shares, which were suspended at 199p when the deal was announced in July, rose 23p yesterday when they resumed trading. </p> <p>The listing particulars also outlined the executive incentive scheme which the new board will join. Unlike many incentive schemes, it does not contain a cap on bonuses to top executives, often set at 150% to 200% of base salary. </p> <p>In some cases it allows payouts to executives should the company be taken over within three years of being formed, a feature that has been criticised by some City investors for encouraging executives to do deals. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins said the scheme had been shown to big institutional investors and the Association of British Insurers, which represents City institutions controlling about 20% of the stock market. \"Once the scheme was explained to them, they loved it.\" </p> <p>He said the change of control clauses, which allow performance schemes to vest in the event of the company being taken over, only kicked in \"for people putting their own money at risk\". </p> <p>The company said the aim of keeping base salaries low was \"in the belief that shareholders' interests are best served by containing fixed costs and increasing the total compensation that is directly performance related and thereby aligned with shareholders' interests\".</p>",
  "<b> Embarrassed ...for \u00a3260 </b> <br> <p>I recently tried to renew my motor insurance by telephone, using my Lloyd's TSB credit card. </p> <p>The transaction was refused by Lloyd's because they said the amount, which was \u00a3260, was too large in comparison with my spending patterns. </p> <p>Yet I had used the same card in nine of the previous 10 years (but not last year) for the same renewal, for about the same amount, with the same insurance company, at about the same date. The car was registered in my name, at my address, where I have lived for 17 years. </p> <p>There was also several thousand pounds in my current account, which I have had for over 40 years. </p> <p>For all the noble talk of fighting international crime, what it amounts to is that Lloyd's preferred to inconvenience and embarrass a very good customer, rather than risk \u00a3260 of their money on a transaction which could not have been fraudulent and was not even suspicious.<br><b>Name and address supplied </b> </p> <p><b> Fuelling the arguments</b><br> </p> <p>This is one of those situations where you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. It happened to my husband and I when we went on holiday to Scotland. We filled up with petrol in Manchester but my husband's card was declined. Eventually it was passed. When we tried to use it again, in another filling station, it was again declined. </p> <p>It took about 45 minutes before the card was accepted by the attendant and we were asked to telephone the bank. </p> <p>The reason the card was declined was because it had been used to purchase \u00a31,900 of electrical equipment from a store we had not used.

We had to rent a car to get home, then stopped at a petrol station at 3am. </p> <p>At the garage, I had to conduct my transaction through a grille, standing outside in a bitterly cold and windy -2 degrees C. </p> <p>The attendant told me his machine told him he must phone for authorisation. He contacted the credit card centre and they said the card was out of date. It wasn't and the attendant agreed. </p> <p>He then said that I must answer security questions. I had to give him my month and day of birth...shouting my responses through the grille. (He also insisted on the year of my birth!) </p> <p>At no point was it made clear that any of the answers I had given were wrong. </p> <p>The attendant then said that he had been given instructions to cut up the card and return it to RBS and this he proceeded to do. I had no choice in the matter. </p> <p>He refused to return the card to me. It had to be left at the petrol station. I had no cash but luckily my wife had her credit card. </p> <p>I wrote to RBS complaining and after a few attempts to brush me off I was sent a couple of bottles of wine. </p> <p>Should I have phoned ahead to say that I am about to buy some petrol at 3am in the morning? </p> <p>What rights does a customer have when a retailer insists on cutting up a credit card and keeping it?<br><b>David Lambie</b><br> Edinburgh </p> <p><b> Calling time on a fraud</b><br> </p> <p>I have a Lloyds TSB debit Card.

My wife's Visa card produced the same result. </p> <p>We insisted on seeing the \"void\" slip, and it indeed appeared to state that the transactions were refused. The owner said it often happened, but there was no point in contacting the credit card companies. </p> <p>I went to the nearest cash machine and withdrew the cash without any problem. We thought the cards may have been rejected because of some network problem, and thought no more of it. </p> <p>I deposited my wife and mother-in-law at Bergamo Airport, and headed to France staying at a hotel near Evian.

  "<p>Who among us can honestly say they have never called Channel 4 during Richard &amp; Judy and screamed down the line: \"I'm truly sick of looking at Judy's cleavage!\"?</p> <p>Yes, we've all done it.

The vast majority are enquiries but around 7% are complaints - that's approximately 211 a day.

But, apart from the obvious, it's very difficult to predict what will spark calls from the public.</p> <p>After one recent BBC documentary about the second world war, an enraged licence-holder called the Beeb to complain that the film \"had shown Hitler in a bad light\".</p> <p>An episode of EastEnders prompted a complaint that it showed people drinking from bottles rather than glasses and was therefore responsible for teenagers \"acting like tramps\".</p> <p>A feature film shown on the BBC in which the word \"fuck\" was used 159 times prompted fewer complaints than an episode of The Archers in which a character said \"piss\".</p> <p>However, duty officers are aware that rescheduling always provokes fury.

She should have shown more decorum. I thought Judy was a lady. I won't be watching any more.\"</p> <p>\"I do wish Richard wouldn't keep crossing his legs so that all I can see is the sole of his shoe,\" said another. \"It's not cool and it's not trendy.\"</p> <p>Family Affairs, Five's flagship soap, comes in for a fair amount of flack. Someone identifying herself as the Prophetess Esther contacted the broadcaster to tell them that God approved of an incest storyline but also wanted to point out that when one-night stands don't work out, \"people turn to drugs, nicotine, cocaine and alcohol, prostitution and threesomes, vibrators and material supplements, then start jumping from roofs.\"</p> <p>Another caller was disgusted that \"Nikki has been living in that house for quite some time now and she still has no stairway carpeting.\"</p> <p>There is a very thin line between the eccentricity of some callers and the genuine mental health issues of others. John Reith himself, the founding father of the BBC, noted: \"Periodically, letters come in, one per thousand or two, which make one doubt the sanity of the correspondent - in fact, there is little room for anything other than doubt.\"</p> <p>One BBC duty officer was very disturbed when the woman on the end of the line who had been complaining about the shrieking emitted by her TV revealed that the wailing continued through the night. When the TV was turned off.</p> <p>A Channel 4 duty officer took a call when Johnny Vaughan was interviewing Tom Cruise on the Big Breakfast. The caller wanted the duty officer to warn Vaughan that Cruise was an alien and would take over the presenter's body if he got too close.</p> <p>Some complaints are almost too good to be true: they have a whiff of the urban myth about them.

Occasionally viewers are happy about something and call with an \"appreciation\" as they are known in the business. Like the chap who rang C4 to tell them: \"Jon Snow - absolutely brilliant. He comes across very well and doesn't piss off his interviewees like, say, Paxman does. He asks the questions that we would ask ourselves and wears great ties. Brilliant.\"</p> <p>And others just want to impart valuable intelligence.

  "<b>The left are a dying breed</b> <br> <p>The struggle between the two Americas will soon be over, predicted Phillip Longman in the <b>Washington Post</b> (September 2), with the rightwing emerging triumphant. The reason? Fertility rates. While \"liberal, secular\" Americans were having fewer and fewer babies, the birth rate for their \"conservative, religiously-minded\" compatriots was booming. </p> <p>Mormon Utah had the highest rate in the US, 90 children for every 1,000 women of childbearing age, while in liberal Vermont, \"the only state to send a socialist to Congress\", it was just 49. </p> <p>\"High fertility correlates strongly with support for President George Bush,\" Longman revealed. Nine out of the top 10 most fertile states voted for Mr Bush in 2000, while the least fertile states \"went overwhelmingly for Al Gore\". Women in \"Gore states on average have 12% fewer babies than women living in Bush states\". </p> <p>There is also a coastal-inland split; the birth rates for California, New England and Massachusetts declined between 1990 and 2002, while in Nevada, Colorado and Idaho they increased. </p> <p>If present trends continue, \"secular Americans\" would \"unwittingly give a strong evolutionary advantage to the other side of the culture divide ... If 'metros' don't start having more children, America's future is 'retro',\" warned Longman. </p> <p><b> The capital's new 'right bank'</b><br> </p> <p>The balance of power in London has shifted, said John Graham in <b>Tatler</b> (October). \"The once-ridiculed 'south of the river' now has multi-million-pound houses. It's gone bling.\" This has been fuelled by a wave of posh migrants, among them the Lord of the Rings star Orlando Bloom and the model Naomi Campbell. </p> <p>But why? For a start, the view was better from the \"Right Bank\", wrote Graham, because you could look across at \"all the nice things north of the river\". The houses were cheaper, there were \"huge open spaces ... lots of good schools ... a nearly out-of-control bar and club scene\", and, most importantly, \"as you are driving south across the bridges, the burglars are driving north.\" </p> <p>South London's celebrity property boom was partly down to \"architecture barons\", who had been \"let loose alongside the Albert and Battersea bridges on the south side. Lord Foster's round glasshouse and Lord Rogers' Montevetro building are celeb magnets.\" </p> <p>So, has the traditional view of south London gone for good? There was still one big disadvantage to the Right Bank: a distinct lack of fashionable shops. \"You have to Fendi for yourself here,\" Graham mused sadly. </p> <p><b> Soviet work directive </b><br> </p> <p>In the late 1920s, the Soviet Union's desire to \"bring about a new world ... spread to time itself\", noted Clive Foss in <b>History Today</b> (September). In an effort to increase productivity, Stalin abolished Sunday as a day of rest. The normal working week disappeared - workers toiled for four days, than had one day off. Individual workloads did not increase, but, with rest days staggered, \"the factories would be working a full 360 days a year instead of 300\". A colour-coded calendar was introduced to help workers remember their days off. </p> <p>Official propaganda extolled the scheme's benefits: \"Production and employment would increase ... leisure time would be more rationally employed, [as] cultural activities ... would no longer have to be crammed into a weekend ... Shopping would be easier for the same reasons.\" </p> <p>By October 1930, 73% of workers were operating under the new system, but \"they hated it. Coordination of family schedules was virtually impossible ... so husbands and wives only saw each other before and after work; rest days were empty without any loved ones to share them,\" explained Foss. </p> <p>In addition, the rotation system meant machines were \"no longer consistently in the hands of people who knew how to tend them, [and] were often poorly maintained or even broken\". Productivity suffered, and, by 1940, \"Sunday returned as the traditional day of rest.\"</p>",

  "China's rise through America's eyes: \"When a speeding freight train is heading towards you, you either get on board or you get out of the way. We want to get on board.\" The locomotive is China, whose economy is forecast to become the second largest in the world by 2016 and to have overtaken America by 2041. \"We\" are the people of South Carolina, the southern US state whose textile-based economy is under increasing threat from cheap labour in the People's Republic. And getting on board means trying to get the Chinese to invest in the state rather than trying to keep them out by erecting protective trade barriers. <p>The speaker is Mark Sanford, South Carolina's Republican governor, who has travelled to Beijing to attract Chinese investment to revive its beleaguered economy. He is speaking at a private dinner in a club so exclusive that it doesn't have a name, just an unmarked red door in a windowless wall. The late Deng Xiaoping used to come here to relax, but today the mix of privacy and transparency has become an irresistible magnet to China's nouveau riche. </p> <p>In his Southern drawl, Sanford speaks elegiacally of a knitwear factory that closed in his neighbouring state of North Carolina. This closure, and others like it, have led to a heated debate about attempts to restrict \"off-shoring\". Sanford explains that his goal is to attract investment from Chinese companies such as Haier, which built a fridge factory in South Carolina in 2000, completing an integrated system of production and sales with its design centre in Los Angeles and trade centre in New York. He speaks about turning his state into a \"poster-boy\" for globalisation, a Chinese gateway into America, reversing the sense of an inexorable flow of jobs and business from the US to China, and creating a \"win-win\" scenario. The Chinese roar with approval at his speech: they like this new face of America, as supplicant rather than bully. </p> <p>But Sanford is a lonely voice in preaching the need to woo China, despite the overwhelming force of the statistics: China has a population of more than a billion, an economy that is growing year-on-year by more than 8%, and had a trade surplus with the US of $124bn in 2003; Chinese imports into the US are outpacing American exports to China by more than five to one. More typical, perhaps, are the words of Roger W Robinson Jr, the former chairman of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the official body charged with assessing the security implications of the trade between the US and China. \"The US-China economic relationship is heavily imbalanced and undermining our long-term economic health,\" he said at the launch of the commission's last report. John Edwards, the vice-presidential nominee who represents the neighbouring state of North Carolina in the Senate, has taken a much tougher line than Sanford: he promises to review US trade agreements and investigate workers' rights abuses in China.</p> <p>China's growing economic power is doing much more than harming America's trade figures. Its development needs huge quantities of oil, forcing up prices on the world market. That is another big campaign issue in the world's most oil-hungry nation. According to the International Energy Agency, China will generate one-third of global incremental demand for oil between 2002 and 2004. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times has argued: \"As Asian growth continues, the global balance between demand and supply will continue to be tight, unless (or until) a vast increase in investment takes place. With such tight markets, relatively modest disruptions could lead to explosive jumps in oil prices, as happened twice in the 1970s.\"</p> <p>If the US Democrats are exercised by China's economic threat, the Republicans have focused on its military one. President George Bush's first intelligence briefing from the CIA listed China as one of three strategic threats, along with terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The thin red mist descends and China becomes, in the neo-con imagination, a Soviet Union of the east, intent on establishing puppet regimes, governed by a modern mandate from heaven. Though not all would go as far as denouncing Deng Xiaoping as a \"chain smoking communist dwarf\", as the rightwing firebrand Pat Buchanan did, there is a segment of the US political class that recoils at reports of double-digit increases in Chinese military spending, an intense focus on military modernisation and the simmering tensions over Taiwan. </p> <p>Back in 1997, Paul Wolfowitz, the neo-conservative flag-carrier who is now deputy defence secretary, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs that compared the rise of China at the dawn of the 21st century to the rise of Germany a century earlier. He characterised China as \"a country that felt it had been denied its place in the sun\", that believed it had been mistreated by the other powers, and that was determined to achieve its rightful place by nationalistic assertiveness. He warned there may be another world war. But rather than a hot war, the two have engaged in a competition for influence in the Asian region.</p> <p>The establishment of US bases in central Asia, America's tightening defence ties with Japan and Australia, and its growing relationship with India are all seen by China's elite as part of Washington's design to keep them in check. China's response has been to bend over backwards to prove it is no threat either to the US or its neighbours. Li Junru, the vice president of the Central Party School, one of the Communist part institutions, has said the policy of heping jueqi (literally \"merging precipitously in a peaceful way\") means other nations need not fear. \"China's rise will not damage the interests of other Asian countries,\" he told the Beijing Review. \"That is because as China rises, it provides a huge market for its neighbours. At the same time, the achievements of China's development will allow it to support the progress of others in the region.\" He talks of the Chinese developing free trade areas and security organisations for the region on the model of the European Union and Nato. As part of this strategy, Beijing has resolved virtually all its land border disputes with its neighbours: it has signed a non-aggression pact with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean); it is working to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue; it is signing a treaty of friendship and cooperation with Asean which includes free trade agreements and economic aid; and it is conducting joint military exercises with Russia, Kyrgyzstan, India and Pakistan. </p> <p>The American analyst Robert W Radtke, writing in the Christian Science Monitor, argued that China's soft sell appeals to America's allies in Asia: \"China's peaceful rise was introduced to Asia by Chinese President Hu Jintao on his tour of south-east Asia in October - on the heels of President Bush's visit to the region that month. The contrast in tone between the two leaders couldn't have been more striking. In short, China's message was, 'We're here to help,' while the US message was 'You're either with us or against us' in the war on terror. It's not hard to imagine which was the more effective diplomatic strategy.\"</p> <p>But the Chinese will not push this competition too far: their biggest fear is that the neo-cons in Washington will encourage Bush to ratchet up the pressure over Taiwan, whose government has been making noises about declaring independence from the mainland, to the displeasure of the Beijing administration. Since the spat early in Bush's term when a US spy-plane crashed into a Chinese fighter, relations between the world's two leading powers have thawed. Beijing has provided Washington with useful intelligence and, like Russia, used the war on terror as an excuse to damn its own separatist movements. Even over Iraq, the Chinese supported the first UN resolution and kept a low profile over the second. During Kosovo, by contrast, Chinese spokesmen were on a 24-hour rota condemning Nato's illegal action. This time the risk of causing a rift with the Americans was judged too great. </p> <p>American policy towards China is trapped between an imperative for engagement and a preference for containment. Earlier this year US policymakers welcomed a Chinese trade delegation for a multi-billion dollar buying and spending spree, during which the Chinese were to look at making investments. Within days of the delegation's departure, however, the US threatened sanctions that would make the purchases impossible. And in the security sphere the US is seeking the People's Republic's help on the proliferation of WMD in North Korea at the same time as pushing a missile defence shield that could launch a new arms race between the two nations. </p> <p>What is becoming clear is that the Chinese are no longer easily manipulated. China's welfare is so intimately woven into the international order that its welfare affects the hope and dreams of others across the world. China is already on its way to becoming America's chief banker: the $400bn of foreign reserves it has accumulated allows the US to sustain its astronomical budget deficit. If Beijing stopped buying dollars, the US currency would collapse. The security analyst Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg has even compared the Chinese hold on the dollar to a nuclear weapon: \"Breaking the dollar would be the functional equivalent of using a nuclear weapon,\" he wrote in 2003. \"The possession of such a capability cannot be ignored by the weaker party.\" </p> <p>Because of this mutual dependence it is unlikely that Wolfowitz's predictions of world war will come true. But as China rises, the balance of power will continue to shift to the east and more and more Americans will follow Sanford's example: approaching China with a begging bowl rather than a stick. China itself will face intense pressures over the coming years - unemployment, labour unrest, environmental problems and financial problems - but any problems in the People's Republic will also threaten American interests. </p> <p>Maybe the neocons have got it wrong. Perhaps the only thing worse for the US than a China that is too strong in 2020 will be one that is too weak.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Mark Leonard is director of the Foreign Policy Centre (<a href=\"http://www.fpc.org.uk\">fpc.org.uk</a>)</p> <p><b>How China is wooing the world</b></p> <p>In my local curry house I was greeted like a long-lost friend. A huddle of young waiters gesticulated excitedly towards me. Eventually I realised they were pointing at my bag, picked up during a recent trip to China, and emblazoned with the Chinese script for Shanghai. \"You've been to China,\" they said, \"China have just put a man in space - they're taking over from America.\"</p> <p>These young Bengalis are not just motivated by regional passions. Everywhere in the developing world people are sitting up and taking notice of the Chinese juggernaut. As a model for development it is a source of inspiration, its giddy growth rates of over 8% a year lifting millions of people out of poverty. </p> <p>But even more exciting is the prospect of a new superpower that might challenge US hegemony and the American way of doing things. In a paper for the Foreign Policy Centre, Joshua Ramo, a former foreign editor at Time who is based in China, laid out the elements of a new \"Beijing consensus\", which he sees as a direct challenge to the \"Washington consensus\" that defined attitudes towards the development debate in the 1990s. Beijing is \"driven not by a desire to make bankers happy, but by the more fundamental urge for equitable, high-quality growth\", he wrote. </p> <p>China treats the ideas of privatisation and free trade with caution rather than pursuing them with zeal; the country is defined by its ruthless willingness to innovate and experiment and has created a series of \"special economic zones\" to test out new ideas. Its foreign policy is driven by a lively defence of national borders and interests (see its attitude towards Taiwan) and an increasing commitment to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, which it hopes will pin the US down. Together these policies have allowed China to grow without surrendering its independence to such financial institutions as the World Bank and IMF, global companies, or the Bush administration. </p> <p>This recipe for success is so intoxicating that, on visits to countries as diverse as Iran and South Africa, I have been drawn into discussions about the \"Chinese model of development\". China's model is seducing leaders in countries as different as Vietnam (which is taking business tips from the thoughts of the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin), Brazil (which is sending study teams to Beijing), and India (Ramgopal Agarwala, an eminent sociologist, observed: \"China's experiment should be the most admired in human history. China has its own path.\").</p> <p>Few in the west have picked up on this excitement, because they have looked at China's power simply by measuring the size of its economy or the technology of its army. But by focusing on Chinese hard power (its ability to use military force or economic might to get its way) people are missing the extraordinary rise of the country's \"soft power\" - the ability of its ideas and values to shape the world. It is an unwritten rule in the minds of the west that though China might become wealthy, it is western values and culture that will continue to define the rules of the world. </p> <p>That is already changing. For the first time there is an emerging pole that is strong enough to change the way things are done on the global stage. Japan was too small and inward-looking; India is too protectionist; Russia too weak. As China emerges as a superpower, it is desperately trying to present itself as a force for good in the world. The past few years have seen a successful Olympic bid, the creation of an English language international TV channel, a series of high-level visits by President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to key countries, and a concerted attempt to befriend not just China's neighbours but other countries as far afield as Africa and Latin America. Two centuries ago Napoleon warned China was a \"sleeping giant\" that \"once awake would astonish the world\". That prediction looks like it is about to be fulfilled.</p> <p><b>Rise of the east</b></p> <p>The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, laid down a marker for the world in April when he outlined China's ambitions in a speech to the Boao Forum for Asia. \"We will quadruple the 2,000 GDP to $4 trillion with a per capita GDP of $3,000, and further develop the economy, improve democracy, advance science and education, enrich culture, foster greater social harmony and upgrade the texture of life for the people,\" he said. </p> <p>Some in America responded positively to the remarks - former president George Bush Sr said China's peaceful rise was \"very reassuring and very, very important to the Asian horizon and Asia's landscape\" - but there are many in America who are disquieted by China's rise. Its military expenditure is rising, though it will still not compete with US defence spending and it has become increasingly bullish over Taiwan. In July, Jiang Zemin - the former president who heads China's armed forces - said China would have recovered the island by 2020. </p> <p>His remarks coincided with military exercises involving 18,000 troops, designed to demonstrate China's air superiority in the Taiwan Strait. It is also seeking to compete in space: Luan Enjie, the head of the national space programme, said last November that China intends to land a man on the moon by 2020.</p> <p>One motor of China's growth is its increasing population but with such rapid expansion come problems. Some relate to China's programme of population planning. The one-child policy has created a shortage of female babies, and the government has admitted that by 2020 China might have as many as 40 million single men, which could pose a threat to social stability.</p>",
  "<b>Central Africa</b> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>Over recent decades, central Africa has seen a series of bitter and bloody civil wars and a genocide, with millions dying or uprooted. Because the roots of these conflicts spill over national boundaries, the security of the central African nations is interlinked; any dramatic deterioration in this interlinked security during the next 20 years could mean the virtual collapse of central governments in the region. If that happens by 2020, anarchy could have spread through the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda and Congo. </p> <p>The neighbouring countries will then also face deepening insecurity as refugees pour over their borders. Expect more of the same chilling stories we have seen in recent years: reports of mass rape, kidnapping, and forced recruitment drives taking men and boys off the land and into armed rebel factions.</p> <p>The DRC would be the centre of this regional political and security vacuum, but intervention would be impossible. Given the level of lawlessness, forces under the mandate of the UN, the EU or the African Union would become targets of ambushes or kidnappings by increasingly reckless and confident armed groups. As a result central Africa could become, as parts of eastern DRC and Sudan are now, a no-go area for outsiders, making it impossible to deliver the humanitarian aid that would be desperately needed.</p> <p>A circular process of dedevelopment could engulf the whole region. If war becomes a permanent state, it will destroy hopes of improved health and education, and reverse the gains of the post-colonial years of the late 20th century. If millions are unable to access any sort of modern healthcare, rampant malaria will run unchecked and could kill tens of thousands, especially babies and small children. Dengue fever and sleeping sickness would attack all sectors of the population, while the failure of inoculation programmes for children would mean epidemics of measles and the probable re-emergence of diseases such as polio. The constant war would also have the side effect of causing HIV/Aids to spread faster than ever: it would be transmitted through the migration of impoverished people forced into refugee status and through the use of rape as a weapon of war (this would be a militarised culture in which powerless women are despised and men live outside any traditional community except their shifting armed groups). The most productive section of society would be hardest hit by deaths from Aids, which in turn would tighten the cycle of poverty. With health disasters piling on the population one after another, life expectancy could drop as low as 30 to 35, and households headed by children or old men and women would be the norm. Those kind of family groupings do not have the strength to cultivate land, and they will be forced into the most marginal subsistence agriculture, or, in some places in DRC, dangerous artisan mining of diamonds, gold and coltan. Girls would be compelled to join the sex trade to survive in the corrupt, swollen mega cities. </p> <p>After years of warfare, a generation of uneducated youth would know only the brutalised life of the gun, meaning that the gulf between the political elite of the countries and the rest of the population would be wider than ever. The possibility of moving any part of the region towards democracy might disappear for generations. The civilian brain drain would worsen, depriving the civic culture and leaving the military in the ascendant. That would set the stage for new dictatorial regimes as debased as those of Idi Amin in Uganda, or Mobutu Sese Seko in the former Zaire. Africa's standing in the rest of the world would be completely debased, and African writers and artists would no longer be portraying life in the continent, only life in exile. </p> <p>Would the US seek to make its presence felt to help guarantee security? Yes, but only out of self-interest. With regional war on the horizon, the US would quickly upgrade its warm relations with Uganda and establish a permanent military base for the region, in order to maintain access to the oil reserves of southern Sudan. Like other western governments, however, it will have given up on the people of the region.</p> <p> <b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>In 2020 central Africa could be a completely different place, where the warlords and kleptocrats of the present day would be nothing but historical curiosities, and where new visionary leadership, much of it female, could lead the continent in transformed relations with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Under this leadership, arms sales to Africa would be banned by the newly invigorated African Union, and the war zones of central Africa would begin to hold regular competitions for the biggest and longest burning bonfires of small arms. The spark for this would be a major western political figure - perhaps Gordon Brown - taking the initiative in the very near future and persuading the G8 to cancel Africa's debt and remove all agricultural subsidies in Europe and the US, providing equal access to EU and US markets. The 2004 annual global figure of $300bn in subsidies to farmers in the rich nations would be abolished. And if the European leaders would make the leap to fight terrorism by first fighting poverty and injustice, that money could be put into the weakest states in the world - many of them in central Africa.</p> <p>Massive funding for health and education would then pour into the continent, especially into central Africa's former war zones. New HIV/Aids vaccines could prevent a disastrous shift in the demographics of Africa and successfully arrest the decline of the productive age group, ensuring the the region would not lose their farmers, teachers and nurses.</p> <p>Education funding on an unprecedented scale would be a priority. By 2020 it might at last be recognised that UN and aid agency piecemeal projects to eliminate illiteracy have failed postwar societies. What Africa's new generations really need is tertiary education if they are to create both civil societies and a political class able to make an impact in the wider world. That could be achieved with a mass of new initiatives planned in the region and funded from outside. Devices such as twinning African universities with western universities and increased use of distance learning for African students could be the fashionable causes for western academic institutions. The judicious use of targeted funding could also address the long-standing problem of the brain drain. The combination of political stability and money could lure back those who have left and keep those who had planned to leave. If that can be achieved, by 2020 central Africa would have leaders capable of transforming the region. With secure, democratic governments free of corruption, the rule of law could become a priority. Warlords would be delivered to the International Criminal Court to stand trial for their war crimes. At home there would be trials for corruption, truth commissions would be established, and governments would be able to compensate survivors.</p> <p>If Africa, aided by resources from the rich countries, can manage two decades of building skills, free and open communication, and pluralist politics, we can hope by 2020 for the growth of a confident political class unlike any since the first years of independence from colonialism, when Congo's Patrice Lumumba was the region's hero. The impact of these leaders on international bodies such as the UN, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the IMF could help produce by 2020 the new world order so elusive over the previous half century.</p> <p> <b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>By 2020 central Africa will be divided into two types of country. In failing states, such as DRC, large areas of the country will be out of contact and control of the weak central authority. But two decades of strong and visionary leaders in states such as Rwanda and Tanzania will lead to huge investment in education and technology in those countries, which will have emerged as regional leaders. They'll also be recognised across as the first countries to transcend ethnic politics, which will be widely considered old-fashioned and destructive.</p> <p>In these flourishing countries the population will be moving out of poverty. New computer-based industries will provide work for the educated, as has already happened in Bangalore and Chennai. Ecotourism will be a magnet for high-spending foreigners and bring infrastructure and income to rural areas. The brain drain to the west will be a forgotten phenomenon, and the universities will be linked to the best specialised departments across the world.</p> <p>The west will have long since cancelled Africa's debt, and vastly increased aid will flow to the continent. And the agricultural subsidies to western farmers that used to be thought an essential part of European and American domestic politics will seem a curious piece of old history. But in places where the leadership is weak and lacks vision, the new external resources will not have been enough to break the cycle of poverty.</p> <p>Violence will still hold sway, and poor education and poor health - especially the scourge of HIV/Aids - will still cripple the population. In these countries, life expectancy will be the lowest in the world. Ethnic loyalties will still be the determining factor in politics, and a ready supply of small arms into the region means armed factions will still control many areas in shifting alliances with each other, leaving the populations as desperately insecure and poor as they are now. The rich natural resources of those countries will not enable them to escape this bleak future. Outsiders will control the rich mining areas of DRC and the oil wealth of southern Sudan, and the profits will flow out of Africa as they have for centuries.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Victoria Brittain has worked on Africa since 1975 and lived in several African countries, some as the Guardian's correspondent</p> <p><b>Middle East</b></p> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>The US will blame Iranian interference for the turmoil in Iraq and will launch military strikes against the Tehran regime. Resistance to the US will stiffen in Iran and among Shia Muslims across the region: Shia rebellions could break out in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Anarchy in Iraq will give Kurds the excuse they need to declare independence and foment a Kurdish uprising in Syria.</p> <p>The \"war on terror\" will destroy al-Qaida as an organisation but it will not dampen Islamist militancy. Its greatest effect will be to spawn hundreds of small autonomous groups that prove impossible to monitor. </p> <p>The Yemeni elections of 2009 will prove to be the last in the Arab world as governments backtrack on democracy, blaming the deteriorating security situation. The EU will deal with that same problem by approving a Middle East stability pact that lifts all restrictions on weapon sales to regimes that are deemed to be combating terrorism.</p> <p>The threat of Islamist terror will continue to spread beyond the Arab world. London will face its gravest threat when an Islamist group threatens to explode a dirty nuclear device unless Britain stops supporting \"Arab lackeys of Zionism and Crusaderism\". There will be no progress towards peace with Israel, so the Palestinians will abandon their claim for a separate state and demand equal rights with Israeli citizens. </p> <p>By 2015, the UN will have accepted a plan to divide the whole of historic Palestine into a series of Jewish and Arab cantons, but it will not end the conflict. By 2020, Nato forces sent to implement the plan will still be struggling to impose peace in the face of stiff resistance from extremists on both sides.</p> <p><b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>The Arab-Israeli conflict will end by 2008 with the creation of a viable Palestinian state, and a peace treaty between Israel and Syria. All the Arab states, plus Iran, will then recognise Israel and exchange ambassadors. Talks can begin on ridding the Middle East of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and by 2012 UN inspectors will be able to declare the region a WMD-free zone.</p> <p>Peace with Israel would remove one of the main driving forces behind Islamic militancy in the region, which would in turn lead to a decline in terrorism. Political reform throughout the region would also follow peace, since Arab leaders would no longer be able to blame Israel for their countries' problems.</p> <p>Iraq will avert civil war and stay in one piece - but only just. Amid the chaos left by its elected civilian government, the return to military rule later this decade will be greeted with widespread relief. By 2020, the Iraqi regime will still be promising elections \"next year or as soon as the situation permits\".</p> <p>Elsewhere, the strategy of gradual but steady reform is largely successful. By 2020, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states will have become constitutional monarchies, while Yemen, Egypt and Syria will have all held elections that - for the first time - result in changes of government. In Africa, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia will be readying themselves to join the EU, probably by 2030. Libya, which could be the Mediterranean's fastest-growing tourist destination by 2020, will remain politically eccentric: all government decisions will be made by citizens voting on the net.</p> <p><b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>How will Iraq be faring in 2020? It will be a toss-up between rule by Saddam Lite (authoritarianism with American blessing) and the fragmentation of the state. The underlying conflicts over religion and ethnicity will take years to play out - probably through violence, unless a strong national leader emerges. Continued instability in Iraq will harm all its neighbours.</p> <p>But that does not mean the region will have been dragged into continual conflict. By 2020 there will be a new generation of Arabs who have known satellite TV and the internet all their lives; the significance of that should not be underestimated. So far, globalised media has achieved three things in the Middle East: it has engaged ordinary Arabs in international politics in a way that was impossible before; it has given them a view of western lifestyles that some covet and others reject; and it has given them a sense of common Muslim/Arab identity that cuts across borders and the nationalism of individual states.</p> <p>The belief that Arabs and Muslims are victims of American and Israeli designs is almost universal in the Middle East, as is the feeling that the current leaders are powerless to do anything about it. One response - the dominant one at present - is Islamist militancy, but there are others, especially among the urban young, who want to be like the rest of the world. Among religious believers, too, there are many who privately question the confrontational, backward-looking interpretations of Islamists.</p> <p>There is a chance that, by 2020, the fundamentalist trend will have peaked and that new, more progressive interpretations of Islam will have begun to emerge. The idea that Arab/Muslim societies can survive as islands of cultural authenticity or religious purity in a globalised world is nothing but pure fantasy. Today, Saudi censors go through every imported newspaper, obliterating \"undesirable\" material while millions of Saudi citizens are able to watch whatever takes their fancy on satellite television. </p> <p>Moves towards a form of Islam that is more compatible with modern life will also be reflected in social and political changes. The need here is not for cosmetic democracy but for ideas of tolerance and openness to take hold, for accountability and transparency in public life, and for political parties based on policies rather than tribal, ethnic or religious allegiances.</p> <p>It's a tall order, but it will have to happen sometime. The two factors most likely to hold it back are American policies towards the region and continued conflict with Israel. It is difficult to imagine that Israeli voters, at some point before 2020, will not weary of the strategy pursued by their present government and decide that there has to be a better way. </p> <p>Whether American voters will reach the same conclusion is more doubtful. The old, confrontational cold war themes play well with American voters when reapplied to the Arab and Muslim world, but don't really serve American interests. The best thing the US can do for the Middle East over the next 16 years is stop prescribing solutions and ask: \"Is there anything we can do to help?\" It should also not be too offended when the reply is \"Yes. Please go away.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Brian Whitaker is the Guardian's Middle East editor</p> <p><b>Kashmir</b></p> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>India and Pakistan's rivalry over Kashmir could, by 2020, have finally have erupted into a nuclear exchange that might leave 100 million people dead and lay waste to half a million square kilometres of rich agricultural land in Asia. The roots of such a disaster would lie in a series of political miscalculations and in chronic economic mismanagement.</p> <p>The main problem will be the two neighbours refusing to make the tough decisions required for peace. Political misjudgments would see India failing to realise its potential as an economic powerhouse, with successive governments introducing policies that favour the rise of a small urban elite, rather than lifting the fortunes of the rural poor. This could spark armed insurrection among the poor of northern and eastern India. The Maoist rebellion in Nepal would exacerbate the problem, providing ideological coherence from the Himalaya to the plains of India.</p> <p>Governance will be a thing of the past in many of India's large northern and eastern states. The country's southern regions, which have their own distinctive culture and languages, will begin to agitate for a form of independence. The north will react differently to the political chaos, electing a hardline Hindu nationalist leadership that would stress national unity. Its plea would fail. The Indian union will unravel if a south Indian fiscal union is formed between Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh and Karnataka. These four wealthy states, with close ties to the hi-tech US defence industry and burgeoning software industries, might refuse to subsidise the central government and the north, leading to a major political crisis.</p> <p>In Pakistan, the modernisers will lose out to the religious zealots by 2010 after Nato ends all its operations in Afghanistan. The military, in effect, will become the armed wing of a theocracy - one armed with a nuclear bomb. This fundamentalist state would begin to neglect education and would do little to stem the rise of Islamic institutes, preferring instead to produce an army of willing volunteers for jihad in Kashmir and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Religion would not be a strong enough glue for the nation. The simmering tension between the states of Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab would begin to boil over. The argument will be that Punjab's plains soak up most of Pakistan's water and its industry consumes most of the country's coal, depriving other states. Militant groups would declare independence in Sindh and Balochistan and begin targeting Punjabi officials. Pakistan's civil war would have begun.</p> <p>In Kashmir, the issue of water is going to be crucial. The three rivers that feed Pakistan - the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - run through Indian Kashmir. With the water table of Pakistan decreasing and north-west India facing shortages, the two nations will abrogate their mutual water treaty by 2015. America might by then have decided that an independent Kashmir is the answer and arm insurgency groups via China. And by then Kashmir will have become a killing field, with Indian and Pakistani-backed fighters engaged in open warfare. This war in Kashmir, Pakistan's anarchy and political chaos in India will turn the region into a live bomb: all that would be needed is someone to light the fuse. Kashmir will be the excuse, not the reason. But by this point apocalypse will be inevitable; the world will have seen its first case of mutually assured destruction.</p> <p><b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>By 2020 no one will believe that almost 20 years before, Pakistan and India were poised in a nuclear stand-off over the then restive Kashmir, which will have become the tranquil tourist haven of Kashmir Autonomous Region.</p> <p>The turning point was the summer of 2002, which marked the end of history for the region. Not long after, the leaders of the two nations began to escape from the prison of the past. India and Pakistan made the commitment to develop friendly relations and leave the settlement of the Kashmir question to the diplomatic process which began this year. </p> <p>The factor that will lead to peace is the realisation of the leadership of both countries that neither can win militarily. That, and the emergence of a new South Asian Union (SAU) as a single economic area, which will grease the development of sound bilateral relations. Instead of Hindu nationalism and Islamic chauvinism, leaders in both countries would then opt for good governance and development.</p> <p>The simple fact is that to house, feed and provide jobs for ever-growing populations, both India and Pakistan need to start working together. By making social and economic policies the priority for government, rather than nurturing nationalism, both will lift tens of millions out of poverty. Trade will be the proving ground of the new relationship. If the energy-hungry metropolises of the subcontinent can be supplied by pipelines from Iran and Turkmenistan, then both countries will stand to benefit. Islamabad will gain wealth from transit fees while India will be able to buy cheap energy. The two countries will discover that trade is a game of mutual interests, where both will be able to seek and gain benefit. Delhi will allow Pakistani goods to travel by road to reach south-east Asia. In return Islamabad will open transit routes to central Asia for Indian wares.</p> <p>The cultural and religious antagonisms between India and Pakistan will then fade, reducing the need for perpetual war-footing. No longer will their people consider each other to be in the grip of obscurantist preachers and zealots. They will be too busy setting up factories, rediscovering lost relatives and friends on the other side of the border, as well as taking holidays in hill stations and balmy sunspots. The signing of a nuclear-arms reduction treaty between India and Pakistan will also reduce tensions, and China will play a key role, aware that nuclear war in its backyard will hamper its own peaceful rise.</p> <p>In Kashmir, under the guidance of an American peace envoy, a ceasefire will be in place by 2007. The Indian army will finally withdraw from the Kashmir Valley and Delhi can then address the human rights violations perpetrated since the insurgency began in 1989. Pakistan, too, will end its shadowy intelligence operations and close down militant camps in Kashmir. Home-grown armed separatists can then move towards the use of the ballot box, not the bullet.</p> <p>If a settlement is reached, the pace of change could be so fast that the problem will be not peace, but deciding what follows peace. Kashmir's complicated geography and the fact its territory is fractured along the fault lines of national identity and state allegiance mean there would be no easy answers. There are minorities who would fight for the status quo as viciously as they would for independence.</p> <p>To defuse these tensions will require a peace plan that first devolves power from Islamabad and Delhi to the state capitals of the two halves of Kashmir. Also elections in Pakistani and Indian Kashmir would allow representation from all political shades. The border would remain but crossing it would require no travel documents. By 2020, a single Kashmir political entity could be a reality, in one of the world's most tense and bitter rivalries.</p> <p><b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>The concept of a separate Kashmiri identity is going to disappear over the next 16 years, as the independence movement is submerged by the crashing waves of Indian and Pakistani nationalism. Kashmir will be simply carved into two by both countries, with China being handed the mountainous portion its army has occupied for decades. India and Pakistan will accept the deal, and the people of Kashmir will pay the price. Lacking an inspirational leader, Kashmiris will be unable to tell the world of their plight.</p> <p>The likely sop to the Kashmiri people will be a form of travel documents which both India and Pakistan will pledge to upgrade, eventually, into passports. Talk of a cross-border Kashmiri parliament will come to nothing: all that is likely to happen is a regular meeting of Indian and Pakistani-appointed politicians. Such a Kashmir settlement would not be accepted by separatists on either side of the border, but they will be unable to mobilise resistance. A joint Indo-Pakistan covert military operation will pick off the militant leaders and simply repress all forms of dissent. </p> <p>The reason for the diminishing importance of Kashmir in both national psyches is that both countries simply have more to lose than to gain over the issue. Pakistan will in time come to realise its primary advantage over India lies in its geopolitical location, which gives it access to the huge and growing market across the border. It will be in both countries' interests to agree a nuclear no-first-use pact, probably sponsored by the Americans</p> <p>The two countries will also be brought closer by the movement towards a south Asian common market. When an agreement to establish a SAU is finally signed in 2015, the region's legal and economic institutions will be forced to improve their services and, to some extent, harmonise their activities. The SAU would have to grant Kashmir special status, but to tempt investors restrictions on land acquisitions will be lifted, leading to a buy up by big business. That will mean the arrival of a migrant workforce for Kashmir's new industrial sector. The distinctive character of the region will start to fade, just like Tibet since its annexation by China.</p> <p>A less confrontational relationship between India and Pakistan will mean that by 2020 the shadow of conflict will no longer hang over south Asia.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Randeep Ramesh is the Guardian's south Asia correspondent</p>",
  "By 2020, China will have overtaken Japan as the world's second biggest economy. It may even have started to rival the US in terms of the hard power of its military. But if it is to achieve the government's goal of once again being the world's leading civilisation, the country will also have to acquire the \"soft power\" of universally appealing values. <p>How can it do that? Paradoxically, the best hope for softening China may be the same thing that poses its greatest threat: the HIV/Aids epidemic. China is on course to suffer the biggest epidemic of Aids in the world, but in the process it may find the illness acts as one of the main drivers for social change over the coming years.</p> <p>\"By 2020, Aids will have transformed society,\" says Wan Yanhai, an Aids activist who was arrested two years ago for disclosing details about China's HIV problem, which was then deemed a state secret. \"Both people and the virus will be more active in China. It is not something we can ignore. People have to ask questions about their way of life, they have to get involved in social politics and get organised. From my personal experience I'm absolutely certain that this kind of activity will lead China towards a democracy.\"</p> <p>It is already possible to get a glimpse of China in 2020. It is an impressive sight. Barring a war over Taiwan or an economic crash - both distinct possibilities - the country will have been transformed by the greatest spurt of development in world history. Beijing - currently thick with cranes and noisy with hammers and drills - will have hosted an Olympics to dwarf all its predecessors in terms of scale and spectacle. With annual growth of more than 7% per year, Shanghai, the country's commercial capital, will have overtaken Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore as Asia's leading financial centre. Further south, Guandong province will be the unrivalled workshop of the world. Its giant factories on the Pearl River delta will not only be churning out the labour-intensive goods of old, but also cutting-edge products developed by China's premier institutes of nanotechnology and cloning.</p> <p>China will have become a land of superlatives. By 2020, a host of world-beating projects will be completed: the biggest hydroelectric project, the Three Gorges Dam in Sichuan Province; the longest bridge and tunnel, near Shanghai; and the highest railway, which will rise above 4,000 metres through the Himalayas to connect Tibet with Qinghai.</p> <p>China will also be leading the world, reluctantly, in HIV/Aids. According to government estimates, the world's most populous nation had 840,000 cases of the disease in 2003. That amounts to less than 0.01% of the population, far lower than the 35% infection rates in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. But with the number of new cases rising at between 20% and 40% per year, the United Nations has warned that China could have 10 million cases by 2010 - double the number at present in South Africa, which is currently the world's worst affected nation.</p> <p>Despite the huge numbers, health officials insist the disease will not derail China's economy. According to the government's latest HIV/Aids impact assessment, the epidemic will cost the country no more than 15.9bn renminbi (\u00a31.1bn) by 2010 - equivalent to only 0.03% of GDP. But that optimistic view was contradicted last year by the former US president Bill Clinton, who warned that lost working hours and rising health costs could derail progress.</p> <p>\"China is moving in a positive direction. The headlines are hopeful and the future looks bright,\" he told a conference at Tsinghua University last year. \"But the weight of 15 or 30 million people living with HIV/Aids could blunt a lot of your progress, especially if the burden falls most heavily on young people.\"</p> <p>Officials admit the figures are guesswork. Government cover-ups, social taboos and a dilapidated healthcare system mean very few cases of HIV/Aids are reported. Some provinces, led by Yunnan - a major centre for the drug trade - have been very open about their problem and have sought international help to establish condom promotion and needle-exchange programmes that ought to help control the epidemic by 2020.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the government followed that lead, extending Yunnan's policies across the country, as well as offering free tests and treatment to sufferers. But not all China's rulers have been so decisive. Henan province, for example, continues to cover up a blood-collection scandal - in which villagers sold their blood en masse, with the result that infected blood became mixed in to the supply - that produced infection rates of more than 50% in countless villages. Official figures suggest Henan has 40,000 people who are HIV-positive, but Aids activists believe the figure is over 1 million and rising because infected villagers are migrating to work in cities and their tainted blood is still being used in hospitals. Given that 23 provinces ran blood-selling operations, the problem could be widespread.</p> <p>\"I'm still very pessimistic about the control of Aids, especially about its spread,\" says Gao Yaojie, a local doctor who received international plaudits - and official intimidation - for helping to expose the problem in Henan. \"The government has started to act on blood collection, but it hasn't done anything on the [black market] blood transfusion problem, which is also very serious. In Henan, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong and Sichuan, there are many underground clinics which offer cheap - and probably polluted - blood.\"</p> <p>An equally grim picture is painted by Wan Yanhai,who has set up an NGO called Aizixin in Beijing. \"I don't think that infection rates will slow over the next 10 years,\" he says. \"The government has not invested enough in intervention and it is still underplaying the scale of the problem. My guess is that there are already 5 million to 10 million cases. By 2020, this will rise above 20 million.\" </p> <p>The World Health Organisation disputes those claims, saying the government has done enough to keep the epidemic in check. Dr Zhao Pengfei, the HIV-Aids coordinator at the WHO's Beijing office, believes that by 2020 the target should be to keep the number of cases below 5 million. \"Even in the worst case scenario, I don't think there will be 10 million cases by 2020,\" he says.</p> <p>But he warned China must brace itself for the disease spreading from the current high-risk groups of blood-sellers and drug users - who are mostly concentrated in inland rural communities - to sex workers and the general population in urban areas on the eastern seaboard. Zhao's biggest concern is that gay men could pass on the disease to their wives and children. \"Because of social pressures in China, most of the gay population is married and lead bisexual lives, so they could act as a bridge for HIV to cross into the general population,\" he says. \"But social stigma has constrained the government from developing a policy to reach out to this group, even though measures are now in place for sex workers and drug users.\"</p> <p>The fact that these things can be discussed openly represents a significant break with the past. That - and the influx of international funds to deal with the crisis - explains why so many of China's sharpest minds are drawn to working in the fight against Aids, which is now attracting the sort of idealists who would have been campaigning for democracy 15 years ago. </p> <p>The slaughter of students and civilians in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989 has taught subsequent generations that engaging in direct political confrontation is dangerous and futile. Graduates of the country's top universities are now more likely to concentrate on making money - either through business or the Communist party. But for those still driven to change the world, HIV is an opportunity. Whether they work as healthcare professionals, journalists or NGO volunteers, they can not only help the sick, but highlight the growing threat of the disease as a means to indirectly shape China's values. </p> <p>This reform by stealth is working. As the Sars crisis demonstrated last year, health is a vulnerable spot for a communist government that has presided over a growing income gap between rich and poor and a steady deterioration in the quality of rural hospitals. It has also become an opportunity for the new leadership of the Communist party to prove its compassion. Last December, in a marked break with his predecessors, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited an Aids hospital, where he told a patient: \"We need care and love, equality and opposition to prejudice.\"</p> <p>Many NGOs and health workers see the more compassionate approach to Aids as a sign that the government has shifted from a single-minded pursuit of economic growth to a more holistic policy of balanced development.\"HIV is already making a huge impact on society,\" says Lily Liquing of Marie Stopes International, one of an increasing number of foreign NGOs that have been allowed to operate in China. \"It is helping to nurture a civil society and greater internationalism because the authorities and NGOs are working with their counterparts overseas in ways that wouldn't have been imaginable before. Homosexuals are getting organised for the first time, schools are working harder on sex education, and women are more conscious of family planning issues. HIV is bringing some very positive social changes. It has brought problems out into the open. We are seeing less taboos in China now.\"</p> <p>While the disease has made life a misery for countless Chinese, it also appears to have given others strength. Ren Guoliang, a 23-year-old Aids activist, had to give up his job in the army and he now conducts lectures, works with an Aids hotline and appears on television to talk about the disease. Although he does not expect misunderstanding and discrimination to disappear for many years, his life has been made easier by the government's increased openness and the provision of free retroviral drugs. </p> <p>\"In 2020, I believe China will have more democracy, that there will be better policies for care and treatment of Aids. Civil society will have matured and we'll be more open about the disease, which will help to control its spread.\"</p> <p>But he also fears another bleaker version of the future. \"If the government fails to keep up the recent good momentum, Aids will spread out of control. It will be a disaster threatening millions of lives. China will be the next Africa.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Jonathan Watts is the Guardian's China correspondent</p>",
  "Two career criminals who ran Britain's biggest firearms conversion business were jailed for six years each yesterday. <p>Stephen Herbert, 47, and Gary Beard, 45, bought 574 replica and blank-firing guns, worth \u00a3344,000, converted them into deadly weapons and sold them to London's gangsters at the rate of one a day. </p> <p>They were arrested in February last year after a 14-month surveillance operation. Police raided their homes and two lock-up garages in south London, where they found dozens of weapons in various stages of conversion. Several hundred guns already sold on are unaccounted for. </p> <p>A police source said there was no doubt that guns converted by the pair had found their way into the hands of serious criminals and been used in all manner of crime, from robberies to shootings. The pair, who both have a string of convictions stretching back 30 years, could have been jailed for 10 years but Judge David Paget reduced the sentence because they had pleaded guilty. </p> <p>Yesterday, as he was led from the dock at the Old Bailey, Herbert shouted: \"That's lovely, thanks very much. We got away with that.\" </p> <p>Last night the Crown Prosecution Service said it was considering referring the sentence to the attorney general for \"undue leniency\". </p> <p>The weapons included \u00a340 Walther PPKs, Brococks (gas-cartridge pistols), Italian handguns and a 12-bore shotgun. </p> <p>Undercover police officers saw the pair buying replica guns from dealers and Beard, a former jeweller, was seen buying tools and metal tubing, used to replace gun barrels, from a local DIY store. </p> <p>They were also caught selling guns to buyers who had travelled from London to Liverpool. </p> <p>Mark Gadsden, prosecuting, said: \"These conspirators were converting and putting out on to the streets of London these prohibited weapons at the rate of one per day. </p> <p>\"The amounts they bought were as little as two or three to up to 20 or 40 at a time. They bought 574 guns over a period of 14 months.\" </p> <p>Beard's and Herbert's fingerprints were found on gun boxes and packaging. On the first day of the trial in May they admitted conspiracy to manufacture and supply prohibited weapons and conspiracy to supply firearms with intent to cause fear of violence, between April 23 2002 and February 25 2003. </p> <p>Mr Gadsden said: \"This case concerns the largest group of blank-firing weapons that were converted into fully functioning prohibited weapons nationally.\"</p>",
  "It began nearly three years ago in the early hours of December 19 2001. Nine men were removed from their homes across the country by dozens of police officers and taken to Belmarsh and Woodhill high security prisons. Their families were not told where they were until much later. All non-UK nationals - from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia - the men were certified as \"suspected international terrorists\" under a new law passed only days before, the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act (ATCSA), whereby the home secretary requires only \"reasonable belief\" that those detained are a threat to national security. The men cannot be identified because to do so might put their families at risk here and in their home countries. They have been in prison now for years, without charge, without trial and with no prospect of release. To allow for this, Britain had to renege on the section of the European convention of human rights stipulating no detention without trial - the only country out of 40 to have done so. <p>By now, 17 foreign nationals in all have been certified. Of those, 13 are being detained; one has been released on bail but may not leave his home; two have left the UK; and one has been released after a successful appeal. The detainees occupy small cells, 3m by 1.8m, for 22 hours a day, rarely see daylight and are strip-searched each time they are visited (a particular humiliation for devout Muslim men). Gareth Peirce, of Birnberg Peirce solicitors, who represents all but two of the men, says that they have been \"entombed in concrete\". Amnesty International describes the indefinite detentions without trial as \"a Guant\u00e1namo in our own back yard\", and conditions at Belmarsh as \"cruel, inhuman and degrading\". </p> <p>Not even their solicitors can establish why these men have been detained - the evidence, for reasons of national security, cannot be disclosed. The men are in a surreal legal no man's land specific to foreign nationals: they cannot be tried because there is not enough evidence against them; although labelled suspected terrorists, they are free to leave Britain; but they cannot be deported because they face persecution, torture or death in their countries of origin (the reason so few have opted to leave Britain voluntarily). All the detainees have to go on is the statements made in open sessions of a review at the Special Immigration and Appeals Court (Siac), which late last year confirmed the detentions to be appropriate. These statements link each of the men to terrorist organisations and fraudulent activities claimed to be financing a terrorist agenda. For example, one case summarises that the man in question \"took an important role in support activities for the GSPC [the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, an Algerian extremist group] within the UK and, more widely, for the objectives of Bin Laden and al-Qaida\". But such claims are not backed by surveillance evidence. In all, says Peirce, the open evidence amounts to this: \"You are someone who is associated with other people who are believed to have links with an organisation which is believed to have links in some unspecified way with al-Qaida.\" Any evidence confirming such statements appeared in a closed court, to which the detainees and their lawyers were not invited. </p> <p>The Home Office claims that its \"suspected terrorist\" decisions were based on \"detailed and compelling evidence\" - although evidently not compelling enough to warrant a prosecution - and argues that, although the detentions are an undesirable outcome, there is no alternative. \"What else are you going to do?\" says a spokesman. \"If you are the government of the day, you have an obligation to the public to protect them against a suspected threat.\" </p> <p>But lawyers and campaigners are horrified at the quality of information presented in the open sessions. \"I have been shocked,\" says Natalia Garcia of Tyndallwoods solicitors, who represents two of the detainees. \"I thought the secret services were much more efficient and up to speed.\" Garcia reports that an intelligence service witness at Siac, supposedly a specialist in Islamic extreme groups, had never heard of leading experts in the field and used inaccurate translations in court. According to both Garcia and Peirce, the information given by anonymous MI5 witnesses mentioned organisations nobody else had heard of. The security services relied heavily on press cuttings, even though, as the Observer's home affairs editor, Martin Bright, pointed out in his evidence to Siac, the information in them often came from intelligence sources in the first place. Meanwhile, Sir Peter Heap, a former British ambassador, has written about the unreliability of the intelligence agency MI6: \"A substantial amount of intelligence information is bought,\" he says. \"The sources of a lot of it are quite dubious, and those who are best able to assess the value of that evidence are not allowed to know what the sources are.\" </p> <p>One source, it is feared, may be the defendants' home governments. Men who have fled persecution and been granted asylum here on that basis are perhaps now being detained on the strength of information provided by the persecuting regimes. And it gets worse. Evidence may have been obtained under torture from detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and Bagram military airbase, Afghanistan. Such evidence would be unwelcome in any ordinary British court; indeed, torture or no, any information extracted from inmates at Guant\u00e1namo would probably be regarded as unsafe. \"These are people who have been held for well over two years in a legal limbo,\" says a spokesman for Amnesty. \"I would say anything to get out of there, anything - even if it incriminated someone else.\" </p> <p>However, this is not ordinary British judicial procedure. In August, appeal court judges decreed that evidence extracted under torture was admissible in British courts, as long as British agents were not the ones doing the torturing. This followed an appeal by the detainees, involving a byzantine discussion of what could or could not be admissible evidence: if the torture was carried out by British officials, the evidence definitely could not be accepted by a British court, but what if they were simply present at the time of the torture, or knew it was going to happen? \"For the victim of torture,\" the Amnesty spokesman responds, \"who cares if it was a British official or not?\" A further appeal is scheduled to be heard at the House of Lords on October 4 to 7. </p> <p>None of the detainees can understand why he has not at any point been questioned. This is in stark contrast to the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, who are so regularly questioned that fresh interrogators are flown in to operate on three-month shifts. Louise Christian, who represents some of the British detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, says: \"The US openly avow they are holding people at Guant\u00e1namo for intelligence purposes and are actively pursuing that, but the British authorities have decided that their detainees are a threat to national security, and are not holding them for intelligence purposes.\" If the British security services genuinely believe the Belmarsh detainees are terrorists, it is odd that they do not see the need to try to glean information from them about other associates or planned campaigns. Peirce says she has seen a five-year-old MI6 report on one of the detainees describing him as \"a charismatic figure of influence . . . exerting a restraining influence on potential younger hotheads\". </p> <p> </p> <p> O ne of the first to be detained was Mahmoud Abu Rideh, a Palestinian refugee in his early 30s, whose name was released before the court order barring such disclosures came into effect. He is, it is claimed, \"closely involved with senior extremists and associates of Osama bin Laden, both in the UK and overseas\". He counters that his charitable work in Afghanistan, where he set up a school for the children of \"Britain's most wanted\", did indeed put him in contact with affiliates of al-Qaida - but was he aiding the cause of terror by helping the children of extremists? \"Maybe your father was not a judge; maybe your children won't be either,\" he told Siac. A father of five, Abu Rideh is diagnosed as suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, having been tortured in Israel, and his imprisonment at Belmarsh has triggered flashbacks. He was transferred to Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, but experts who have examined him believe he should be placed near his family, at a hospital with less oppressive security measures. Doctors at Broadmoor have accused the Home Office of \"unprecedented political interference\", since it has ignored their advice. </p> <p>\"Mr M\", a 38-year-old Libyan, was released in March after a Siac appeal found that his 15-month detention under the ATCSA was based on evidence that was \"wholly unreliable and should not have been used\". Now, he says, he can think of nothing but the men he has left behind in Belmarsh. In April, he told the Guardian: \"I knew some of them outside of the prison. Their behaviour and how they were when I saw them inside was completely different. They had lost weight and three or four of them had gone crazy.\" Lawyers confirm that they are seeing these men collapse. \"We are more than worried,\" says Peirce. \"We now regard this as an emergency.\" A Home Office spokesman says that detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons have ready access to routine and emergency medical care. </p> <p>Last December, the home secretary, David Blunkett, said of the detentions: \"These were not powers I assumed lightly. I have never pretended that they are ideal, but I firmly believe that they are currently the best and most workable way to address the particular problems we face.\" This has echoes of Tony Blair's justification of his stance on Iraq as a difficult but necessary decision. In any case, the Home Office is confident that the act is checked in several ways, the obvious one being Siac, since its purpose is to review the government's certification. But Siac uses the standard of proof set by the ATCSA itself - a \"reasonable belief\". \"If you and I had a car accident, we would have to prove our facts to a higher degree,\" says the Amnesty spokesman. The ATCSA has to be renewed by parliament every five years, and the clause relating to detention reviewed every 15 months. But the internment laws in Northern Ireland during the 1970s carried similar renewal provisions and lasted over 20 years. </p> <p>The purpose of the reviews is not to question the antiterrorism law which allows for detention, but rather to establish that the new law is not being misused.\"If the law in itself is flawed, then the checks on it just become a bit of PR,\" says Tony Bunyon at Statewatch, an information group that monitors the state and civil liberties in the EU. </p> <p>Because they are nameless, faceless, hidden, it is as though the detainees are not connected to families and communities. In fact, most of the men, who are all in their 20s and 30s, have wives and children; two became fathers while in prison. Now some of the detainees' wives have begun to speak of their experiences, after meeting one another for the first time in July. \"We were shocked at the horrendous experiences of racism and harassment,\" says Niki Adams at Legal Action for Women, which hosted the meeting at the Crossroads Women's Centre in London. Where the police raids had been visible, the wives left behind were often bullied by neighbours. One of the wives says of another: \"She was left with her children with a broken door for several days, and was terrified that people would break in and attack her. She was terrorised by her racist neighbour, who set his dog on her and threw cleaning water on her on the stairs of her estate.\" </p> <p>The women complain that they were treated like criminals when their husbands were arrested - even when they had children or elderly relatives with them. \"Both the prison officers and the police mocked us and our religion,\" says one of the wives. \"They behaved like they knew our husbands were guilty and we were stupid because we didn't know what our husbands were doing. They tried to make me suspicious of my husband . . . It really got to me.\" The women, says Adams, are now \"hanging on by their fingertips\" as they try to support both their husbands and their children. \"Their kids just couldn't understand it -there was nothing the mothers could say to explain why their fathers had been taken away from them, with no end in sight.\" She adds: \"All the women, unprompted, described their husbands as very sociable people, generous and relied on by lots of people in the community. Their houses were meeting places where newcomers would be welcomed.\" </p> <p>Those homes must seem empty now. \"I didn't go to anyone outside my family for help, because I knew that if I got in contact with someone, they would be under suspicion,\" says one woman. \"Many of my friends disappeared because of this.\" The apparent lack of evidence on the detainees was enough to make others wonder: if they can pick him up like that, then why not me? </p> <p>That message is being heard loud and clear by Britain's Muslim population. The detentions \"strike almost all Muslims as deeply unjust\", says Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). Because this detention law does not apply to British citizens, it effectively creates a different set of rules for foreigners. Indeed, that is being said about Britain's terrorism laws with regard to Muslims. When in July the Home Office released figures showing a 300% increase in police use of stop-and-search powers against British Asians, it came as no surprise to members of that community. \"We were hearing of far, far greater increases in the number of people being stopped and searched, but even so, these figures are stark,\" says Bunglawala. Since 2001, the number of white people stopped and searched under antiterrorism laws has doubled. </p> <p>The ATCSA was introduced hurriedly in 2001 in response to the fear, frequently reiterated since, that Britain is likely to be the target of an attack. Security experts warn that the threat comes from within, from al-Qaida sympathisers living in the UK, and that the terror is getting closer: after 9/11, it was Bali, then Kenya; after that, British targets in Turkey and, nearer still, the devastating train bombs in Madrid. Coupled with the Terrorism Act of 2000, the act gives the state extra powers of search, arrest, questioning, surveillance and detention. Lawyers, human rights groups and campaigners have for some time been warning of the effects of Britain's counterterrorism measures: of a widespread misuse of police stop-and-search powers; erroneous arrests in high-profile raids; indefinite detentions without trial. Long-established civil liberties - freedoms of speech, movement and association; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair trial - are in jeopardy. Yet there is little public outcry, even at the clearly discriminatory incarceration in Belmarsh. These freedoms are mainly being denied to minority groups. Unless you are a Muslim, a migrant or a vocal dissident, you may not feel their effect. </p> <p>The consensus appears to be that if this is what it takes to keep the rest of us safe, so be it: the authorities know what they are doing. Well, do they? </p> <p> S ince September 11 2001, there have been 622 terrorism arrests; of these, 69 led to charges and there have been 15 convictions, although several cases are pending. Many of the arrests were made in high-profile raids that allegedly thwarted devastating bomb plots, vindicating the government's continued warnings about terror threats and the need for harsh laws to counter them. Rarely have we heard what happened to the hundreds of people who were arrested and then released without charge. </p> <p>Shadman Sofi, 26, and Rebaz Ali, 23, sit in a flat above a kebab shop in Manchester, the one that was splashed all over our TV screens when police raided it in the early hours of April 19. \"They came to my flat, attacked me, pushed me to the floor and claimed I was a terrorist,\" says Sofi, who insists that \"acts of terror are against my ideology\". This was part of a huge antiterrorist operation which, we were told, foiled a plot to blow up Old Trafford football ground. Nine men and one woman were arrested by police. The next day, the Sun newspaper carried the following headline: \"Bomb gang had tickets all around the ground; Man Utd suicide blasts foiled.\" The Daily Mail took a similar line: \"Al-Qaida terror strike at Man Utd match is foiled.\" Eight days later, all 10 individuals were released. No charges were made against them. </p> <p>In Sofi's flat, there are posters of Old Trafford and Britney Spears on the walls. Sofi and Ali are big fans of Manchester United. \"All my life, I supported Manchester United. I love them,\" says Ali, who was a professional footballer in his home of Halabja in northern Iraq. They would have loved to attend the Liverpool v Manchester United game at which they were supposed to blow up Old Trafford, but neither could afford the tickets. In fact, the only football ticket found in Sofi's flat was two years old, kept as a souvenir. Sofi's CD collection includes Kurdish singers and top 40 pop groups. Before the raid, the two say, they would \"work all week, then go out and enjoy ourselves, drinking and clubbing at the weekend\". They are, in short, young men who spend their time doing young men things. Or, at least, they used to. </p> <p>\"Our reputation is in ruins,\" says Sofi, like Ali an Iraqi Kurd. \"We have lost our jobs, our girlfriends, we lost our friends. Nobody believes that we are not terrorists.\" The men, both atheists who say they have never set foot inside a mosque, want to change their names and move towns, because otherwise \"people will always remember us as the people who tried to bomb Manchester football ground\". They have received no apologies and do not know why they were arrested. Greater Manchester police say of all 10 arrests: \"The decision to run the operation was taken because of credible intelligence. It was 100% justified and there was no alternative for us.\" </p> <p> I rreversibly stigmatised, Sofi and Ali are also in a legal limbo, unable to work or receive benefits. Their asylum applications have been rejected, but they cannot be sent back to Iraq because it is not safe for them - and they have no passports or ID papers, so they can't go to any other country, either. Before their arrests, they both worked illegally in a packing factory - but now, says Sofi, they \"can't even get jobs on the black market\". They are surviving solely on the charity of their friends. Ali, whose mother, father, two brothers and two sisters were killed in Saddam's gas attacks on Halabja in 1988, says: \"Sometimes I wish I had been killed like them and not come to this country and been treated like this.\" </p> <p>Muddassar Arani, of solicitors Arani &amp; Co, represents many such cases. \"I wish people could see the human side: the wives being thrown out of their homes, one woman miscarrying from the shock of her husband's arrest, the effect it has on the children.\" </p> <p>Some of those arrested are more vocal than others. Babar Ahmad, a 30-year-old from Tooting, south London, was one of 14 people picked up in early morning raids across the country by antiterrorist branch police officers in early December last year. It made all the papers. Ahmad was, he says, assaulted by police in his home: \"Before I knew it, six or seven police officers are beating the daylights out of me. I'm lying on the floor with arms restrained behind my back and four people punching me on my face, my head, my ears, my back and my legs.\" He says that police officers also forced him to strip and assume the prayer position, asking, \"Where is your God now?\" and that he was further assaulted in the police van on the way to the station. </p> <p>Three days later, a doctor found that Ahmad had injuries all over his body, and tests found blood in his urine. He was held and questioned for seven days. \"It's not like you participated in a crime, or there is a particular crime that they want to ask you about,\" he said in July. \"They asked about my family, my political opinions, what mosque I go to . . . they try to incriminate you with anything. So if you have a bank receipt that says you spent \u00a365 in a Birmingham hotel, it's, 'OK, why did you go to Birmingham? Oh, maybe you went to scout the airport?' \" </p> <p>He was released without charge, but in early August he was picked up again, this time as a terror suspect on an extradition request from the US. Calling it an \"al-Qaida raid\", the Evening Standard reported that Ahmad was accused in court of being in possession of battle plans to attack the US navy. \"Are we to believe that the police massively cocked up in December and released al-Qaida's naval operations commander on to the streets of Tooting?\" asks Adnan Siddiqui of the campaign group Stop Police Terror. </p> <p>At the time of going to press, Ahmad was awaiting a second bail application. His first was refused: the prosecution lawyer pointed to Ahmad's house sale as evidence that he was cutting ties to this country. (Ahmad had earlier told me that he and his wife were selling their home because of its traumatic associations with the first arrest.) Meanwhile, the US government has until 65 days from the time of his arrest on August 5 to provide documents supporting the extradition request. Now at Woodhill prison, Ahmad is also awaiting the outcome of an investigation into his claims of police abuse by the Independent Police Complaints Commission -the IPCC findings were lodged on August 5 with the Crown Prosecution Service, which has yet to decide on what action, if any, should be taken. </p> <p>Over the past two years, there have been several other headline-grabbing, counterterrorism raids, notably the ricin swoops in January last year which, we were told, were part of a \"massive and complex\" investigation of a plot to use this lethal poison in a terror attack. After the initial panic died down, we heard that ricin was more commonly used to forge passports, although some of the ricin cases have yet to appear in court. </p> <p>Then came the raids in March this year, involving five police forces and 700 officers, when eight people were arrested under suspicion of involvement with terrorist activity. This time, half a tonne of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, of the type used as explosive in the Bali and Istanbul bombings, was found in a London self-storage unit. Court cases are expected some time next year. </p> <p>Last month, 13 people were arrested in counter-terrorism raids across the country. After being held by police for two weeks, the maximum time allowed, eight men were charged with terrorist offences. \"Were they plotting another 9/11?\" asked the Daily Express, naming the eight. The charges are both severe and oblique: conspiring to murder and commit public nuisance; plotting to use \"radioactive materials, toxic gases, chemicals and explosives\"; having \"reconnaissance plans\" for finance buildings in New York and, in one case, possessing a \"terrorist's handbook\". The men were due to appear in court again on September 3. </p> <p>That the focus of counterterrorism should be on Muslims is inevitable, given the degree to which Islam has been associated with violent extremism. \"There is nothing Islamic about what al-Qaida are doing. They are completely using it to further their own agenda,\" says Samar Mashadi at the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism (Fair). But much of the media doesn't want to know. \"It is always the 'mad mullahs' that are trotted out in the media,\" says Liz Fekete at the Institute of Race Relations. \"So that becomes the voice of the Muslim community as far as the general public is concerned. You have that stigma always attached to the Muslim community - that they are potential terrorists.\" </p> <p>If the police and security services seem focused on Muslims and asylum seekers, it legitimises racism on the streets. A Fair log of racist incidents in Britain is a catalogue of verbal and physical abuse, anthrax hoaxes in mosques and incidents of pork-hurling at Muslims on the streets. Massoud Shadjareh at the Islamic Human Rights Commission, meanwhile, says he has heard of \"around 700 attacks on Muslims in the year after September 11\". Small wonder, then, that Muslims are now considering whether it is time to leave Britain. \"People who were born here are now talking openly about whether there is room for them in this society,\" says Shadjareh. \"It is so sad, because we used to say to Europe that Britain was a good example of Muslim integration.\" </p> <p>And it's counterproductive. \"People accept that it is the police and secret services' responsibility to establish law and order,\" says Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain. \"But when they go and knock on somebody's door, they don't have to treat people, the whole family, as if they are all terrorists, all criminals. Because of this, our young people have lost trust in the system, which will take a long time to recover.\" After the Madrid bombings, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) sent letters to all UK mosques and Islamic centres, urging that anyone with information about potential acts of terror should tell the police. \"That call went right around the community,\" says Bunglawala of the MCB. \"But incidents like stop-and-searches for no identifiable reason only undermine the trust of the Muslim community and their willingness to help.\" </p> <p> A nd all the while more counterterror laws are being passed. In February, the ATCSA was changed so that police can now detain terror suspects without charge for 14 days instead of seven. In March, without consulting parliament, the government agreed that US extradition requests need not carry any prima facie evidence. When Lofti Raissi was detained in Belmarsh for five months after being accused by American authorities of training the pilots in the September 11 attacks, a judge finally decided there was not enough evidence on which Raissi could be extradited. That wouldn't happen now. It does not bode well for Babar Ahmad, who is in Woodhill awaiting evidence from the US to support its extradition request. Richard Egan, the solicitor who represented Raissi, says that supporting evidence now just means confirmation of the name and that the crime is indeed extraditable. \"The fact that the US can just say, 'We want X or Y, and we don't need to tell you why or to put it to the test' is extremely worrying.\" </p> <p>Tony Bunyon of Statewatch, an information group that monitors civil liberties in the EU, believes that, as a consequence of legislating to fight the so-called war on terror, \"we will end up defending a democracy which is not a democracy\". We are moving down that road now, he adds. We have already arrived, say the detainees at Belmarsh and the asylum seekers interviewed here, all of whom came to Britain precisely because they thought it honoured human rights and the rule of law</p>",
  "<b> Our new plot in Exmoor is infested with the bad type of rhododendron. I've tried dealing with it organically, but in some areas their roots are the only things preventing landslide. </b> <p>This will be the fearsome Rhododendron ponticum , a purple-flowered shrub first introduced as an ornamental. Problems arise when it takes off for the wild, forming dense thickets that no native birds or animals nest in or eat, and under which nothing will grow. As the fallen leaves rot, they release a growth-inhibiting chemical, so anything planted in their wake is stunted. You can speed the soil's recovery by clearing the top layer of leaf litter, although you should resist planting for a year. To hold soil in place in the meantime, dig in physical barriers, such as logs or railway sleepers. Pin biodegradable matting (ie, coir) over the area to stabilise it temporarily. Plant trees and shrubs with extensive root systems to bind the soil together - natives to Exmoor include rowan, whitebeam, hazel and blackthorn. There'll be plenty of dormant seeds waiting to spring into life once you've put the bullies in their place. </p> <p><b> We grow herbs in pots on the kitchen windowsill, but they're infested with thrips. How can we get rid of the little monsters and still eat the leaves?</b> </p> <p>Thrips give the surface of leaves a silvery mottling. They often attack indoor plants in hot and dry situations, so make sure you are watering regularly, and consider moving the plants to a cooler spot. Try Ambleysius, a biological control that is sprinkled on to the leaves and will munch through them in no time (from Green Gardener, 01394 420087).</p>",
  "<p>Barely a week into the new school term, and the artwork is already beginning to pile up. A haphazardly woven wallhanging, a dinosaur made from cereal boxes, and some sort of collage spewing string, glitter and polystyrene offcuts are in a heap on the kitchen table, awaiting display. But several days have now passed and still they lie there. Soon suspicions will be aroused and questions asked. Balled-up gobs of ancient Blu-Tack will be proffered and the children will point out the acres of empty space on the kitchen walls just waiting to be cheered up with their creations. Why the delay? </p> <p>The brutal truth is that, since I had the kitchen refitted, my children's pictures just don't go with the decor. In the time it has taken to paint over the horrible wallpaper and garish pine with a medley of subtle off-whites from Farrow &amp; Ball, I have turned into the sort of uptight monster who is extremely reluctant to have her pristine walls violated by anything as upsettingly slapdash as a clown's face made from pasta shapes glued on to school-issue sugar paper. </p> <p>It is, I admit, an ugly state of affairs when a craving for minimalism overrides a parent's desire to show pride in their children's creativity, but still I am torn, and cannot quite bring myself to display that Plasticine lizard fashioned from a wince-making medley of Day-Glo orange, green and pink. </p> <p>While wrestling with my conscience, I have attempted to shift some of the blame on to the twisted workings of the key stage two curriculum. I am convinced most primary school teachers are driven by a sadistic streak that leads them deliberately to sabotage parents' decorating schemes by encouraging children to make free with neon fake fur, glitter that drops all over your neutral sisal flooring, and scrunched-up tissue paper in shades selected to contradict this season's colour palette. So unless my nine-year-old can dream up a firework night scene without resorting to hackneyed oranges and reds, or devise a piece of weaving that picks up at least one of the soft neutrals in my magnificent new curtains, then, frankly, his work doesn't stand a chance of making the final cut. </p> <p>But there is no kind way of saying this to a child, so I am continuing to ignore the burgeoning collection of art on the table, now disappearing under a drift of bills and junk mail, and stalling the children with talk of buying, in the very near future, a proper cork noticeboard that will show off their work to optimum effect. But as sure as old Pringles tubes will be made into wonky pencil pots, there will be no noticeboard. Not in the kitchen, at any rate. I know that its role is to function as the throbbing, chaotic heart of the house, but at the moment mine looks more like an exceptionally clinical hospital sluice room, and that's the way I would like it to stay. I am proud of my children and love their artistic expressiveness, but at the moment what I love more is being complimented, by adult visitors, on my new, spacious kitchen. </p> <p>This isn't to say there is no child art on show around the house; there is plenty. Some pieces are mounted in maple frames, others transposed on to Perspex, at considerable expense, courtesy of a fancy London design company. This way both parties are kept happy: the children think their work is being granted lavish treatment because of its skill of execution, when, in truth, anally retentive parental quality control insists that it be spruced up and formalised in order to be acceptable for general display. </p> <p>There are, of course, some forms of junior creativity that are waved through with no deliberation whatever. Collections of tasteful stones arranged in attractive circles on a coffee table? Spot on. Organically shaped pieces of driftwood placed artfully on mantelpieces? Just the thing. Keep it natural, keep it neutral, I want to tell the children, and there will be no more nasty standoffs about clashing primary colours and questionable choices of wool offcuts for those homemade pompoms. </p> <p> Am I such a wicked parent? The evidence against me seems to be mounting up. I have become convinced that, with children aged nine and 12, we are far enough away from the hellish pre-school days of potato prints to consider reclaiming an adult environment. So much so that a white carpet has been laid and pale covers put on the sofas. As a result, I have become the kind of harridan who instigates a strict no-shoes policy and emits pained screams every time a visiting snot-nosed toddler comes within 50 metres of the living room. </p> <p>Perhaps it's asking too much to expect sympathy, but a little understanding would be appreciated. As a self-confessed sufferer from child art stress syndrome, I am about to enter the worst possible season. If the thought of autumnal dried leaf-and-twig collages isn't bad enough, there is the run-up to Christmas to consider - all that glitter, general garishness and an endless succession of wintry scenes featuring cotton-wool balls. On the plus side, snow is at least white and, should I defrost a little, it may yet merit a square metre or so of prime kitchen wall space.</p>",

  "<p>So, Michael Eisner, for 20 years head mouse in Disney's Magic Kingdom and latterly one of the most vilified chief executives in US corporate history, has finally decided to step down. </p> <p>This is the man whose management style was described by dissident director Roy Disney (founder Walt's nephew) as \"the singular imperial rule of an emperor\". Those views were shared by many others. </p> <p>He singlehandedly sparked what has been dubbed in the US \"the war for boardroom accountability\". His enormous pay (he took $1bn-plus out of the company in pay, bonuses and share options) has been rocket fuel to the executive pay debate. Few objected to his performance-linked pay in the first 10 years, when the business was motoring; but in the second - with poor TV acquisitions, underperforming retail operations and ailing theme parks, plus hugely expensive top-level firings ($350m to just two executives) and a string of movie flops - Eisner's constantly escalating pay became almost obscene. </p> <p>It was Eisner's perilous position that was said to have sparked an audacious low-ball \u00a334bn bid for Disney earlier this year by cable group Comcast - though it was later dropped. </p> <p>More than four out of 10 shareholders failed to support Eisner at the Disney investors' meeting this year. But he dug in, only handing over his role as chairman and refusing to quit as chief executive. </p> <p>Yesterday he relented. He is finally heading for the hills. However, he is staying another two years, so the board will have time to find a successor. And, just for the avoidance of doubt, he made it clear his decision to go was \"not motivated by current circumstances at all\". </p> <p>It seems Mr Eisner is playing hardball to the end. His gesture may take the fight out of some of those shareholders who wanted his head. They may now prefer to just wait for him to be history. </p> <p>As for giving time for a successor to be flushed out - well there has been a well-aired and lengthy list of potential candidates doing the rounds for months. </p> <p>His decision to go only at the end of his current contract also rules out the possibility that he might, embarrassingly, not have been offered another. It also provides another two years for Eisner to try to turn around the company and restore his reputation. The other way of looking at it is as another two years for Disney to lose its way further. He lost shareholder support some time ago and shouldn't be let off the hook. </p> <p><strong> Odds and sod's law </strong><br> </p> <p>Today's running of the St Leger, the last classic flat race of the season, marks the time, according to the old stock market adage, to get back into equities. But those who adhere meticulously to the \"Sell in May, go away, don't come back 'til Leger day\" saying will not profit this year. </p> <p>On the first trading day in May the FTSE 100 index closed at 4547.2. Yesterday the index closed at 4545.0. But this apparent inertia masks the power of the sell in May argument. On the second trading day in May the FTSE 100 index closed at 4569.5 and then went into decline, shedding more than 250 points during the so-called summer. </p> <p>Had the St Leger been run a month earlier the old adage's accuracy would have been impeccable. The FTSE100 hit an intra-day low of 4297 on Friday August 13, since when it has risen irresistibly and recouped its post-May losses. </p> <p>May sellers who have yet to return to the market could consider putting their cash on Godolphin's Rule of Law in tomorrow's big race. But at projected odds of 2-1 perhaps equities are a better bet. </p> <p><strong> Runway profits </strong><br> </p> <p>The folks at BAA were mighty pleased with the highest ever August passenger numbers at their seven major airports - a figure only marginally shy of July's all-time high of 14.21 million. </p> <p>Ah, you might say, but that doesn't necessarily mean higher profits if, for example, the airlines that use Heathrow and Gatwick had managed to negotiate lower landing fees. </p> <p>But that's the joy of being a near-monopoly, especially in the crucial south-east. BAA this year forced through higher landing fees from the airlines. Higher prices combined with higher volumes usually equals bigger profits and BAA reported last month its profits were up 25% in the second quarter. Nice business if you can get it. </p> <p><strong> Pine planting ploy </strong><br> </p> <p>Want to plant a few trees every year but can't get the energy together? In the old days you would hire a gardener. Now you can get your gas supplier to do it, if you use Scottish and Southern Energy. </p> <p>This is the latest marketing ploy in the booming \"green\" power sector. SSE will plant five Scots pines every year to mitigate the impact of you burning gas to heat your home. The utility is also trying to entice new customers by offering a power2 tariff based entirely on hydro-electric power. It claims to have enough of this renewable capacity to service hundreds of thousands of customers. But the reality is that SSE, which has been buying up coal-fired stations recently, will just switch hydro-electric supplies from its existing 5.5m customer base to new customers. Is this progress?</p>",
  "For a cleric who refuses to talk to, let alone buy the Sunday papers on the grounds of deep religious conviction, Ian Richard Kyle Paisley still gets exercised over what newspapers on the Sabbath day have to say about him. <p>Leaning towards the microphone with a combative eye on the gathering press corps at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, last Wednesday he launched into a blistering attack on the Sundays for daring to suggest he is terminally ill.</p> <p>'Look at me, look at me,' he bellowed as one reporter asked after his health. </p> <p>'I hope to take a few thousand pounds off some newspapers who lied about me. And I would it is just because I happen to be a Protestant and journalists happen to be Romanists that they think they can take it out of me,' Paisley roared. </p> <p>In fact the two 'Romanists' - Paisleyspeak for Catholics - he was referring to are not even Catholics. Alan Murray is an East Belfast Protestant; Liam Clarke is the son of a Presbyterian Minister. They raised questions last weekend about Paisley's participation in talks aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, scheduled to start on 16 September given the state of the 78-year-old's health.</p> <p>If Paisley ever pursues the journalist's respective papers through the libel courts it will make for a fascinating contest. </p> <p>Both newspapers would request under the rules of disclosure Paisley's medical notes over the last few years. </p> <p>Although pale and gaunt, his dark suit hanging loosely off his shoulders, Paisley made it clear that he would be there to effectively rain on Tony Blair's parade.</p> <p>The Prime Minister's bid to shift the focus away from Iraq and onto the domestic agenda this autumn includes re-engaging with one of the major achievements of his two terms of office - peace and stability in Northern Ireland. Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern will co-chair the final session of talks at Leeds Castle in Kent which are set to run over three days. </p> <p>Downing Street hopes that by 'hothousing' the parties together in a closed environment progress can be made towards bring back powersharing government between unionists and nationalists. The two Premiers and their officials, including Number 10's key negotiator and Blair's chief-of-staff Jonathan Powell, cannot underestimate Paisley's apparent determination to break the talks on the wheel of the IRA's continued existence. </p> <p>Twenty-four hours after Paisley's 'Romanist' outburst the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party appeared to move even further to the right. He intimated that even if the IRA were to disarm and disband his DUP would still not share power with Sinn Fein. Paisley would not even talk directly to Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein President, if the IRA were to decommission. 'Not as a Sinn Feiner,' Paisley said as he stood alone at his solo press conference. </p> <p>Over the summer officials at the Northern Ireland Office and their colleagues in Dublin's Department of Foreign Affairs have tried to talk up the prospects of an autumn deal. </p> <p>They pointed to the seemingly pragmatic noises coming from Paisley's able deputy the East Belfast MP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dodds, arguably the most talented of the DUP's front-bench team who stressed there could be a deal done before next year's Westminster elections. There was even an unspoken hope at Stormont Castle that Paisley's alleged illness would force him out of the talks allowing the younger, ambitious and eager DUP young guns to dictate the party's agenda at the negotiations. Paisley's theatrics and the choreography of his first press conference in months suggest the 'Big Man' is still very much in charge.</p> <p>Before his confrontation with reporters on Wednesday Paisley was surrounded by a cluster of the DUP old guard, all of whom such as the Reverend William McCrea are members of their leader's fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church. </p> <p>The subliminal message transmitted from Paisley's choice of cadres to surround himself was that the party's traditional hard-line on republicanism, its no-compromise unionism, would not be diluted this side of a general election, or perhaps even beyond it. </p> <p>Middle class unionist voters normally turned off by Paisley and his party's fire and brimstone biblical rhetoric abandoned the Ulster Unionists at last November's Assembly elections for the DUP because they were fed up with the outworkings of the Good Friday Agreement. </p> <p>They were frustrated at the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries' refusal to end all violence and they were horrified that a former IRA chief-of-staff, Martin McGuinness, was in charge of their children's education in the now suspended powersharing executive. These are the main reasons why the DUP supplanted the UUP as the leading force in unionism and became the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p> <p>While Paisley was warning journalists at Stormont that some of them 'would be in coffins before I am', his rival David Trimble was being feted several thousand miles away by the US Republican Party at George W. Bush's convention in New York. Trimble has told his party colleagues that all the UUP has to do is sit and wait for the DUP to make the inevitable compromises the Ulster Unionists were forced to make with republicans six years ago.</p> <p>In the words of one key Trimble aide: 'His strategy regarding the DUP is basically \"give them enough rope\". DT thinks that the voters will see the hypocrisy of the DUP saying one thing in opposition and doing the opposite because they crave power.' </p> <p>Northern Ireland's former First Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner is likely to be entering his final year as leader of the UUP. Next year marks the 10th anniversary of Trimble taking control of his party and even some of his closest supporters admit he will use that date to bow out. 'I think David wants to see out his 10 years as leader and then retire on the anniversary, which will coincide with next year's talks. Then a new leader will come forward who will make it easier for the DUP to co-operate with our party,' said one of Trimble's most loyal friends inside the UUP. </p>",
  "<p><strong>Countdown to open access</strong></p> <p>After years of campaigning, ramblers are lacing up their walking boots in anticipation of new countryside laws that will allow greater access to rural land later this month. </p> <p>On September 19, the first phase of the controversial Countryside and Rights of Way Act will open up previously restricted areas of countryside on mountain, moor and common land in the south-east and lower north-west of England. </p> <p>The Peak District will be the first national park to benefit from the new legislation, as 400 new gates and stiles have been installed as well as 250 new signs to show walkers where they can go. </p> <p>According to Nick Barrett, chief executive of The Ramblers Association, the significance of the new \"right to roam\" isn't just about vast areas of land being opened up, but a fundamental shift in the presumption surrounding access to rural areas. \"After centuries of landowner dominance, the new law tips the balance in favour of the general public's access to the countryside,\" he said. </p> <p>But landowners fear for their right to privacy and the safety of livestock, as well as that of walkers who stray into areas near shooting businesses. Caroline Bedell, a surveyor for the Country Land and Business Association, said she has been \"swamped with queries from farmers and land managers who are concerned people view the new act as a general right to roam and not as a restricted right of access to mapped areas.\" </p> <p>The new \"open access areas\" are marked on 32 new ordnance survey maps - the first of which are due out this week - and information about where walkers can go is available from local tourist information centres. The first open areas include parts of Surrey, Kent, Sussex and nine London boroughs, plus parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Merseyside, Great Manchester, Cheshire, Cumbria, Staffordshire and Derbyshire. </p> <p>Walkers will have to wait until the end of 2005 until the \"right of open access\" is rolled out throughout England and Wales. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Further information: <a href=\"http://www.countrysideaccess.gov.uk\">countrysideaccess.gov.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ramblers.org.uk\">ramblers.org.uk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bulgaria's eco push</strong></p> <p>Bulgaria has identified eco-tourism as a cornerstone for future tourism development. </p> <p>Although there has been huge investment in the package-holiday resorts around the Black Sea, Bulgaria tourism specialist John Todd said the country wants to develop ecotourism in the hinterland, away from the resorts, where there is an enormous amount of pristine countryside. </p> <p>'Bulgaria already has a well-developed network of national parks and protected areas and supports some of the richest biodiversity in Europe,' he said.

  "<p>The decision to reinstate Humberside police chief David Westwood, provided he retires within months, was last night dubbed a \"shambles\" by the Tories.</p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, will lift Mr Westwood's suspension from Monday after the chief constable agreed to take early retirement at the end of March.</p> <p>Mr Westwood, 55, was criticised for failing to take personal responsibility for the failures of his force after the child-killer Ian Huntley slipped through the intelligence net. He was eventually suspended after a tense stand-off between the Home Office and Humberside police authority.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"The home secretary has yet again landed us in a shambles. The initial peremptory use of his powers has yielded neither a clear conclusion nor continuity in leadership for the people of Humberside. They are the principal losers from the home secretary's disorganised approach, which was more concerned with scapegoats than solutions.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said that Mr Blunkett and Mr Westwood had agreed he would retire on March 30 2005. \"Humberside police will continue to work to the agreed work programme with Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary and the Home Office police standards unit to improve the performance of the force and its intelligence processes.\"</p> <p>The agreement removes the prospect of a damaging legal battle between Mr Blunkett and the police authority, which has backed Mr Westwood throughout.</p> <p>The authority initially refused to follow Mr Blunkett's instruction to suspend him, despite criticism in Sir Michael Bichard's Soham inquiry. The authority was forced to capitulate after Mr Blunkett went to the high court.</p> <p>July's suspension was the first time the home secretary had used powers brought in during 2002 to order a chief constable to step aside in this way. At the time, Mr Blunkett said: \"It is Sir Michael's view that the 'final responsibility' for these serious failures rests with the chief constable, David Westwood. It is difficult to disagree with this.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's development may be seen as a blow to Mr Blunkett's attempts, instituted within weeks of his arriving at the Home Office, to gain Whitehall more control over under-performing chief constables, who are traditionally answerable only to their police authorities.</p> <p>Mr Westwood's solicitors issued a statement saying he would complete the work he had set out to do, which included major improvements for the Humberside force, and in doing so would \"honour the commitments he has made to the families of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells, which he has always said he would do.\"</p> <p>Between 1995 and 1998, Humberside had eight separate contacts with Huntley - four involving rape allegations. But intelligence checks failed to raise concerns and he was later able to secure a job as a school caretaker in Soham.</p>",

  "<p> Philip Roth has had the grandest prizes available to an American writer, some of them more than once, and he has been to the White House to have the National Medal of Arts pinned on him by former president Bill Clinton. But the honour that seems to have pleased him most is the forthcoming multi-volume edition of his collected works in the Library of America. This officially establishes him as an American classic, with Melville, Hawthorne, James, Fitzgerald and Faulkner, and so far only two other writers - Saul Bellow and Eudora Welty - have been immortalised in this way during their lifetimes. </p> <p>For the last decade, at an age when most writers are beginning to lose interest, Roth has produced a series of books more powerful and accomplished than any he has written before. And he shows no signs of slowing down. </p> <p>\"Even now, he doesn't relent,\" says Aaron Ascher, Roth's old friend and editor. \"This is a 70-something-year-old writer who is still going uphill and keeps getting better. He has back problems which give him great pain, yet he's always working. He never stops, even in his worst periods.\" </p> <p>Roth's face is lined now, his mouth has tightened and his springy hair has turned grey, but he still looks like an athlete - tall and lean, with broad shoulders and a small head. Until recently, when surgery on his back and arthritis in the shoulder laid him low, he worked out and swam regularly, though always, it seemed, for a purpose - not for the animal pleasure of physical exercise, but to stay fit for the long hours he puts in at his writing. He works standing up, paces around while he's thinking and has said he walks half a mile for every page he writes. Even now, when his joints are beginning to creak and fail, energy still comes off him like a heat haze, but it is all driven by the intellect. It comes out as argument, mimicry, wild comic riffs on whatever happens to turn up in the conversation. His concentration is fierce, and the sharp black eyes under their thick brows miss nothing. The pleasure of his company is immense, but you need to be at your best not to disappoint him. </p> <p>He has always believed in the separation of life and art. He keeps his private life strictly to himself and prefers not to work where he lives. In Connecticut, his studio is back in the trees away from the house; 30 years ago, when he was spending half the year in London, he lived in Fulham and worked in a little flat in Kensington; in New York, there were two apartments on the Upper West Side, one for living in and a studio for work; when he moved more or less full-time to Connecticut, he kept the New York studio and that is where we met to talk. </p> <p>It is on the 12th floor, a single large room with a kitchen area, a little bathroom and a glass wall looking south across Manhattan's gothic landscape to the Empire State Building, with a wisp of cloud around its top. </p> <p>The lectern at which Roth works is at right angles to the view, presumably to avoid distraction. Above it is a sketch of an open book, with an indecipherable text that might be in Hebrew, by his friend, the late Philip Guston. There is a bed with a neat white counterpane against the wall, an easy chair in the centre of the room, with a graceful standing lamp beside it, all of it leather and steel and glass, discreetly modern. It is a place strictly for work, spare and chaste, a monk's cell with a great view. </p> <p>This seems to fit Roth very well. I once asked him what he would like to have been if he could have lived his life again. \"A parish priest,\" he said, \"swishing around in a cassock and hearing confessions.\" He may have missed out on the cassock - he dresses soberly, neutrally, as though not to be noticed - and celibacy is not his style, but in other ways his life is as stern, self-sufficient and dedicated as any priest's: he works long hours, eats sparingly, drinks hardly at all and goes to bed early. </p> <p>Roth's monkish routine is at odds with what he once called his \"reputation as a crazed penis\" bestowed on him by Portnoy's Complaint, his great panegyric to the comedy of sex. When Portnoy was published in 1969, it seemed to epitomise the anarchic spirit of the decade. Maybe it did, but the author himself was a product of the 1950s, the last generation of well-behaved, sternly educated children who believed in high culture and high principles and lived in the nuclear shadow of the cold war until their orderly world was blown apart by birth-control pills and psychedelic drugs. Portnoy was considered outrageous when it appeared, but the real outrage was Roth's and he was outraged because he couldn't help being a good boy however much he yearned to be bad. </p> <p>Like most Jewish families, Roth's was close-knit, affectionate and tempestuous. His father, Herman, was a passionate New Dealer, a forceful indignant man, who worked for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and rose to be a district manager - which was as high as a Jew could go before Congress passed the Fair Employment Act after the second world war. He and his wife Bess were children of immigrants from eastern Europe and they lived in the largely Jewish Weequahic section of Newark. In those days Newark was the commercial capital of New Jersey, a prosperous industrial town. \"I was brought up in a Jewish neighbourhood,\" he says, \"and never saw a skullcap, a beard, sidelocks - ever, ever, ever - because the mission was to live here, not there. There was no there. If you asked your grandmother where she came from, she'd say, 'Don't worry about it. I forgot already.' To the Jews, this was Zion.\" The neighbourhood schools were good and Roth was a straight A student. He graduated magna cum laude from Bucknell, an idyllic little college in Lewisberg, Pennsylvania, got his MA from the University of Chicago, did a spell in the army, was invalided out with a spinal injury, returned to Chicago to start a PhD and teach freshman English, then dropped out after one term. Ascher first heard of him when his sister, a student at Chicago, wrote to tell him she had sublet an apartment from \"a guy called Philip Roth. He says he's a writer.\" </p> <p>It was a long time, however, before Roth began to write about the world he was brought up in. Neither of his devoted, sensible parents seems to have had much in common with the comic nightmares that tormented Portnoy and they only began to figure large in their son's work after they died. His new novel, The Plot Against America, is, in a way, his memorial to them. When Roth was working on it he told his friend David Plante, the novelist, that he was \"writing about his parents in their prime, when their life was at its full and they were dealing with it\". Though the book turned out to be about a lot of other things as well, the portrait, according to Ascher, is strong and accurate: \"Herman was fiercely what he was - a marvellous, na\u00efve man who loved his children and was perplexed by them. In this new book, Philip puts him in these terrible situations and he reacts exactly as he would have done in real life.\" </p> <p>The idea for the terrible situation occurred to Roth when he read in Arthur Schlesinger's autobiography that the right wing of the Republican party had thought of nominating Charles Lindbergh, the celebrated aviator, anti-semite and friend of Hitler, to run for the presidency against FDR in 1940: \"I wrote in the margin, 'What if they had?' Then I began thinking about other what-ifs, like what if Hitler hadn't lost? All this was happening when I was a little child - I was born in 1933 - but it is quite vivid to me because the great outside world came into the house through the radio and through my father's reactions to it. So it began to make sense as a novel. One of the reasons I could never write about what our family life was really like was because my parents were good, hard-working, responsible people and that's boring for a novelist. What I discovered inadvertently was that if you put pressure on these decent people, then you've got a story.\" </p> <p>Putting pressure on people and facts and his own experience is one of the many solutions Roth has come up with for the problem to which he has devoted his life: how to transform life into art. \"I have to have something to do that engages me totally,\" he says. \"Without that, life is hell for me. I can't be idle and I don't know what to do other than write. If I were afflicted with some illness that left me otherwise OK but stopped me writing, I'd go out of my mind. I don't really have other interests. My interest is in solving the problems presented by writing a book. That's what stops my brain spinning like a car wheel in the snow, obsessing about nothing. Some people do crossword puzzles to satisfy their need to keep the mind engaged. For me, the absolutely demanding mental test is the desire to get the work right. The crude clich\u00e9 is that the writer is solving the problem of his life in his books. Not at all. What he's doing is taking something that interests him in life and then solving the problem of the book - which is, How do you write about this? The engagement is with the problem that the book raises, not with the problems you borrow from living. Those aren't solved, they are forgotten in the gigantic problem of finding a way of writing about them.\" </p> <p>His solutions to the problem have taken many forms as well as a large cast of narrators. Deception, for instance, is written entirely in dialogue, like a stage play. Operation Shylock is a find-the-Roth shell-game, with a false Philip pretending to be the true one until neither is quite sure who is who. The technical problem of The Plot Against America was less tricky but equally hard to solve: although it is a Roth book, the Roth who narrates it is aged seven: \"Prior to that, I'd had these rich brains telling the story and now I was going to have to look over the shoulder of a child. I never wrote What Maisie Knew and this was What Little Philip Knew. How do I do that without putting on a straitjacket? The answer turned out to be quite simple: if you have one child in the centre of the book, you have a problem, but it goes away when he is a child among children. So once I discovered the other children to act as foils for him I was in the clear. Then I had a child's perspective, but the book is no longer told by a child; it's told by an adult remembering his family when he was a child.\" </p> <p>Roth has never been much interested in aesthetic theories and experiment and when he talks about getting a story right he does so, like any craftsman, with a practical understanding of the materials he uses and the techniques needed to get the job done. In The Ghost Writer, the ageing writer, EI Lonoff, tells 23-year-old Nathan Zuckerman, the most disabused of Roth's stand-ins, that he \"has the most compelling voice I've encountered in years. I don't mean style... I mean voice: something that begins at around the back of the knees and reaches well above the head.\" Voice in this sense is the vehicle by which a writer expresses his aliveness and Roth himself is all voice. Style, in the formal, flowery sense, bores him; he has, he once wrote, \"a resistance to plaintive metaphor and poeticised analogy\". His prose is immaculate yet curiously plain and unostentatious, as natural as breathing. Reading him, it's always the story that's in your face, never the style. </p> <p>His voice sounds so spontaneous that the lazy reader might suppose he is listening to confession rather than reading a work of fiction. And this, to Roth, is an insult to the labour he puts into his craft. It also links him with the cult of celebrity and that is something he has fought against throughout his career. </p> <p>\"One dreams of the goddess Fame,\" wrote Peter de Vries, \"and winds up with the bitch Publicity.\" Roth first tangled with the bitch when Goodbye, Columbus provoked rabbis to denounce him as \"a self-hating Jew\", and he responded by writing Letting Go, the most conventional of his novels, as if to show that he was indeed as serious and worthy as authors were expected to be in the 50s. Being a good boy, however, did not sit easily either with his surreal comic inventiveness or with the troubles he was having in a difficult first marriage to Margaret Williams. When he finally yoked comedy and rage together to produce Portnoy's Complaint, the serious writer again came face-to-face with the bitch Publicity and this time she didn't let him go. </p> <p>\"In 1969, I wrote Portnoy. Not only did I write it - that was easy - I also became the author of Portnoy's Complaint and what I faced publicly was the trivialisation of everything.\" </p> <p>Instead of being read as someone playing brilliant games with reality in the tradition of Kafka and Gogol, Roth got scandal, outrage and best-seller celebrity in its most crummy form. According to Ascher, \"the attacks were horrible and disheartening, especially from the Jews. He had to cope with the nightmare of a smash hit. It made him angry and defensive, so he closed up. But maybe it did him good. The setback of great success changed and improved him as a writer. Without it, he'd have been different.\" </p> <p>Roth's immediate response was to refuse all public appearances and retreat to Yaddo, the writers' colony in upstate New York. Hiding himself away was easy, but disguising that distinctive, compelling voice of his was a trickier problem. His solution was ventriloquism, narrators with everyday lives not unlike his, but who see them differently and transform them into something else: disabused, tough-talking Nathan Zuckerman who sniffs out every weakness and forgives no one; studious David Kepesh, a professor to whom outlandish things happen when he lets himself go, but who loves literature as much as he loves women; a character called Philip Roth whose relationship to the author is a source of mystery for both of them. Roth remarked to me, apropos of President Bush, that born-again Christianity is the ignorant man's version of the intellectual life. Similarly, reading fiction as though it were true confessions is the ignorant man's aesthetics and Roth has made a mockery of it in many ways. The eulogist at Zuckerman's funeral in The Counterlife puts it pompously but well: \"What people envy in the novelist... is the gift for theatrical self-transformation, the way they are able to loosen and make ambiguous their connection to a real life through the imposition of talent. The exhibitionism of the superior artist is connected to his imagination; fiction is for him at once playful hypothesis and serious supposition, an imaginative form of inquiry - everything that exhibitionism is not... Contrary to the general belief, it is the distance between the writer's life and his novel that is the most intriguing aspect of his imagination.\" </p> <p>In life as in art: a snide academic at a New York dinner party once tried to show his disdain for the famous author by pretending to mistake him for Herman Wouk and taking him to task for the structural weakness of Marjorie Morningstar. Roth, of course, was too smart to be indignant; he just played right along with the game and became Wouk for the rest of the evening. </p> <p>His most effective escape from New York celebrity was Czechoslovakia and its writers. He stumbled across them inadvertently, when he was on a holiday tour of Europe and stopped off in Prague to pay homage to Kafka. This was in 1972, three years after both the nightmare success of Portnoy and the far greater nightmare that followed the Prague Spring. Through his Czech translator he met blacklisted writers who cleaned windows and stoked boilers for a living while they wrote books that wouldn't be published at home. Their troubles put his into perspective: \"They made me very conscious of the difference between the private ludicracy of being a writer in America and the harsh ludicrousness of being a writer in eastern Europe. These men and women were drowning in history. They were working under tremendous pressure and the pressure was new to me - and news to me, too. They were suffering for what I did freely and I felt great affection for them, and allegiance; we were all members of the same guild.\" </p> <p>Back in New York, Roth immersed himself in literature from behind the iron curtain. He went every week to a little college on Staten Island to attend Antonin Liehm's classes on Czech culture and edited a series of eastern European fiction for Penguin. </p> <p>\"My life in New York after Portnoy was lived in the Czech exile community - listening, listening, listening. I ate every night in Czech restaurants in Yorkville, talked to whoever wanted to talk to me and left all this Portnoy crap behind. That was idiotic, this was not idiotic. I lived up in Connecticut, where Philip Guston was my friend, and had my east European world in New York, and those were the things that saved me. I think that's why Hemingway lived in Key West; he liked to be in a world that had nothing to do with what he did all day. Fame is a worthless distraction.\" </p> <p>Roth's regular visits to Prague continued until 1977, when he was denied an entry visa, and they seemed to bring about a change in his focus as a writer. By then, he was spending half the year in London, but he left in 1989 to be with his father in his final illness and, following the break-up of his second marriage to the actress Claire Bloom, he never went back. It was, he says, a huge relief to be home: \"I used to walk around New York saying under my breath, 'I'm back! I'm back!' I felt like Rip van Winkle waking up with a long beard and discovering there'd been a revolution and the British were gone! Being home, being free in my personal life brought a great revival of energy. I felt renewed.\" </p> <p>While he was rediscovering America, Roth immersed himself in the modern classics and they reminded him of what American novelists do best: \"The great American writers are regionalists. It's in the American grain. Think of Faulkner in Mississippi or Updike and the town in Pennsylvania he calls Brewer. It's there on the page, brick by brick. What are these places like? Who lives there? What are the forces determining their lives? ... I hadn't yet discovered my own place, that town across the river called Newark, and it didn't have any power for me until it was destroyed in the race riots of 1966. Before, it was too pleasant and my family was too decent to write about. Only when the place had been burned down and the families I knew had been exiled did it become a fit subject for inquiry.\" </p> <p>The energy released by his return to America culminated in his great, subversive outburst of comic outrage and exasperation, Sabbath's Theatre. The book reads like Portnoy's Complaint retold by a 60-year-old man raging not about sex, but against the injustice and ludicrousness of death, and it was a turning point. Having vented his rage at the prospect of death, and while he still had time, he set about writing an extraordinary series of novels about what it was like to live in the United States in the second half of the 20th century. After his experience in eastern Europe, he now saw the place more sharply through the lens of history. </p> <p>In the 50s, when Roth was starting out and literature was considered the noblest of all vocations, the best writers responded in an intensely inward way to whatever was going on in the big outside. All that changed, Roth thinks, when Kennedy was assassinated in 1963: \"It was an event so stunning that our historical receptors were activated. The stuff that's happened in the last 40 years - the Vietnam war, the social revolution of the 60s, the Republican backlash of the 80s and 90s - have been so powerfully determining that men and women of intelligence and literary sensibility feel that the strongest thing in their lives is what has happened to us collectively: the new freedoms, the testing of the old conventions, the prosperity. That's what I was writing about in the trilogy that followed Sabbath - American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and The Human Stain: people prepare for life in a certain way and have certain expectations of the difficulties that come with those lives, then they get blindsided by the present moment; history comes in at them in ways for which there is no preparation. 'History is a very sudden thing,' is how I put it. I'm talking about the historical fire at the centre and how the smoke from that fire reaches into your house.\" </p> <p>Old age and its humiliations, he says, are equally unpredictable. \"I think about Hemingway and Faulkner and how it ended for them - tragically, not peacefully in their sleep. Faulkner drank himself to death; Hemingway's body was banged to bits, the booze had saturated him and he couldn't write; he had nothing to live for, so he shot himself. These are lives of torment... I'm not a romantic about writing, I don't want a tormented life and, by and large, I haven't had one. But these guys... I can't stand to think about how they ended.\" </p> <p>\"Who knew what getting old would be like?\" he says. \"There may be a biological blinder about age that's built in. You are not supposed to understand until you get there. Just as an animal doesn't know about death, the human animal doesn't know about age. When I wrote that book about my father in old age, Patrimony, I thought I knew what I was talking about, but I didn't really. In this new book I've brought both my parents back in their full flower. The flow of energy in our house was extraordinary.\" </p> <p>It was also the atmosphere in which Roth's own special talents began to flourish. When he was a teenager and his older brother Sandy was an art student in Brooklyn, they would meet up with their friends most weekends at the Roth house in Newark: \"My mother loved it. Eight or 10 boys, a very mixed bag, but one thing they had in common was tremendous humour. Some of them I still know and they remember roaring with laughter in our house - laughing and eating and laughing. It was a wonderful period, a great explosion of camaraderie. Our subject was the comedy of being between 15 and 20 - comedy located in sex and frustration - lots of longing, little activity. I think that was the incubator for everything.\" </p> <p>Maybe it still is, in a ghostly way. \"Roth often visits his parents' grave in New Jersey,\" Plante says. \"He stands at their graveside and weeps. Then he begins to talk to them and they answer. Then he starts joking with them, they have these funny, bantering conversations and he goes away feeling better.\" </p> <p><strong> Philip Roth</strong> </p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> March 19 1933, Newark, New Jersey. </p> <p><strong> Educated:</strong> Weequahic High School; Bucknell University; University of Chicago. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1959 Margaret Martinson Williams, '63 div; '90 Claire Bloom, '94 div. </p> <p><strong> Some novels:</strong> 1959 Goodbye, Columbus;'62 Letting Go; '69 Portnoy's Complaint; '74 My Life as a Man; '93 Operation Shylock; '95 Sabbath's Theatre. </p> <p>Roth books: 1990 Deception; '91 Patrimony; '93 Operation Shylock; 2004 The Plot Against America. </p> <p>Zuckerman books: 1979 The Ghost Writer; '85 Zuckerman Bound; '86 The Counterlife; '97 American Pastoral; '98 I Married a Communist; 2000 The Human Stain. </p> <p>Kepesh books: 1972 The Breast; '77 The Professor of Desire; 2001 The Dying Animal. </p> <p><strong> Some awards: </strong> 1960, '95 National Book Award; '93, 2000 PEN/Faulkner Award; '98 National Medal of Arts; 2001 American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal.</p>",
  "Those monthly mood swings, long considered an exclusively female affliction, may not be as gender specific as once thought. Men, say researchers, can get pre-menstrual tension too. <p>A study by psychologists from the University of Derby suggests that men may experience cyclical symptoms similar to, or even worse than, those suffered by pre-menstrual women, including moodiness, discomfort and loss of concentration. Everything, it appears, apart from the bloat. </p> <p>The researchers asked 100 men and women to complete questions relating to seven types of symptoms usually attributed to the menstrual cycle. </p> <p>\"We were stunned when the men started reporting suffering from all the traditional PMT [pre-menstrual tension] symptoms,\" said Dr Aimee Aubeeluck, who presented her findings to the British Psychological Society's annual conference in Edinburgh yesterday. \"They got unusual headaches, had severe mood swings and reported losing concentration at certain times of the month. </p> <p>\"To be honest, we still haven't managed to come up with an explanation for what causes it. But there has been previous research that suggests we all have natural internal biorhythms, and the male symptoms could somehow be caused by that. It could be that we all have these cyclical changes in our moods, and that it is completely coincidental that women also menstruate cyclically. Because men don't have periods, they simply dismissed those cyclical symptoms as being caused by other outside factors.\" </p> <p>The men and women taking part in the study answered 47 questions relating to pain, concentration, behavioural change, physical reactions, water retention, negative feelings, arousal and control. Men completed the questionnaire once while women completed it on three separate occasions over one menstrual cycle. The men scored on average higher on all of the sections except water retention. </p> <p>Dr Aubeeluck said she hoped to carry out more research on men in the future to discover if they suffered PMT symptoms at specific times of the month, like women. </p> <p>\"I believe our research suggests that there may be some other, as yet undiscovered, cause for many of the symptoms that are generally dismissed by doctors as being PMT in women,\" she said. </p> <p>\"It also suggests many men are suffering from cyclical changes that are left undiagnosed ... But it could be that men really do have a lower threshold to pain than women, and that they are simply making a fuss about nothing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Research could soon show that cannabis could be a helpful long-term treatment for multiple sclerosis sufferers. </p> <p>Patients who took part in a 15-week study - published in the Lancet last year - went on to try the effectiveness of the banned drug for a 52-week course, John Zajicek of the Peninsula medical school told the British Association science festival which ended in Exeter yesterday. </p> <p>\"Initial results of the longer-term study are positive and will be published in the near future. In the short-term study, there was some evidence of cannabinoids alleviating symptoms of multiple sclerosis; in the longer term there is a suggestion of a more useful beneficial effect, which was not clear at the initial stage,\" he said in a statement. </p> <p>\"I hope these results will encourage support of further studies of cannabinoids in multiple sclerosis and, potentially, other diseases.\" </p> <p>Cannabis has been used as a medical treatment for at least as long as it has been a recreational drug. Queen Victoria is supposed to have used it for period pains. It was sometimes used in childbirth and a poignant archaeological discovery in the Middle East revealed cannabis remnants near the body of a young woman who probably died in childbirth 5,000 years ago. </p> <p>Cancer patients have claimed that cannabis could help suppress nausea after chemotherapy. Glaucoma sufferers have claimed it relieves pressure on the eyeball and delays the onset of blindness. </p> <p>Animal experiments have suggested the drug slows nerve cell death. And many multiple sclerosis sufferers have been using it, illegally, to relieve the pain and stiffness of their slow progression towards helplessness. </p> <p>Once it became clear that cannabis-like chemicals were produced naturally in the human nervous system to control appetite and facilitate nerve cell communication, researchers began to understand why a folk remedy could be medically effective. </p> <p>But clinical evidence in randomised double-blind trials has been rare. \"We set out to establish whether there was any scientific truth behind that,\" Dr Zajicek said. </p> <p>A total of 667 patients took part in a short-term study. More than 500 agreed to go on to longer trials. The patients were given either capsules containing cannabis extract, an active component of the drug called THC, or sugar pills. The chief aim had been relief of muscle stiffness. </p> <p>\"But we also wanted to look at the other symptoms, including pain, bladder disturbance and measures of disability,\" he said. \"From the patient's symptomatic point of view there was beneficial effect but we couldn't prove that from an independent assessment by a physiotherapist of muscle stiffness.\" </p> <p>So they continued the trials: the results could be published in a few weeks' time. </p> <p>Researchers are notoriously unwilling to discuss results before they have been reviewed by their peers and published formally in a scientific journal. \"What I can say at the moment is that there does seem to be evidence of some beneficial effect in the longer term that we didn't anticipate in the short term study.\"</p>",
  "<p>Thursday night, just before 11pm in Lloyds No 1, a former bank in Nottingham city centre which still has its original marble pillars, ornate moulded covings and high ceilings. Loud pop music booms out of the speakers, and the bar, heady with the fug of cigarette smoke, is packed with young people drinking bottles of beer or vodka and Red Bull (\u00a32 for a double). </p> <p>Leanne Sheehan, an 18-year-old law student at Nottingham Trent University, is sipping her ninth bottle of Reef orange and passionfruit alcopop through a straw (5% volume, \u00a31 each). Before she came out for the evening with her friends three hours earlier she drank half a bottle of white wine. </p> <p>Clearly intelligent and articulate, despite the amount of alcohol she has drunk, she is not slurring her words or staggering around. </p> <p>However, she talks animatedly, occasionally repeating herself, and waves her arms enthusiastically to the music. A discarded lollipop wrapper is left on her table - a poignant reminder of how young she is. </p> <p>Nearby, a man in his 20s whistles into two empty bottles of Moet et Chandon. Another man walks past in a T-shirt with the unambiguous logo \"Wanted: casual sex now\". </p> <p><strong> Pressure</strong><br> </p> <p> \"We will go on to a club,\" Leanne says. \"I have learned to drink water from about 1am. I am lucky because on Friday we don't have lectures till lunchtime and I can sleep it off. I will still feel tired, though. </p> <p> \"Sometimes I will come out and not drink alcohol - but I always have a better night when I have a drink. I feel happy and I know I will remember everything in the morning.\" She says even if the price of alcohol is increased, she will still go out to get drunk as a release from the pressure of her university studies. </p> <p>Leanne says she has never witnessed any violence in the city centre other than the odd scuffle. \"I have seen nothing like the scenes which were shown on that [Panorama] TV programme,\" she adds. </p> <p>But Nottingham is the city which has been shunned by Brilliant Weekends, a travel company which organises stag weekends and hen nights, amid safety fears. The company said two of its clients had ended up in hospital with broken bones after a fight in the city. \"We want people to have a good time, not a bad time. We are not in the business of sending people to hospital,\" said its managing director, Richard Dennys. </p> <p>\"We sent 3,000 people there last year but I think there is a situation in Nottingham that I don't want to make any worse.\" </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the Nottingham Evening Post's columnist Richard Winter was unimpressed. He wrote: \"Well, if Brilliant's clientele were going to behave like your standard stag or hen mob, yelping, swaying and chundering their way through NG1 [a club] on Friday and Saturday nights, good riddance. They can park their puke in some other town.\" </p> <p>Lloyd's No 1 is owned and operated by JD Wetherspoon. The company opposes a minimum price for alcohol, which has been mooted by a group of publicans in the city and is supported by the police and university. </p> <p>Wetherspoon's claims that it would in effect be running a cartel, and the minimum price would hit pensioners the hardest. </p> <p>John Heeley, the chief executive of Ex perience Nottinghamshire, the destination management partnership, said the recent media image was not representative of the city. </p> <p>\"Nottingham is no worse than any other city, but it is the compactness of the city centre which gives it a visibility and a prominence, whereas in other places the bars are spread out,\" he said. </p> <p>The medieval configuration of the city means that within a square mile there are 358 licensed premises - including restaurants and theatres, but chiefly bars, pubs and clubs. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day the city centre has to be owned and identified with by the whole population. It is for families and couples and children, not just young people,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Heeley said it was in everybody's interests to address the social excesses, but it required a degree of self-regulation within the industry. \"The city really has a 24/7 buzz and markedly so because it has become emphasised by its compactness,\" he added. </p> <p>He said the economy of Nottingham was substantially dependent on the leisure, tourism and retail industry. One pound in every four of local wealth is associated with these industries. \"The perceptions of the people who live here are a world apart from the Panorama programme,\" he added. \"We do not feel that it is a beleaguered, crime-ridden anti-social place. It is a great place to shop, to visit, and is incredibly popular.\" </p> <p>Inspector Paul Winter, of Nottinghamshire police, is responsible for licensing in the city. He says the conurbation, which has a population of 620,000, has 110,000 people pouring into the city centre at 11pm on weekend nights. By 2am there are still 40,000 people hanging around. \"People are largely drunk and there is a potential for violence and disorder,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The chief constable has recently taken the unusual step of appearing in court in person to oppose the licensing application of two major bars because he has decided enough is enough.\" </p> <p><strong> Warnings</strong><br> </p> <p> He says the problems in the city are representative of a national cultural problem and not specific to Nottingham. The police oppose irresponsible drinks promotions and are trying to encourage licensees not to offer 2-for-1 drinks or to sell drink at very low prices. </p> <p>Their research has shown that 10 premises in the city - which they won't identify - are responsible for 40% of violent incidents. The police now meet with the licensees of the worst premises and encourage them to take steps to address this, such as setting realistic targets to reduce the number of incidents. In some cases the licensees will be issued with written warnings. </p> <p>He said that while alcohol-related violence and disorder had increased nationally over the past three years, the figures had remained static in Nottingham, albeit at a relatively high level. </p> <p>Nottingham University's student union welfare officer, Anne Griffiths, said binge drinking happened at all universities but the managers of pubs, clubs and bars needed to work with the police and council to set higher standards. </p> <p>\"They should stop having so many cheap drink promotions and selling strong drinks,\" she said. \"We feel that the pubs and clubs are targeting the residents of Nottingham in these promotions, rather than students. </p> <p>\"It is a shame that certain travel companies are choosing to avoid Nottingham as it is a wonderful city and there are so many bars and pubs which won't tolerate the antisocial behaviour.\" </p> <p><strong> Flights of fancy Stag venues</strong></p> <p><strong> Amsterdam</strong> <br> Cheapest flight: \u00a360 <br> Popularity: last 20 years </p> <p><strong> Dublin</strong> <br> Cheapest flight: \u00a330 <br> Popularity: last 10 years </p> <p><strong> Prague</strong> <br> Cheapest flight: \u00a390 <br> Popularity: last 5-6 years </p> <p><strong> Barcelona</strong> <br> Cheapest flight: \u00a370 <br> Popularity: last 10 years </p> <p><strong> Tallinn, Estonia</strong> <br> Cheapest flight: \u00a350 <br> Popularity: last 2 years </p> <p><strong> Ljubljana, Slovenia</strong> <br> Cheapest flight: \u00a360 <br> Popularity: last year </p> <p><strong> Popular UK destinations</strong> <br> Brighton, Blackpool, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle </p> <p> Sources: Abta/Visit Britain</p>",
  "<p>Jose Mourinho has revealed he is human after all by admitting he does have fears in life, although it is God and not Arsenal who gives him sleepless nights. </p> <p>The 41-year-old Portuguese coach is under huge pressure to deliver success to Chelsea in his first season, but he insists that what happens to him in football is second to his relationship with God. </p> <p>He said: \"I'm scared of God. I'm a religious man, although I don't practise religion by going to church every day. I believe what I believe. </p> <p>\"There are certain things in this life that we cannot control. The first thing in my life is to have the people I love healthy and happy. </p> <p>\"In football, what is there to be afraid of? If you lose, you go home and train the next day like David James. He showed a great attitude after what happened with England. I have no fear of losing, no fear of the critics. It is important to do your best, wake up every day with good ambition and go home to sleep well knowing you have done everything.\" </p> <p>Mourinho will be hoping to extend Chelsea's record four-match 100% start to five in the match at Aston Villa today to keep up the pressure on Arsenal. Three days later his team begin their Champions League campaign away to Paris St-Germain. </p> <p>Chelsea lost 19 players to international duty in the past two weeks, leaving Mourinho to work with only three first-team squad players and the injured goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini. \"It's more than frustrating,\" he said after running through a series of videos and discussing tactics with his re-assembled squad yesterday. \"You can do nothing to improve your team ... We couldn't work tactically, we couldn't communicate.\" </p> <p>He said his players, who have represented 12 different national teams, were all at different levels of fitness and morale. Because he had not had time to take the players on to the pitch his main aim was to keep them focused on the job in hand. \"I told them the only chance we have ... at Aston Villa is to forget the internationals and next Tuesday's Champions League. Aston Villa are too difficult to be thinking of other things.\" Villa have won both their home matches this season. </p> <p>The former England defender Chris Powell hopes to resurrect his career by leaving Charlton Athletic to join West Ham United on loan. The 35-year-old left-back signed a new one-year contract before the season but has not played in any of Charlton's four matches. </p> <p>West Ham have also completed the signing of Norwich's 32-year-old Scotland defender Malky Mackay for \u00a3300,000. </p> <p>Millwall lost only \u00a3100,000 in the last financial year, proving suggestions this week of a \u00a34m deficit were way off the mark. Their run to the FA Cup final last year helped reduce a loss of \u00a34.7m in 2003 to a near break-even position to May 2004.</p>",
  "<p>The Russians are assured of their third different women's champion in successive grand slams at Flushing Meadows today, Elena Dementieva and Svetlana Kuznetsova having wiped the floor with their American opposition in yesterday's semi-finals. </p> <p>Lindsay Davenport and Jennifer Capriati had been widely expected to contest an all-American affair, but Davenport went down 1-6, 6-2, 6-4 against Kuznetsova, and Capriati lost 6-0, 2-6, 7-6 against Dementieva. So, for the first time since 1988, there will be no American men or women challenging for the singles titles this weekend. </p> <p>The strength in depth of Russian women's tennis has been obvious for some time; this year they have converted strength into major titles. In Paris Anastasia Myskina defeated Dementieva for the French Open title, and then the 17-year-old Maria Sharapova won at Wimbledon, defeating Serena Williams in the final. </p> <p>All four of these Russian women are currently in the top 10, and it cannot be long before one of them rises to very top. Of the quartet Dementieva in perhaps the unlikeliest success story, simply because her serve - or what passes for a serve - would scarcely past muster in a public park. It is a horrendous round-arm affair which has already cost her 48 double faults, including a relatively modest eight yesterday. </p> <p>During the French Open final, when she double-faulted 10 times, she cried out that she hated it; as for the rest of her game, it is athletic and often dynamic, particularly her forehand which can be quite devastating, as Capriati found to her cost. </p> <p>It is 13 years since Capriati, now 28, reached her first US Open semi-final as a 15-year-old. It may be that this was her last chance of making the final in the city of her birth. In the first set she was as flat as a pancake, but fought back strongly only to get involved in a third set of quite improbable drama which included eight breaks of serve before Dementieva won the tie-break 7-5 on her second match point. </p> <p>Davenport, who had come into the US Open on the back of four hard court titles and 22 consecutive victories, had felt a twinge in her hip on Thursday, and aggravated the injury during practice before her semi-final. </p> <p>\"It felt OK in the beginning but midway through the sec ond set it seemed to pull a bit more. I knew I had to try and keep the points short and go for bigger shots.\" </p> <p>The 19-year-old Kuznetsova had looked set to be overwhelmed in her first grand slam semi-final. \"I was playing well and feeling good,\" said Davenport. \"I had no reason at that point to doubt myself, even when she broke me for 2-1. But around 4-2 my leg got worse and I knew it was going to be an uphill battle. She was making me run and serving well. She's a good player.\" </p> <p>After Kuznetsova had won the second set Davenport took a medical time-out to have her injury re-strapped. The Russian sat huddled up, covered with towels, trying to keep focused, but the disruption caused her to lose her rhythm temporarily and she went 3-0 down in the third. \"I just tried to stay calm and keep moving Lindsay around,\" she said. </p> <p>Kuznetsova had been expected to make a major impact at this year's Wimbledon, having won her first career tournament at Eastbourne, but she went out in the first round. Prior to that she had led Myskina 6-1, 3-1 in the fourth round at Roland Garros and had a match point before losing in three sets. </p> <p>Some believe the stocky Kuznetsova, whose family have a sporting background in cycling, may turn out to be the pick of the bunch. Certainly she was extremely composed and tactically astute against Davenport once she had overcome the first-set nerves, and she should be more rested for the final. </p> <p>Davenport's defeat means that France's Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, who was beaten by Dementieva in the quarter- finals, becomes the world No1, replacing Belgium's Justine Henin-Hardenne. But the Russians keep on coming.</p>",
  "<p>Kimi Raikkonen rode an intoxicating wave of confidence through the first practice session for the Italian grand prix to set the second fastest time close behind Michael Schumacher's Ferrari, only a fortnight after relegating the world champion to runner-up in Belgium. </p> <p>Such red-letter days have been few and far between for the McLaren-Mercedes squad in recent years as Schumacher and Ferrari have transformed the formula one business into their private fiefdom. Yet through this spell of disappointment and underachievement Raikkonen's equable and unflustered temperament has been a crucial stabilising influence on a team who looked precariously close to unravelling for good during the early races of the season. Likewise he has taken success in his stride. \"It's always nice to win, but I've been so close before that I wouldn't say that win in Belgium has made me any more confident,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>His blistering first lap at Spa, one of the races of the season, during which he dodged cars crashing in all directions to make up five places and come round in fifth place, was one of the keys to that impressive success. </p> <p>\"I knew from qualifying that the car was extremely good so I knew it should have been pretty good come the race,\" he said. \"I knew I had a good chance and when I finally got past Michael and was catching up the Renaults the car felt very strong. The car was really very nice to drive and after the final safety-car period I knew there was no way Michael was going to get past me.\" </p> <p>This weekend at Monza he believes McLaren can sustain the momentum that is building behind the MP4-19B, which was introduced in the middle of the season. </p> <p>\"In testing here last week we were pretty happy,\" he said. \"We are there or thereabouts and although we might not be the fastest qualifiers we should be in good shape anyway.\" </p> <p>He said that though the disappointing start to the season with the troublesome original MP4-19 had been unfortunate for the team it basically had not undermined his confidence. \"It wasn't my fault,\" he said, \"even though it was upsetting for the entire team to discover that all the work we'd done over the winter was a waste of time. It wasn't nice for anybody, but I couldn't change anything. In a way it always hurts when you retire, but when the car breaks down it's not my fault.\" </p> <p>The 24-year-old Finn is one of the coolest customers in the formula one paddock. Like his predecessor Mika Hakkinen, who won two world championships for McLaren, he radiates an aloof insouciance that signals he is not in the slightest intimidated by Schumacher's status and star quality. </p> <p>\"There is a particular self-contained inner strength and sense of resolve amongst the Finnish nation which we had previously encountered with Mika and are now enjoying again with Kimi,\" said Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. \"He is not only extremely talented but also very tough and resilient. </p> <p>\"While he came within two points of winning the 2003 world championship, he has also had to come to terms with a run of disappointing results earlier this season. The real strength of a driver's character is displayed not so much by the way in which he handles success but by the manner in which he comes to terms with events which have fallen short of his expectations.\" </p> <p>Raikkonen's controlled aggression and dynamic car control have even attracted the attention of Ross Brawn, the Ferrari technical director, who clearly believes the Finn may be high on the wish list for the famous Italian team if Schumacher retires when his current contract expires at the end of 2006. </p> <p>\"Raikkonen has shown he is [the heir apparent] more than anyone,\" Brawn said. \"It was evident last year, and in Spa we saw that now he has the tools for the job. He is an exceptional driver; he doesn't appear to make many errors.\" </p> <p>Brawn's enthusiasm was echoed by Jean Todt, Ferrari's sporting director. \"I like Kimi,\" he said. \"He's quick, naturally talented. He doesn't make wild statements. He doesn't try to raise his profile. I like that. And in my rally career I had a lot of contact with Finnish drivers so I know them very well. I like Kimi's style, but for the moment it's really only from a spectator's point of view.\" </p> <p>Until that changes, Raikkonen is simply looking forward to meeting the challenge of 2005 when Juan Pablo Montoya arrives from Williams to take over as successor to David Coulthard. </p> <p>\"I don't care who my team-mate is,\" he said. \"The real challenge in this business for all of us is to beat Michael Schumacher. I think we can have a chance of doing that next year, but we must have a reliable car from the outset if we are to do it. </p> <p>\"What Montoya does won't have any effect on the way I operate. He'll work with his own engineers and I'll be doing my own thing. It's as simple as that. It won't change my position in the McLaren team.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today's US Open semi-final is the sixth time, and the second this year, that Tim Henman has tried to overcome the physical and psychological barrier that has so far prevented him from reaching the pinnacle of his sport, a grand slam final. And it doesn't get any easier. </p> <p>Pete Sampras (twice), Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic and Australia's Lleyton Hewitt have denied him at Wimbledon, and in this year's Parisian spring he was beaten by the Argentinian Guillermo Coria on the red clay of Roland Garros. </p> <p>Now, on the unforgiving hard courts of Flushing Meadows, the player standing in his way is Switzerland's Roger Federer, the undisputed world No1 and holder of the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles. Henman, the world's best volleyer, against Federer, the world's best player. </p> <p>It does not come any tougher and if Henman is to make the breakthrough in the 38th grand slam tournament of his career then it is going to take something quite remarkable, for Federer is the overwhelming favourite. The 23-year-old Swiss, seven years younger than Henman, has won all three grand semi-finals he has played, two at Wimbledon, and then gone on to take the title. </p> <p>Apart from at Wimbledon in 2001, when Henman might have beaten Ivanisevic but for a horribly timed rain delay when he was ahead in the fourth set, the pattern of his semi-finals has been one of comprehensive defeat. In the other four he has won a total of two sets and, though his talent is unquestioned, he has never breathed easy at the business end of a major tournament. Nor has he seemed to possess the mental strength when the biggest prize comes within view, but today in New York the winning psychology might just favour him. </p> <p>The one niggle at the back of Federer's mind, one that Henman hopes to play on, is that of their eight previous meetings he has lost six. </p> <p>\"The good thing for me is that I won our last match in the final at Indian Wells this year,\" said Federer. \"That obviously gives me a lot of confidence, but Tim always puts me under pressure. He comes at you all the time. In Indian Wells I served well, and I was dominant from the baseline which was very important.\" </p> <p>Federer, after a hard but successful summer, is known to be a little tired but undoubtedly benefited from a fourth-round walk-over against Romania's Andrei Pavel. Henman, who has played three five-set matches, has spent more than seven hours longer on court than Federer during the past 12 days, which may prove crucial. </p> <p>The lack of a major weapon has always been a problem for Henman, particularly in the latter stages of a major tournament where a few free points are a boon beyond measure. It is acknowledged throughout the locker room that he is the best volleyer of all, but his second serve is regarded as suspect and eminently attackable and his forehand is liable to fragment under pressure. </p> <p>\"Tim has a great game because he does everything well, but I think that at the end of the day Federer has just a bit more firepower,\" said Andre Agassi, who lost to Federer in a five-set quarter-final. \"Henman can play some pressure shots in pressure situations. He moves well; he does a lot of things well. But Roger is not the No1 in the world for no reason, and if the wheels come off, if you lose your intensity for a second, he can really capitalise.\" </p> <p>\"Federer makes tennis look easy,\" said Dominik Hrbaty, whom Henman defeated in the quarter-finals. \"You try and serve as hard as you can against him and he returns it as if it were a piece of paper. It's very difficult to damage his game in any way. He's just too good.\" </p> <p>But he does have his off days, and Henman will be praying for one of those. Unfortunately they have become fewer and fewer since the Swiss made his grand slam breakthrough at Wimbledon in 2003. The only significant let-down he has suffered this year was at Roland Garros, when he lost to Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten in the third round, and at the Olympics where he went out in the second round to the Czech youngster Tomas Berdych. </p> <p>Those two defeats aside he has been all but invincible, winning eight tournaments, including the Australian Open and Wimbledon. </p> <p>\"People talk about the similarities between him and Pete [Sampras] because both could put pressure on you from the front and the back of the court,\" said Agassi. \"Pete could always let go from the baseline and it would get you in trouble right away, or he could get to the net and make you hit a pressure shot in a crucial situation over and over again. Roger can do that too, and that's what makes him too good.\" </p> <p>Henman believes Federer brings out the best in him. \"If you give Roger time from the baseline then he's better than anybody else. I need to be aggressive and try and give him less time - that's what will give me my best chance.\" </p> <p>To play his best tennis, and therefore to stand any chance at all of winning, Henman knows he must enter today's semi-final in a relaxed frame of mind, and stay relaxed. The major lesson he has learned since taking on Paul Annacone as his coach is that if he puts too much pressure on himself and tries too hard, his game fragments. </p> <p>\"I think the underlying theme at the top of the game is that if you are going to lose you want to have played your best. I'm not sure Tim did that enough in the past and now he's starting,\" said Annacone, Sampras's former coach. </p> <p>\"Sometimes as you get older you can put too much pressure on yourself because you can feel things slipping away, but Tim is a realistic guy and he's a smart guy and I think he realises that he's got a few good years left. If he wins a major title that's great and, if he doesn't, the goal now is to at least lose them doing what he does best.\"</p> <p><strong>How five other semi-finals ended in heartache</strong></p> <p><strong> Wimbledon </strong> 1998 </p> <p> Successive quarter-final exits finally give way to greater success as Henman becomes the first British men's Wimbledon semi-finalist since Roger Taylor in 1973 after beating the Czech Petr Korda in straight sets. Unfortunately he then comes up against Pete Sampras and, despite taking the second set off the reigning champion, he is never really in the match. Sampras wins the next two sets for a 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory and goes on to defeat Goran Ivanisevic in the final. </p> <p> <strong> Wimbledon </strong> 1999 </p> <p> By dispatching C\u00e9dric Pioline in four sets in the last eight Henman reaches a second successive semi-final against his great nemesis. Sampras has already beaten him in the final at the Queen's Club so there is great excitement when the home favourite takes the first set 6-3 and suddenly dreams of becoming the first British men's finalist here since 1938. It proves a false dawn, however, as Sampras bides his time and his serve-volley game and flawless ground strokes are just too good for Henman, with the American winning the next three sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. \"I believe 100% I can be Wimbledon champion,\" Henman says afterwards. \"I'll give it everything I've got. I've got a lot of years in front of me and, if I make that improvement, then I'm certain one day I can be champion.\" </p> <p> <strong> Wimbledon </strong> 2001 </p> <p> Henman defeats Roger Federer, who has announced his arrival in men's tennis by beating Sampras, in a grand slam event for the first time to reach the last four after a disappointing fourth-round exit in 2000. </p> <p>This is a Wimbledon punctuated by constant rain delays and Henman's semi-final against wild card Ivanisevic runs over three frustrating days. Henman is in control and seems to be moving to his first Wimbledon final when, at two sets to one and two games to one up in the fourth set, persistent drizzle forces the players off court. In 51 minutes of play the following day Ivanisevic wins the fourth set and is leading 3-2 in the decider before play is again suspended. </p> <p>It takes Ivanisevic only 18 more minutes on Sunday to win the fifth set 6-3 as Henman struggles again with the enormous public expectations as much as the Croatian's big serve. Ivanisevic goes on to beat Pat Rafter in an emotional final for the big-serving Croatian. </p> <p> <strong> Wimbledon </strong> 2002 </p> <p> Henman finds himself in the favourable half of the draw which leads to an even greater sense of expectation from the British public. After easing through to the last four again he has the prospect of facing the rank outsider David Nalbandian in the final. But the fourth seed is beaten in his first serious test in straight sets by the world No1 Lleyton Hewitt, who proceeds to breeze past Nalbandian, again in straight sets. </p> <p> <strong> French Open </strong> 2004 </p> <p> Henman proves his skill on a surface other than grass in becoming the first British male to reach the semi-finals of the French Open in 41 years. Despite having a game ill-suited to clay and despite suffering illness in the earlier stages of the tournament, he battles his way to a meeting with the Argentinian Guillermo Coria, who has won 47 of his previous 49 matches on the surface. As in previous matches, Henman catches his opponent off guard and takes the first set 6-3 but once again he cannot sustain the pretence and Coria's superior groundstrokes and speed around the court see him take the next three sets 6-4, 6-0, 7-5. Henman is left to concentrate on Wimbledon.</p>",
  "<p>When Philip Robinson walks into the paddock before the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown this afternoon, he will not so much be preparing to ride a horse, as to tame an elemental force. </p> <p>\"Rakti's got his quirks and his little ways,\" the jockey says, an understatement of considerable proportions. The truth is that he must try to achieve one of the most difficult tricks in racing. He needs to half-explode a bomb. </p> <p>Stand close to Rakti in the parade ring and you can almost hear him ticking. Headstrong, arrogant almost, he is a horse who does things his way. </p> <p>In the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, Robinson channelled his raw energy brilliantly, setting a strong pace as Rakti pulled for his head, but keeping enough back for a devastating finishing kick. A few weeks later, though, in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown, Rakti's fires raged out of control. He battled Robinson for control from the start, his head tossing violently, throughout the first six furlongs. When they turned into the straight he had nothing left to give. </p> <p>A repeat of his Ascot form, though, could well be enough to mark Rakti down as a champion in today's race, the finest contest of the season so far. Doyen, the brilliant King George winner, is also in the field, along with Grey Swallow, the Irish Derby winner, and Azamour, who took the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. </p> <p>\"What it's about is the difference between having a horse that's running keenly on the bit, and a horse that's trying to run away,\" Robinson says. \"He always sits on the bridle, he just doesn't know how to drop the bit [and relax]. No matter how hard you try, he'll just never do it. </p> <p>\"His last few bits of work he's learned to relax a bit more, but he's still keen and always will be. And he's the strongest horse I've ever ridden. You can't give him his head and then switch off in front, I've tried that at home and he just went faster and faster and burned himself out, so that's not an option. </p> <p>\"But that said, if he pulls at Leopardstown like he did at Sandown, I might have to try that rather than keep fighting him, because if you do that, it's futile.\" </p> <p>The struggle - both physical and mental - with Rakti's exuberance is clearly one that Robinson will relish. He has long had a reputation among punters as one of the weighing room's smartest riders. If the going changes suddenly the course of an afternoon, for instance, Robinson can usually be relied upon to find the fastest strip of turf. </p> <p>\"If there's an extra inch to be gained anywhere, I'll always look for it,\" he says. \"Often there's no prior plan. I might spot something at the last minute as I'm going to the start, perhaps a bit of ground that hasn't been getting the water. Sometimes that will make a big difference to the result.\" </p> <p>As the son of Peter Robinson, a former jockey turned trainer, he was always likely to find his way into the weighing room. </p> <p>\"My father died when I was 18, when I was just starting out and I'd only ridden a couple of winners,\" he says. \"I had to grow up very quickly. </p> <p> \"I was champion apprentice two years on the run, but like so many I found it a bit tough when I lost my claim and I think I ended up with 30-odd winners the next year. I just kept grinding away and working at it. </p> <p>\"I've always had a bit of a different approach to a lot of jockeys, I'd rather ride quality than quantity, and sometimes I'll take a day off rather than go and ride a bad one somewhere. Some people might say that's a bad idea, but as you get older [he is now 43] you have to try and pace yourself.\" </p> <p>Robinson's focus on quality rather than the seven-day grind made him a natural for the high-octane racing circuit in Hong Kong, where he spent six seasons and twice finished as the former colony's champion rider. </p> <p>\"The hardest thing in Hong Kong was learning to put up with the pressure, because jockeys have film-star status over there. But it's one of the places that if you don't enjoy it, you're not going to last. </p> <p>\"I've ridden in many different countries, and I've always learned something from them. If always think that when you stop learning, you're starting to retire.\" </p> <p>The horses on Robinson's cv already include such brilliant performers as Pebbles, the 1984 1,000 Guineas winner, and Holding Court, who won the French Derby by six lengths. </p> <p>\"I'm frightened to mention them all in case I leave one out,\" he says, \"but I do think that Rakti could be the best I've ridden.\" Robinson may manage to control his mount this afternoon, or he may be carried away by the explosion beneath. Either way, it will be quite something to see.</p>",
  "<p>Rain disrupted the first day of the Champions Trophy, just as we knew it would after a preceding week of unrelenting heat and sunshine. There was time enough though for Zimbabwe to ensure that England did not have it all their own way. </p> <p>These games are carried over into a second day in the event of weather disruption on the first, with overs reductions only applying thereafter. So England, put in to bat by Tatenda Taibu, will resume this morning, having made 198 for five from 38 overs, stretched by a performance of great enthusiasm and, in the field, surprising quality from the young and inexperienced Zimbabwe side. </p> <p>Credit then not to England, who remain in control if chastened, but to Zimbabwe and their new coach Phil Simmons. The former West Indies batsman has had only six weeks to work with his new charges but in that time he seems to have instilled a work ethic. </p> <p>Strict fielding disciplines were added to bowling which began nervily in the extreme - with a 13-ball opening over, so much difficulty did the teenage Tinashe Panyangara have in locating the cut part of the pitch - but which knuckled down. Zimbabwe performed creditably within limitations, none better than Edward Rainsford, who took two for 43 from his 10 overs of intelligent medium pace before retiring with a migraine. </p> <p>To compete with bat and ball, Simmons will have reasoned, is beyond his team's scope, but fielding is another matter. Yesterday, from as early as the second over, when a ball was relayed in from the boundary with two flat throws rather than one in a parabola - reckoned to cut a fraction of a second from the time, the difference, perhaps, between a run-out and not - his influence was evident. </p> <p>More than ever, a poor or inexperienced bowling attack relies on support in the field. Fewer chances are created; all the more reason to take those that are on offer. In this Zimbabwe were faultless: Marcus Trescothick, after a couple of bludgeoning boundaries, steered tamely to a solitary slip, Brendon Taylor, who took the catch throat high; Michael Vaughan, after a brace of sixes short-armed off Doug Hondo into the Hollies Stand at square leg, was squared up by an excellent delivery and well caught by Mark Vermeulen low down at second slip; and Andrew Strauss saw Taibu, barely five feet tall, plunge away to his left behind the stumps and pluck a scintillating one-handed catch out of the air. </p> <p>Best of all, though, was Panyangara's dismissal of Andrew Flintoff, crowned this week as king of the one-day game. The bowler had shown considerable character in coming back from the embarrassment of his opening over but there can be no more daunting experience in the game at present than to be confronted by Flintoff with his double-O licence fully activated. One four was biffed over cover. But in attempting to take the aerial route the all-rounder got under the ball too much and hit it steeplingly towards long-off. The odds were not on Hondo. But he made ground to his left and sprawlingly clung on, an inspirational effort. </p> <p>England's effort had been underpinned by the continuing excellent form of Vikram Solanki, who made 62 effortlessly and with great style before his concentration lapsed - to his obvious chagrin as he made his way back to the dressing room - and he hit all around a straight ball and was leg before wicket. </p> <p>These days his talent is coming to fruition, however, and he worked the leg side immaculately before rattling out his off-side shots off front and back foot, none better than the boundary punched precisely, elbow-high, off Hondo. That he allowed his mind to wander remains a worry, though. In this match, with the prospect of a sappy pitch today on which to bowl, his dismissal was probably an irrelevance. England by then may well have had sufficient to win the match. But in more trying circumstances it is paramount that a batsman, playing as well as he, capitalises fully and allows the others in his side to bat around him. </p> <p>As it is, it will be down to Paul Collingwood, the scampering fixit in this England side, and Geraint Jones, altogether more robust in approach but both of them as jaunty as sailors on a spot of shore leave, to put the game beyond Zimbabwe's reach. Thus far the pair have added 39 for the sixth wicket, with Collingwood on 35 and Jones 23.</p>",
  "<p>In Beyond the Fringe Jonathan Miller delivered a whimsical monologue about the day he visited the sales department of the British Rail Lost Property department. Miller had gone in search of cheap clothing and discovered to his amazement that on offer were several hundred pairs of brand new, \"cerulean blue\" gentlemen's corduroy trousers. How, Miller pondered, could so many people on a train absent-mindedly divest themselves of several hundred pairs of trousers when \"it's hard enough to lose a bagful of orange peel when you really want to\"? </p> <p>Miller's words came back to me this week when I read that thieves in Rainham had broken into a garage and made off with 3,000 umpire's jackets. According to Kent police, a member of the Association of Cricket Scorers and Umpires had been storing the coats - embroidered with the ACS&amp;U badge and the red logo of the sponsors, the Post Office - in his garage and had returned on Monday to find them gone. </p> <p>Not since it was reported that Willington FC of the Northern League had suffered the indignity of having their pitch stolen has any crime so alarmed the world of sport. That tale happily proved to be apocryphal, though that did not deter hordes of armed vigilantes eager to claim the putative reward - a free ticket in the Hall Lane half-time meat draw - from scouring County Durham in search of freshly laid lawns with penalty spots on them. </p> <p>Tragically this latest chilling dispatch from Blair's Battleground Britain proves to be incontrovertibly true. The distinctive jackets - estimated street value \u00a345,000 - have gone and so far nobody has any idea who took them or, more worrying still, why they took them. </p> <p>Questioned about the case Kent police remained stony-faced. \"Anyone who may have information in connection with this crime should come forward,\" said a spokesperson in a cunning, but so far unavailing, ruse to flush out the villains. </p> <p>Meanwhile the shockwaves from the case have reverberated down cricket's corridors of power like a late-night kebab. The ACS&amp;U has 8,000 members ranging from David Shepherd to the old blokes who pass their Saturdays and Sundays on suburban council pitches trying to ignore yelling slip cordons and get a bit of a kip. The prospect that these legal overlords of strip, square and outfield might in future have no pockets in which to store their counting stones has sent the game into crisis mode. </p> <p>Questioned about the possible effect of the loss of the association's vital supply of coats, Clare Skinner, communications officer for the MCC, said: \"It could be a bit of a problem. They are the governing body of umpires everywhere.\" Fighting hard to keep the panic from her voice Skinner added: \"Maybe they should try looking on eBay.\" </p> <p>I have just done so. Sadly I must report that instead of \"BNWT Cricket Official's Coat (poss. fetish/sexual interest). Winning bidders state size. 2,999 more available\", all I found when I typed \"umpire's jacket\" into the search engine was a hardback edition of Dickie Bird's autobiography (offered at 99p, no bids) and the Official Handbook of the Association of Cricket Umpires (1957) by RS Rait Kerr at a tempting Buy It Now price of \u00a34.50. </p> <p>In the wake of this terrible crime two obvious questions arise: why did the ACS&amp;U have so many jackets and what are the thieves planning to do with them? The first is easily dealt with. Following advice in the government's recently distributed booklet on what to do if terrorists explode a dirty nuclear device in your toolshed - for those who missed it, tuck your trousers into your socks and eat baked beans was the gist - the association had taken the precaution of stockpiling enough umpiring coats to see the summer game through a nuclear winter, with enough spare to get through a chilly start to nuclear spring as well. </p> <p>As to why anybody should want to steal the coats, one can only speculate. One hope is that as part of some situationist-style tribute to Jonathan Miller the thieves intend over the coming weeks to spread their load across Britain's train network. Already there are rumours that the rail companies are pre-recording announcements - \"We regret to report that the 3.12 service from Hatfield is running approximately 52 minutes late. This is due to umpire's jackets on the line in the Welwyn region.\" </p> <p>A more real fear is that the thieves have stolen the coats as part of some terrible plot. Is it possible that some evil mastermind has hit on the idea of using the traditional affection and respect all Britons instinctively feel for cricket officialdom to establish a totalitarian regime by sending an army of 3,000 bogus umpires on to our streets? </p> <p>Is our willingness in all circumstances to abide by the ump's decision, no matter how crazed or arbitrary, with no more protest than a shrug of the shoulders and the mouthing of the words \"blind bastard\" at the nearest TV camera, about to be used to seize control? Will a raised finger and a rueful grin send us all to the gulags? In the current climate of international menace nothing can be ruled out. By the time you read this the men in white coats may be coming for us all.</p>",
  "<p>Do you remember Henry Olonga and Andy Flower? Just asking because it seems to me that in all the fuss about substandard teams, racism, safety and security in Zimbabwe, all the talk of repercussions and the game of cricket imploding in this country if England do not fulfil their agreement to tour that beleaguered country, the real issue seems to have been carefully slipped on to the back burner. </p> <p>So to refresh any memories that need it, Olonga and Flower, Zimbabwean cricketers both, one black the other white, were the two immensely brave individuals who risked not just careers but - and this is not overdramatising - the lives not just of themselves but of friends and family by a black-armband protest, signifying the death of democracy in their native land, at Zimbabwe's opening match of the last World Cup, against Namibia in Harare. Olonga has been in self-imposed exile since; Flower plying his trade as a professional cricketer in Australia and this country. Neither is likely to return home. </p> <p>On Thursday, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board David Morgan, chose the eve of yesterday's Champions Trophy match against Zimbabwe to reiterate the ECB's intention to honour its agreement to tour. At the same time Michael Vaughan, the England captain, stressed that while there was no obligation on any of his players to tour if they had strong personal grounds for not doing so, he had received no indication from any that they had any intention of not going for the five-match series in November. </p> <p>This is strange. At the time of England's withdrawal from their World Cup match in Harare, on a spurious safety and security issue, there was believed to be a significant group who had moral objections at the time who are still in the shake-up. </p> <p>The time, though, is drawing near for a few heads to be stuck over the parapet, and just in case heads have been filled with talk of England suspension and livelihoods disappearing should players not go, all England-con tracted players, as well as ECB board members, Richard Bevan of the Professional Cricketers Association, and the media, will shortly receive a letter from a credible Zimbabwean action group (which, until it is officially in the public domain, cannot be named) which outlines a few home truths. It needs no paraphrasing: </p> <p> \"It is now inevitable that England will be touring Zimbabwe later this year, and we all understand the circumstances that have led to this inevitability. Since the tour is going ahead, however, it is important that those who may be travelling as members of the touring party be very aware of what kind of a place they will be visiting. We had hoped to be able to talk to you and to answer any questions you may have had face to face. Despite numerous requests, however, the ECB have decided not to allow us to brief you in person. Hence this letter. </p> <p>\"Eighteen months ago, the England team chose not to travel to play the World Cup fixture against Zimbabwe scheduled for the Harare Sports Club. Other teams did make the journey north; two matches were decided in Harare, and three at the Queen's Ground in Bulawayo. The document we have enclosed was compiled shortly after the Bulawayo matches. It details what happened to some of the Zimbabweans who attended those games, and who, without disrupting play in any way, exercised their constitutional right to peaceful protest. The brutal experiences related by these people, who are only a sample of those arrested at the time, are nothing short of disgusting. </p> <p>\"By the time the England players arrive in Zimbabwe on the forthcoming visit, a new law will be in force which will ban organisations such as those who compiled the document we have sent you. Reporting of such abuse will cease, and such appalling behaviour by a government against its own citizens will become invisible to all but the victims. </p> <p>\"Other organisations, which treat such victims of torture, or feed the hungry, or nurse the sick, will have to register with the government, and have their activities closely controlled. The government itself has refused international food aid, despite a catastrophic shortfall in this year's harvest, so that it may more easily manipulate food supplies for political ends. And the previous 48-hour limit on the time that the police can detain a person before bringing charges has now been extended by an additional 21 days - renewable. </p> <p>\"The physical safety of the touring party will not be put in any jeopardy. The England team will be closely protected from any danger, and will be treated to the most lavish hospitality. But if you are one of those who do travel to Zimbabwe, remember what is going on behind the sight-screen.\" </p> <p>The document to which the letter refers, a copy of which will accompany each letter, refers to arrest, torture and rape in custody and can be viewed at <a href=\"http://www.zwnews.com\">www.zwnews.com</a> in the Exclusives section at the bottom of the home page. There is little to add.</p>",
  "<p>I'd arranged to have lunch in Wales with a German acquaintance, a gourmet who once (very briefly) owned a Sino-Teutonic restaurant called A Wok In The Black Forest. As we drove towards Conwy, he confided that he'd now lived in this country long enough to conclude that the British are preoccupied with regulations, and are far more authoritarian than his own supposedly law-obsessed nation. </p> <p>In particular, he was appalled by the number of \"forbidden\" signs he saw everywhere (No Parking, No Waiting, No Sitting, No Standing, Keep Off The Grass, Keep Out), and by the hostile negativity of our service industries, with their unwelcoming \"wait here to be seated\" placards in restaurants, and waiters who delight in smugly responding \"It's off\" when you give them your order. \"Give a Brit a clipboard and a shred of authority,\" he told me, \"and they all turn into traffic wardens, because saying 'no' is your national sport.\" </p> <p>He proved his point when we arrived at The Groes Inn (it rhymes with Joyce), and immediately drew my attention to the child-unfriendly \"No Prams\" and \"No Pushchairs\" signs on the door (euphemisms for \"You're welcome to enter but, do us a favour, please just go away\"). From the moment we stepped inside, I regretted that there wasn't another sign saying \"No Bibelots or Knick-Knacks\", because the place was crammed to its fake half-timbered rafters with clutter and gewgaws, some of which looked as though they'd been there since the place was awarded its licence in 1573. </p> <p>Gaudy trinkets dangled from every beam, with military hats, old cooking utensils, and Victorian postcards jammed tightly against glass-encased cricket bats, and even a huge trout in a plastic frame. I also caught sight of a Welsh dresser sandwiched between a pouffe and a tallboy. God bless the Prince of Wales. </p> <p>On reaching our table, I thought nothing could be more refreshing than the \"Caesar salad with classic dressing and croutons\". And nothing would have been more refreshing, because what arrived was an even more dismal travesty of possibly the greatest dish ever to have originated in the US (well, just across the border in Tijuana, anyway) than those wretched supermarket box kits that also masquerade under the name. No heart of a romaine lettuce, no subtle whiff of garlic, no egg, no anchovy fillets, nor even a dash of Worcestershire sauce to impart an anchovy flavour. Just a few limp, wilted leaves sprinkled with too many damp croutons, and some nondescript bits of old cheese (which I ate Caerphilly), all covered with a thick coating of gunge. More of a seizure salad, really. </p> <p>My German colleague's potage was slammed down precariously on the table, and one sip confirmed that it was \"underseasoned, like most British soups\". Worse, its frothy sabayon texture suggested a recent brutal encounter with an electric food processor, and I pined for the good old days when soups like this would be tammied on a kitchenmaid's leg. The service was equally frothy, with a disingenuous faux-urgency that reminded me of those meaningless \"on hold\" telephonic phrases (\"Your call is important to us\"), but we eventually received our wine, though not the parsimonious half-bottle of Chablis we'd ordered. Germans love puns, which may be why he looked at the label, then inquired, \"Mcon for lunch?\" just as the soup was being sloshed down. </p> <p>When the main courses finally arrived, my companion's Manx kippers in butter (with added bread and butter) didn't require a lemon so much as a tub of industrial-strength Trico. Well, only a proprietorial degreasing agent could have cut through all that added fat, its cloying texture further exacerbated by the superfluous presence of mounds of bacon. </p> <p>As for my \"fisherman's pie in a creamy cheese sauce, topped with crushed potato and served with fresh vegetables\", it fell foul of my golden rule: if I can make a better fist of a dish than the chef, then the chef has clearly failed. The allegedly wild salmon had the flabby texture of the cheap, farmed variety (I blame overcooking), and was taking its final desultory swim in a vapid sauce that resembled either a split hollandaise or school custard; and where were the contrasting tastes of smoked haddock, or cod, or prawns? Bizarrely, the self-same croutons that had marred the potage and the seizure salad reappeared in bloated form in the sauce (creating a disagreeable mulchy texture). When you find yourself glancing enviously at a trout in a plastic frame, you know you're sitting over a whole bowl of wrong. </p> <p>To be fair, the bread-and-butter pudding (made from bara brith Welsh bread) served with ginger ice cream was faultless, the more so when accompanied by a glass of jobbing muscat. But to be fairer, lunch was a bleak and forlorn affair, thanks to a farinaceously obsessed chef who had achieved a sort of gastronomic alchemy. He'd made a pig's ear out of a fish pie. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Open:</strong> All week, 12 noon-3pm; 6.30-11pm (Saturday, 6-11pm). <br><strong>Menus:</strong> Lunch from \u00a311.90 for two courses. <br>Wheelchair access (no WC).</p>",
  "Complaints about the Guardian's coverage of the horrific events in Beslan have been relatively few. One might assume from this that the enormity of the event checked the critical hand, or even that there was a tacit sympathy with the paper's struggle to relate and comprehend such an event. No more than 20 complaints reached me. Perhaps this was also partly because the coverage, although extensive, was as decently restrained as it could be. <p>In at least one respect the coverage was too restrained for a few readers. Several took strong objection to the use of the term \"militants\" rather than \"terrorists\" to describe the hostage-takers, the immediate perpetrators of the atrocity. These complaints were provoked in particular by a heading across the top of two pictures from the hostage-takers' video: \"Inside terror school - Film taken by militants shows hostages' desperate plight\". A briefly immoderate email from Nevada in the United States, for example, ended: \"These guys are terrorists, not militants, not fighters. They are terrorists!\" </p> <p>The term was not entirely absent. An article on the comment pages (Max Hastings: \"These terrible tactics may actually be working\") was unequivocal and right in applying it to the hostage-takers. One can still say \"right\", I think, in the knowledge placed before us in more than one of the contextual and historical pieces carried by the Guardian, that a huge number of children have been among civilians killed by Russian forces in Chechnya. </p> <p>Most of the complaints were from readers of the printed paper which - almost unbelievably - carried at the bottom of a page devoted to the disastrous ending of the siege a \"Back to school\" advertisement. It was a deeply regrettable collision between the normality of school routine and the horror of what had happened in Beslan on which all editorial minds at work on that page were concentrated. We can agree with the reader who said: \"Please, please take more care over this kind of thing.\" </p> <p>There was an isolated complaint about a cartoon carried on the main comment page (Martin Rowson, September 6). Beneath the line \"How to achieve freedom and justice ...\" it showed - against the background of an inferno - the figure of death placing its hand on the shoulder of a crouching gunman to whom it is saying: \"No No No! Aim lower or you'll miss the kids.\" The reader found this extremely offensive and suggested that had it been British children slaughtered we should not have been so callous as to publish anything like it. I can understand that view but I cannot agree with it. The cartoon seemed to me to be an expression of proper outrage and helplessness. </p> <p>A headline in an early edition on September 7 - \"Mother left daughter at captors' mercy\" - drew complaint from another reader who argued, in this case quite rightly in my view, that it implied \"a voluntary abandonment\" while the story made it clear that it was nothing of the sort. It was changed for later editions. </p> <p>Most of the complaints were directed at pictures, in particular one used across six columns on the front page of September 6 showing the mother of 12-year-old Erik Varziyev weeping over his body during one of the many funeral ceremonies. One reader wrote: \"This seems to me to go well beyond the bounds of ordinary decency\" And another: \"We do not need to see pictures to understand how cruel and tragic the situation in Russia is.\" One reader complained that the privilege of choice over whether to expose her own children to such images had effectively been removed from her by carrying the picture on the front page. \"Maybe you think that the children in this country need to share every last detail of an event so unbelievable that most adults are having a hard time comprehending it.\" </p> <p>Readers expect us to have carefully considered the images we show. We recently asked 2,500 Guardian readers to respond to the following statement: \"I am concerned that children should not be exposed to certain violent images.\" Forty-nine percent agreed it represented their view; 28% disagreed; and the rest neither agreed or disagreed. </p> <p>The picture editor said, \"I have spent the past three days looking at horrific pictures [among several thousand images received from Beslan in that time] and this was not one of them. The question we have to ask ourselves is how to do we face up professionally and privately to increasingly horrific events in the world?\" Is the newspaper a window or a screen? </p> <p>Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning <b>0845 451 9589</b> (UK only, calls charged at local rate) or <b>+44 (0)20 7713 4736</b> between 11am and 5pm UK time Monday to Friday excluding UK bank holidays.

  "<p>A disturbing culture of bullying and abuse has emerged at Britain's major airports, according to Amicus, Britain's largest private sector union. Heathrow and Gatwick are at the centre of the union's report, which highlights disturbing allegations of bullying by staff. </p> <p>Prompted by anecdotal evidence of widespread abuse, Amicus asked the charity Andrea Adams Trust, which works with employers to identify bullying behaviour, to set up an anti-bullying hotline across Heathrow and Gatwick. </p> <p>The charity recorded around 150 calls from check-in-staff, engineers and cabin crew, with nine out of 10 callers complaining about racial abuse or sexual harassment. </p> <p>The analysis of these cries for help revealed a raft of racial, physical and verbal abuse as well as sexual harassment. The most harrowing call came from a woman who said that she was locked in a cold store for 15 minutes to teach her a lesson because she complained about her male supervisor touching her inappropriately. </p> <p>Then she was warned that if she took the matter further he would make sure that the next time she froze to death. </p> <p>Other abusive remarks directed at black and Asian staff included: \"Don't they teach you to read and write in the jungle\" and \"Turbans are not allowed sunshine, get a haircut\". </p> <p>One manager admitted that while he recognised that bullying behaviour could be seen all around the airports, most victims simply kept their heads down, fearing that a complaint would only lead to further intimidation or cost them their jobs. Amicus wants employers to work with the union to \"boot these bullies out of the airports\". </p> <p>But allegations of workplace bullying are not confined to airports. Traffic wardens Phil Mansell and Bruce Edwards claim that they were sacked by Bromsgrove District Council for not issuing enough parking tickets. </p> <p>The wardens who were writing some 14 tickets a day were compelled to hand out more \u00a330 fines, through a staff assessment memo which said \"The current performance is unacceptable and needs serious and immediate improvement. The target for the next three months is to achieve an average figure of 19.6 excess charge numbers a day.\" </p> <p>To make sure that the kindly wardens hit their target it is alleged that the pair were followed around by managers and ordered to book offending police cars, ambulances and post office vans. The council rejects their claim of bullying, saying that the wardens simply failed to meet their set performance targets. As both men were serving out their probationary period at the time of their dismissal they cannot appeal against the decision. </p> <p>Last year a survey by Unison, the union for local government workers, found that nine out of 10 traffic wardens and car park attendants experienced verbal or physical violence during the course of their work. </p> <p>Now it seems that bullying by managers over targets is also becoming a feature of a traffic warden's working day. </p> <p>However, employer organisations have until next year to address the workplace harassment issue when the EU Directive on Equal Treatment will enter UK law to amend the 1976 regulations. </p> <p>Under the new rules, there will be an onus on employers to implement a satisfactory policy to prevent bullying or harassment in the workplace.</p>",
  "<p>Tax experts this week urged families with tax credit overpayments to check their records before agreeing to pay the money back. </p> <p>Thousands of families could escape making repayments because the fault lies with the Inland Revenue, says the Chartered Institute of Taxation. A badly worded tax credit application form, which misled many claimants, could also be used to avoid repayments, it says. </p> <p>The problem arises because the Inland Revenue wants to cut payments to claimants if they were overpaid tax credits last year. Some families that earn a combined income of \u00a313,000 have found themselves in a position where they face demands for more than \u00a32,500, which Revenue officials say must be paid back out of their monthly income. </p> <p>Earlier this year the Revenue was criticised by a parliamentary committee for failing to claw back \u00a32bn of tax credit overpayments. Now the tax authority is under pressure to force all claimants to pay back overpaid benefits. </p> <p>One family that contacted Jobs &amp; Money must pay back \u00a32,500. They have been told to take a \u00a3500 cut in benefits this year. They don't know when they must repay the other \u00a32,000. </p> <p>Anna Sinclair says her son and daughter-in-law found themselves saddled with the debt after they claimed tax credits for themselves and their baby in April last year. They were awarded working tax credit (WTC) of \u00a33,645 and child tax credit of \u00a31,990 to boost their \u00a37,165 income and pay for part-time childcare costs. Everything went well until daughter-in-law Serena went back to full-time work and the family income jumped to \u00a313,000. Immediately the tax credit office demanded back \u00a32,599 of the WTC childcare benefit. It also reduced their tax credits for the current year by \u00a34,350. </p> <p>The combined effect of making the repayments and cuts in tax credits was to reduce their annual income from \u00a313,000 to \u00a36,091, says Ms Sinclair. The Revenue has agreed to delay repayments, but has left the family in dire straits, she says. </p> <p>\"My daughter-in-law went to work believing she would receive 70% of the cost of her childcare. But what was the point of her going out to work now the tax credits have been taken away. It is such a dishonest scheme. </p> <p>Ailsa Forbes told the Revenue of changes to her circumstances in November last year. But while she says she just informed them about the birth of her second child, the Revenue says she added that her income had fallen from \u00a313,000 to \u00a38,000. This resulted in a demand for overpaid tax credits of \u00a31,321. </p> <p>Ms Forbes wrote to the Revenue to say she didn't suffer a drop in income because she was a civil servant on maternity leave. She says the Revenue refuses to concede that one of its helpline advisers might have made a mistake. </p> <p>Her misfortune was then compounded by the discovery that her successful application for extended maternity leave without pay (something only made possible following legislation passed by the government last year), would disqualify her from tax credits. She appealed against the overpayment demand even though the Revenue had already clawed back \u00a3500 from her benefits due to be paid in February and March. This week the Revenue wrote to say it had exonerated itself and turned down the appeal. </p> <p>\"I will appeal again. I'm so angry at the way the system works,\" she says. </p> <p>Katie Lane, policy officer at Citizens Advice, says the tax credit system can't cope with people who change jobs, split up with their partners, move house and all the other things can cause seismic shifts in income. </p> <p>\"People who change jobs all the time, like agency workers, are the worst affected. It takes tax advisers who specialise in tax credits three hours on average to work out each award,\" she says. \"The award fails to give a breakdown of figures and times when you qualified and when you didn't. It is even more obscure than last year.\" </p> <p>The Revenue says it will be next May before it has any figures on the number of appeals against overpayment demands. A spokesman says the claim forms were accompanied by the TC600 explanatory notes and the award form by the TC602 notes. </p> <p>Ms Lane says it should produce a one-page crib sheet rather than just booklets which run to more pages than the forms themselves. </p> <p><strong>How to hold on to an overpayment</strong></p> <p>Has the Inland Revenue overpaid your tax credits and asked for their money back? Check before you agree to any reductions in future payments - you may be able to keep it, says the Chartered Institute for Taxation. </p> <p>Many people will either have been overpaid or underpaid because tax credits paid in the year to April 5 2004 are based on income for the year to April 5 2002.However, the amounts paid during the tax year 2003-4 must be checked against an individual's actual situation in the period. </p> <p>Where the Revenue has overpaid someone, it will normally require the extra to be refunded. Individuals will now be receiving these requests. However, repayment is not always necessary: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If an overpayment was the result of the Revenue's mistake, and the individual could reasonably believe the tax credits were correct then they do not have to be repaid. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> There were also mistakes in the original Revenue guidance provided with the tax credit form. For example, the form wrongly said farmers' income should be averaged. So a farmer relying on this guidance will not have to return overpayment. </p> <p>To request that overpayments be scrapped ask the Revenue for form TC846 \"Request to reconsider recovery of tax credits\".</p>",
  "<p>Website owners - and those thinking of setting up sites - are the targets of new schemes hitting the unwary, or those worried about others stealing their internet site names, for sums of up to \u00a31,000. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money has uncovered a network focusing on legitimate owners of internet sites (known as domains). Besides UK cases, there have been similar practices in the Netherlands, South Africa, and the US. </p> <p>They work on the basis that even if only a small proportion of those who are targeted pay up, those involved in selling these schemes can easily earn \u00a34,000 or more a day. </p> <p>Marketing research expert Henry Samuels was on the receiving end of one attempt. He runs a marketing research business from his London home. \"I have never bothered with a website because I do not need one. I have plenty of work in my speciality - financial services - through word of mouth recommendations,\" he says. </p> <p>But last week he received an unsolicited phone call. \"It said that someone with offices in London and Stirling was going to set up henrysamuelsmarketingservices.com. The bit without the .com is my trading name. </p> <p>\"But the caller said if I wanted to control the name of my own firm, I could do so by paying \u00a3400 for the .biz versions and \u00a3200 each for others such as .co.uk. Once I paid, my business name would be safe for 10 years,\" he says. </p> <p>The caller, who identified herself as Sian Lewis, insisted Samuels pay then and there with a credit card. </p> <p>\"She said that she had to take the money at once to prevent this other person stealing my name. She had a very persuasive patter,\" says Mr Samuels. </p> <p>Ms Lewis said she worked for a firm called DomainiaUK. No such company is listed at Companies House - although there is, of course, no legal compulsion to incorporate. </p> <p>The firm's website offers a variety of deals including the ability to set up web addresses ending in .uk for 10 years. But DomainiaUK is well-known to Nominet, the not-for-profit company which organises the the registry for .uk internet names. </p> <p>\"Our rules say that you can only register a .uk domain name for a maximum two years,\" says Nominet lawyer Ed Phillips. \"If you paid for 10 years, you would have to trust the company to renew the registration every two years.\" </p> <p>DomainiaUK gives an address in Old Gloucester Street, Holborn, London. Jobs &amp; Money went there earlier this week. But far from discovering a call centre, we found the October Gallery. </p> <p>The Gallery, about to host a exhibition of Australian indigeous art and culture, has been there for 25 years, occupying the entire building. </p> <p>\"This is address theft, including our own postcode,\" says gallery director Chili Hawes, who says she became aware earlier this month that DomainiaUK was stealing the company's address. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money has tried but failed to contact Domain iaUK. But in 2002, Nominet brought a legal action against Domain Registrar Services (DRS), a Carmarthen-based company now over a year late filing accounts with Companies House and about to be struck off. </p> <p>DRS was linked to Domain Verification Bureau which, in turn, used the trading name Domainia. This operated from a maildrop address, also in Old Gloucester St. </p> <p>The domainiaUK website is registered to a Christopher Snow at the October Gallery address. Jobs &amp; Money was unable to contact Mr Snow - or to gain any response from the 0870 numbers the firm uses. These numbers come from Totem, a Manchester based phone company which says it cannot disclose the subscribers or their locations due to the Data Protection Act. </p> <p>Henry Samuels was worried enough to agree to pay \u00a3400 with his credit card. But when he put the phone down, he realised his mistake. </p> <p>\"I managed to contact Barclaycard at once and reverse the transaction,\" he says. \"It is too easy to be caught out.\" </p> <p>Other money making attempts are aimed at those already with websites. </p> <p>Timothy Cornes set up his <a href=\"http://www.tiddleham.com\">tiddleham.com</a> website two years ago for a children's book idea he is developing. He paid \u00a38.99 a year to 1&amp;1 Internet, the world's largest web hosting company. </p> <p>\"This expires soon. But before 1&amp;1 contacted me, I received a 'domain expiration notice' from Domain Registry Services in Cambridge asking for \u00a360 for two years. This looked very convincing. </p> <p>\"It appears official but I noticed the high price and the incomprehensible small print so I questioned it,\" he says. \"My present provider's price is unchanged.\" </p> <p>Roy Schofield, who owns Phaedrus, a specialist DVD firm, in Darwen, Lancashire received the same \"domain expiration notice\" from DRS but from a central London address. He is a 1&amp;1 customer. </p> <p>His letter says: \"Do not ingore this notice.\" It threatens \"immediate suspension and deletion without further notice from us if payment is not made to the registry before the expiry date.\" </p> <p>DRS also billed him \u00a360, insisting on a cheque. Both DRS addresses are maildrops. </p> <p>Richard Stevenson at 1&amp;1 Internet says: \"A small number of 1&amp;1 customers have received a 'domain expiration notice'. We have sent an email to our customers to reassure them that all domains registered with 1&amp;1 are renewed automatically, which means that customers do not lose registered domain names.\" </p> <p>Roy Windibank at Camden trading standards is now on the trail of DomainiaUK. </p> <p>\"We have had complaints from individuals and the October Gallery. I got through once on the phone and spoke to a woman who told me the firm was registered at Old Gloucester Street. This is simply wrong,\" he says. \"I also spoke to someone who said he was Christopher Snow but he gave two false addresses.\" </p> <p>\"The problem is the Business Names Act 1985 is all I can use for false addresses at this stage. And this act has no usable enforcement powers,\" he adds. </p> <p>Swansea trading standards is prosecuting a number of firms running similar internet plans. </p> <p>\"We're using the trade descriptions act to prosecute a number of local firms whose activity causes concern\" says trading standards officer David Picken. He adds: \"Claiming someone is about to buy your domain name is a false description if there is no such act in reality. We hope to track down the people behind a number of these scams by following the money - they use bank accounts and take credit cards so there will be an audit trail.\" </p> <p>But, he adds: \"If you are contacted about a website out of the blue, be very careful.\" </p> <p><strong>Make a name for yourself</strong></p> <p>It's easy - and inexpensive -to register a domain name. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Your domain title cannot have more than 64 letters and will usually be related to your name or business. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Decide on the suffix such as .co.uk, .com, .biz or .org.uk Some such as .com are more popular while .org can tell people you are not a company. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Check whether your chosen name is already taken - there are a number of \"WHOIS\" services including one from Nominet for .uk names. The <a href=\"http://www.easily.co.uk\">easily.co.uk</a> site is useful for .com as well. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Register with an internet service provider. It can be worth shopping around as prices vary depending on other services provided such as email addresses. Expect to pay around \u00a310 a year plus VAT for a basic package. </p> <p>You can sign up for two years for .uk, longer for some other suffixes.</p>",
  "<p>Given the great modern reliance on networks of pipelines, it would tempting to think that sea ports are in decline - but it is anything but the case. Ports may suffer from rather poor PR, but business is booming around the world. Fuelled by the huge increase in world trade, the volumes of goods being handled by giant ports such as Rotterdam or Shanghai have never been higher.</p> <p>Which is where this week's set course comes in. Those wanting to study a postgrad course in port management in Europe have two choices - a course in English is offered in Antwerp, or for something a bit closer to home there's one offered by Plymouth University. </p> <p>Its MSc in port management sits neatly alongside two sister courses in international shipping and international logistics, and while it's not the biggest of the three, it's the fastest growing. </p> <p>However, according to the man who runs the course, Michael Roe, port management doesn't attract many UK students for the simple reason that getting funding is so difficult. \"We aren't keen on taking recent graduates unless there are really, really good. Most of our students are young professionals in the 25-35 age group who have been working in a port or related environment since graduating.\" </p> <p>By that he means freight forwarding or logistics - one thing he makes very clear is that he will not accept anyone with anything less than a 2:1 unless there are exceptional circumstances. If you can persuade him to give you a place the course divides into three main areas - two taught terms and a dissertation. The winter and spring terms are spent learning standard business modules such as law, economics and IT but, according to Michael, they are all taught from a ports perspective. </p> <p>\"Students won't be working their way through oceans of English law - everything is examined on the basis of how it relates to the business of running a port.\" </p> <p>Students have the option of studying some of the modules offered on the syllabuses of the two related courses, and there are plenty of lectures by speakers from the ports and closely related industries that students are required to attend. </p> <p>\"When it come to the dissertation most of our students seem to disappear off to one of the big ports to conduct their research. While it's not required, we do encourage students to conduct some research within the industry that they will go on and work in,\" he says. </p> <p>The port business is very much an international business and lots of jobs available to those who have completed the course will be outside the UK. That said, Tilbury, Southampton, Felixstowe and Immingham on the Humber are thriving and need senior mangers.</p> <p>Fees for the course are around \u00a33,500. The course has 30-40 students studying full-time, over one year, and there are places available for 'exceptional candidates' - but you'll have to move fast.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscali.fr\">miles.brignall@tiscali.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>Tempted at the last minute by a postgraduate course? But not sure whether a quick decision will prove to be a poor decision? Rise spoke with experts and recent postgraduates about their experiences of plunging in at short notice, both good and bad. What, we asked, do they think are the absolute essentials that should always be taken into account before deciding?</p> <p>For Tim Brown, general secretary of the National Postgraduate Committee, the key issue to consider is an exit strategy. \"Although there is no right or wrong reason for doing a postgraduate degree,\" he says, \"the most dangerous thing is to enter into one without giving any thought to how it will affect your options when you exit. A taught course will always make you more of a specialist. The question to ponder is whether it will give you more or fewer options than you have now.\"</p> <p>\"To anyone who is um-ing and ahh-ing about doing a postgraduate course, I would advise them to really think about how it was going to help them with their chosen career,\" says Bhupinder Grewal, a postgraduate who regrets the decision to rush into the course she chose: a masters in legal and political theory at UCL.</p> <p>\"If they are unsure, I would also advise them to maybe defer entry and spend the year saving up and perhaps working in their chosen area to see what it is like. A year is really not a very long time to wait. Like a lot of graduates, I didn't have a clue what to do after my degree and decided to take the masters because I thought it would put me a step ahead of the competition.</p> <p>\"I'm very proud of my MA, but with hindsight, I wish I had not been so hasty as I don't think it has helped me very much with gaining employment. Most employers assume that I am over-qualified, and I haven't been able to use any of what I learned in my work.\"</p> <p>Apart from the necessity of having a definite idea of where the course might take you, the other thing that needs to be taken into account is whether you can sustain the level of interest in the subject. \"I feel that if people did the course as a stop-gap because they couldn't find a job, or for any similar reason, then they might struggle and be overwhelmed by the volume and frequency of work,\" adds Stephanie Dale, whose experience following her own quick decision (see below) was much more positive.</p> <p>\"If people are thinking about taking a course at short notice, then they should definitely have an interest in the subject. Not necessarily any in depth knowledge, but the most important factor and motivator is your own interest. A postgraduate course is a lot of hard work and is almost like a full-time job. You end up spending 40 hours a week studying just to get by. I'd advise people only to do it if they're motivated and interested.\"</p> <p>Thanks to Milkround Online for asking some of its postgraduates to share their experiences</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:dwill.dwill@virgin.net\">dwill.dwill@virgin.net</a></p> <p><strong>Why another degree was worth the extra year</strong></p> <p><strong>Stephanie Dale (25) did a first degree in finance and management science at Keele University and then got a temporary job working in accounts. In August 2001 she began looking around for a postgraduate IT course and started one at Keele University the following month.</strong></p> <p>\"I remember my family being a bit dubious about my decision to leave my job, as it had by then become permanent and had some good prospects. However, I knew that I wouldn't be happy if I stayed and it was all very exciting to be going back to university once again.</p> <p>\"So the year passed. At the end, I came out with an MSc with distinction and many more experiences that I'd missed the first time that I'd been to university. The job hunting was as hard as ever, so I ended up temping again, this time for nine months. It was only an admin job, but I was able to use my IT to get extra responsibility.</p> <p>\"This got me noticed, not only by the bosses but also people from companies that visited. One outside contact asked for my CV, which in turn led to my current job as an IT engineer within a Swiss company. I definitely feel that I made the right decision by going back.</p> <p>\"Having a postgraduate qualification undoubtedly got my CV noticed in a lot more places, and by a lot more influential people. However, without the experience I had gained and the contacts I'd made, it still would have been hard to get a foot in the door, even with this qualification.\"</p> <p><strong>Anthony Sharot (25) graduated with a BEng in electronics from Brunel University and then decided at the last minute to stay on and do an MA in psychoanalytic studies</strong></p> <p>\"I wasn't half as nervous about this decision as my parents were. You see, I had a great engineering job lined up after my first degree, but I suddenly realised I didn't want to move from London. Not knowing what to do next, I frantically searched for an alternative. I wanted to study something completely different, both to balance my technical background and to play for time while I investigated other opportunities.</p> <p>\"Many MAs require a first degree in a similar field so I was delighted to find a course that would accept me. I bluffed my way through the interview not knowing the first thing about psychoanalysis. I couldn't even spell it!</p> <p>\"But my enthusiasm compensated for my ignorance. It was an impulsive move. It is also possibly the best decision I've made. My communication skills were transformed, and for the first time in my life I can write long essays and articles with confidence. </p> <p>\"After I finished, I worked in a local recruitment firm for a couple of months. I enjoyed it, and am currently weighing up job offers from half a dozen of London's most successful recruitment consultancies. Soon, I hope to be one of the most successful engineering recruitment consultants in London. Any regrets? Not a chance.\"</p>",

The children have started a new school year, and their parents are beginning a new work year. It's a fresh term; the transition from the holiday to the work season is upon us. And every year there is the same cancerous question: why is the acceleration in tempo and pressure as we leave those restorative holidays behind not a source of well-being and happiness? There must surely be ways of marrying work and life that are more accommodating to our humanity. Are holidays really the only time when we can find time for living at a human pace? </p> <p>The quest for happiness is starting to preoccupy the national conversation more and more. The work-life balance movement, at first derided as the obsession of New Labour ministers and some trendy employers, is coming of age; more and more companies want to offer their workforces some autonomy over how they use their time and are finding that if they don't, they lose their best and brightest. Workers will go on strike to insist that they have more control over their time. A new generation of economists is inquiring into whether the century-long assumption of economics - that economic man and woman have an inbuilt motivation to want more profit, more wages and more material goods and that monetary motivation is always a reliable compass to action - is still correct. If money doesn't reliably make us happy, then economics had better remodel how it conceives of human behaviour. We might be less self-interested; maybe even concerned about our happiness in the round. And then what happens to the profit motive? </p> <p>A growing number of men and women in mid-career seem ready to abandon the prospect of material wealth for a downsized life in which they are in control of how they spend their time. The interest in alternative medicine, therapies and diets mushrooms; pharmaceutical companies offer us lifestyle drugs that keep depression at bay. We want well-being. And now comes a rash of books from some accomplished journalist/commentators (Tom Hodgkinson, Carl Honore and Pat Kane), all of whom seem to be practising what they preach (damn them), urging us variously to take play seriously, to go slower and to celebrate idleness. </p> <p>On top there is an American academic - Joseph Nye - arguing that how the west lives can be a source of compelling \"soft power\" to the rest of the world, persuading it voluntarily that because it wants to be like us it will be readier to do our bidding; and a British academic (Michael Marmot), who shows how good health, an essential component of happiness, is crucially determined by the higher your standing in the organisation for which you work and society at large, rather than the amount of money you earn. Taken as a whole, these books at the very least suggest that something is going on. </p> <p>If Nye is right, could the idler (Hodgkinson), the player (Kane) and the slowcoach (Honore) offer a better response to terrorism than shocking and awing cowed Muslim populations? Their preoccupation, freely expressed in a typical western society, is how to live well free from the injunctions of the state, church or social compulsions - more appealing that we might guess to populations in thrall to the unrelenting rhythms of religion. Of the three invocations to live differently, Kane's is the most arresting, with its appeal to celebration of a play ethic; Hodgkinson and Honore are treading well-worn paths in their appeal to be idle and slow respectively, although they do it well. Hodgkinson, in particular, glories in reminding us that idleness has a long tradition. But taking play seriously? Kane is certainly on to something fresh and insightful. </p> <p>He rebels against the notion that purpose can be achieved only by the disciplines of work, and against those who argue that work is what gives meaning to our lives because it is via work that we act on the world, via work that we interact socially and via work that we achieve status. He chides the Calvinistic Gordon Brown for his view that work is the salve for every economic and social problem. For Kane the point of life is not to work and be a worker; it is to play and be a player - and thus be both a better worker and solve that happiness riddle alike. What we want is less work-life balance, more a recognition that the alpha and omega of good living is to know how to play - and to insert the play ethic into everything we do. </p> <p>Play is about imagination, experimentation and being confident enough to take a chance, all in a context in which, because it's a game, nothing vital attaches to the outcome; and if we start with the notion that we are \"players\" and that the world will not come to an end if what we plan doesn't come off, there is much more chance of living edgily, of finding time, of building rewarding relationships and of being genuinely creative in how we live and work. </p> <p>Kane argues that our language subliminally recognises the role of play: we talk about putting an idea or concept in play; a company that is the object of takeover speculation is \"in play\"; a politician on the up is a \"player\". Yet we never stop to think about why we use play in contexts that the wider work ethic would insist are the ultimate in seriousness. Kane insists that the language is pointing us in the right direction, if only we recognised it. Of course all the world's a stage, and we are merely players with our exits and entrances; the trick is to lighten up and recognise that all aspects of life are more about gaming than working. There's fun to be had in taking over a company or challenging for the leadership of a political party - and once you locate what you are doing in those terms you are readier to experiment with the unexpected or devise a winning stratagem. Moreover, our language - talking about play and players - recognises that this is what is going on. </p> <p>It's a nice thesis, except that Kane doesn't know whether he is inventing a universal theory of life or merely saying play is valuable, even for those in work. He is not sure whether he wants us just to play at everything, or that to play is a better way of achieving the outcomes that we normally look to work to provide. Every trendy button is pressed, whether the role of hackers in spreading the IT gospel (particularly in Finland) to, inevitably, St Luke's advertising agency - with lots of indulgent meanderings about his own life. It's very easy to get lost. </p> <p>Nor does he recognise the way in which work confers status, and thus wellbeing. Michael Marmot's important study Status Syndrome shows that - in every culture - our happiness and health are closely related to the place we occupy in the status hierarchy, and that that the key to status is our occupation. Happy, healthy, long-lived civil servants don't play more than their peers; they just need to be one rung above them in career grades. Kane, enjoying his status as writer, thinker and provocateur, has lost sight of the fact that what motivates everyone else is just the same - and climbing up an organisation's grades or doing enviable, well-regarded work is fundamental to most people's sense of themselves. Work is where it's ultimately at. None the less you can't read his book without accepting that we all could play more while we do it. </p> <p>The question is whether we could also go slower and find more time for idleness. I found Honore's and Hodgkinson's books not only entertaining, but getting under my skin. Reaching middle life - or even late middle life - with a growing sense that I need to reorder my priorities made me a receptive reader. Honore's hymn to the pleasure of allowing everything its proper time - from eating and cooking to just moving around - is well executed and persuasive; and you learn about a worldwide \"Slow Movement\" that seems to be gaining ground everywhere. There are slow food groups, slow sex therapists (tantrists), slow doctors, slow sports experts - and so it goes on until finally you wonder how you ever could have mixed with all those fasties. </p> <p> I'm not sure, however, whether he concedes sufficiently the pleasures of doing things fast. At one stage he acknowledges wryly how quickly he was driving to make an appointment to enjoy a meal of ritualised slowness in Italy - and reproaches himself. But the paradox is that Honore could never have accumulated the impressive evidence for the case he makes without the whole fast infrastructure of modern life, from the internet to air travel. Like Kane, he falls into the trap of trying to turn an important corrective to too much speed into a philosophy of life. I enjoy the (too few) occasions when I chop vegetables, linger over a meal or just hang out; but I enjoy speed, too. There is pleasure in crossing the Atlantic in a cruise ship; but most of us opt for the 747 not from perversity, but because we value our time. Life is finite. Most of us want to die with a sense of a life well lived rather than the satisfaction that we took our time. That said, there is no doubt that we overdo speed. </p> <p>And we overdo being busy. Tom Hodgkinson, founder of the Idler magazine, takes us on an indulgent (but that's his mission) tour of the satisfactions of being idle. Indeed I was so impressed by his chapter on the virtues of the nap that one sunny lunchtime I headed for the park to fall asleep in the sun - which I did, feeling gloriously guiltless and assertive about it. The directionless ramble; the joy of inhaling cigarette smoke; the pleasure of sleeping in; the anticipation of the first drink of the day - Hodgkinson knows where pleasure is to be found. The more I read, however, the more I felt that he protested too much; that we don't need citations from long-dead poets and scribes to justify napping in the sun. The point about being idle is not to work at it, surely; indeed one of the virtues of work is that it offers us something to be idle from - as well as offering us a sense of purpose. To make idleness our central purpose is to turn it into work - and then even idleness becomes infected by the work ethic. It's all, as with Kane and Honore, about proportion. </p> <p>The debate about idleness, play and speed would strike any one of the billions of workers in the third world who earn no more than a couple of dollars a day as something from another planet - but one none the less to which they aspire. Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government, has built upon one of the themes in an earlier book - The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Superpower Can't Go it Alone - arguing that what he calls \"soft power\" is an indispensable element in contemporary diplomacy. Hard power is the coercive military strength of the 19th century; but it doesn't work in the 21st. Threats come less from competing nation states than from terrorist sub-groups; and most diplomacy these days is about persuading states voluntarily to sign a treaty or join an alliance to help us in some endeavour - to fight terrorism, say - for which they in turn have to win domestic support. And that can best be won, certainly in relations with the less developed world, if their elites and citizens alike want to join the alliance because they like their ally's values and the lifestyles it boasts. Nye cites the BBC World Service as a key element in Britain's soft power; it is a window on a universe that its listeners worldwide respect and want to emulate. </p> <p>Thus, if you agree with Nye's thesis, the other authors under review are not just advocates for seeking wellbeing; they are advertisements for the way the British are trying to live, part of our soft power. Nye is excoriating about the way Bush - and by implication Blair - has undermined the west's soft power in the Middle East by their invasion of Iraq. I know the British Council, for example, feels profoundly compromised by Britain's close association with American foreign policy, and many CEOs of FTSE 100 companies are uneasy about how British companies are seen as American surrogates and fear for their long-term prospects in some key Asian and Middle Eastern markets. Soft power - and the values and lifestyles behind it - may be invisible, but it is nevertheless potent, and we sacrificed a lot of it to make common cause with US neo-conservatives who want to make America feared for its uncontestable military might. </p> <p>But we can relax a little. Kane, Honore and Hodgkinson are doing their small part to help our image and limit the appeal of al-Qaida. It's a far-fetched thesis, but not so far-fetched that it can be rejected out of hand. The happier we are, the better - not just for ourselves, but as a reason to be copied rather than opposed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Will Hutton is chief executive of the Work Foundation.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Scribbling the Cat: Travels With an African Soldier</strong><br> by Alexandra Fuller<br>269pp, Picador, \u00a316.99</p> <p> Look back too much and you are wiped out by the tree in front of you says Alexandra Fuller's dad, but she ignores him and heads full-throttle into the past looking for demons. She missed the tree, but the trip \"bloody nearly killed me\", she tells us afterwards. Dad was right, and not just about Fuller's journey. Too many Zimbabweans see the past as the key to the present and it's nearly killing them as well. </p> <p>For the leftovers of Ian Smith's killing machine who people Fuller's new book, the past is all there is. Yesterday's world had rules of engagement. Remaindered from the Rhodesian war, all they have now is their ghosts inadequately repressed by extreme religion, alcohol, purple pills or a penchant for tearing down bars. Don't believe these guys don't exist. Spot them at the end of a Harare Rhodie bar or even worse stumbling towards you across the terrace of a bush hotel and it's time to grab the bill. </p> <p>I should have stayed to listen. It might have helped me understand where President Mugabe was going when he told me (as British high commissioner), just before pulling up the drawbridge, that the winds of change were irrelevant to Zimbabwe and he would take the country back to its roots and rural strengths. </p> <p>For Mugabe, the past is a comfort zone, full of certainties, free of challenge. That's why he abolished the present and left his enforcers and Henry the Fourth (HIV infection to you) to take care of the generation shift. </p> <p> Scribbling the Cat is a grimmer title than it sounds: \"scribbling\" is a term current among Rhodie veterans for the act of killing. Preferred targets were fighters of the liberation movement (gooks), but nobody (gondie, munt or even honkey) could feel safe in the Rhodesia/Mozambique border country. If the vocabulary (Fuller thoughtfully provides us with a glossary) is disturbing, try telling K, the white African veteran who, when not exchanging atrocities with the enemy, tries to scribble Father Christmas by forcing his beard down the back of his throat. </p> <p>For Fuller, the too-curious feline of the title, these easy pseudonyms reflect the casualness of killing in conflict and the virtual irrelevance of human life to the protagonists. But as the book progresses they increasingly come across as necessary euphemisms for former combatants trying to minimise their guilt and quiet the demons that variously bring them to tears, keep them cursing though their dreams or drive them howling into the bush.</p> <p>\"Don't let the ghosts in Mozambique bite you,\" says one old fighter to another: some hope! Fuller's objective is to get the ghosts talking through those they possess, to make some sense of war and its impact on warriors and ultimately find the answer to the \"splinters in my own psyche\". She carries her own demons from schoolgirl days when she cheered on the troopers and sang the anthems of supremacy. </p> <p>She accordingly asks K to take her on a journey back to the zone and relive his past. It is a high-risk project. Once a silent killer, hard-drinking street fighter and bar brawler of awesome violence, now a born-again Christian with visions and a special line to God, K is Desperate Dan with an attitude. \"Don't blame me if we get scribbled,\" he says. </p> <p>Most everything that could happen on their safari does happen, helped along by corrupt officials, thieves, the local fauna and forces of nature. K's on/off death wish doesn't help. With hindsight it is an ironic journey. Mount Darwin, 80 miles northeast of Harare, had K scribbling like fury in his day. It was an iconic location for Rhodies and rebels. Today it is hard-line Party country where, 22 years after the peace, Border Ghezi, my one-time lunch mate and governor of the province, led the first brutal attacks on commercial farm workers. </p> <p>K and a cast of crazed former hunter-killers give us a dark, often hilarious, ultimately unforgiving moral travelogue with regular sorties into politics, race and the like, but always returning to war and the perpetrator. For Fuller's chums, it's to do with self-justification and legitimacy. \"We didn't choose war, war chose us,\" rationalises one former fighter. \"No one would choose war deliberately but if it's the hand you're dealt, then... fuck. \" </p> <p>Perhaps tired of the special pleading, she comes off the fence: the war hadn't created K. He was \"what happened when you grew a child from the African soil, taught him an attitude of superiority, persecution and paranoia and then gave him a gun and sent him to war is a world he thought was his to defend\". It's not easy to accept K's casual rationalisations without anger or at least indignation. But reading is one thing: meet the bereaved and the torture victims of present-day Zimbabwe for yourself and wonder at the shoulder-shrugs as the torturers pass themselves off as agents of freedom - don't be surprised if you wonder what it is they have won and what it was that K lost. </p> <p>But the biggest shiver for me comes when K describes the fear he instilled in the psychiatrists checking him out after a particularly awful act of torture against a young Shona girl. \"They were so scared of me,\" he says. \"They knew that if they had been in my position they might have done the same thing. They were so shit scared of being who I was.\" Maybe the demon is with us all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Longworth was British high commissioner to Zimbabwe, 1998 -2001.</p>",
  "<p><strong> From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History of English Newspapers to 1899</strong><br>by Bob Clarke<br> 283pp, Ashgate, \u00a349.95</p> <p> In 1695 there was one of the most important parliamentary botches in British history. Arguing over details, politicians failed to renew the Licensing Act, which had severely regulated printing and publishing. There was an outpouring of newsprint and the sudden swelling of what Daniel Defoe called \"a throng of public writers\". Assertive and unregulated, newspapers proliferated in the early 18th century. Journalism became one of the new professions, sustaining some of the greatest writers of the age: Defoe himself, Fielding, Johnson. </p> <p>Previously, state control had been rigorous. \"News... makes the Multitude too familiar with the actions and Counsels of their Superiors,\" declared Roger L'Estrange, official censor under Charles II and editor of the leading Restoration \"newsbook\". Though the word \"newspaper\" is first recorded in 1670, it is used to describe the London Gazette, a tediously official publication whose only domestic news consisted of royal proclamations. In the 1700s the world of print is transformed. A new character of the modern age is featured in Tatler: the Political Upholsterer, a man so addicted to newspapers, and yet so confused by their contradictory reports, that he ends up in Bedlam. </p> <p>In this buoyant account, Bob Clarke takes us up to the end of the 19th century but is clearly engaged most by the vigour and irregularity of 18th-century journalism. He has spent his hours with the papers he describes and selected what has diverted him. The study is larded with choice samples of 18th-century journalism, unrestrained in its wit and abusiveness by any very certain libel laws. It is illustrated with pages from the papers of the past. There are stories of crimes and body-snatching, long paragraphs of bilious political vituperation, macabrely precise accounts of some of the daily tragedies of life. </p> <p>He gives a good overview of historical developments, too. A series of contests between press and government in the later 18th century, of which the case of John Wilkes was but the most famous, established \"the liberty of the press\" as an ideal and a common phrase. In the 19th century there was the growth of radical and reforming provincial newspapers. One of the most successful of these was the Manchester Guardian, founded in 1821 with the intention of promoting liberal interests. </p> <p>Provincial papers grew into dailies, and in the late 19th century many cities got their own evening papers, cashing in on the development of organised sport. The Victorian public became, as Clarke says, \"saturated with newspapers\". In the 1870s the Isle of Wight, with a population of 66,000, had 10 different titles. </p> <p>By far the most successful newspaper for most of the century was the Times, founded by John Walters in 1785. Under the editorship of Thomas Barnes, from 1817 to 1841, it distilled a new power in the land: middle-class opinion. Under his successor, John Delane, it was selling seven times as many copies as its nearest rival. By the 1850s, the Times was the fourth estate, though by the end of the century it had declined to be one of many rivals. Now the market was changing again: there wereillustrated papers and notably sensationalist Sunday papers. In 1896 Alfred Harmsworth, editor of Bicycling News, launched the Daily Mail. By the end of the century its sales were approaching a million; what we call the popular press had arrived. </p> <p>Yet this book is more like an anthology than a history. Intrigued by the advertisements that kept papers in business from the beginning, for instance, Clarke provides an entertaining selection of the ads most common in the 18th century, those for quack doctors and medicines. From the personal column of the Times in the 19th century, he extracts wonderfully mysterious notices. \"HAMPSTEAD HEATH ENCLOSURE. Look out! The Weasel is not asleep!\" </p> <p>A pity that the book's price destines it only for libraries.

  "<p>In 1492, Christopher Columbus \"discovered\" America. Six years later, a petty Portuguese nobleman called Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached India. These were, as Adam Smith called them, \"the two greatest events recorded in the history of mankind\". They marked the beginning of a great age of exploration and maritime trade, which resulted by the 19th century in complete western domination of the world. </p> <p>Or so the old story goes, still found in books that describe how the modern world was created by the west, Europe, Britain, even Scotland; how from 1490 onwards, brave and resourceful Europeans ventured out into the great unknown, and showed isolated and backward natives everywhere the benefits of free trade, science, technology, and democracy. </p> <p>Asia usually appears in such accounts as the passive beneficiary of some irrepressibly dynamic and uniquely gifted white people. But as the ambitious new exhibition at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Encounters: The Meeting of Asia and Europe 1500-1800, makes clear, Europeans were latecomers in the network of global trade and communications established by Arabs, Persians, Indians and the Chinese. While much of Europe lay torpid in the Dark Ages, Buddhism and Islam were travelling East through the Silk Route, and Arab, African and Indian merchants were crisscrossing the Indian ocean and the China seas. </p> <p>Much before the 1490s, Arab and Persian sailors had gone up the west coast of Africa and into the Mediterranean. A Chinese sailor sailed up the east coast of Africa in the early 15th century. In fact, Vasco da Gama had dared to aim as far as the East Indies mostly because of navigational technologies developed in China and the Islamic Middle East and then diffused across Europe; and it was an Indian Muslim sailor who led Vasco da Gama to India after the latter had lost his way and ended up in east Africa. </p> <p>Columbus, Vasco da Gama and their European successors come across in contemporary accounts and their own writings as cruel, even slightly deranged. Fortunately, the capacity for murder and pillage they displayed in the Americas was limited in Asia. In India, and then China and Japan, the buccaneers, missionaries, sailors, soldiers and diplomats of Europe faced rich and sophisticated states and societies, which wanted little from them and confined them to white ghettos on the coast. </p> <p>The world economy then was dominated by the luxury goods - silk, ceramics, spices - produced by Asia. Not surprisingly, Vasco da Gama provoked derisive laughter in India when he produced the gifts he had brought from Europe. The British and Dutch traders who successfully undermined their Portuguese rivals in Asia by the 17th century only entered Asian trade with the help of gold and silver extracted from Europe's American colonies. </p> <p>Personal contacts with Asian peoples were achieved fitfully by missionaries, mostly Jesuits, men of the Counter-Reformation hoping to make up in Asia for Catholic losses in Europe. The Jesuits also introduced Asians to western advances in cartography, astronomy and clockmaking. But the story of the Jesuit mission in Asia is largely one of naive hopes and disappointment. </p> <p>With an early agricultural and industrial revolution, and three path-breaking inventions (printing, gunpowder, and the compass) in its past, China was then a great economic and scientific power, if serenely self-absorbed. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci managed to get to know the country better than any European before him while trying to figure out why it was indifferent to Christianity. </p> <p>But for most Europeans who knew of China or Asia at all they were no more than the source of exotic furnishing, porcelain, cotton, silks and wallpaper. The V&amp;A exhibition displays many of these objects of European desire as well as the western forms of art and technology - clocks, guns, maps, lenses - adopted by Asians during the 300 years when economic and cultural globalisation wasn't the overwhelming phenomenon it later became under the aegis of European imperialism. In their introduction to the exhibition's catalogue, the curators claim that the \"boundaries between different cultures\" weren't fixed; and that until 1800 they were marked by \"fluidity and hybridity\". </p> <p>The concepts of fluidity and hybridity are much cherished today in our globalised, multicultural societies; and the V&amp;A has done well to attempt a contemporary spin on the early encounters of Asia and Europe. But, as with present-day globalisation, it is hard to marvel at the free flow and consumption of diverse commodities and artefacts without wondering whether they advanced understanding and sympathy across nations and cultures at the same time. </p> <p>The evidence from the past is only partly encouraging. The few Asians who met Europeans tended to treat them pompously and arrogantly, and they remained largely ignorant of Europe until they began to feel its new power. Steven Parissien notes correctly in the catalogue that \"the Asians responsible for the exotic imports remained an unknown quantity to most in the West, their homelands far-away countries about which most Europeans preferred to know nothing\". Dr Johnson described all Asiatics as \"barbarians\", and conceded only, when pressed by Boswell, that the Chinese were not bad at pottery. Visiting China in 1792 on a diplomatic mission, Lord Macartney observed that the British expatriates in Canton mixed rarely with the Chinese; they may have sympathised with Philip Larkin, who wanted to visit China only if he could return the same day. </p> <p>Lord Macartney also saw that China had grown militarily weak; and in the mid-19th century, the British called China's bluff. They had Indian opium to sell and found that they could bully the Chinese into buying it. Much of their confidence was due to unexpected success in India, where as the over-extended Moghul empire imploded in the 18th century, a vast subcontinent lay open to a multitude of warlords, both Indian and foreign. Swift British victories in India stoked imperial greed across western Europe. China was one of its victims, with Britain, France, Russia, and even Germany tormenting in turn and often together the once-invincible Middle Kingdom. </p> <p>By 1800, the east, with its great declining empires (Ottoman, Moghul, Qing), no longer appeared very mysterious or admirable to the British. In 1783, while accusing the British East India Company of ruining Indian society and economy, Edmund Burke had dealt impatiently with the suggestion that Indians were an uncivilised people. He asserted that Indians were \"people for ages civilised and cultivated - cultivated by all the arts of polished life, whilst we were yet in the woods\". Such regard for non-European cultures became rare in the 19th century, when mass industrial production and technologically advanced armaments made Britain the supreme military and economic power in the world, and led it to easy conquests in Asia and Africa. </p> <p>Lord Macaulay thought that Indian learning was mostly worthless, and even John Stuart Mill assumed that Indians had to first grow up under British tutelage before they could accept the good things - democracy, economic freedom, science - that the west had to offer them. </p> <p>This liberal paternalism rarely became as obsessive as the later rhetoric of the New Imperialism, which George Orwell described as \"a sort of forcible evangelising\" (\"You turn a Gatling gun on a mob of unarmed natives and then you establish 'The Law' which includes roads, railways and a court-house\"). The \"white man's burden\" - creating law and order, promoting the superior civilisation of the west - grew heavy only later in the 19th century. But then it was, as Orwell noted, always borne by the black and brown man. </p> <p>It was especially heavy in the slave colonies of the New World that helped fuel the industrial revolution in England. It grew onerous in India as the East India Company acquired control over the eastern provinces of Bengal and Bihar, and as extortionate British demands for revenue forced Indian landholders and peasants into debt and destitution. Ironically, as the British historian Percival Spear wrote, \"the days of corrupt Company officials, of ill-gotten fortunes, of oppression\" were \"also the days when Englishmen were interested in Indian culture, wrote Persian verses, and foregathered with Pandits and Maulvis and Nawabs on terms of social equality and personal friendship\". Such British officials as William Jones and Warren Hastings enquired into Indian religions, laws, customs, literature and art, inaugurating a British tradition of scholarship that was weakened considerably in the 19th century by men who shared Lord Macaulay's views of Indian learning. </p> <p>There were few white women in India; and, faced with prolonged celibacy, European expatriates had often acquired Indian wives and mistresses. A few British men continued to go native in this fashion even in the 19th century, when large numbers of eligible British women had begun to arrive in India, and the British in the coastal towns of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were already living racially sequestered lives. David Ochterlony, the British Resident in Delhi, went parading around the city every evening with each one of his 13 concubines on a separate elephant. Men like him, busy expediting British rule over India, were probably happy to escape the drab ghettos of the coastal towns, and to act out sexual fantasies which the envious bores at the church and the club would have denounced as Oriental decadence. </p> <p>But these \"Nabobs\" still differed from previous foreign ruling elites in India, such as the Muslims from Persia and Central Asia, who had blended into the general population, and fashioned gradually a distinctive Indo-Islamic civilisation, of which the Taj Mahal, Urdu poetry, and North Indian dress and cuisine are the more conspicuous examples. Most of the Nabobs hoped to make their fortune quickly, before the onset of tropical disease, and then return to Britain. </p> <p>No Taj Mahal was ever likely to emerge out of the Indo-British encounter. The hybrid art and architecture produced by it remained resolutely minor, occasionally rising to the pleasing kitsch of the Brighton Pavilion and Company School paintings. This was also the trend wherever Asians and Europeans worked together. Few of the objects built to appease European taste in Oriental luxuries, or the Asian artworks inspired by fantasies of Europe, match the glories of Renaissance Europe, Ming China and Moghul India. </p> <p>Ideas were more fruitfully exchanged, most importantly in the realms of military technology, law, administration and nation-building, with consequences that are still working themselves out. Cultural assimilation, as it is known today, was rare on either side. Few Asians wished, or managed, to travel to Europe. And understanding Oriental cultures seemed to have grown harder for many Europeans arriving in the east three centuries after Matteo Ricci. </p> <p>TE Lawrence, who went famously native in Arabia, confessed to being brought close to madness by his efforts \"to live in the dress of Arabs, and imitate their mental foundation\". They deprived him, he wrote, of his \"English self\" without helping him turn his \"Arab skin\" into anything more than an \"affectation\". </p> <p>It is not surprising that all the detailed and precise western knowledge about the East - the travel books, missionary accounts, administrators' gazettes - did not much help Lawrence in what was, essentially, an effort at empathy. Ruskin had despaired in the middle of the great age of British expansion and exploration: \"If only we English, who are so fond of travelling in body, would also travel a little in the soul!\" </p> <p>But then to explore the soul was not easy for the selfless and honest men serving the impersonal bureaucracy of empire, such as TE Lawrence, who managed to persuade himself that, as a British secret agent, he was bringing political independence to Arabs, only to realise later that he had been part of an imperial effort to secure the \"corn and rice and oil of Mesopotamia\". </p> <p>The white man's burden was always more trouble than it was worth - as was proved again recently by the Anglo-American misadventure in Mesopotamia. But men conscious of this burden would change the world for ever, subjecting its great diversity to their own singular outlook, and reducing in the process potentially rich encounters with other peoples and countries to monologues about the unassailable superiority of modern western politics, economy, and culture. </p> <p>They rarely noticed that western efforts, however sincere or altruistic, to modernise supposedly backward Asians incited more resentment than admiration or gratitude. Expelled from their old social and political order, and denied dignity in a west-dominated world, aggrieved natives wanted to beat the west at its own game. The Chinese intellectual in Andr\u00e9 Malraux's prescient novel The Temptation of the West (1926) says, \"Europe thinks she has conquered all these young men who now wear her garments. But they hate her. They are waiting for what the common people call her 'secrets'.\" </p> <p>Japan was the first to imitate western techniques, and aim at world domination. Modernising China now poses a formidable challenge to the west - more calibrated than the one presented by radical Islamists. Observing a humiliated country in 1889, Kipling had wondered: \"What will happen when China really wakes up, runs a line from Shanghai to Lhasa, and controls her own gun factories and arsenals?\" This old anxiety now has a strong basis as an aggressively nationalistic China rises swiftly, the words once used to dismiss its potential - \"insular\" and \"arrogant\" - are applied to its rival, the United States, and, with India waiting in the wings, the dominance of the west begins to appear yet another phase in the long history of empires and civilisations. </p> <p>Looking back at the journeys of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama, Adam Smith had written, \"What benefits, or what misfortunes to mankind may hereafter result from these great events, no human wisdom can foresee.\" The books that tell us \"How the west/Europe/Britain/ made the Modern World\" seem to imply that we know better now. Perhaps, it is time to congratulate ourselves, or at least to celebrate what the catalogue of the forthcoming V&amp;A exhibition calls a \"dynamic period of commercial, artistic, and technological exchange\". Certainly, the evidence for this would be compelling when the exhibition opens next week, even if the mute, obdurate beauty of lacquer and porcelain cannot express the melancholy truth that, as Walter Benjamin once put it, \"there is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism\". </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong>Pankaj Mishra's An End to Suffering: The Buddha in the World will be published by Picador in October.

  "<p><strong> A Tale of Love and Darkness</strong> <br>by Amos Oz <br>448pp, Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a316.99</p> <p>Some time in the night between Saturday and Sunday the fifth and sixth of January, 1952, Amos Oz's mother ended her life in her sister's flat on Ben Yehuda Street in Tel Aviv, overdosing on medication prescribed to treat her depression. In the newspapers, a debate was raging about whether Israel should demand and accept reparations from Germany. The pragmatic left thought that Germany should pay the cost that Israel would have to bear to absorb the survivors, while the right declared it was immoral to sell absolution in exchange for tainted lucre. A couple of years later, Oz, by then 15, broke with his right-wing father and went, by himself, to live on a kibbutz. </p> <p>Oz's memoir, A Tale of Love and Darkness, thought to be the biggest-selling literary work in Israeli history, is an exploration of why his mother killed herself, and the effect on him, a sensitive, intelligent boy growing up in Jerusalem during the last years of the British mandate and the war of independence. It is one of the funniest, most tragic and most touching books I have ever read. I am a great admirer of Oz as a novelist, of his spare, quiet portraits of intimacy between couples, but here, in this long book, he reveals a huge talent for the big narrative picture, for Dickensian character portraits and an expert fusion of history and personal life. </p> <p>From the outset the family bears down on you. His father, Ariyeh Klausner, the thwarted academic in a land stuffed with the over-qualified - \"a sort of rootless, short-sighted intellectual with two left hands\". His grandfather, the follower of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the revisionist founding father of today's right-wing Israeli politics: \"He was a nationalist, patriot, a lover of armies, victories and conquest, a passion-ate, innocent minded-hawk... He had a weakness for everything grand, powerful and gleaming - military uniforms, brass bugles, banners and lances glinting in the sun, royal palaces and coats of arms. He was a child of the 19th century, even if he did live long enough to see three-quarters of the 20th century.\" </p> <p>Here, too, is the neighbour hood, obsessed with germs: \"You never actually managed to set eyes on an anti-semite or a germ, but you knew very well they were lying in wait for you on every side, out of sight.\" The city, Jerusalem, where people schlepped along the streets: \"If we picked up our foot someone else might come along and snatch our little strip of land. On the other hand, once you have lifted your foot, do not be in a hurry to put it down again... time and time again we have fallen into the hands of our enemies because we put our foot down without looking where we were putting them.\" Tel Aviv, spoken of almost confidentially, \"as though the city were some kind of crucial secret project of the Jewish people\", the sea \"full of bronzed Jews who could swim... Who had ever heard of swimming Jews?\" </p> <p>His mother, Fania Mussman, told him stories peopled by giants, witches, fairies, tales that came from places where there were forests. Long after her death, her sister told Oz the whole story: of the grandfather who was both mill owner and communist, whose motto was: \"Justice without compassion isn't justice, it's an abattoir.\" She evoked the atmosphere of fear as the girls were growing up in Rovno, a town passed back and forth between conquering armies, fear not of Germans but of anti-semitic nationalism. \"It may be a little hard for you to understand,\" his aunt told him, \"but in those days all the Poles were drunk on Polishness, the Ukrainians were all drunk on Ukrainianness, not to mention the Germans, the Czechs, all of them... and there was no place for us at that carnival, we didn't belong and weren't wanted. Small wonder that we wanted to be a nation, like the rest of them. What alternative had they left us?\" </p> <p>Driven from Rovno, where Polish universities had strict quotas of Jews, Fania went to Prague university until she was driven out of there as well by anti-semitism. She arrived in Palestine in the nick of time and married Klausner, a sensitive, poetic, olive-skinned girl hitched to a right-wing pedant. Growing up, Amos, who had not yet broken with his father and changed his surname, wanted to be not a writer, who, he observed, \"could be killed like ants\", but a book, because however much you try to annihilate a book, there is always a chance that a copy would survive in some out-of-the-way library. </p> <p>As he grows up, the world outside the lower-middle class neighbourhood of down-at-heel intellectuals opens up to reveal another population: Jerusalem's middle-class Arabs. Taken to a tea party in the home of a post office employee in honour of the British post-master general, he goes into the garden and tries to impress a little girl, puffed up with a sense of responsibility as a representative of the Jewish people and of Zionism. Excited and already a little in love, when she dares him to climb a mulberry tree he instantly transforms himself from Jabotinsky to Tarzan, from weedy yeshiva bocher to muscular Judaism, \"the resplendent new Hebrew youth at the height of his powers... a lion among lions\"; he finds an iron ball and chain at the top of the tree, whirls it round his head like a lasso, loses control over it, so that it lands with a bloody crash on the foot of her little brother, who is toddling after a butterfly, \"and everything was silent all around you in an instant as though you had been shut up inside an iceberg\". </p> <p>He evokes the utter silence in the neighbourhood as they gather at midnight to listen on the radio to the result of the UN vote that would partition Palestine to create a Jewish state, the child feeling with his hand the tears on his father's face. The horrors of the 1948 war, the siege of Jerusalem - a boy playing in the street shot dead by a Jordanian sniper. His mother's deteriorating mental state. A farcical encounter with Menachim Begin. The boy's loss of his virginity on the kibbutz and the painful encounter 40 years later with the woman who seduced him. The dogged ambition to understand why his mother took her life. </p> <p>It was reading Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio that showed Oz how he could be a writer, by writing exactly what he knew: \"a dreary tangle of sadness and pretence, of longing, absurdity, inferiority and provincial pomposity, sentimental education and anachronistic ideals, repressed traumas, resignation and helplessness. Helplessness of the acerbic, domestic variety, where small-time liars pretended to be dangerous terrorists and heroic freedom fighters, where unhappy bookbinders invented formals for universal salvation.\" </p> <p>No agreement is possible about the history of this conflict. There is no objective truth, however much Zionists and anti-colonialists wrangle. The Palestinian writer Samir el-Youssef has remarked on the new genre that is emerging in Palestinian literature: memoir. The subjective truths of the participants are the real story of this long war between Jews and Arabs. The generation that escaped to Palestine in the 1930s were neither one thing nor another; the precursors of the idea of being Europeans, driven out of Europe by nationalism and racism, they arrived in the middle of a project to squeeze the ghetto of the Jewish soul. Everything they brought with them, the memories of forests and old cities, the polyglot soul, withered in the Middle Eastern heat, like the plants in the garden the Klausners tried to grow. Haunted by genocide that had claimed their own parents or brothers and sisters, they paid no attention to the population already there. They had enough to contend with, without that additional burden. </p> <p>It was their children who founded Peace Now, who produced the New Historians, questioning every Zionist assumption. Yet the war between the generations always gives way, in middle age, to curiosity and compassion for the dead. Oz's book is a testament to a family, a time and a place.

He delights in a kind of pared down metamorphosis, in taking an everyday event - cooking, going to the cinema, moving house - and, through sleight of image or colloquial phrase, trying to throw our complacency and assumptions to one side. His writing aspires to the tradition of George Herbert or Henry Vaughan, the kind of poetry that imbues the everyday, the tarnished and burnished, with the possibilities of the transcendent. </p> <p>And sometimes his own work approaches this. Take \"A Jar of Honey\", one of the most successful pieces here. The poem is full of a restrained, almost puritan sensuality, relishing, at the same time as it underplays, its capacity to transform. Here's the first stanza: </p> <p>&#xa0;\"You hold it like a lit bulb, </p> <p>&#xa0;a pound of light, </p> <p>&#xa0;and swivel the stunned glow </p> <p>&#xa0;around the fat glass sides...\" </p> <p>The otherness of the honey is evoked, significantly, by comparison with two everyday objects - a lit bulb and a pound of, let's say, sugar. Herbert or Vaughan would bring in the everyday, the colloquial, to make concrete a religious experience (\"I saw eternity the other night\") whereas Polley calls upon the ordinary to recast the ordinary. It is a kind of secular transubstantiation. That word \"stunned\" knowingly carries the effect of those first two lines. In the second and final stanza the process continues: </p> <p>&#xa0;\"it's the sun, all flesh and no bones </p> <p>&#xa0;but for the floating knuckle </p> <p>&#xa0;of honeycomb </p> <p>&#xa0;attesting to the nature of the struggle.\"</p> <p>The metamorphosis of honey into sun lets in a whole range of religious echoes but Polley undercuts this immediately with another everyday metaphor, the punch of that \"floating knuckle\". There is aggression and danger, a physical bluntness running throughout and this builds to the slightly contentious final line (\"attesting to the nature of the struggle\"). As in many of the poems in this collection, Polley tries to end with a language that hints at greater breadths and perspectives. The sense of \"the nature of the struggle\" and the struggle of nature have already been achieved and this line is perhaps a little needless. But its use is interesting in the context of the book as a whole. </p> <p>The act of creation, of writing, is continually perceived as a struggle in itself, something that takes place against the odds in a pared down, difficult, even malevolent context. Polley was born in 1975 and part of the interest of this book is to watch a young poet trying to break away from those writers who have inspired him. Heaney, Hughes and at times Muldoon and Lowell are all strong presences in this volume and time and again we see Polley attempting to find a way of articulating his own experience and background through their example. </p> <p>Take the poem \"Smoke\": the piece is a description of the domestic ritual of his father lighting an old stove: \"My father kept a stove / with dogs legs / on a pink hearthstone\". From the start it evokes Heaney's \"Follower\": \"My father worked with a horse-plough / His shoulders globed like a full sail...\" Both pieces are about the process of articulating and trying to break free from influence and both pieces end by drawing out the symbolic implications of their descriptions. Heaney, perhaps rather melodramatically, transforms the father from the followed to the follower; Polley attempts something more complex and ambitious. The image of a bird burnt in the flue of the stove becomes a metaphor for the young poet waiting to be born.</p> <p>Once again Polley's sense of the miraculous is imbued with violence and danger - the act of creation is a struggle, a risky and difficult venture. But, although it reaches beyond the poem that inspired it, \"Smoke\" is, in the end, nowhere near as achieved as Heaney's \"Follower\". It feels slightly clumsy and leaden, it doesn't have the ease and adeptness of the latter. In this, as in several poems, Polley hasn't been able to transcend his literary models. </p> <p> The Brink is by no means a first collection that changes the poetic landscape; it doesn't have the range, impact and facility say of Hughes's The Hawk in the Rain, Heaney's Death of a Naturalist or Armitage's Zoom - those writers Polley is seeking to define himself through and against. But there is a certain cutback virtue throughout, a belief in a restrained language and the transforming possibilities of description and metaphor. To end, here is an excellent, almost apocalyptic portrayal of the communal wonderment of cinema that suggests the struggle can indeed be worthwhile: </p> <p>&#xa0;\"then sneak a look at the rows behind </p> <p>&#xa0;as the curtains skate apart and strangers </p> <p>&#xa0;catch the brightness of this idea </p> <p>&#xa0;full in the face, their mouths blown open </p> <p>&#xa0;and eyes given up...\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Charles Bainbridge works at the Poetry Library on London's South Bank.</p>",
  "<p>In July 1924, the Borges family returned to Buenos Aires after a year in Europe. Now 24, Jorge Luis (\"Georgie\") had been writing poetry since his teenage years. In Spain, he had been influenced by a group of avant-garde poets known as \"El Ultra\", and aimed to bring their movement to Argentina. In October he read James Joyce's Ulysses, published in Paris the year before. He wrote a review, exulting in being, as he put it, \"the first Hispanic adventurer to have arrived at Joyce's book\". Joyce was a kindred spirit who had done for the Irish what Borges had himself, as yet vaguely, envisaged doing for the Argentines.</p> <p>At the same time, he was becoming fascinated by a 17-year-old writer, Norah Lange. On October 26 he told his friend Guillermo de Torre that he was thinking of translating a passage from Ulysses, and in the same letter referred no fewer than three times to Norah. A month or two earlier, he had undertaken to help her with the publication of her first book of poems, La calle de la tarde (Evening Street). He negotiated a price with Samet, the publisher, arranged for it to be reviewed and for a selection of the poems to be published in Martin Fierro magazine, together with his prologue, where he praised Lange in a high-flown lyrical style - she was \"illustrious for the double brilliance of her hair and her haughty youth\"; she was \"light and haughty and fervent, like a banner unfurling in the breeze\".</p> <p>A good part of Lange's attraction lay in the exoticism of her family background. Her father, Gunnar Lange, was Norwegian, while her mother, Berta Erfjord, though Argentine born, was the daughter of a Norwegian and an Irishwoman. Norah, the fourth of six children, was born on October 23 1906 and grew up in the suburbs of Buenos Aires in a cultured, liberal, multilingual environment.</p> <p>A particularly striking attribute of Norah Lange's was her mane of red hair, an exotic attribute in a Latin country and one associated in the Hispanic world with devilment and mischief. She grew up the tomboy of the family, notorious for her escapades and practical jokes - her favourite turn in early adolescence was to put on a poncho and a broad-brimmed hat and climb up on the roof, from where she shocked the neighbours by shouting out an incomprehensible stream of words in various languages, punctuated with insults and shrieks of laughter. Yet despite this apparently extroverted personality, Lange would remain something of an enigma to herself, and this inner mystery was to be the source of her creativity.</p> <p>Borges was extraordinarily susceptible to the romantic aura of men of action, and Lange's attachment to the memory of her father, a noted explorer who died when she was still a child, undoubtedly added to her mystique. In addition, the Langes were related to the distinguished Norwegian novelist and playwright Alexander Kielland and this meant that Norah, like Borges, could boast writers as well as heroes among her forebears. To cap it all, the two families were related by marriage, Norah's aunt being the wife of Borges's uncle Frank, a connection that made Norah and Georgie primos, or cousins, in the Hispanic tradition.</p> <p>Norah's, then, was a complex allure: her red hair spoke of passion, but her pale, Scandinavian looks called to mind the purity of an angel, and it was this tantalising blend of innocence and fire that she captured in dreamy poems charged with erotic anticipation. Her poems, moreover, depicted a landscape not dissimilar to Borges's, a favourite topic being the sun setting over the barrios bordering the pampas.</p> <p>In October 1924, at around the time Lange published La calle de la tarde, she began to invite Borges and a select group of friends every Saturday evening to a party at her house. There they would recite their work, discuss literary and other matters and dance to tangos played on the piano. These parties soon became the highlight of Lange's week: she would write that on Saturdays \"the evening is suddenly lit up\" by the presence of Georgie and his friends. And so it was, too, for Borges, for these parties would convert the house on calle Tronador into the inner sanctum of his literary group.</p> <p>In Lange, Borges believed he might have found a source of inspiration that would inject new energy into his writing. In January 1925 he published his own version of the last page of Ulysses - Molly Bloom's famous, erotic soliloquy - the first translation of James Joyce into Spanish. By the middle of the following year, Borges's relations with Norah Lange had reached an unprecedented intimacy. One of her poems of this period suggests an encounter that was as much erotic as emotional - she describes herself going to her lover like dew to a freshly opened rose; her heart aches with bliss as she anticipates the feast that awaits her in his lips; she can imagine him within her, plain as the moon in the silence of the night.</p> <p>This sense of communion in love was to exert a powerful influence on Borges's literary ideas. In June 1926 he published \"A Profession of Literary Faith\", in which he likened the transaction between an author and a reader to \"a confidence\" whose basis lay in \"the trust of the listener and the veracity of the speaker\". Writing was \"the full confession of a self, of a character, of a human adventure,\" and, correspondingly, readers had \"a lust for souls, for destinies, for idiosyncrasies\", a lust so sure of what it sought that if fictional lives did not satisfy it, it would \"lovingly probe the life of the author\". He conceded that the \"autobiographical substance\" of a work might be hidden at times under the \"accidents\" that embodied it, but it was present all the same, \"like a heart beating in the depths\". Writing was both creation and discovery, for an author remained open to a mysterious power that would reveal to him the essence of the self and its relation to the world.</p> <p>As far as Borges was concerned, the personification of that guiding power was Lange: it was she who had inspired his ultra-confessional poetics of the heart, and she who, he hoped, would bring to a harmonious fruition all the various elements that existed in contradiction and disarray in his conception of himself.</p> <p>On November 6 Borges accompanied Lange to a luncheon party at the restaurant by the Boating Lake in Palermo Park. The party was being held in honor of Ricardo G\u00fciraldes whose gaucho novel, Don Segundo Sombra, had been published to huge acclaim earlier that year. In a photograph later published in Martin Fierro, Norah Lange appears fresh-faced and dreamy, gazing upward, head to one side, as if lost in a girlish reverie; next to her is Georgie, wearing a faintly wry smile that gives him an air of relaxed, proprietorial satisfaction.</p> <p>At this time Norah Lange was known as a published poet and a literary protege of Borges, but her contact with other writers outside Borges's own circle had been very limited. It was at the party in Palermo Park that Borges introduced Lange to his chief literary rival, the poet Oliverio Girondo, and she was later to find herself sitting next to him. What struck her about Girondo was his voice - it was dark and resonant, \"like mahogany\" or something \"underground\"; at one point she knocked over a bottle of wine, whereupon Girondo leaned over and said to her, \"Blood will flow between us\". After lunch they danced together and then Girondo took her home. Lange had fallen head over heels for this stranger - \"Oliverio was vital, passionate. I was in love with him from that day on.\"</p> <p>Girondo was not handsome - he had protruding front teeth accentuated by a weak chin that he would mask in later years with a distinctive beard, but his pale complexion set off restless brown eyes; his hair was swept back from a high forehead to fall in wavy locks around his neck. He was very much a man of the world - privately educated in England and France, widely travelled, and currently resident in Paris. Oliverio liked to present himself as a rebel against the straitlaced mores of Argentine society, but he was, in fact, the scion of a powerful landowning family of Basque descent, and for all his bohemian airs he was not averse to reminding people of his kinship with the Arenales and the Uriburus, two of the most illustrious of the great criollo dynasties.</p> <p>To lose Lange to another man would have been disaster enough for Borges, but to lose her to Girondo was a desperate humiliation. His dislike of Girondo had arisen over a disagreement about the avant-garde, but there was also a marked difference in temperament - Borges was withdrawn, mild mannered, tentative; Girondo was a force of nature, brash and energetic, and a compulsive exhibitionist. Class resentment played a part, too. Though of patrician stock, Borges actually came from the urban middle class, whereas Girondo belonged to the ruling elite.</p> <p>Girondo turned up at the Lange house the following Saturday, having been invited by Norah. He was introduced to her mother Se\u00f1ora Lange, and he later claimed to have got on so well with her that they had ended up playing chess together under a table.</p> <p>Lange and Girondo began seeing each other almost every day. As she was to put it in a poem, her lover's voice promised to uncover life's possibilities for her, and as her feelings became more ardent, so did the insistent voice press her for something that she was too frightened to surrender in a society that placed such a premium on a woman's honour. But then Girondo announced that he was leaving Buenos Aires - \"He already had a ticket for Europe in his pocket\", Norah was to tell an interviewer - and on December 4, barely a month after the party at Palermo Park, he embarked for Paris, leaving Lange in a state of the most acute distress. She began writing to him almost daily, and decided to transform her letters into an epistolary novel, Voz de la vida (The Voice of Life), through which she might come to terms with her predicament.</p> <p>\"I suffered so badly my hair fell out,\" Lange recalled. \"For some time I had to wear a little bonnet to cover my head.\" Towards the end of 1927, she decided to go to Norway to spend a year with Ruthy, her sister, who was married and expecting her first child. On November 15, Martin Fierro announced a farewell party for Lange, whose Voz de la vida had just been published. Later that month she departed Buenos Aires on a cargo ship bound for Oslo.</p> <p>Borges's rejection by Norah Lange was to be one of the major reversals in his life. In March 1927, when Girondo was refusing to have anything to do with Lange, Borges had proposed marriage to her, but it seemed that the more Girondo made the girl suffer, all the more did she understand that she could not love Borges. In April she repudiated Borges's love with unexpected cruelty, publishing in Martin Fierro a review of his first two poetry collections, Fervor de Buenos Aires and Moon Across the Way, under the enigmatic title \"Thinking of Jorge Luis Borges in Something That Does Not Quite Manage to Be a Poem\". With a few well-placed qualifications, she distanced herself from the poetry of the man whom she had been happy to acknowledge as her mentor for the past three years.</p> <p>Borges's response to the critical review came just two weeks later, in the form of a brief essay on one of the greatest love poems in the Spanish language, the 21st of Francisco de Quevedo's \"Sonnets to Lisi\" in which the poet declares that his soul and veins and marrow have known the fires of love, and when he dies they will lose their form but not their will: \"Ash they shall become, but ash that shall yet feel, Dust they may be, but dust that loves you still.\"</p> <p>Quevedo's sonnet, according to Borges, was \"a most original argument for immortality\", an argument based on the proposition that \"intensity is the promise of immortality\", and not just any kind of intensity but the intensity of erotic desire. Still, his confidence in salvation had been profoundly shaken and his belief in the possibility of \"immortality\" would become ever more tenuous - in another essay written later that year he would insist that even though the particular feelings or thoughts of a writer might fade with time, his \"individuality\" would \"cling like a root\" to the souls of his readers, allowing his literary personality to survive if only as \"an echo\", \"a handful of shadows\", a mere \"wake in the absence of the word\".</p> <p>Borges had made his profession of literary faith at the very zenith of his love for Norah Lange, when it had seemed to him that the highest goal of poetry was a transparency of communication comparable to that between lovers. In the wake of his rejection, in a public lecture sponsored by the newspaper La Prensa that he gave in September 1927, he gave voice to a visceral mistrust of all language, declaring that it was the Devil - \"that mocking serpent, that inventor of equivocation and adventure, that core of the fruits of chance, that eclipse of an angel\" - who had baptised the things of this world.</p> <p>This outburst came only a few weeks after Lange had broken with him. In a poem called \"To the Doctrine of Passion in Your Voice\", addressed to an unnamed woman, he wrote: \"How to forget your voice of passion,/ when voices that once said 'I love you' have been forgotten,/ and yours holds us in thrall?\"</p> <p>And yet, despite this attitude of resignation, the poet looks toward a future in which it is conceivable that he might regain the woman's love. Borges evidently felt that all was not lost with regard to Lange: it was possible that in the year she planned to spend with her sister in Oslo she might get over her feelings for Girondo and he might then have a chance to win her back. Meanwhile, he had to face life in Buenos Aires without her - a bleak, comfortless prospect and a period in which the whole of his inner world would remain in suspense, waiting for Lange to return, waiting to discover whether he might yet find salvation as a writer or be damned forever to the nothingness of the self.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from Borges: A Life by Edwin Williamson, published by Viking, price \u00a325</p>",
  "<p><strong> Czeslaw Milosz 1911-2004</strong> </p> <p>For quite a while now, those who knew Czeslaw Milosz couldn't help wondering what it was going to be like when he was gone. In the meantime, he more than held his own, writing away for all he was worth in Krak\u00f3w, in his early 90s, in a flat where I'd had the privilege of visiting him twice. On the first occasion he was confined to his bed, too unwell to attend a conference arranged in his honour, and on the second he was ensconced in his living room, face to face with a life-size bronze head and torso of his second wife, Carol. His junior by some 30 years, she had died from a quick and cruel cancer in 2002, and as he sat on one side of the room facing the bronze on the other, the old poet seemed to be viewing it and everything else from another shore. On that occasion he was being ministered to by his daughter-in-law and perhaps it was her hovering attentions as much as his translated appearance that brought to mind the aged Oedipus being minded by daughters in the grove at Colonus, the old king who had arrived where he knew he would die. Colonus was not his birthplace but it was where he had come home to himself, to the world, and to the otherworld; and the same could be said of Milosz in Krak\u00f3w. </p> <p>\"The child who dwells inside us trusts that there are wise men somewhere who know the truth\": so Milosz had written, and for his many friends he himself was one of those wise men. His sayings were quoted, even when they were wisecracks rather than wisdom. A few days before he died I'd had a letter from Robert Pinsky, telling of a visit last month to the hospital where Czeslaw was a patient. \"How are you?\" Pinsky asked. \"Conscious,\" was the reply. \"My head is full of absurd bric-a-brac.\" It was the first time I'd ever detected a daunted note in any of his utterances. A couple of years earlier, for example, a similar inquiry from Pinsky's fellow translator, Robert Hass, had elicited the reply, \"I survive by incantation\" - which was more like him. His life and works were founded upon faith in \"A word wakened by lips that perish\". This first artistic principle was clearly related to the last gospel of the Mass, the In principio of St John: \"In the beginning was the Word\". Inexorably then, through his pursuit of poetic vocation, his study of what such pursuit entailed and the unremitting, abounding yield of his habit of composition, he developed a fierce conviction about the holy force of his art, how poetry was called upon to combat death and nothingness, to be \"A tireless messenger who runs and runs / Through interstellar fields, through revolving galaxies, / And calls out, protests, screams\" (\"Meaning\"). With Milosz gone, the world has lost a credible witness to this immemorial belief in the saving power of poetry. </p> <p>His credibility was and remains the thing. There was nothing disingenuous about his professions of faith in poetry, which he once called philosophy's \"ally in the service of the good\", news that \"was brought to the mountains by a unicorn and an echo\". Such trust in the delicious joy-bringing potential of art and intellect was protected by strong bulwarks built from the knowledge and experience that he had gained at first hand and at great cost. His mind, to put it another way, was at once a garden - now a monastery garden, now a garden of earthly delights -and a citadel. The fortifications surrounding the garden were situated on a high mountain whence he could view the kingdoms of the world, recognise their temptations and their tragedies, and communicate to his readers both the airiness and the insights that his situation afforded. Somewhere, for example, he compares a poem to a bridge built out of air over air, and one of the great delights of his work is a corresponding sensation of invigilating reality from a head-clearing perspective, being liberated into the authentic solitude of one's own being and at the same time being given gratifying spiritual companionship, so that one is ready to say something like \"It is good for us to be here\". </p> <p>Milosz was well aware of this aspect of his work and explicit about his wish that poetry in general should be capable of providing such an elevated plane of regard. Yet as if to prove the truth of WB Yeats's contention that without contrarieties there could be no progression, he was equally emphatic about poetry's need to descend from its high vantage point and creep about among the nomads on the plain. It was not enough that the poet should be like Venus in WH Auden's poem \"The Shield of Achilles\", looking over the shoulder of his artefact at a far-off panorama that included everything from kitchen comedy to genocide. The poet had to be down there with the ordinary crowd, at eye level with the refugee family on the floor of the railway station, sharing the smell of the stale crusts the mother is doling out to her youngsters even as the boots of the military patrol bear down on them, the city is bombarded, and maps and memories go up in flames. Awareness of the triteness and tribulations of other people's lives was needed to humanise the song. It wasn't enough to be in the salons of the avant-garde. Certain things, as he says in \"1945\", could not be learned \"from Apollinaire, / Or Cubist manifestoes, or the festivals of Paris streets\". Milosz would have deeply understood and utterly agreed with John Keats's contention that the use of a world of pain and troubles was to school the intelligence and make it a soul. The discharged soldier of \"1945\" has received just such a schooling: </p> <p>&#xa0;\"On the steppe, as he was binding his bleeding feet with a rag </p> <p>&#xa0;He grasped the futile pride of those lofty generations. </p> <p>&#xa0;As far as he could see, a flat, unredeemed earth. </p> <p>&#xa0;And what, in these drastic conditions, has the poet to offer? Only what has accrued to him through custom and ceremony, through civilisation: </p> <p>&#xa0;I blinked, ridiculous and rebellious, </p> <p>&#xa0;Along with my Jesus Mary against irrefutable power, </p> <p>&#xa0;A descendant of ardent prayers, of gilded sculptures and miracles.\"</p> <p>Tender towards innocence, tough-minded when faced with brutality and injustice, Milosz could be at one moment susceptible, at another remorseless. Now he is evoking the dewy eroticism of some adolescent girl haunting the grounds of a Lithuanian manor house, now he is anatomising the traits of character and misdirected creative gifts that led some contemporary into the Marxist web. From start to finish, merciless analytic power coexisted with helpless sensuous relish. He recollects the fresh bread smells on the streets of Paris when he was a student at the same moment as he summons up the faces of fellow students from Indo-china, young revolutionaries preparing to seize power and \"kill in the name of the universal beautiful ideas\". </p> <p>No doubt the intensity of his early religious training contributed to his capacity to let perpetual light shine upon the quotidian, yet this religious poet was inhabited by another who was, in a very precise sense, a secular Milosz, one afflicted by the atrociousness of the saeculum he was fated to live through. The word \"century\" usually preceded by the definite article or the possessive pronoun, first person singular, repeats and echoes all through his writing. It was as if he couldn't go anywhere without encountering, as he does in his poem, \"A Treaty on Poetry\", \"The Spirit of History... out walking\", wearing \"About his neck a chain of severed heads\". And it was his face-to-face encounters and contentions with this \"inferior god\" that darkened his understanding and endowed everything he wrote with grievous force. </p> <p>His intellectual life could be viewed as a long single combat with shapeshifting untruth. \"The New Faith\" upon which the communist regimes were founded was like the old man of the sea, a villainous fallacious Proteus who had to be watched, wrestled with, held down and made to submit. Just how much stamina and precision this entailed can be seen in the almost inquisitorial prosecution of argument and accusation which characterises The Captive Mind, the book he introduced like a bell and candle between himself and his Polish contemporaries who had succumbed to the Marxist tempters. The sense of personal majesty that developed around him in old age derived in no small measure from his having survived this ordeal, which had sprung him into solitude and left him a wanderer, as capable in the end of self-accusation as he had ever been of accusation. </p> <p>Once, after a poetry reading in Harvard where he had seemed, as I later wrote, to combine the roles of Orpheus and Tiresias, he said to me: \"I feel just like a little boy, playing on the bank of a river.\" And the poems convinced you that here too he was telling the truth. In fact, Milosz gave the lie to TS Eliot's line that human kind cannot bear very much reality. The young poet who started out with his peers in the caf\u00e9s and controversies of 1930s Warsaw was present when those same young poets were dying in gunfire during the Warsaw Rising, their memorials little more than graffiti in the rubble of the devastated city. The old man, the sage of Grizzly Peak Road in Berkeley, veteran of the cold war, hero of Solidarity, friend of the pope, was at once the child \"who receives First Communion in Wilno and afterwards drinks cocoa served by zealous Catholic ladies\" and the poet who constantly heard \"the immense call of the Particular, despite the earthly law that sentences memory to extinction\" (\"Capri\"). </p> <p>I know Milosz's poems only in translation, but they come through so convincingly in the \"target language\" you forget that their first life is in Polish. Reading him in English, you are in thrall to a unique voice, a poetry cargoed with a density of experience that has been lived through and radiated by an understanding that has rendered it symbolic. It's not just that one trusts the ear and the accuracy of those poets who have done the translating, although their contributions in this regard have been indispensable. It's more that one can hardly not intuit the sheer weight of human presence, prose content and musical transmission that must subsist in the original away beyond our linguistic reach. The poetry as a whole is eminently comprehensible, equally well supplied with occasions of surprise and recognition. It can move from sumptuous evocation to solo articulation. Its easy-as-breathing cadences, its often unexpected simplicity (as in a bewitching early poem such as \"Encounter\") and its equally unexpected but persuasive obliquity (\"Far West\", for instance), convince you of the truth, of Milosz's frequent claim that his poems were dictated by a daimon, that he was merely a \"secretary\". Which was another way of saying that he had learned to write fast, to allow the associative jumps to be taken at a hurdler's pace. When he tells us that his poem \"Ars Poetica?\" was written in 20 minutes, I believe him and rejoice. </p> <p>Part of the secret and much of the power came from his immense learning. His head was like one of those renaissance theatres of memory. Schoolboy Latin, Thomist theology, Russian philosophy, world poetry, 20th-century history, the dramatis personae of the age, many of whom were his close companions - you have only to read a few pages of his copious prose to realise how present all of this was to him, and how flimsy and inadequate the old clich\u00e9, \"a well-stocked mind\", turns out to be in his case. The poetry is the fine flower of an oeuvre that extends to autobiography, political argu ment, literary criticism, personal essays, fictions, maxims, memoirs, and much else that is original, frolicsome, ominous, more or less unclassifiable. 0ther poets have written voluminous prose. Among his near contemporaries in English one can think of Hugh Macdiarmid and WH Auden, both gifted with vigorous intelligence and a rage for order. By comparison, however, Macdiarmid, for all his compendiousness, seems to protest too much. Auden is closer, in that he too is compelled to examine the middle state of human life and can never forget the border states of beast and angel. Yet compared with Milosz, Auden tends towards don-speak, doesn't appear to suffer as much from the complicating drag of the contingent: you get serious speculation but it tends to lack the interesting impairment of specific personal gravity. I love Milosz because there is such a guarantee in his tone, a guarantee that the performative prose-writing persona is being kept under constant scrutiny by a more penitent, more punitive side of himself. What we get in the prose, as in the poetry, is the speech of the whole man. </p> <p>And yet Milosz was always impatient with \"the insufficiency of lyric\", as the poet Donald Davie expressed it, and indeed the insufficiency of all art, deeply conscious of the unattainability of the reality that surrounds us. His yearning for a more encompassing form of expression than is humanly available was a theme to which he returned again and again. \"Arranging colours on a canvas is a paltry thing compared with what calls out to be explored.\" Yet he also exulted in the certainty that he was called as a poet \"to glorify things just because they are\", and maintained that \"the ideal life for a poet is to contemplate the word is \". In pursuit of this ideal, he brought poetry beyond the chalk circle of significant form and opened it to big vistas and small domesticities: his poems sometimes have the head-on exclamatory innocence of child art (\"O happiness! To see an iris\"), sometimes the panoramic sweep of synoptic historical meditation, as in \"Oeconomia Divina\": \"I did not expect to live in such an unusual moment... / Roads on concrete pillars, cities of glass and cast iron, / airfields larger than tribal dominions / suddenly ran short of their essence and disintegrated... / Out of trees, field stones, even lemons on the table, / materiality escaped\". Yet by diagnosing the onset of this lightness of being Milosz effectively halted it for his readers, and much of his staying power as a poet will continue to reside in his exemplary obstinacy, his refusal to underprize the thickness of the actual and the sovereign value that can inhere in what we choose to remember. \"What is pronounced strengthens itself. / What is not pronounced tends to nonexistence\" (\"Reading the Japanese Poet Issa\"). </p> <p>Thinking of Czeslaw during these past months, seeing him in my mind's eye marooned on his bed, visited by friends yet always with his eye fixed steadily on the life-obliterating wall ahead, I couldn't help but see him also in the light of two works of art that have about them a typically Miloszian combination of solidity and spiritual force. The first is Jacques Louis David's painting, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of the death of Socrates. The sturdily built philosopher is on his high bed, bare to the waist, finger in the air, sitting upright and expounding to his crowd of friends the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. The picture could well carry as an alternative title or caption the words: \"I permitted myself everything except complaints\" - a remark made by Joseph Brodsky, one which Milosz quoted with high approval and which could apply with equal justice to Milosz himself. And the other work, probably brought to mind by that tableau of Milosz face-to-face with the bronze likeness of his wife Carol, is an Etruscan sarcophagus in the Louvre, a mighty terracotta sculpture of a married couple, reclining on their elbows. The woman is positioned on the man's left side, couched close and parallel, both of them at their ease and gazing intently ahead at something which by all the rules of perspective should be visible in the man's outstretched right hand. But there is nothing to be seen there. Was it a bird that has flown? A flower that has been snapped away? A bird that is approaching? Nothing is shown, yet their gaze is full of realisation, as if they are in the process of settling for the bittersweet answer Milosz provided to his own question to life (in \"No More\"): </p> <p>&#xa0;\"Out of reluctant matter </p> <p>&#xa0;What can be gathered? Nothing, beauty at best. </p> <p>&#xa0;And so, cherry blossoms must suffice for us </p> <p>&#xa0;And chrysanthemums and the full moon.\"</p> <p>I was in our back garden, in sunlight, among flowers, when the call came. There was a fullness about the morning that was Californian. An unshadowedness that recalled his poem \"Gift\", written in Berkeley when he was 60: \"A day so happy. / Fog lifted early; I worked in the garden. / Hummingbirds were stopping over honeysuckle flowers...\" Thanksgiving and admiration were in the air, and I could easily have repeated to myself the remark he once made to an interviewer, commenting upon his epigram, \"He was thankful, so he couldn't not believe in God\". Ultimately, Milosz declared, \"one can believe in God out of gratitude for all the gifts\". So when the cordless phone was carried out and I heard the voice of Jerzy Jarniewicz, I knew what the news would be, but because I had been long prepared, I wasn't knocked askew. Instead, there was an expanding of grief into the everlasting reach of poetry. In the Dublin sunlight, the figure of the poet in his hillside garden above San Francisco Bay merged with the figure of Oedipus toiling up the wooded slope at Colonus, only to disappear in the blink of an eye: when I looked he was there in all his human bulk and devotion, when I looked again he was not to be seen - and yet he was not entirely absent. There and then I could have repeated the words of Sophocles's Messenger as he reports the incident which for all its mysteriousness has the ring of a common truth: </p> <p>&#xa0;\"He was gone from sight: </p> <p>&#xa0;That much I could see... </p> <p>&#xa0;No god had galloped </p> <p>&#xa0;His thunder chariot, no hurricane </p> <p>&#xa0;Had swept the hill. Call me mad, if you like, </p> <p>&#xa0;Or gullible, but that man surely went </p> <p>&#xa0;In step with a guide he trusted down to where </p> <p>&#xa0;Light has gone out but the door stands open.\"</p> <p>\u00a9 Seamus Heaney</p>",
  "In our table listing the members of Tony Blair's government, page 11, yesterday, we erred in giving details for the Department for Constitutional Affairs. \"In\" should be Lady Ashton, not Lord Ashton. \"Out\" should be Lord Filkin, not Lady Filkin. The list of department ministers should include not \"Lord Filkin, 60\" but \"Lady Ashton, 48\". She moved from the Department for Education and Skills, where the entry is correct. Apologies. <p>In our front-page picture yesterday the Australian flag was not shown flying against a background of the \"bombshattered embassy in Jakarta\" as the caption stated. The devastated building is not the embassy but the office tower next door to it. As the text of our report said, the heavily fortified embassy building suffered only minor damage. </p> <p>Mark Latham is the leader of the Australian Labor, not Labour, party (our leader on the Jakarta bomb, page 29, yesterday). The party's founders chose that spelling to differentiate it from the British Labour party. </p> <p>In a report headed Building firm puts freight on the water, page 11, September 9, we referred to \"millions of tonnes of gravel, used to make cement\". Gravel is not used to make cement. Cement is made primarily from limestone and clay. Cement and ballast are used to make concrete. </p> <p>Apologies to those who are still struggling to solve the clue for 4, 23 down in last Saturday's Quick crossword (page 21, September 4). Meryl Streep (one \"s\", two \"r\"s) does not make an anagram of sleepy terms (two \"s\"s, one \"r\"). </p> <p>The readers' editor writes about coverage of Beslan, page 26.
