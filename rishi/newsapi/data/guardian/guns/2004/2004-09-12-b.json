  "A former police special branch informer today pleaded guilty to the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. <p>Ken Barrett, a loyalist paramilitary at the time of the killing, broke into Finucane's home in February 1989 and shot him 14 times in front of his wife and three children. He is expected to be sentenced on Friday.</p> <p>The guilty plea will increase calls for a public inquiry into allegations that solicitor Finucane, who had defended several prominent Republicans, was murdered with the collaboration of the police and military intelligence.</p> <p>The 41-year-old's killing has been at the centre of a 15-year investigation into collusion between Protestant paramilitaries and the security forces.</p> <p>A retired Canadian judge, Peter Cory - appointed by the British and Irish governments in 2001 - has recommended an inquiry into the murder. However, London postponed a decision on the grounds that criminal proceedings were taking place.</p> <p>In June, Gerry Adams held a meeting with the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, who has led investigations into collusion. Mr Adams claimed the British government was intentionally obstructing a public inquiry.</p> <p>\"The institutional use of collusion for over 30 years has led to the deaths of hundreds of people, the maiming of thousands more, and the terrorising of an entire community,\" he said. </p> <p>Among those who today heard Barrett plead guilty were Finucane's former legal partner, Peter Madden, the former RUC sergeant Johnston Brown - who once taped an alleged confession from Barrett about his part in the assassination - and Commander David Cox, in charge of the day to day running of the Metropolitan police investigation into collusion allegations.</p> <p>When Barrett appeared in the dock, he nodded when asked to confirm his identity. When a series of charges, including Finucane's murder, were put to him, he quietly replied: \"Guilty.\" </p> <p>He also admitted the attempted murder of Mrs Finucane, possessing weapons with intent to endanger life, membership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, wounding with intent, and the theft of a huge consignment of army-owned guns in August 1987.</p> <p>He became a police informer in 1991 after being stripped of his post as a commander of the loyalist paramilitary organisation in North Belfast for allegedly stealing money obtained through racketeering.</p> <p>Two of his former associates, who were also allegedly part of the team involved in the Finucane shooting, have since died. </p> <p>William Stobie, who provided one of the weapons used in the killing, was shot dead by loyalists at his home in December 2001, and Brian Nelson - who helped provide information on Finucane's whereabouts - died of lung cancer in Wales last April.</p> <p>Both Nelson and Stobie were also working as informers for the police and military intelligence, and it was Nelson who warned his handlers in advance of the Finucane killing that a shooting was about to take place. However, nothing was done to prevent it.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, Barrett will be entitled to early release from jail. Having served almost 18 months, he will be able to apply to the life sentence review body in a move to be set free.</p>",

  "Only hours to go before the UK's first American Apparel store throws opens its Carnaby Street doors and 22-year-old Jarred Rubenstein, on secondment from the New York store, is passing on final sales tips to his unfeasibly young and pretty new British team. <p>'This is a cute look,' he announces, brandishing a pair of baby pink running shorts and a wrap that could 'be worn as a halter'. 'Cute' is Jarred's favourite word, and it's all the more striking because it's not one traditionally associated with ethical clothing. But then at American Apparel there's not a pair of patchwork dungarees or tie-dye sweater in sight. </p> <p>With no subcontractors and no sweatshops, American Apparel, headed by 34-year-old chief executive Dov Charney, is the antithesis of conventional globalised fashion and its murky, socially and economically complex supply chain. Charney claims his way of doing fashion via vertical production in his LA factory - where workers are paid $13-18 per hour (about \u00a37.50-\u00a310) and encouraged to sign up to yoga - means a five to 10-day turnaround of new designs, unlike the multinational brands using local labour in the developing world who are looking at 90 to 100 days offshore. </p> <p>But Charney is at pains to point out that his customers aren't worthy. 'They're actually hedonists,' he announces. 'The ethics is an afterthought. Like a girl wants to wear a sexy skirt at night but it doesn't sit right if that's been made by sweatshop labour.' Anti-logo, anti-fashion, Charney is also anti-celebrity: 'Celebrities suck. I'm not interested in using them to promote us.' </p> <p>Celebrities, however, are evidently interested in wearing American Apparel. Ewan McGregor, Jude Law and even Robert Downey Jr are converts. </p> <p>The fair-trade label People Tree, by contrast, welcomes celebrity wearers. 'Well, ideally I'd like Madonna,' says its founder, Safia Minney, 'but I don't have Gap-sized budgets. We don't spend a lot on glitzy promotion because we'd prefer to spend it helping our Bangladeshi fair-trade suppliers recover after the floods.' Still, the label has managed to attract an impressive list of fans - Sienna Miller, Minnie Driver and Chris Martin have all been spotted in People Tree threads, sourced from 70 fair-trade groups in 20 developing countries. </p> <p>Two weeks ago the brand opened concessions in Selfridges. 'We are as excited as People Tree about working together,' says Anna Garner, the head of fashion at Selfridges, who stresses the symbiotic nature of this relationship. 'For us the most important thing is that we are giving customers this choice.' </p> <p>Even more choice will arrive early next year in the form of Katharine - an ethical collection from Katharine Hamnett, champion of the thinking fashionista. </p> <p>For her forthcoming collection, she has researched every part of the supply chain to make it organic and sustainable. But she is also passionate about the aesthetic. 'It used to be that everything in organic cotton was a horrible porridge colour,' she said. 'My point is why can't you have something completely gorgeous and ethical?' </p> <p>In the past Nick Pecarelli wrote speeches for Gordon Brown. Now he runs Hug, a fair-trade label with a strong line in cutesy, cheeky T-shirts. In the past he also had problems explaining what he was doing. 'There was an old school of fair-trade fashion trying to get people to buy knitted llamas, but that's never going to meet the mainstream,' he said. </p> <p>Like Dov Charney, the designer Jenny McPherson is Canadian, and like Pecarelli, she only wanted to work in the fashion business if she could do it ethically. Working with hemp - a naturally resistant crop which doesn't need agrochemicals - her Enamore label may sound wholesome but her edgy website using actress models to interpret her 'nouveau romantic' look is anything but. </p> <p>McPherson also uses recycled fabrics in her collections, addressing another important ethical theme. The disposability of fashion has had a huge knock-on effect in the developing world where clothing donations from the West flood local economies, destroying any indigenous garment or textile industries. </p> <p>Traid (Textile Recyling for Aid and International Development) takes a different approach. Operating partly as a charity/vintage hybrid shop, proceeds are ploughed into sustainable projects in the developing world while recycled scraps are refashioned and unwanted clothes given new life under the organisation's Remade label. Stella McCartney is a regular in the Notting Hill store. </p> <p>Back at American Apparel, customers as unfeasibly young and pretty as the staff are snapping up baby rib hoodies and spaghetti tanks. A stack of T-shirts for dogs remains untouched. 'Hmm,' says Jarred, 'in New York we're dressing 60 to 75 dogs a day in our doggy tees.' </p> <p>A sign, perhaps, there's still some way to go to bring the UK consumer up to speed on ethical pet fashion.</p>",

  "<p>September marks the point where our cooking takes a small but significant step towards autumn. Already, I have noticed slight changes in what I cook for supper, and have spotted the first early pumpkins and game birds in the shops. While I am not yet ready for big casseroles, I do find warm food is becoming my first thought. And from now on, those gorgeously fruity tomatoes growing in my garden are more likely to be baked than sliced in a salad.</p> <p>Like a true Brit, I hold on to summer until the last leaves have fallen off the trees. Any meal that can be is eaten outside, and if that means putting on a sweater, then so be it. Only pouring rain will stop me lighting a grill and cooking my kebabs in the open air, and it would probably take a hailstorm to prevent me from having breakfast in the garden. Not until the first frosts appear do I even consider eating indoors. In fact, I will continue laying the table outside until everyone refuses to join me.</p> <p><strong>Quick fish soup</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 2 as a main dish</strong></p> <p>I wouldn't suggest that this is as fine a recipe as a fish soup you have laboured over, but it sure ain't bad.</p> <p>1 shallot</p> <p>garlic -2 cloves</p> <p>olive oil</p> <p>tomatoes - 3 large</p> <p>bay leaves</p> <p>hot fish stock - 425ml</p> <p>white fish, prepared (skate, hake or haddock) - 100g</p> <p>small clams - 12</p> <p>mussels - 12</p> <p>large prawns - 100g</p> <p>saffron strands - 1 teaspoon</p> <p>a little coriander leaf</p> <p>Peel the shallot and garlic and chop them finely. Let them cook in a little olive oil until just turning gold. Chop the tomatoes and add them, with a couple of bay leaves and the fish stock. Bring to the boil then turn down the heat to a simmer and add the fish. Four or five minutes later, add the clams, then the mussels and prawns, and stir in the saffron strands. Cook for a further couple of minutes until the mussels have opened.</p> <p>Taste the broth; it may need salt and pepper. Throw out the bay leaves. Add the coriander. Serve hot, spooning the broth, fish and shellfish into large, warm bowls. Offer bread for dunking.</p> <p><strong>Baked tomatoes with mozzarella, anchovies and breadcrumbs</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 4</strong></p> <p>Plum tomatoes tend to hold their shape better than the round varieties, but don't let that stop you if round ones are what you have.</p> <p>plum tomatoes - 12</p> <p>fresh breadcrumbs - 175g</p> <p>anchovy fillets - 8</p> <p>garlic - 2 large cloves</p> <p>basil - a good handful of leaves</p> <p>a ball of mozzarella</p> <p>olive oil - 6 tablespoons<br></p> <p>Chop the anchovies, peel and finely chop the garlic and cut the mozzarella into small dice. Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0c/ gas 7. Slice the tomatoes in half lengthways and scoop the seeds into a bowl. Place the tomatoes skin-side down in a roasting tin so that they nudge up against one another. Mix the tomato scoopings with the breadcrumbs, anchovies, garlic, basil, mozzarella and two tablespoons of the olive oil.</p> <p>Season the stuffing with salt and black pepper, and pile the filling into the tomato halves. Pour over the remaining olive oil and bake for 25 minutes until the filling is golden.</p> <p><strong>Avocado and warm bacon vinaigrette</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 2</strong></p> <p>One of those salads that is substantial enough to eat as a light supper with some good bread.</p> <p>avocados - 2, perfectly ripe</p> <p>streaky bacon - 3 rashers</p> <p>tomatoes - 3 decent-sized</p> <p>red wine vinegar - 3 tablespoons</p> <p>extra-virgin olive oil - 50ml</p> <p>Dijon mustard - 2 tablespoons</p> <p>flat-leafed parsley<br></p> <p>Cut the bacon rashers into thinnish strips and fry to a crisp in a shallow pan. Throw the vinegar and olive oil into the pan with the bacon, chop the tomatoes roughly and add them too, then stir in the mustard and leave everything to bubble for a minute. Chop the parsley.</p> <p>Peel and halve the avocados then remove the stones. Cut into thick slices then toss gently with the parsley and warm dressing.</p> <p><strong>Grilled lamb kebabs with cumin and crushed chillies</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 2-3</strong></p> <p>A sweet red onion and tomato salad is just the thing with this.</p> <p>serves 2-3</p> <p>lamb, chump chops or steak - 450g, cubed</p> <p>garlic - 2 cloves</p> <p>crushed dried chillies - 1 level teaspoon</p> <p>ground cumin - 2 level teaspoons</p> <p>ground coriander - 1 level teaspoon</p> <p>runny honey - 1 tablespoon</p> <p>thick, natural yoghurt</p> <p>lemon juice and more yoghurt to serve</p> <p>Peel and crush the garlic and mix it with the crushed chillies, ground cumin, coriander, honey and yoghurt. Add the lamb and toss gently to coat the meat with the marinade. Set aside somewhere cool for an hour.</p> <p>Thread the cubes of lamb onto skewers. Get the griddle or barbecue hot. Place the kebabs on the grill - they will hiss and crackle and there will be much smoke, but you will see the edges of the meat start to brown. I never start to move the meat until the side on the grill has started to catch a little here and there, maybe even char very slightly.</p> <p>Now cook the other side - it will take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on the temperature of your grill. The meat should end up a dark and glossy brown on the outside, the inside a deep rose pink and juicy.</p> <p>Remove the lamb from the grill, squeeze over the lemon and serve with a tomato and onion salad and perhaps a little more yoghurt.</p> <p><strong>Almost instant chocolate ice cream</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 4-6</strong></p> <p>I use bought custard from the chiller cabinet at the supermarket for this. Check the ingredients carefully though, some brands are better than others.</p> <p>fine quality dark chocolate - 200g</p> <p>a small espresso (about 50ml)</p> <p>fresh custard - 400g</p> <p>whipping cream - 250ml<br></p> <p>Put the chocolate, broken into pieces, and the coffee in a heatproof basin set over a small pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Once the chocolate has melted, stir gently once or twice and turn off the heat. Pour the custard into a jug, then stir in the cream and chocolate. Scoop the mixture into an ice-cream machine and churn till frozen.</p> <p>No ice-cream machine? Then pour the mixture into a plastic box and place in the freezer, removing it and beating the mixture with a hand whisk every couple of hours until it's almost frozen. (You will need to do this two or three times.) If you leave it in the freezer overnight, then place it in the fridge for an hour or so before serving to allow it to soften.</p> <p><strong>The wine list</strong></p> <p><strong>Lamb kebabs with garlic, cumin, chilli and honey</strong></p> <p>2002 Syrah, Laurent Miquel, Vin de Pays d'Oc (\u00a34.99, Threshers)</p> <p>An outstanding buy, this smoky French red is a juicy, easy drinking wine with blackberry fruit and a nip of tannin on the finish.<br></p> <p><strong>Baked tomatoes with mozzarella, anchovies and breadcrumbs</strong></p> <p>2002 Xerolithia, Peza, Crete (\u00a35.49, Oddbins)</p> <p>A spicy, zesty, green olive-scented Greek white that tastes a bit like a superior unoaked chardonnay, albeit with a little more acidity.<br></p> <p><strong>Avocado salad with bacon, Dijon mustard, parsley and tomatoes</strong></p> <p>2003 Villa Maria Pinot Gris Private Bin (\u00a36.99, Waitrose)</p> <p>This ripe, off-dry New Zealand example is a full-flavoured white with just a touch of residual sugar.<br></p> <p><strong>Quick fish soup</strong></p> <p>2003 Casa Marin Sauvignon Blanc, Laurel Vineyard (\u00a313.95, Lay &amp; Wheeler, 0845 330 1855)</p> <p>One of the best New World sauvignon blancs I've ever tasted: nettley, intense and beautifully poised with mouth-watering freshness.<br></p> <p><strong>Chocolate ice cream</strong></p> <p>Lustau East India Solera Rich Oloroso Sherry (\u00a310.99, Waitrose)</p> <p>The sweetness is so well integrated on this that you can pour it over a bowl of ice cream.</p>",
  "<p>I wrung a chicken's neck this morning. A cockerel's neck, to be precise. I've probably done a couple of dozen or so in the past few years, since I regularly started raising my male chicks for the pot, and I'm getting better at it.</p> <p>The technique, which I gleaned from various old poultry-rearing manuals, requires grasping the legs of the bird firmly in one fist (my right) and the head firmly between the middle fingers of the other hand (my left), and then pulling the two hands apart, firm and fast, in the opposite direction from each other (legs up, head down seems to work well). It has to be done with confidence and determination, as the neck vertebrae actually need to part company for the dispatch to be efficient. Provided this is achieved, the effect is fairly instant, and the bird is immediately rendered quite lifeless, bar the odd twitch.</p> <p>That may all sound a bit grisly to some. But I feel pretty good about raising and killing my own meat birds. Relatively speaking, that is. I think I've got their death down to a minimum of stress and suffering - in other words, it compares favourably, in terms of speed and pain, to the death of most birds at the hands (or teeth, or claws) of a creature that intends to eat them. And, of course, that's how almost every bird, wild or domesticated, meets its end.</p> <p>But with my cockerels what I feel best about is not so much the way they die as the way they live. They scamper about in a grassy field, strutting their stuff and pecking the living daylights out of the grass, bugs and slugs, along with the corn and maize mix we scatter for them. In other words, they spend all day doing properly chickeny stuff. As a result, they taste properly chickeny at the end of it all.</p> <p>Compare and contrast with standard broiler chickens, reared in their millions of millions around the world (including about 800 million a year here in the UK alone). They live short, uncomfortable and wholly unnatural lives. The resulting bland, tasteless pith, like papier-mache without enough glue, is a malleable food commodity that is, with the addition of the full battery of artificial flavourings, conveniently moulded and extruded into all kinds of ready-made meals and fast-food products. And it accounts for an astonishing 98 per cent of all the chicken meat we eat in this country.</p> <p>For those of you who haven't heard the worst about intensive chicken farming, let me summarise briefly: a unique breed of chicken called the Ross Cobb, genetically engineered over hundreds of generations to be inherently obese, is raised from an egg to a two-kilo bird in a mere six weeks (it would take one of my cockerels getting on for 20 weeks to make that weight). At the end of this process, each bird has a space on the floor slightly smaller than an A4 sheet of paper.</p> <p>The litter of wood shavings in the shed is not changed once during the six weeks. The resulting dung is so high in ammonia that, from four weeks on in the cycle, many of the birds suffer serious abrasions, known as 'hock burns' on their legs.</p> <p>Every day, dozens of dead birds, usually expired from stress-induced heart attacks, are removed from the sheds. Premature mortality is measured in 'acceptable per percentages' of five to 10 per cent per crop. Across the industry, that's well over 50 million chickens that die before they reach their slaughter weight. (In theory, these birds are banned from the human food chain and go to make pet food, fertiliser or maggots for anglers. But it is far from rare for this meat to be illegally recycled for human consumption.)</p> <p>Compassion in World Farming has argued that the broiler bird is such a genetic freak that it is impossible to raise it on this regime without inevitable suffering in a significant (more than 30 per cent) proportion of the population. To farm it at all, it maintains, should technically be illegal under EC animal welfare legislation. The organisation points to the undisputed fact that the parent birds in the Cobb breeding programme (the ones that lay the eggs that hatch into the broiler birds) are reared on a completely different feed regime - effectively a starvation diet, that leaves them in a permanent state of hunger. This is because, on the same diet as their children are destined to receive, they would invariably die of obesity before they could ever reach sexual maturity.</p> <p>You may or may not have heard all this before. If you have, then why are you (98 per cent of you) still buying this rubbish? You didn't know you were? Be in no doubt that, unless someone is specifically, loudly, unambiguously taking the trouble to tell you otherwise (by using the words 'free range' or 'organic' on a label or menu), all the chicken you eat is made in this way.</p> <p>What's bizarre is that we seem to have a completely different set of moral scruples about laying hens than we do about meat birds. The battle on behalf of the poor beleaguered laying hen has, over the past 30 years or so, been fought by the consumer with some passion and, if not won, then at least fairly honourably drawn. Free-range eggs (as opposed to battery eggs laid by hens in tiny cages), now account for about 50 per cent of all UK egg sales to the public (though the food industry continues to use vast quantities of battery eggs).</p> <p>If nothing else, that proves that, when it comes to the way our food is being produced, consumers do have teeth. It's time to sharpen them again, urgently, by chewing on chicken that has lived a half decent life. And by boycotting the kind that you can suck through a straw.</p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong> Hugh is now running regular cookery courses and local food events at the new River Cottage HQ, near Bridport in Dorset.

  "<p>Italian cuisine is world-renowned for its use of superb seasonal ingredients and simple cooking methods. Apart from in the home, nowhere is this more apparent than in the cooking of Italy's local restaurants, the trattorias. In fact, the cooking in the best trattorias can be said to be as good as that in the home, for most are family run.</p> <p>Trattoria cooking is home cooking at its best. Often the chefs or owners are determined to have you appreciate their skills or local dishes to the greatest extent. The Slow Food movement, based in the north of Italy, has recently highlighted the unique position of trattorias in Italian life, awarding symbols for excellence. But whether given such accolades or not, most trattorias are the backbone of Italian eating: somewhere you can go for lunch every day and be assured of getting something different, something traditional, something reasonable in price and something really well cooked. The recipes here - some from family-run trattorias I know or have found, some from friends' families and some of my own - reflect that glorious creativity.</p> <p><strong>Sausages with lentils</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 6</strong></p> <p>This is a perfect New Year's Eve dish, as lentils are believed to bring money when eaten at the beginning of the year.

Ladle into warmed soup bowls and serve with some good oil.</p> <p><strong>Butternut squash, mozzarella and caramelised garlic risotto with shallots</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 4</strong></p> <p>This recipe comes from Geltrude Mitterman of Trattoria Bella Vista in Mendola, Alto Adige. It is family-run, very friendly, and very Austrian/Swiss in its interior and approach to its dishes.</p> <p>400g butternut squash</p> <p>olive oil</p> <p>1 small onion, peeled and diced</p> <p>55g unsalted butter</p> <p>200g risotto rice</p> <p>700ml chicken broth, hot</p> <p>55g Parmesan, grated</p> <p>125g buffalo mozzarella, cut into 1cm cubes</p> <p>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p> <p>pesto</p> <p>1 large bunch fresh basil</p> <p>3 garlic cloves, peeled</p> <p>3 tbsp pine nuts, lightly toasted</p> <p>about 3 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>3 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan</p> <p>crispy shallots</p> <p>55g shallots, peeled and finely sliced1</p> <p>115g plain flour, seasoned vegetable oil for frying</p> <p>caramelised garlic</p> <p>16 garlic cloves</p> <p>200ml chicken broth, hot</p> <p>25g unsalted butter</p> <p>First make the pesto. Put the basil, garlic and pine nuts in a food processor with a little salt and pepper. Work to a paste, add enough olive oil to produce a loose-textured puree. Remove from the food processor, pour into a bowl and fold in Parmesan.</p> <p>Next, make the crispy shallots. Dust the shallots in seasoned flour, shake off any excess and deep-fry in vegetable oil at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F). When they are a light golden brown, remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Season with a little salt and keep on a warm plate.</p> <p>To caramelise the garlic, first blanch the garlic in a pan of salted boiling water for about 3 minutes, then peel and transfer to a clean pan. Pour off the water and add the chicken broth and butter. Cook until the garlic is soft and the broth is reduced to a syrup that coats the cloves. Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/gas mark 4.</p> <p>Peel and seed the butternut squash, dice into 1cm cubes and fry in a little olive oil until lightly coloured. Transfer to the oven for 10-12 minutes, until the flesh is tender. Meanwhile, gently sweat the diced onion in the butter until the onion is soft. Add the rice to the onion, raise the heat and cook, stirring, until the rice is shiny and translucent. Lower the heat and begin to add the hot broth, a ladleful at a time, wait for it to be absorbed before adding the next ladleful.</p> <p>Once the rice is cooked to al dente, and of the correct texture, fold in the Parmesan, mozzarella and squash, and cook for 2 minutes more. Season to taste.</p> <p>Serve immediately on hot plates, drizzle the pesto around the risotto and top with a small pile of crisp shallots and caramelised garlic cloves.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Trattoria: Italian Food for Family and Friends by Ursula Ferrigno is published by Mitchell Beazley (\u00a320).

  "<p>Have you ever wondered how much your work colleagues earn? Whether it's out of plain nosiness, or a nagging sense of possible injustice, discussing your earning power with colleagues isn't easy. </p> <p>Workplace secrecy over how much people are paid is, says occupational psychologist Matt Goff from psychometric assessment company SHL Group, one of the last no-go areas of modern life. 'Most people don't like showing their hand. Many people probably don't have a problem if you're working in completely different disciplines, but if you work in the same area or at a similar level, it can be a huge problem.' </p> <p>Crawford Warnock faced this situation a few years ago when he left his London PR job for another role with Reed Personnel Services in Northampton, earning about \u00a37,000 in total more than his other team members due to a renegotiated pay and bonus deal when he moved north. </p> <p>Warnock didn't advertise the fact that he took home several hundred pounds more a month than other members of his team, but when he began a relationship with a colleague, word got out. </p> <p>'There wasn't open hostility,' he says, 'but a barrier was definitely up.' </p> <p>Warnock says he handled it by keeping his head down and working hard to be more inclusive within the team. 'It wasn't exactly a charm offensive, but I had to make sure resentments didn't start to build up.' </p> <p>One of the reasons people don't like to discuss their earning power with colleagues is the fear of being shamed, believes psychologist Dorothy Rowe, who researched the topic in her book The Real Meaning of Money: 'People are often afraid to disclose their salary because if you do tell them, they may either envy you or pity you. Being pitied by someone is demeaning, and envy is very dangerous. </p> <p>'For the same reason we don't ask people about the size of their mortgage. You just would not say to their face, \"goodness, how on earth can you afford a mortgage that size?\".' </p> <p>Rowe worked in the NHS during the 1970s and 1980s, when there was a clearly demarcated salary scale and most people knew what others earned. 'Whenever there was a pay review,' she says, 'we all got together and told our union rep what we thought - it was the power of the group. But then they started turning the NHS into a business, work began to get outsourced and many were put on separate contracts. Of course, it is often very much in the interest of employers to keep pay information secret.' </p> <p>For some employers, asking employees to keep pay details confidential means the chances of staff swapping and sharing information on their salaries is reduced, possibly minimising the risk of grievances being aired. </p> <p>But pay issues are now increasingly clouded because of the rising number of people on short-term contracts. </p> <p>'Don't forget a lot of people doing short-term work tend not to have access to permanent work benefits like sickness and pension pay,' says Lesley Greenway of human resources consultancy DBM. 'But pay transparency is a good thing, because if you go into an organisation your expectations about the job can be managed more effectively. The difficulty comes when rises and bonuses are given and aren't actually in line with the established procedures, risking favouritism.' </p> <p>Where there are clear discrepancies on pay or bonuses, delving into perceived injustices with work colleagues might not be the best way forward. Simone Makepeace, head of recruitment agency Blue Arrow, advises people to take the issue up with their line managers, rather than gossip about the situation with colleagues. </p> <p>'Get an explanation about any new pay review and try to identify the rationale behind it. You could also gain tangible ways of increasing your package by the setting of various targets, so you have something to work towards.' </p> <p>Makepeace believes an increasing number of British companies are mov ing towards pay openness, though it can be a slow haul. 'HR might have a lot of pay packages to reconcile. Let's say you have three procurement managers, two on \u00a330,000 and one on \u00a340,000, all with different benefits packages. To be transparent overnight would be hugely problematic.' </p> <p>To sort this, a migration process over three or four years, allowing HR to address the gaping holes, might be started, she says. 'That's what the public sector is largely doing - they're in front here.' </p> <p>But despite the chatter about transparency, many would argue that how much someone earns is ultimately a private matter between worker and employer. </p> <p>Charles Walker, an employment analyst at payroll consultancy LSM, is certainly against moves for greater definition: 'Although you might find it interesting to know how much others are paid, you might feel differently if they knew how much you were paid yourself.' Walker says recent changes to the way tax is collected mean pay slips can contain a great deal of information about the personal circumstances of employees. </p> <p>'Where might it end?' he asks. 'If the Government increasingly starts to take deductions direct from your salary, could your work colleagues potentially find out about a county court judgement against you, or that you're still paying off a student loan? Or even that you're supporting a child from a previous marriage? Might all these things risk being made public as well?' Walker says pay is private - and should stay that way.</p> <p><strong>A woman's right to know</strong></p> <p>Women often earn less than men for doing the same job, as the recent rash of high-profile City discrimination claims show. If a woman suspects she is being paid less than a man for doing the same job, the Equal Pay Act allows her to follow the recently introduced Questionnaire Procedure. </p> <p>'If you suspect there is genuine inequality,' says Belinda Lester, an employment solicitor at law firm Sprecher Grier Halberstam, 'you can ask your employer to complete an Equal Pay Act questionnaire in which the employer will be asked to confirm whether or not there is a discrepancy, and if there is, to explain that discrepancy.</p> <p>'It's then up to the employee to decide whether the explanation is adequate.'</p> <p>Lester says an employer has the right not to answer the questionnaire, but a refusal could be held against it should the case come to a tribunal.</p> <p><strong>Upfront employers</strong></p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development is a firm backer of greater pay transparency. The CIPD says if a company wants to get the best out of its employees, greater clarity about what employers value - and what they're prepared to pay for it - is important. </p> <p>'If organisations aren't communicating their rewards, aims and objectives, they risk people simply not being motivated,' says the CIPD's Charles Cotton. 'You don't have to be bolshy about asking about it. A company should be able to publish the range of what it pays. It also ensures pay decisions don't discriminate or are accidentally discriminatory.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Author, Author</strong><br>by David Lodge<br>Secker &amp; Warburg \u00a316.99, pp389</p> <p>David Lodge packs a fair bit into the title of his homage in fiction to Henry James: 'Author! Author!' is the traditional cry of theatrical success, announcing the moment when the solitary artist emerges from the wings as a public figure.</p> <p>The absence of those exclamation marks might signify James's distaste for such hectic punctuation, or indifference by his audience. Then again, when writers are friends, it isn't their writerly core which becomes attached. Henry James and George du Maurier were intimate for many years and over that period, du Maurier exchanged popularity as a cartoonist for worldwide fame as a novelist, while James remained eminent and distinguished.</p> <p>The title Author, Author, may glance at the necessary distance within even such an affectionate relationship. Certainly, his friendship with du Maurier, a charmer but hardly an intellectual equal, shows James at his best, able to enjoy family life at a safe remove and to absorb the pain (when du Maurier's Trilby, based on an idea he had once offered to James, became a craze) of commercial eclipse.</p> <p>James is the supreme example in Anglo-American culture of the artist as priest, sacrificing participation in life to transform it for others. The drawback of such an artist as the hero of a novel is clear enough: James's adventures in consciousness left few traces outside his work. Yet his sense of a higher calling was endearingly alloyed. When he started in the renunciation game, he was confident that excellence was bound eventually to be rewarded with a large readership. When this didn't happen, he had no logical basis for being disheartened.</p> <p>If he complained, he risked revealing that what he had undertaken was from the beginning a gamble rather than a sacrifice. As an aspiring dramatist (an aspiration which ate up five years of his life), James set out to raise standards but also to earn money in a business where it is famously possible to make a fortune but not a living. A large part of Author, Author is devoted to this period, when James was trying to meet an immediate public taste without pandering to it.</p> <p>Lodge remarks in his own voice that James's plays 'remain, alas, unperformed', but it isn't easy to second that sigh. There was an element of obtuseness in James's fantasy of theatrical triumph from the start. He took heart from the success of Pinero's The Second Mrs Tanqueray as evidence that the British public was ready to loosen its attachment to the happy ending. But what he offered at the end of Guy Domville (the play that carried his hopes to the bottom when it foundered) wasn't an unhappy ending, as theatre audiences understand such a thing, but a cheat. The hero renounced love, family and the world to become a monk. There are many things that people will happily dress up and leave their homes to witness, but renunciation is not one of them.</p> <p>Making the case against Guy Domville in spite of himself, Lodge records that on its first night the play contained in the second act an entirely serious scene in which the hero and his best friend, wanting to discover each other's deepest motives, try to get each other drunk while remaining sober. Much surreptitious pouring of liquids into suitable vessels on stage. That James did not notice despite months of rewriting that this is a farce mechanism, horribly misplaced, argues that he had (to borrow a distinction from the last sentence of The Sacred Fount) rather more method than tone.</p> <p>Lodge chooses a standard structure for his novel, as familiar from films as from books: the deathbed with flashbacks. This enables him to close off certain avenues of speculation without declaring them off limits. So, on the first page, James is asserted never to have experienced sexual intercourse, and shortly afterwards his secretary-typist, Miss Bosanquet, is described as being 'as celibate by nature as her employer'. How celibate is that, exactly, when she lives with a female companion?</p> <p>Later in the book, though earlier in his life, James fantasises palely about Trixy du Maurier's wedding night ('he grew quite hot'). The next page refers to 'an innate lack of concupiscence', which would certainly explain why 'he found it impossible to imagine himself performing any of these acts, even the most elementary, with anyone'. But another sentence about James's celibacy addresses the matter differently: 'The reasons were complex and he did not care to probe them too deeply, even in self-communing.' The absence of desire, simple glandular deficit, would hardly prompt such a buried qualm.</p> <p>James's level of self-repression fluctuates oddly. There's a disconcerting conversation with George du Maurier in which he is remarkably unfazed by the existence of female pubic hair (a traditional wedding-night trauma of chaste Victorian bridegrooms), and seems close to indulging in some mild front-bottom banter. And it turns out that self-communing yields an image of sexual performance, after all: 'He found it easier to picture himself thus engaged with a beautiful youth than with a beautiful maiden.'</p> <p>We have come some way from the idea of natural celibacy, since surely celibacy is a different choice when your deepest desires are prohibited by morals and law. The overall effect is of a door being firmly closed at the beginning of the book, and then inched open, but not far enough to let anyone in or out. The figure of Miss Bosanquet allows Lodge to announce the late trilogy (The Ambassadors, The Wings of the Dove and The Golden Bowl) as James's great achievement.</p> <p>Lodge himself, appearing in person at the other end of the book, describes them as 'foundation stones of the modern psychological novel', yet James's place in the canon isn't quite so secure. For one thing, James hitched his wagon to the long sentence, now out of fashion, and every year that passes makes him seem in stylistic terms more antiquated than his contemporaries.</p> <p>Yes, he was bold to base novels on sexual intrigue in the absence of personal experience, but when explicitness is commonplace, his indirectness can seem more hollow than subtle and his inability to convey sexual tension very striking. If James's life had a turning point, it was the first night of Guy Domville. James ventured on stage to receive applause, unaware that the play had not gone well and that the coarser grades of playgoer, thwarted of red blood in their entertainment, were baying for the author's own.</p> <p>Can this moment be promoted from symbolic turning point to novelistic setpiece? Lodge thinks so and takes a lot of trouble to build it up, with walk-on parts for Bernard Shaw, Arnold Bennett, HG Wells and others, but there's a risk that he will imitate James all too closely, the James of whom it was said that he had bitten off less than he could chew.</p> <p>Sensibly, Lodge avoids any approach to pastiche of an oceanic style which keeps possibilities suspended rather than resolved. In fact, his directness can seem positively bald in this context. 'The truth was...'; 'It was obvious to Henry...'; 'The reason he had been kind to her...' - all these formulations seem unJamesian, even counterJamesian, when applied to someone who so far preferred suggestion to spelling out.</p> <p>Only one piece of figurative language has a resonance worthy of the novel's hero, Lodge's description of James's sister, Alice, and his great friend, Gertrude Fenimore Woolson (who may have harboured tender hopes), as 'two women who circled his existence like moons, showing him at most only half of their selves'.</p> <p>Anachronisms such as 'input' and 'paranoid' can be jarring, but the chief obstacle to the success of Author, Author lies in its timing. It is Lodge's misfortune that his long-pondered novel about Henry James should be preceded by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's remarkable The Master, so that a capable book is published in the wake of a dazzling one. T\u00f3ib\u00edn has stolen his thunder, and his lightning into the bargain.</p>",
  "<p>Her bullet-riddled body was found last month amid the dense undergrowth of eastern Thailand. Those who stumbled on the blood-soaked carcass described milk still flowing from her breast. The elephant's calf was nowhere to be seen, snatched by her mother's killers along with her valuable tusks. </p> <p>By now the ivory will have found its way to Bangkok, where hundreds of British visitors will have deliberated whether to smuggle it home. It may already be available on the streets of London, home of the UK's flourishing and sophisticated ivory market. </p> <p>In three weeks' time British ministers will arrive in Bangkok for the most crucial talks this year on protecting the planet's wildlife. Yet an Observer investigation reveals the city remains unrivalled as the world's greatest hub for the illegal trade in rare animals. </p> <p>Yet on the eve of the international summit, concern is shifting closer to home. Tens of thousands of Britons and their desire for acquiring anything from snakeskins to tiger pelts to ivory trinkets stand accused of accelerating the slaughter of endangered animals. Their willingness to flout wildlife law has fostered a deep sense of shame among Britain's conservationists. </p> <p>The UK government is also under fire for choosing to remain silent on the scale of Bangkok's trade. Despite receiving a wealth of evidence on the city's role in the smuggling of rare species, ministers have refused publicly to condemn Thailand's failure to quash its slaughter of endangered animals. Some believe Britain should first concentrate on the increasing problems in its own backyard, citing its 'uncontrolled and thriving' ivory market. An investigation for the International Fund for Animal Welfare has identified the UK as the third-biggest source of illegal ivory into the US, one of the world's largest markets. The scale of illegal animal trafficking in Britain is stunning. More than 570 illegal wildlife imports were seized by UK customs officers each day during the most comprehensive analysis of the crisis so far. </p> <p>Environmentalists say the situation is accelerating the fastest extinction of species since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. In Bangkok, evidence suggests it remains as rife as ever. An undercover investigation, yet to be published, by the Dorset-based Monkey World found 38 orang-utans had been smuggled from Thailand into Cambodia over the summer. </p> <p>Director Jim Cronin estimates up to 600 of Asia's only great ape are being kept illegally in Thailand. 'We are talking about the wholesale decimation of the orang-utan by the Thai government. Where has the UK, and the world, been?' said Cronin. </p> <p>Today among the 10,000 stalls of Bangkok's sprawling Chatuchak weekend market, a major draw for British tourists, The Observer was repeatedly told it would be possible to order orang-utans, snow leopards or rare birds by market traders. Similarly sources told Monkey World they could buy an orang-utan for \u00a34,000 but that prices will fall after the spotlight of Thailand's international talks fades. </p> <p>Some Britons will be unable to wait that long. Few, though, are unlikely to match the audacity of Raymond Humphreys, 45. When customs officers opened his suitcase at Heathrow after a flight from Bangkok two years ago, 23 endangered bird species worth \u00a335,000 were found wedged into tight glass tubes. Six had died en route. Later, on top of Humphreys's Norfolk caravan, police came across a present for his wife - a golden-cheeked gibbon, one of less than 1,000 left. </p> <p>A streak of dried blood clung to the inside of the tusk. Viewed from another angle, though, its polished veneer gleamed without blemish: a reminder of why the world's most valuable bone remains craved by so many Britons. This was the finest-quality raw ivory around, hacked from an Asian elephant, each tusk as long as a man's arm and the weight of a six-month-old baby. Unveiled from the dusty backroom of a Bangkok shop last week, the pair were offered to The Observer for \u00a33,500. They came without paperwork and were perfectly illegal. 'I don't care and you don't care; this is ivory,' beamed the proprietor when told of plans to whisk them back to London for sale. His store stood in the centre of the Thai capital, a short cab ride from the huge Queen Sirikit Convention Centre where 5,000 delegates representing more than 160 countries will shortly convene to discuss around 40 proposals on how to improve protection for the most threatened plants and animals. </p> <p>All those about to arrive will know that not only is the elephant the former symbol of Thailand, but it is that of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) too. Yet the host country continues to fail its former icon. </p> <p>Numbers of wild Thai elephants have fallen to fewer than 3,000. Most countries attending will have assumed the killing to have stopped during the run-up to the talks. The fact that ivory can still openly be bought in downtown Bangkok will embarrass figures such as Britain's Environment Minister, Elliot Morley. </p> <p>Of equal concern are the findings of an Observer investigation that has unearthed a trial of corruption, harassment and even death threats as elements within Thailand resist efforts to suppress the trade before the gaze of the world's media arrives. Even the Thai Prime Minister, it has emerged, has come under fierce pressure from the powerful interests that profiteer from the covert smuggling of endangered creatures. </p> <p>Today Thailand's dark secret has become second only to the country's notorious narcotics rings in terms of value. And it is just as dangerous. </p> <p>At first glance, the silver Mazda seen trundling down a dirt track towards the Laos border seemed like just another lost traveller. On closer inspection, highway police noticed the vehicle was carrying a load so heavy its boot sank low above the rear axle. The reason soon became clear. Inside they found the bloody carcass of a huge Bengal tiger sawn clean in half. At 4pm the driver Leuthai Tiewchareun was arrested, by 6pm he was free on bail. </p> <p>Manop Laohapraser - one of Thailand's senior Cites officials and a man whom Morley would expect to meet next month - is reported to have arrived at the scene. Despite his presence, no DNA of the tiger was taken, while a microchip embedded in the creature's neck was never reported, making the tiger's origins impossible to deduce. Yet Leuthai was well-known to the authorities. Undercover investigators had identified him as a major player in an illegal animal smuggling network codenamed Cobra. </p> <p>Last November when police raided his home, it looked more like a zoo. More than 20 pairs of bear paws lay beside piles of fresh tiger meat. His deep-freeze contained the body of a baby orang-utan from Indonesia. Back then, Leuthai had been arrested, but had again jumped his \u00a33,000 bail. </p> <p>Sources say he will be in Bangkok as Morley and the UK delegation touch down for Cites on 2 October. Manop himself is now suspended over his alleged involvement in the sale of 100 Bengal tigers to a Chinese theme park that some believed were destined for human consumption. </p> <p>In addition, evidence collated by WildAid and sent to the Thai authorities reveals that Cobra has links to a police intelligence officer as well as a powerful Thai family. Documents detail the bribes Leuthai's network would pay to Thai border officials such as \u00a3150 for up to 400kg of pangolins, a type of anteater. To date, they provide one of the first insights into the corruption that underpins Bangkok's illegal wildlife network. </p> <p>As profits have grown, so too has the involvement of violent criminals. Even the man appointed to clean up Thailand's illegal trade at the behest of the Prime Minister admits he has been threatened after targeting the biggest players. Major-General Sawake Pinsinchai, head of the Forestry Police, told The Observer: 'There have been several threats in the past. The problem in the past and present is that you are fighting some organisations that are part of a very big network and are very well connected to influential people and politicians.' </p> <p>One prominent conservationist was recently told by a Thai official that he could not even attend Cites. Attempts were even made to discredit Edwin Wiek, who runs the acclaimed Wildlife Rescue Centre in Petchaburi, north of Bangkok. Despite nursing 115 previously sickly and malnourished animals he has been arrested and charged on grounds that have left supporters baffled. Other campaigners have fared far worse. One was recently killed after trying to protect a mangrove swamp from developers. A forestry campaigner was shot dead two weeks ago north of Bangkok. 'I am on the list, by the time you found out how high up you are it's too late', one told The Observer last week in the safety of a guarded hotel. </p> <p>Steven Galster, director of Thailand's WildAid, said: 'People get killed around here for a lot less.' More than 240 wildlife dealers, some with suspected connections to corrupt police and border officials are thought to operate out of Bangkok into neighbouring countries. Leuthai's network covers the whole of south-east Asia and relies on Thailand's 1,800 miles of porous borders. Three hours' drive east from Bangkok lies Cambodia and the region of Pailin, a favoured animal smuggling route. So far this year eight people monitoring the Cambodian side have been killed. Some manage to survive ferocious machete attacks. One man recently required 74 stitches. </p> <p>Such murders are safeguarding a system that involves single shipments into Bangkok worth \u00a36 million. Single cargos of 3,000 pangolins and 600 macaws have been found. Figures passed to the Thai authorities reveal \u00a31.6m of illegal wildlife passed through the city in the six months up to March. </p> <p>'As a trading centre Bangkok is just phenomenal, yet we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg,' said Lincolnshire-born Tim Redford of WildAid, who admits he kept his 'head down' for years while investigating the trade. The level of seeming co-operation between criminals and officials continues to infuriate the country's fledgling environmental movement. </p> <p>A common complaint involves the practice of raids on suspect smugglers being called off at the last minute after a tip-off. Equally important is the dealers' ability to operate with impunity. Hundreds have been arrested, but all, like Leuthai, remain free. No one has received the maximum four years in jail. Yet those like Sawake believe they are starting to make a difference. In just one month 198,465 animals, including tigers and bears, were seized in 656 separate shipments. </p> <p>Deep within the endless suburbs of Bangkok, Safari World has found little trouble luring thousands of UK tourists over the years. A firm favourite among British families are the orang-utans forced to wear garish costumes as they mimic Thai boxers. This week, however, the zoo will find itself at the centre of a storm of international outrage that threatens to cast a shadow over the country's hosting of Cites. A year ago the Thai embassy in London received strong evidence that the orang-utans had been smuggled illegally from Indonesia. Sawake ordered an investigation. The zoo owners replied that they had bred the animals and although they once had 110 of the prized apes 41 had been cremated after falling ill. Their claims were rejected. </p> <p>Finally, police raided the centre and found the remaining creatures. They had been hidden in another part of the zoo. Eight days ago the zoo's vet was convicted of lying to the police. The Indonesian authorities are demanding the creatures be handed back. </p> <p>However, a letter seen by The Observer from the director general of Thailand's department for national parks suddenly claims that they would be suspending action against the owners of Safari World. For conservationists hoping for a symbolic victory against wildlife traders it was a major blow. For Sawake it beggared belief. 'If I am asked to drop the case then you better ask someone else to take over,' he said yesterday. There are increasing signs the British government, whose attempts on tackling wildlife crime are ranked among the best in the world, may raise the issue with the Thai authorities this month. Though for many of the world's most precious creatures it will be too late.</p>",

Songs excised from the project sprinkled subsequent Beach Boys records, but any hearings of Smile as a unified opus were restricted to bootlegs that attested to its fractured, half-finished state. Late 2003, however, brought thrilling news indeed: that Wilson and Smile 's librettist Van Dyke Parks were going back to the work they had left behind, with a view to both live performance and its release as an album. Smile 's premiere at the Royal Festival Hall in February caused entirely justified rapture - and after a year of work in the studio, its appearance on CD later this month will only heighten the ecstasy. It is, frankly, wonderful: faithful to the snippets that have emerged so far, shot through with a sense of the era in which it was conceived - but so brimming with ambition and musical intelligence that its timelessness is a given. One word of warning: those who expect Smile 's belated completion to answer the question of what it was all about might be frustrated. At a guess, its 17 tracks amount to a kind of generalised tribute to a primary-coloured notion of America - but their haziness actually informs some of Smile 's charm.

Sex Traffic is epic state of the nation drama (comparisons are already being made with the original Channel 4 series Traffic ) but Morgan also took inspiration from Hollywood.

My Summer of Love is a tale of romantic obsession and the battle between love and religious faith. Working-class Mona (Natalie Press) lives with her brother Phil (Paddy Considine), who used to run a pub before he found God. When she meets rich girl Tamsin (Emily Blunt) who has been suspended from boarding school, they begin an intense and hedonistic friendship. But how much is Tamsin to be trusted? Is she trying to tempt Phil to prove his Christianity is a sham, or are her motives more complicated? Adapted from Helen Cross's novel, the film was shot around Todmorden, West Yorkshire. It's rare to see a love affair between two young women handled with such delicacy by a young male director, and Pawlikowski gets exceptional performances from the two leads.

And now Dirty War, a co-production between the BBC's drama and current affairs departments tackles a radiological 'dirty' bomb attack on London. Co-written by Daniel Percival (Smallpox 2002) and Lizzie Mickery (Messiah), the story focuses on fire crew, anti-terrorist police officers and the international terrorists they are tracking. The 90- minute drama is based on extensive research into the preparations made by emergency services to deal with an attack (the writers also consulted the Muslim community about representation of the terrorists). The aim is to raise debate: should the Government tell us the truth, or stick to a rigid code of secrecy? Best of all is the human dynamic. We get a real sense of what it would be like for us if a bomb exploded at Liverpool Street Station, stranding travellers and making it impossible for emergency services to approach because of the fear of radiation poisoning. How patiently would we wait in line? Do we have a genuine sense of citizenship in a crisis? Crucially the drama is not about scaremongering, it's about survival.

Never mind the dodgy Scottish accent or the anachronistic beauty (Barrie was short and balding with a moustache) - this is the role Depp was born to play. He enters into the fantasy world of Neverland with such utter conviction, it would be churlish to resist.</p> <p>According to the film's director Marc Forster: 'Johnny is perfect to represent a man who never wants to grow up because you can see that he has this very accessible child inside him from the choices of movie roles he makes.' The film opens in London in 1904 where Barrie, a successful playwright, is bored by his fame and trapped in a failing marriage. Unexpectedly, he finds inspiration for a new project walking in Kensington Gardens, where he encounters widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four boys. Barrie befriends the family, falls in love with Sylvia and engages the boys in a fantasy world of cowboys and Indians, pirates and castaways. Soon he has the plot for Peter Pan (which celebrates its 100th anniversary in December 2004). True the film airbrushes any reference to Barrie's sexuality, but with an A-list cast including Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie, this is likely to be Miramax's pre-Christmas smash.

The Plot Against America plays with the idea of alternative history: the aviation hero and anti-semite Charles Lindbergh beats Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1940 election and leads America into a truce with Hitler. From this starting point, the novelist tells the story of his own family, and how their paths and those of millions of American Jews might have been painfully different under a Lindbergh presidency; parallels with America's present fear are subtle but unmissable.

  "<p>It may sound like blasphemy, but with-profits policies are not all bad. In an era of low growth, low inflation and volatile markets, investors are becoming interested in preserving the capital they have rather than risking big losses by chasing growth. </p> <p>So the cautious strategy and smoothed investment returns of with-profits has some advantages. </p> <p>The trouble is, there are too many disadvantages - high charges, the complicated system of annual and terminal bonuses which make it impossible to work out what your policy is worth, compounded by the Market Value Adjuster (MVA) penalty for cashing them in early - to recommend them to many people. </p> <p>Prudential, one of the biggest and strongest of those still writing with-profits policies, is trying to change all that. </p> <p>On Tuesday, amid an advertising fanfare, it will launch the next generation of with-profits which, it says, offers all the advantages of with-profits without any of the drawbacks. </p> <p>Pru's life fund is a reasonable performer. </p> <p>As the chart below shows, it has performed better than alternatives over most periods - and the longer you held it, the better it has done </p> <p>The new product, called PruFund, will invest in Pru's with-profits fund, which comprises a balanced mix of bonds, property, and domestic and overseas shares. That still offers smoothed returns so that, although the risk that the value of the investment will fall remains, it will not be as vulnerable to the vagaries of the stock market as unit-linked policies or direct investment in the market. </p> <p>And, instead of trying to decipher the annual statement to work out how much the policy is worth, investors will be able to check the value through a unit price published daily. </p> <p>That does not mean it is simple, however. Because the returns in a with-profits fund are smoothed, the unit price will not necessarily reflect the value of the fund. Instead, the unit price is based on the growth it expects from the fund in the future, a rate it will set quarterly - the rate at the launch will be 5 per cent. </p> <p>It will check how its estimates compare with reality daily and, if there is a big discrepancy, the unit price will be adjusted, immediately if the difference is more than 10 per cent, or at the next quarterly rate-setting if it is more than 5 per cent. </p> <p>The PruFund also retains some of the less attractive features of conventional with-profits bonds. </p> <p>There will still be surrender penalties for cashing in within five years, although these are set in advance and can no longer be arbitrarily changed. They start at 9 per cent and fall to 1 per cent, in line with the Pru's unit-linked policies, and underline the fact that these policies are suitable only for long-term savings. </p> <p>They will also still pay big commissions to the independent financial advisers who will be the main distributors - 5.25 per cent, which will be recovered from the fund via the charges over the life of the product. These annual charges start at 1.5 per cent for the first five years, falling to 1.25 per cent for the next five years and 1 per cent thereafter. </p> <p>Pru trots out the usual clutch of statistics to show how much this product is needed: \u00a3107 billion is languishing in low-return deposit accounts; 2.6 million of us simply leave it there because we don't know what else to do; half of us would like a more transparent with-profits product. </p> <p>In reality, however, it is a reaction to the fact that sales of its with-profits bonds, which had been a significant contributor to its profits, have plummeted as the recent bear market laid bare their flaws. </p> <p>Advisers say the PruFund is a reasonable attempt at updating with-profits bonds, but Philippa Gee at Torquil Clark complains about the charges, while Clive Scott Hopkins at Towry Law thinks that a distribution fund, which also combines bonds and equities, could be a better bet for many of the retired investors the PruFund is aimed at. </p> <p>Rivals such as Norwich Union and Legal &amp; General are also likely to be trying to update their with-profits figures: PruFund is a reasonable first attempt.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Stuff Happens</strong> National Theatre, London SE1 </p> <p>At the end of the play, one of David Hare's characters comes downstage to stand in an imaginary Iraq. He asks why nobody has bothered to calculate figures for the Iraqi dead. Then he says: 'Until this country takes charge of itself, it will continue to suffer. If you don't do it yourself, this is what you get!' </p> <p>In other words, 'stuff happens' to those who have lost control of their world. They get tortured, massacred, invaded, bombed or looted. But what happens to those who do control the world, who dish out that stuff? Are they as sovereign as their Texan swagger, French shrug or British snigger suggests? Or are they too in the grip of forces which decide what they will say or do? This is what makes history tough for dramatists. Too much determinism, and you get a masque with puppet characters and wobbling giants guised as Greed or Capitalism. Too much free will, and George W Bush becomes a neat chat-show guest whose lines owe nothing to oil, to patriarchal guilt or to the Ground-Zero hole where his self-esteem should be. </p> <p>This is a hugely ambitious play, but in its scale and scope - not in its ideas about the medium. As political theatre, it compromises. The characters - except for two, Colin Powell and Tony Blair - are sketched and don't develop. In that, Stuff Happens is quite unlike Michael Frayn's Democracy, in which the details of Willy Brandt's betrayal become a fable about two men dreaming of other men they might have been. Hare writes in an author's note: 'This is surely a play, not a documentary, and driven, I hope, by its themes as much as by its characters and story.' But neither are the themes heavily emphasised. This is not agitprop, but imaginative reconstruction by a writer who believes that the meetings which led up to the Iraq war were in themselves wonderfully dramatic. So, to amend David Hare's remark, this play is driven by its story rather than by its themes or characters. </p> <p>On a great round plate of a stage, a crowd of actors is shaken and shuffled into different patterns. There is a Security Council lunch, as the French dismantle Anglo-American hypocrisy over the Iraq resolution. There is Blair at Camp David, circling round Bush like an obsequious tailor trying to pull trousers over the President's hairy intentions. There are White House confabulations, with Colin Powell desperately trying to dilute the 'arrogance' of Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz at the Pentagon. We get the grand 'Mission Accomplished' moment on board the USS Abraham Lincoln, as Bush in his flyer-overall struts up to congratulate his warriors. Meeting after meeting conveys the dire hubris of the whole process, as little men and women (Adjoa Andoh is memorable as Condoleezza Rice) pretend to know what they are doing. </p> <p>And yet this is not anti-war pantomime. David Hare's special strength as a political dramatist is that he takes seriously the cases made by 'the other side'. We saw this to brilliant effect in The Permanent Way, Hare's 2003 play about the decline and fall of Railtrack, in which he used the words of bankers, planners and politicians as they spoke earnestly about their own good intentions. In Stuff Happens, Hare does it again. An audience inclined to easy laughter was reduced to uneasy silence as an actor passionately laid out the moral and political arguments in favour of invading Iraq. Later, President Bush is allowed to become convincing, or at least impressive, in his solo speech justifying the doctrine of preventive war. And, as in The Permanent Way, no character in the play gets to state the full protesters' case. Only individual victims - a Palestinian woman, an Iraqi - speak of what the war and American policy has done to them. And only individuals inside the war machines are permitted to express their doubts, which are usually protests against means rather than ends. Hare is giving his audience credit for intelligence. If the war was wrong, then it is the wordy decision-making itself which must show the audience how wrong it was. </p> <p>Only two figures have real 'life' as dramatic characters, growing and changing as the play develops. These are Tony Blair and Colin Powell. The Olivier shook with mocking laughter as Blair (played almost too cruelly by Nicholas Farrell) stumbled about the world begging for moral reassurance from President Bush. Anxiety gives way to panic as he realises how crude the American approach is, and how thin the evidence that Saddam is a global threat. Tantrum flares when Rumsfeld offers to 'help' him by keeping British troops out of action. Finally, as war is replaced by chaos, he sinks into bruised self-righteousness: 'I wasn't sure what I'd be apologising for. And besides, the moment has gone.' </p> <p>Joe Morton plays the other dynamic figure, Colin Powell. Writing in the Guardian , Robin Cook complained that the play 'built [him] up into a more heroic figure than he deserves'. In Hare's dramatisation, the secretary of state becomes a furious protester against the ruthlessness of the policies being sold to the President by the Pentagon hawks and Condoleezza Rice. He bellows at the French, he yells with anger at Vice-President Cheney, he roars at the President himself. As a performance, Joe Morton brings it off. But as drama, it is weak. When Powell marches off in disgust, are we meant to see him as a noble rebel or a resigned accomplice? Anyway, there is no evidence that cautious Colin ever blew off like this in the White House, or anywhere else. He is known to have disliked the war, but he certainly did nothing noticeable to stop it. </p> <p>Does the play work? Public interest in it is enormous, and gun-jumping reviews have filled the papers. But the audience seemed to leave the theatre feeling slightly unfulfilled. In spite of all its wit, this play lacks the tautness and structural boldness of David Hare's best work. The mixture of one- and two-dimensional characters is awkward. The lesson - that the weak will be wasted by second-rate chancers who have guns, money and a plausible ideology - is well demonstrated, but without surprises. What about that tsunami of public wrath which ran round the world in 2003? Stuff Happens reminds us of what we understood then, but not of what we felt.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Divorce</strong><br> </p> <p> Harry Katz, principal of Norwest Consultants, a financial adviser in Middlesex, says you should expect assets to be equally divided. 'You need to start from the basis that they are going to be split 50-50, although if the wife is getting remarried or is cohabiting with another man, the issue might be less clear-cut,' he says. </p> <p>For women who have given up work or gone part-time to raise children, divorce can mean a big drop in household income and the loss of financial security. Fiona Sharp, an adviser at Finance for Women, part of M2 Financial in Cambridge, says: 'Since December 2000 it has been possible for women to claim a share of their husband's pension, even if it is already in payment - though how much depends on all other assets. In the past there was a lot of offsetting in divorce settlements - the wife took the house and the husband kept the pension - but this left a lot of women without income.' </p> <p>Katz says that very often the husband's pension is couple's largest single asset. </p> <p><strong> Bereavement</strong></p> <p> If you are cohabiting but not married, you may not be entitled to benefits unless you have made a will together. </p> <p>Initially you will need to deal with the will and the estate. The executors may need to get a grant of probate from the Probate Registry to give them the authority to deal with the estate. If the person who died didn't leave a will, but had money or property, an application for legal authority to administer the estate should be made to the Probate Registry. You can get more information from the Probate and Inheritance Tax Helpline (0845 30 20 900). If you need assistance with the legal process, contact a citizens advice bureau, a solicitor or, if you are on a low income, a legal aid scheme. </p> <p><strong> The future</strong> </p> <p> Whether you are left a lump sum or receive one as part of a divorce settlement, you should take your time before investing or spending it. Sharp says: 'You shouldn't make a decision quickly, as your views will change. Sometimes people are emotionally attached to the money that a loved one left them, and don't want to spend it, but after a while they come to realise that they will need to spend some of it to survive. Everyone's circumstances are different.' </p> <p>She says that deciding how to structure your investments depends on your attitude to risk. 'You may need to consider slightly more risky products to generate a greater return. But you need to be comfortable accepting losses as well as growth. If not, you might have to reduce your expenses.' </p> <p><strong> Allowances</strong> </p> <p> You may be entitled to welfare benefits for widows and widowers or the pension credit.

  "<p>As a new generation of students looks forward to living away from home for the first time, many are about to fall for one of the oldest scams in the book. </p> <p>A report by Shelter and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (Nacab) says that in the past academic year nearly 35,000 students had problems recovering deposits put down on accommodation. This means about \u00a35.5 million of students' much-needed cash finds its way into the pockets of dodgy landlords. </p> <p>'Students are seen by landlords as an easy target,' says Helen Symons of the National Union of Students. 'Unfortunately, rubbish accommodation and rip-off landlords are seen as a rite of passage. We know some that have lost thousands of pounds over three or four years of their courses. They have lost all or most of their deposits every time they've moved, usually unfairly.' </p> <p>Jevon Hynds, a 24-year old former engineering student at the University of Hertfordshire, left a house rented in Hatfield with three friends 12 months ago. They still haven't recovered their \u00a31,260 deposit, despite being assured that they would. Jevon recalls that when they first moved into their new home, it was like 'walking into a crime scene', with the previous tenants' possessions scattered around - 'down to his slippers in the wardrobe'. </p> <p>'But also it was dirty, the washing machine didn't work, the bathroom door didn't lock and the shower was broken,' he says. 'We didn't even have gas for the first four weeks, because there was no gas card for the meter.' </p> <p>The four friends were glad to leave last June and assumed that they would recover their deposit in full. However their landlord insisted they had to pay \u00a360 professional cleaning costs as well as an extra 10 days' rent after one of their number, Neal, agreed to stay on after their tenancy ended. 'It was simply ridiculous,' Jevon says. 'We left the house in a far better state than we found it, and the arrangement between Neal and the landlord had absolutely nothing to with us and our tenancy agreement.' </p> <p>In February the ex-students went to their local citizens' advice bureau, which advised them to write to the landlord saying that they would pursue their claim through the Small Claims Court. 'Since then the trail has gone cold and we haven't had a penny,' Jevon says. 'But what do you do? We're left with no alternative now but to take him to court. When you've just left college this is a lot of money, but there's a point of principle. This is our money.' </p> <p>Of course, troublesome landlords do not just prey upon students: last year Shelter and Nacab reckoned that more than \u00a320 million of deposits were wrongfully held back by landlords and agents each year. The Government has recognised the problem and, according to its figures, one in five tenants is ripped off by unscrupulous landlords. </p> <p>To this end, ministers have promised to amend the Housing Bill to include a protection scheme for tenants' deposits whereby the money would be held independently in either a government-run or a recognised industry scheme. 'This is absolutely fantastic news for our clients,' comments Andrew Davies, the director of Brighton and Hove CAB. </p> <p>However the legislation is not yet on the statute books so will be of no help for students starting their academic year next month. </p> <p>'When students leave a property, they're usually moving somewhere else the same day, so they need that money as deposit for the next property,' Davies says. 'In Brighton, that's usually at least a month's rent, and you're talking \u00a31,000, even for student accommodation. People tend to pay for that through overdrafts, or by sticking it on their credit card or other high-cost credit.' </p> <p>So what can you do to avoid Rachman-style landlords? First of all, you may be able to negotiate the amount of deposit payable. It is common for some landlords to charge only the first two weeks' rent for more basic accommodation or even waive a deposit completely. Alternatively, you can see if your landlord, or letting agent, is signed up to one of the existing approved letting schemes run by a third party. </p> <p>'The first thing we advise prospective tenants is to ask the landlord, or agency, whether that money is kept in a separate account and whether they will receive interest on it at the end,' says Davies. </p> <p>Completing a full inventory, or checking the landlord's, is vital. 'Make sure there are no major discrepancies or inaccuracies,' advises John Gallagher, a solicitor at Shelter. Cover every angle and make sure meter readings are listed as well as the age of items like furniture and carpets. Bear in mind that rent covers a sum for 'fair wear and tear'. One tip is to buy a couple of disposable cameras and take photos of the accommodation when you move in and when you leave. 'A regrettably familiar practice is for landlords to say that they needed an industrial cleaner because the place was left in a terrible state whether it was or wasn't,' Gallagher adds. </p> <p>Ask the landlord to confirm in writing any agreement to pay you before you leave the property. Should you fail to get your deposit back, you can always take your landlord to the Small Claims Court, which is geared towards non-lawyers.</p> <p><strong>Top tips from Shelter</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Look for a landlord, or letting agent, that belongs to a professional body, such as Association of Residential Letting Agents, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or the National Association of Estate Agents. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> At the start of the tenancy, get the landlord to fill in and agree a full inventory. Note the state of any fixtures and fittings that come with the flat as well as the general decorative condition.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Get a receipt for your deposit and agree to the terms of the deposit's return.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> If you are worried, take photographs of the property at the start of the tenancy, and date them.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> At the end of the tenancy arrange for the landlord, or agent, to review the state of the property and get them to agree to when the deposit will be returned. If you are worried about getting the deposit back, it may be worth taking photos of the state of the property again.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> You are responsible for any damage you cause, but you are not liable for fair wear and tear. Landlords are responsible for the upkeep of a property.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> If you have problems contact your local citizens advice bureau or Shelter advice centre.</p>",

  "Spain's brightest young film director and one of its best actors have been the unlikely sparks to ignite a debate over whether this Catholic country should legalise euthanasia. <p>A new film about the true-life suicide of Ram\u00f3n Sampedro, a charismatic, tetraplegic sailor, drew most of the Spanish cabinet and prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, to the opening night. </p> <p>Made by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar, who directed Nicole Kidman in The Others, and starring Javier Bardem, the film is becoming an unexpected hit. As Spaniards pour into cinemas, Zapatero has come under pressure to follow the Dutch and Belgian examples by legalising euthanasia. Spain's Catholic church has conducted a ferocious campaign to prevent euthanasia getting anywhere near the statute books. </p> <p>Sampedro, paralysed from the neck down by a diving accident at 25, became famous, and adored by many women, in Spain because of his long and doomed battle for permission to kill himself. </p> <p>What the film Mar Adentro (The Sea Inside) does not prove, and what Spanish police are unable to discover, is the identity of whoever prepared a potassium cyanide concoction Sampedro drank to kill himself - a crime carrying a 10-year jail sentence. </p> <p>'When I have drunk this I will have renounced one of the worst types of slavery, that of being a living head glued to a dead body,' Sampedro said on a videotape later shown on TV. 'You can punish the person helping me if you want. But you know that what you will simply be doing is seeking revenge,' he said on the tape, which was watched many times by the actors in The Sea Inside. Senior members of Zapatero's party, backed by some opposition groups, want him to deliver on an election pledge and set up a parliamentary committee to investigate legalising euthanasia. </p> <p>'Parliament is the right forum for finding out how people feel about this subject,' said Matilde Valent\u00edn, social affairs spokeswoman for the Socialists. Her call was backed by Salvador Paniker, president of Spain's Right To Die With Dignity group, who said that polls showed 70 per cent of Spaniards favoured legalising euthanasia. 'The people's opinion on this is way ahead of that of the politicians, who have decided to look in the opposite direction,' said Paniker, a Spanish philosopher and writer. </p> <p>'The film invites us to reflect,' agreed the justice minister, Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar, who nevertheless said there were no immediate plans to introduce a law. </p> <p>Zapatero, asked to give his opinion, admitted that personally he could not have helped Sampedro to kill himself but said it was time for a proper debate. 'The film, paradoxically, is a hymn to life,' he said. 'The defence of the freedom to die is, itself, a hymn to life.' </p> <p>The Catholic church has attacked the film, adding euthanasia to a long list of battles it is waging with the Socialist government, which has pledged to introduce gay marriage, make divorce and abortion easier, and limit religious education. </p> <p>Luis de Moya, a priest and also a tetraplegic, denounced the film as being 'drenched with falsities' and accused Amen\u00e1bar, 31, of deliberately leading people to believe that euthanasia was the best thing for tetraplegics. </p> <p>'If euthanasia is legalised in Spain, I imagine \"specialist\" centres will soon spring up as they have done in other countries,' said de Moya. 'It will be just like with the abortion clinics.' </p> <p>Mar\u00eda del Mar Cogollos, president of a Spanish spinal injuries association, said Sampedro, who died in 1998, was an anti-hero: 'He never managed to come to terms with his condition. This film will do a lot of harm to tetraplegics like myself who fight daily to get on with life.' </p> <p>The New York Times hailed the film, shown at the Venice Film Festival last week, as 'poignant' and an early contender for the Golden Lion prize, while Bardem is considered a potential for the best actor's award. </p> <p>'I read Ram\u00f3n Sampedro's book a few years ago and I don't know if it was because it was about death, or if it was the way he expressed himself, but I was absolutely enthralled,' Amen\u00e1bar said. Bardem, 35, needed five hours of make-up a day to transform him into a tetraplegic 50-year-old. </p> <p>'It certainly was an enormous physical challenge,' said Bardem, who won best actor in Venice in 2000 for his role as gay Cuban poet, Reinaldo Arenas, in Before Night Falls. 'I could only move my neck, my head and my eyes.'</p>",
  "<p>'I think that pink is in my DNA', exclaims designer Karim Rashid. 'When I was a teenager, I was really into it.' For his Toronto high-school prom, he designed a suit for himself and had it made up in pink satin. He then dyed his hair and painted his nails to match. 'Things were more flamboyant back then, much more experimental,' he says. 'It was almost a cool thing to do.' Dress codes may have changed since, but Rashid is still into vibrant hues. 'What I love about colours that are between orange and pink is the high energy. They make you feel like you're alive.'</p> <p>In the living area of his New York loft, a kind of sprawling orange blob acts as a sofa. There are several curvaceous powder-pink chairs and ottomans and one wall is adorned with a flash of bright pink wallpaper called Replicant - part of a collection Rashid designed for Wolf-Gordon.</p> <p>Rashid has lived in the flat for five years now. He acquired half of the building in 1997 during a housing boom in New York. </p> <p>'The rents were going out of control, so I decided that I had to buy something,' he recalls. What he came across was a 'kind of fallow factory building' in the Chelsea district, built in 1898.</p> <p>'I was looking for such a raw space that I could really start from scratch,' says Rashid. This one was perfect. The ground floor had been a horse stable. The first floor had been used for 20 years as a plumbing supply storage. There was no water, no heating and no electrics. There were, however, rats everywhere, one-metre holes in the floors and hooks that had formerly been used for feeding the horses.</p> <p>On the ground floor, he installed his office. Since setting up his company in 1993, he has designed well over 800 products. They include his iconic Garbo trash can (more than 2m have been sold), interlocking perfume bottles for Issey Miyake, Prada's single-dose skincare line and even special-edition manhole covers for the streets of Manhattan. He has recently completed the Semiramis Hotel in Athens. Next up will be a 96-room hostelry called My Bright in Brighton. Rashid promises that it will be 'very soft and digital'. There won't be a sharp corner in sight and 'you'll be able to open your door by waving your card at it'.</p> <p>Rashid may need a key to get into the flat above the office, which he shares with his digital painter wife Megan Lang, yet it does have other advantages. It is, for instance, like almost every other space Rashid has lived in. 'They have all been long and narrow,' he says. Many years ago, he had a loft in Toronto that was just four metres wide and 24 metres deep. 'It had no windows, just skylights,' he remembers.</p> <p>Light also proved a problem in his Chelsea apartment. Originally, there were just four small windows at the front. He replaced them with floor-to-ceiling openings and also punched a huge window into the side wall. He then treated the space as one volume and hid all the utilities in a 'box', which runs down one side of the flat. In there, you can find the washer-dryer, the heater, a closet and the second bathroom. He also tested out a super-light concrete for the floors. 'It was a disaster. It just didn't level. It all undulated. In the sitting room, it goes up and down like lava.'</p> <p>Curvaceous lines are present throughout. Both the kitchen cabinets and the bathroom floor bear Rashid's trademark Morphscape pattern. Most of the furniture has rounded corners. One exception is the dining table which he made out of glass backed with a silver film for Zeritalia. 'I wouldn't do it like that now,' he says. 'It's hard today to live in the linear world of Descartes. It's a more organic world, which is not to say that we should live in some kind of bubble. </p> <p>It's just that we don't really need square edges on tables.' He learnt this lesson the hard way recently while staying at the Philippe Starck-designed Clift Hotel in San Francisco. He got up at 4am and broke his toe on the edge of a coffee table.</p> <p>One word that is central to his design philosophy is evolution. In 2001, he published his first book and called it Karim Rashid: I Want to Change the World. 'I don't want to live in a regressive environment. </p> <p>I don't have any ambition to be associated with the past at all.' The oldest thing in his flat is a Rosenthal vase from 1951. He also has two vintage Bang &amp; Olufsen stereos from 1968 and 1978. 'The latter is from my teenage years,' he says. </p> <p>'I remember saving all my money to buy it. My mother thought I was out of my mind.' He also has a few Memphis pieces - ceramics by Matteo Thun, a Michele De Lucchi bedside table and Ettore Sottsass's iconic penis vase (Rashid trained with the maestro during his graduate studies in Italy).</p> <p>Otherwise, practically everything else in the flat is of his own design. As he once said, 'I've surrounded myself with my own creations in a rather egocentric way.' He uses the front part of the flat for testing out his new prototypes. He brings one up for a week or so and then replaces it with another. 'Kids love the flat more than adults,' he remarks. 'I don't want to use the term \"playful\", but there is a happy spirit about the place.'</p>",
  "<p>The Sun's voracious editor, Rebekah Wade, recently sent a text message to her most senior journalists complaining: 'We haven't had a decent scoop since Hutton' (when the paper secured an early copy of the report). She went on to warn that, if they didn't come up with a few, she would hire some journalists who would. Sun insiders laugh off the incident, but others detect a whiff of panic at the nation's best-selling daily title, which celebrates its 40th birthday this week. </p> <p>Wade was unhappy with the paper's treatment of Home secretary David Blunkett's alleged affair after being beaten to the story by the News of the World, her old paper, berating her staff for failing to keep pace with The Mirror's coverage. The fact that News of the World editor Andy Coulson clearly covets her job is adding to the pressure. Some see Coulson as the king across the water and his reputation is growing with every scoop he brings in. Like Wade before him, Coulson has created an esprit de corps at 'the Screws' but Wade has found it difficult to create the same rapport with the Sun's more established reporters that she enjoyed with her young News of the World team. Wade portrays herself as a risk-taker who wants to re-establish the Sun's reputation as a provocative, anti-establishment newspaper by placing campaigning journalism at its heart. She is impatient to break big stories, as her text admonishment shows. Insiders say the episode is symptomatic of Wade's abrasive management style, although her supporters emphasise she is 'a highly visible news presence' on the newsroom floor and praise her hands-on approach. </p> <p>They point out that the paper remains hugely profitable. News International does not reveal how much its titles make (or lose), but City analysts estimate that the Sun contributes profits of about \u00a3100 m a year to News International's coffers. Advertising revenue is improving and the circulation battle with its fiercest competitor, the Daily Mirror, was fought and won long ago. </p> <p>News International insiders claim it will be outselling its great rival by two to one by the beginning of next year. Not bad for a paper given a six-month life expectancy by many Fleet Street 'experts' when it was relaunched in November 1969 under the editorship of Larry Lamb. It is one of the great ironies of newspaper history that the Mirror 's nemesis was founded by its greatest editor, Hugh Cudlipp, who oversaw the relaunch of the ailing Daily Herald as a left-leaning 'progressive' title in 1964. </p> <p>Murdoch picked up the Sun from the Mirror's parent company, IPC, for a bargain \u00a380,000 five years later, when its sales had plummeted to below 700,000, and set about turning it into an uncompromisingly populist title that occupies a unique place in British cultural life. By the late Seventies it was regularly selling more than 4m copies a day. </p> <p>The first serious threat came with the launch of the Daily Star in 1978, which has recently been resuscitated by Richard Desmond. Its sales have doubled under his proprietorship, but Sun sources claim its growth spurt may be over and that its circulation has 'plateaued', arguing that there is a limit to how far it can climb under Desmond's cost-averse business model. 'We think it has run out of gas,' says one Sun insider. </p> <p>The same cannot be said of the Daily Mail, which has achieved total dominance of the mid-market. Senior Industry figures say the young Lord Rothermere believes he will secure his place in media history by making the Mail Britain's best-selling paper. </p> <p>The Mail passed one landmark when its started to outsell the Mirror and its long-term aim is to surpass the Sun. The portents are promising. The Saturday edition of the Mail could outstrip the Sun 's within two years, say industry executives. It currently sells around 3.2m to the Sun 's 4.1m and Associated is spending heavily to try to close that gap. The Sun is fighting back with a beefed-up TV magazine, a 96-page listings guide that boasts more readers than the Radio Times. </p> <p>Saturdays are becoming a key battleground in what could become a wider war between the two titles for overall ascendancy in the dailies market. Senior industry sources say Rothermere recognises that the Mail needs to soften its editorial tone to widen its readership and rein in Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief, if necessary. </p> <p>'Rothermere is beginning to wrest control from Dacre,' claims one. Dacre played no part in Associated's unsuccessful Telegraph bid and his role as the Mail 's editorial overlord would not have been expanded to include the Telegraph if Associated had bought it. For the Mail, that could ultimately lead to a fascinating battle between Rothermere and Dacre, arguably the most powerful journalist on Fleet Street.</p> <p>For the Sun, a less cynical Mail, stripped of its vitriol, could one day represent a major threat. Sources close to News International say the Mail 's rapid growth is the great unmentionable at the company. 'They are in denial,' claims one, although others say that News International's executive chairman, Les Hinton, is increasingly conscious of the threat. </p> <p>No wonder Murdoch jumped at the chance to take the Times tabloid, launching a downsized version that some say has a mid-market feel. Closing the gap on the Telegraph is Murdoch's prime objective, of course, but opening a second front against the Mail may help to stall its onward march.</p> <p>Murdoch famously predicted that the UK newspaper market would one day consist of the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Times. That prediction has not been borne out and now the unspoken assumption contained in that statement - that the Sun would be the best-selling paper of the three - could soon be put to the test.</p>",
  "<p>There are two ways to create an encyclopaedia. </p> <p>The first involves being a publisher, convening a distinguished editorial board, deciding which subjects are to be covered, and then commissioning learned experts to write articles. These are then edited, illustrated, printed, bound in handsome volumes and sold at whopping prices to libraries and autodidactic families. This is the Encyclopaedia Britannica way, and it worked well for two and a half centuries until Bill Gates had the idea of doing an encyclopaedia on CD-Rom with lots of animations and calling it 'Encarta'. </p> <p>The other way of creating an encyclopaedia is to create a space on the Web and invite passers-by to write articles. This is such a preposterous idea that nobody in their right mind would entertain it for a moment. How, then, do we explain the fact that someone has done it, and that it is a raging success? It's called Wikipedia and, like Google, it is one of the wonders of the world. It began as an English-language project in January 2001 and it currently contains more than 310,000 articles in English and more than 530,000 in other languages. It's an 'open source' project - all of its content is in the public domain. You can find it at <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">www.wikipedia.org</a>. </p> <p>Wikipedia is the online reference work I use most, even though I have the CD-Rom edition of Britannica and a bookcase full of reference works. Type a search term into its search box and up pops a page. I've just keyed in ' The Observer ' and it tells me that 'the Observer is a broadsheet newspaper of the United Kingdom published on Sundays. It takes a liberal/social democratic line on most issues and is the world's first Sunday newspaper'. It goes on to give an accurate account of the paper's history and ownership, and provides links to our website. </p> <p>Which is nice, but not that special. Hang on, though - there's a link which says 'Edit this page'. If you click on it, the text appears in a window and you can change it on the spot. If you make alterations and press the 'Save page' button, that entry will be changed, and the encyclopaedia will have been updated - by you. </p> <p>Now that is truly weird, is it not? After all, we have a mental model of an encyclopaedia as a tablet of stone. And the thing about stone tablets is that they are read-only. Yet here is something that is entirely malleable - whose entries can be changed by any Tom, Dick or Harry. How could it possibly be any good? </p> <p>Yet it is. I use Wikipedia regularly, and it's often very good indeed. I've just compared its entry on Iraq with that in the CIA Factbook (possibly the only unambiguously useful service ever provided by that agency). The entries are comparable in their scope and coverage: the CIA publication is better on statistics; Wikipedia is better on history and culture. The other day I looked up 'TCP/IP' (the core protocols of the internet) on Wikipedia and Britannica Online. The Wikipedia entry was much more comprehensive. </p> <p>There's been a debate recently about the accuracy of Wikipedia, triggered by comments in the mainstream media by columnists who cannot bring themselves to believe that anything created by a self-organising collective effort could be any good. This led Ed Felten, a well-known computer scientist, to conduct an informal test by looking up entries on subjects familiar to him and comparing Wikipedia with Britannica. On most of his test subjects, Wikipedia won hands down. Where it faltered was on the Microsoft anti-trust case: Felten detected multiple errors - and then went on to correct them. I have no doubt that his blog entry describing all this will prompt someone else to go and revise the entire entry. </p> <p>And what, say the sceptics, about vandalism? What's to stop some clown defacing Wikipedia pages? The answer is: not much - though there are some safeguards in place for blocking known hooligans. And pages do get vandalised. But what's interesting is the speed with which they are repaired by other people. Researchers who have examined this phenomenon have commented on how effective Wikipedia's 'self-healing' properties are.</p> <p>And therein lies a clue to the project's significance. We have become so imbued by the conventional wisdom of managerial capitalism that we think the only way to do things is via hierarchical, top-down, tightly controlled organisations that are highly tuned and incredibly fragile. Wikipedia is none of these things, yet it works brilliantly. There's a lesson there for control freaks.

  "<p> <strong> Memoirs of a Gnostic Dwarf <br> by David Madsen</strong> <br> Dedalus \u00a38.99, pp336 </p> <p> First published in 1995, it has taken years for this historical novel to gain the recognition it deserves. Set in the 16th century, it is narrated by a dwarf who has risen from humble beginnings to become Pope Leo X's most intimate confidant - but is secretly a gnostic. The narrative is propelled by an original imaginative energy and a beguiling, though sometimes, wearying mix of bawdiness and erudition: circus freaks, heretics and hunchbacks leap off pages that are also peppered with fragments of gnostic liturgies. Madsen warns us that his tale is 'somewhat salacious', and Leo's sexual and political proclivities are a far cry from his more familiar image as cultivated patron of Michelangelo. If you think Madsen can't get any more outrageous, try his second novel, The Confessions of a Flesh-Eater (1997), the tale of a gourmet's cannibalism</p> <p> <strong> The Fountain at the Centre of the World <br> by Robert Newman</strong> <br> Verso \u00a37.99, pp342 </p> <p> Chano Salgado wonders if the fountain in his local cafe might be responding minutely to everything going on everywhere in the world. The plot of this ambitious anti-globalisation novel shows how the global shudders through the minutiae of individual lives. Chano, a Mexican political dissident, is on the run after being persuaded to blow up a corporation's life-sapping pipelines. His wife has been shot by militia for attending a political meeting, and his long-lost brother, a PR executive for the corporations responsible for Chano's oppression, is dying of a beetle-borne disease and travelling to Mexico in search of a bone-marrow match. Although his characters sometimes spout too many sermons and despite some rather laboured symbolism, Robert Newman's third novel is as funny as it is serious, as it travels from London to Seattle's WTO street demonstrations. At the fringes of society, Newman gathers these scattered people together with considerable skill and poignancy. </p> <p> <strong> Dead Girls <br> by Nancy Lee</strong> <br> Faber \u00a37.99, pp306 </p> <p> Nightmarish television news crackles through the eight stories in Canadian author Nancy Lee's debut collection, telling of the dead prostitutes whose bones are unearthed in the backyard of a retired dentist in Vancouver. In the title story, the news besieges a woman who hasn't heard from her missing daughter for more than a year and who is broken with anxiety. With subtlety, sensuousness and surprising humour, Lee's fragmentary tales of women regarded as expendable explore emotional dislocation and the confused contours between living and dead in a haunting second-person singular - 'Your own skin seems to blur into the air around you, wash into the sheets.' They tell of relationships destroyed by too much intimacy, troubled by too much human touch: 'You worry about the dense scrub of relationship, an overgrowth of tenderness.' Lee keeps control of a high-pitched pain as she shows the disturbing speed at which affection can edge into brutality. </p>",
  "<p>The air last week was full - for those who breathe such air - of cultured lamentations. In the first episode of a two-part essay in the London Review of Books, the historian Perry Anderson was describing and accounting for the decline of modern France. For him, the rot could be viewed best in developments in the world of ideas. So Anderson contrasted the France that produced a richness of world-class intellectuals such as Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Derrida, Braudel, Lacan, and Foucault, with a France that now produces zip. Or, in Anderson's opinion - in the shapes of Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy and Michel Houellebecq - worse than zip. </p> <p>To parallel Anderson's characteristically grand narrative, last week also saw the publication of a new book by Frank Furedi, professor of sociology at Kent University, de facto rector of the Institute of Ideas and former swami of Living Marxism, entitled Where Have All The Intellectuals Gone? This is a more obviously British affair, being a well-argued 160-page grumble about dumbing down, the age of spin and (though Furedi never uses the phrase) political correctness. </p> <p>Furedi's thesis is that intellectuals in Britain - defined as universalist thinkers whose main role is to search for Truth (his capitalisation) and who intervene in the public affairs of their day - are dying out. The result is a growing philistinism which envelops all aspects of life, from the academic to the artistic and cultural. It's filling universities with students who don't read, political discourse with sound-bites; it's replacing theory with narrow experience, excellence with mediocrity, hard-won understanding with facile comprehension. </p> <p>But why is this retreat happening, and who's responsible? Anderson initially blames America - or rather, the impact of neo-liberal 'economic arrangements that began in the era of Thatcher and Reagan', and are now swamping all that was best about France. Including its cinema, reducing all that Truffaut to bloody Amelie. </p> <p>Furedi denounces a number of enemies. The pursuit of universalist truths has been given a knocking by the rise of postmodernism, he argues. After all, if there can be no truth, why search for Truth? The postmodernists have created an alibi for philistinism through their relativism. Nothing is better than anything else, everything is a - more or less - equally valid narrative. </p> <p>There is an irony in Furedi's complaint, and one he doesn't acknowledge. It is, of course, that the postmodernist intellectuals (including Anderson's Foucault) are precisely the kind of people who Furedi says he wants to see more of - intellectuals creating universalist theories on the basis of what appears to them to be true. So one possible answer to the question of whatever happened to intellectuals is that many became postmodernists, and have driven everybody else - as intellectuals always have - round the bend. </p> <p>Anyway, let them go on their infinite ways and turn to Furedi's other foes. One of which is the managerial class, who have presided over the professionalisation of universities and other cultural centres, and their transformation into institutions which are technocratic, specialised and task-related. This complaint, though, must be about degree. The study of law and medicine, for example - staples of the old system - have always been technocratic. Let alone engineering. The question must rather be about whether there is also space for thought for thought's sake. </p> <p>But Furedi's biggest idea is that intellectual life has been undermined by the pursuit of 'inclusion' for its own sake. We're talking here about our vulgar, crotch-scratching old pal, the lowest common denominator. Everywhere he looks, Furedi sees dumbing down as a consequence of the desire on the part of what he calls the 'cultural elite' not to exclude anyone, or to somehow draw people in. </p> <p>Furedi does not define the cultural elite and indeed sometimes doesn't seem to be sure whether there's one or a number of cultural elites. But you know what he means. Everywhere the challenging and the demanding is replaced by the accessible and the attractive. </p> <p>I note here that Furedi himself might be cited by an uncharitable critic as being an example of what he himself decries. His list of publications reads like a Sunday supplement flat-plan: Culture of Fear, Paranoid Parenting and Therapy Culture. The contrarian Institute of Ideas has become the first number called by lazy radio producers wanting a five-minute argument. </p> <p>This doesn't mean Furedi's wrong. I too can see a tendency towards a sapless tolerance of bad argument, and columnists these days are far more likely to face the criticism that they somehow 'offend' people, than that they fail to conform with the political or ethical prejudices of their editors or proprietors. And he's right about the anti-scientific weight given to personal testimony over longitudinal evidence. Just think how the families of a few autistic children have hijacked the debate about the health of all our children, using the argument 'we are the parents, therefore we know'. </p> <p>There is something, however, distinctly reactionary about Furedi's remaining villain, the public policy of broadening access to higher education - an element of the 'inclusion' he dislikes. In Anderson's essay it appears as democratisation on the cheap, or 'broadening access to education without the resources necessary to maintain the standards of the narrow system'. In Furedi it isn't about the resources, it is about loosening the standards so that possible new entrants won't feel excluded. This is access for its own sake - who cares what the students are doing as long they're there? Not Fame Academy but Whatever Academy. </p> <p>That this dumbing down is happening is a hugely popular prejudice among former students who are now middle-aged. At Alan Bennett's remarkably successful The History Boys, the biggest laugh on the night came when the least academic, most working-class and crassest boy - Rudge - recounted how he had just been admitted to an Oxford college purely on the basis of his father having been a college servant there. Whatever Bennett's intention, the audience's reaction was clear. Rudge was getting a cherished place not because of merit, but because of inverted snobbery. </p> <p>In a favourable review of the Furedi book in last week's New Statesman, Terry Eagleton claims that Furedi is no Melanie Phillips with a desire to return to a golden past. But I wonder. Thus Furedi argues, on broadening access, that, 'in principle, creating equal opportunities for all is a worthwhile objective. Increasing public participation in cultural and intellectual life is a goal that anyone with democratic leanings can support.' </p> <p>The pusillanimous words 'worthwhile' and 'can support' stick out, standing in place of a truly progressive 'essential' and 'must fight for'. Furedi will deign to tolerate democratisation, but only if the would-be participants match his exacting standards. </p> <p>It is the standards, not the democratisation that matter. </p> <p>He uses an analogy with voting procedures. Misguided people are trying to make voting easier, a process which simply undermines the value of voting. Though he doesn't say so, Furedi implies that, in fact, voting ought to be made more difficult, limited perhaps to people who have read all the manifestoes and who turn up at far-flung polling stations between the hours of midnight and one wearing a red wig. </p> <p>This is telling. The 'cultural elites' who want broadened access to higher education want it because they think the experience benefits both the student (who - as a citizen - has something of a right to be so benefited) and the society. The people who don't want it, it strikes me, are still those who would like to maintain their privileges, safe from scrutiny or (a word that Furedi hates) accountability. They don't want the unwashed walking through their corridors or inspecting their books. </p> <p>Too late, Frank. We aren't going back to Cambridge 1936, to that fabulous race of warrior dons who knew everything, to the days when intellectuals were intellectuals and women were their wives and mistresses, to a world when some people always got to talk and never had to listen. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Frank Furedi: Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone? is published by Continuum, \u00a312.99.</p>",
  "<p>Opec, the oil producers' cartel, is poised to raise its target price range for a barrel of crude this week - delivering a harsh message to oil-guzzling economies to get used to a $30 floor under prices. </p> <p>Ministers from Opec's member nations meet in Vienna on Thursday, and will discuss the future of the $22 to $28 target band, which has been breached continuously since December last year. </p> <p>Several countries, including Venezuela, which is already pumping at capacity, have signalled that they believe the target is now unrealistic. Purnomo Yusgiantoro, Opec's president, said last week: 'The price range we have today of $22 to $28 a barrel was decided back in 2000. There has to be a different price range today.' </p> <p>Prices have been boosted in recent weeks by concerns about the security of supplies from the embattled Russian firm Yukos, and the slower-than-expected restoration of oil exports from Iraq. </p> <p>But analysts say the basic problem is the fastest growth in demand for a generation, coupled with long-term underinvestment in oil infrastructure. </p> <p>Raising the band would send a warning to consumers and companies that they should accept $30 a barrel as the norm, and give Opec a more realistic target. </p> <p>'It would be symbolic. It would be a signal that Opec thinks something has changed in the oil market,' says Kevin Norrish, commodity market analyst at Barclays Capital. 'Otherwise, the target just becomes completely irrelevant.' </p> <p>He believes that the current price rise also reflects an underestimate of how quickly production from mature fields, including in the North Sea, would decline. Britain recorded a trade deficit in oil in July for the first time in 13 years. </p> <p>But explicitly targeting a higher price would risk the fury of politicians keen to see energy costs brought under control. Chancellor Gordon Brown said on Friday he had asked Opec to 'signal the action needed to bring prices to a level consistent with sustained world growth'. </p> <p>Economists have become concerned about the health of the global economy since oil prices took off in the summer. Opec pledged to stabilise the market, but have already ramped up production by 1.5 million barrels per day to 29.3m in the last four months with little impact on prices. </p> <p>Thursday's meeting is likely to result in another small rise in production quotas, but since Opec members are are already breaking their official targets, and have little spare capacity, analysts say it will be little more than an acceptance of reality.</p> <p><strong>BP chemical sale</strong></p> <p>BP IS set to make \u00a32.3bn from the sale of around half of its petrochemicals division.

  "<p>Why square blocks wouldn't fit in round holes and why I could never manage to colour inside the black lines were just some of the many conundrums that puzzled me when I was at primary school. But the one thing that took me many years to figure out was the puzzle of the 'Black Book'. </p> <p>The 'Black Book' was an object of which my fellow seven-year-old classmates and I lived in total fear. It contained the names of all the naughty children who would be punished. But what I could never understand was why my teacher called this bright orange book 'black'. What confused me even more was that, when I innocently put this question to my teacher, he said I was a troublemaker, just like my mother. </p> <p>'Racism, it seems, is going out of fashion,' wrote Tony Sewell, director of the Hackney Learning Trust, earlier this year. He argued that black people needed to snap out of their 'culture of victimhood' and stop perceiving racism as a bar to black advancement. </p> <p>But when I read the report published last week by the London Development Agency's Education Commission, highlighting the way the education system had failed black pupils, I found little evidence to support Sewell's view. The report focused on the discrimination faced by black boys in inner-city schools. However, from my experience, even when money, a stable background and encouraging parents are in place, black children still suffer as a result of low teacher expectations and negative stereotyping. </p> <p>It wasn't exactly racism. No one called me 'nigger'. But I can't remember anything we did about black history. The only black people we came across were in English Literature and they were slaves. No one taught me about Marcus Garvey. No one said 'you'll do great things'. </p> <p>I don't come from a disadvantaged background. Nor do I fit any of the other stereotypes that commentators cite as the reasons for black children underperforming. I was privately educated from three to 10 and my secondary education was at a grammar school that regularly tops the league tables. The school, in a leafy Home Counties suburb, was far from underfunded yet, six years after leaving school, my experience leads me to conclude that I have achieved what I have in spite, not because, of my education. </p> <p>My parents were keen to take an active role in my education. But in the Eighties mentioning phrases such as 'positive racial identity' and the 'self-confidence of black children' was not welcomed by the staff at my primary school. </p> <p>My mother soon earned a reputation as being 'difficult'. Talking with my parents now, we laugh about my early experiences. When it came to school plays, Nativity or otherwise, black children were either donkeys or devils. When my sister, who went to the school four years later, got to play a wise man in the Christmas play, it was considered ground-breaking by black parents at the school. </p> <p>At secondary school I remember being made to stand in front of my English Literature class while an irate teacher shouted: 'Who do you think you are? You'll never amount to anything!' Those were pretty harsh words for a 13-year-old whose only crime was to forget her dictionary. I loathed school. Admittedly I wasn't the ideal student. I didn't always hand in my homework on time and wasn't always interested in what was going on in lessons but, even when I tried, it seemed to me as if I achieved little support. </p> <p>At 13, I was preparing to sit exams that would be used to decide which set I would be in for my GCSEs. I was predicted a very low grade for maths. My father, a former maths lecturer, was convinced that I could do much better and subjected me to hours of extra tuition after school. </p> <p>While all my white friends were living it up at the local under-18s disco, I was stuck at home having my cranium stuffed full of algebra, statistics and trigonometry. No matter how much I cried or protested, my father always made me spend at least an hour with him as soon as he got home from work. When I received my results, my maths teacher told me I had got the highest mark possible. Yet she looked at me as if I had cheated. </p> <p>When I was 14, my headmistress recommended to my parents that I repeat the year. Since primary school, I had been a year ahead, but my teachers at my secondary school seemed to think this was a mistake. They believed I wouldn't achieve five GCSE passes. The option of encouraging me to work harder or giving me extra help was never offered. Instead that role fell to my parents, who were adamant that I was more than capable of passing my exams without repeating the year. </p> <p>With extra tuition from my father and family friends who were teachers, I achieved 10 GCSE passes all grade A* to C. While I was pleased to have done well, what gave me the greatest satisfaction was proving my teachers wrong. </p> <p>Last week I contacted my headmistress for her views on how a mainly white grammar school approaches the issue of race. I remembered her as a small South African, who took great pride in maintaining the reputation of her school. Her no-nonsense approach used to put the fear of God into me. I had recently started to think of myself as an adult, but when I heard her voice for the first time in six years I felt slightly ill, like a small child with nerves. </p> <p>Initially she suggested that maybe I had approached the wrong school. 'We don't have many black girls here,' she said. I told her that I had not forgotten. Of more than 1,000 pupils during my time, no more than 12 were black. She questioned what I meant by 'black'. 'I hate labels,' she said, adding that she saw no point in political correctness. 'As you will know, Zoe, politics, race and religion have no bearing on the way we treat our girls,' she said. </p> <p>I disagreed with her, and I suggested that it might have been useful to have strategies in place for dealing with children from different backgrounds. She insisted that the school celebrated the diversity of all its pupils' backgrounds. </p> <p>That sounded markedly different from my experience. I told her that I didn't remember any instances of Afro-Caribbean culture being celebrated, let alone mentioned. 'Well, there were only three of you in your year,' she said. </p> <p>But is this a valid excuse? Research into mainly white schools published by the Department for Education in 2002 found that diversity within the minority ethnic population must be recognised and respected. 'One size fits all' approaches create additional problems for minority ethnic pupils and their parents. </p> <p>The general lesson I learnt from my school years was that people's expectation of me were going to be zero and that I would have to prove myself and dispel their stereotyped views. I don't resent that, but I still feel almost as if I'm required to over-achieve so that my race is never a barrier to me. Without the encouragement of my parents and their positive example of success, I don't think I would have bothered to sit my A levels or go to university. </p> <p>All my anecdotal evidence shows that parents who take an active interest in their children's education do much better. 'We need to educate a significant number of black parents, not just children,' says my father. 'Parents who think that it is the schools' responsibility to educate their children find that their children do not perform as well as if they worked alongside the school taking an active interest in their child's education.' </p> <p>Race is a problem in education as much as it is in any other part of life. Unfortunately, because school is an environment where children are subjected to the power of adults, the impact of any prejudice is much more intense. </p> <p>But if black parents want their children's performance to improve, they must take an active interest in their children's education. Greater parental involvement is the only way that the trend can be reduced. The more you invest in a child, the greater the returns. </p> <p><strong>Hard lessons</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> September 1996: School inspectorate Ofsted found that black boys were locked into a cycle of failure, while being four times more likely to be excluded from school. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> March 1999: A second Ofsted survey found that African-Caribbeans were often the lowest-performing group in GCSE exams. It blamed low expectations and prejudice among teachers for their poor achievement. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> August 2000: Tony Sewell, a black academic from Leeds University, provoked a storm of criticism from within the black community for suggesting that black youth culture was to blame for low educational attainment among African-Caribbean boys. He was accused of blaming the victim. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> October 2003: Controversial black left-wing MP Diane Abbott sparked claims of hypocrisy when she announced she was sending her son to a private secondary school. She described her own decision as 'indefensible'. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> September 2004: A report commissioned by the London Development Agency found that the English system is seen by the black community to have failed its children for 50 years. School data from 2000-02 showed African-Caribbean boys were consistently the lowest performing ethnic group group in primary and secondary school.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Minnie Driver </strong> Borderline, London W1</p> <p> 'You're a bit quiet tonight,' Minnie Driver teases. 'All quietly judging me...' The girl certainly has nerve. Launching her debut album, Everything I've Got In My Pocket, at a private London gig, Driver openly acknowledges this is 'rather weird' for all of us. The latest in a long line of actors (Juliette Lewis, Keanu Reeves) who have turned to music to revive a flagging career, Driver has never had an easy relationship with the British press. Maybe her spiky, self-deprecating humour doesn't translate well. Maybe she just isn't Hollywood enough. </p> <p>In fact, Driver began her professional career as a singer (she was signed to Island Records in the early Nineties until her acting career took off with Circle of Friends). When a Music Week journalist chanced on Driver performing live in Texas earlier this year, he wrote a review so glowing it sparked a bidding war. And her solo album has been put together with consummate care. Unlike the rock chick excesses of Lewis et al, Driver has gone for a mellow West Coast mix of folk and country, guided by producer Doc Dauer. </p> <p>She has also picked the right sweaty venue tonight (everyone has played the Borderline from the Stones to Debbie Harry). Driver is deliberately low-key: white shirt, jeans, natural hair. Only the exquisite complexion gives a clue to the day job. She dedicates songs to friends and family ('I think a new baby needs herald ing') and laughs ruefully at her mistakes on the guitar. The sultry voice is good, too, with the impeccable phrasing you would expect of an actress. Even an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen's 'Hungry Heart' (can Minnie really convince as a blue-collar male?) works well. One senses that raw and unplugged may be the way to go. </p> <p>As a performer there is a sweetness to Driver. She is very English (you could imagine going for a drink with her) and her posse of musicians which includes Rami Jaffee of the Wallflowers and drummer Brendan Buckley, are suitably hip. But, while it is always thrilling to see a Hollywood star up close, the subtler, more interesting songs from the album get lost in the cavernous Borderline. </p> <p>Disappointingly, the new single, 'Everything I've Got In My Pocket' (which has a dizzying strangeness reminiscent of Goldfrapp or Portishead) becomes just another rock anthem. And while the up-tempo 'Invisible Girl' is a great pop moment, the alt.country ballads leave you cold. What new insights can Driver, with her privileged background (Bedales, a childhood in Barbados) offer us about life? </p> <p>Unsurprisingly it's the love songs that really hook, from the sensual 'Everything I've Got In My Pocket' ('I want to lay down with you for ever, or just this afternoon') to 'So Well', a deliciously dry 'memo to self' not to stalk ex-lovers. And part of the fun, for this listener at least, is guessing exactly which of her famous exes (Matt Damon, John Cusack, Josh Brolin) she might be referring to.</p>",
  "<p><strong>La Gioconda</strong> Covent Garden, London WC2</p> <p><strong>Proms 67, 69, 72</strong> Royal Albert Hall, London SW7</p> <p>Watching, rather than merely, as usual, hearing, him conduct his Royal Opera House orchestra and chorus, in an onstage concert performance launching his third season as Covent Garden's music director, clinched my growing conviction that Antonio Pappano is the best thing to happen to British musical life in a long time. </p> <p>In two years at the helm of our premier opera house, he has resecured its reputation as one of the best in the world. A palpable sense of excitement always grips the stalls before his arrival onstage or, more often, in the pit. In the theatre, for my money, this hasn't happened since Olivier. In the opera house or concert hall, it is hard to think of an example since the salad days of Simon Rattle (of whom more anon). </p> <p>To see this diminutive figure get through three shirts in as many hours, the only conceivable reason for two intervals, making for a very long evening, offered rare proof of the passion, as much as the energy, that he brings to every bar, his windmill arms caressing each last thrilling nuance out of his performers. </p> <p>Pappano's innate sense of theatre, one of his supreme strengths as an opera conductor, also breathed unlikely life into Ponchielli's neglected melodrama <strong> La Gioconda</strong>, renowned for its twinkle-toed 'Dance of the Hours' and its feisty soprano aria 'Suicido', but not, hitherto, for much else. </p> <p>Concert performances are usually poor relations of full stagings; just occasionally, as in this case, they can be revelatory. Spared the directorial conceits which so often get in its way - persuading the soprano to sing her big number upside down, for instance - the music is free to speak for itself, leaving the backstreet canals and cabals of 17th-century Venice to our individual imaginations. In the process, a derelict work like this is liberated from its undeservedly third-rate reputation. </p> <p>Given soloists as fine as Pappano's - Romanian bass Alexandru Agache as the Scarpia-like villain; dashing Sicilian tenor Marcello Giordani as her lover; Lithuanian soprano Violeta Urmana in the title role - we were left wondering why Covent Garden hasn't staged this opulent piece in 75 years. Let's hope this tantalising taster will have Pappano seeking out the right director to realise its potential. </p> <p>Showcasing his players like this, giving the audience a glimpse inside the great engine room that is the ROH orchestra, is a stylishly Pappano-esque way of kicking off a season whose many prospects include his first Ring cycle. If a chance to study him in action was a rare bonus, the same is not always true of maestro Rattle. </p> <p>By which I mean primarily that Rattle is more often seen on the podium than hidden in the pit, so we have grown accustomed to his extravagant mannerisms. (Let's face it, observed my companion, he conducts the same way we all do in the mirror.) The trouble is that the sound Rattle produces can now seem, at times, just as mannered. The way he led his magnificent Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra through Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (<strong> Prom 67</strong>) often bordered on the pedantic. </p> <p>So accomplished are the players of Rattle's mean machine that, in familiar repertoire such as this, his apparent need to impose his own sometimes eccentric, often nitpicking insights can become unduly conspicuous. The opening bars of the celebrated 'Ode to Joy' theme, for instance, allocated to the lower strings, were so piano as to be almost inaudible. At times like this, Rattle's supreme musicianship can seem more like showmanship. </p> <p>That said, the adagio was as luminous as I've ever heard it, the slow-burn of this ultimate rite of passage perfectly judged as Rattle seemed content to put his non-pareil players on cruise control, pending the demands of the finale. Which proved, by contrast, plain pedestrian, with the terrific Birmingham Symphony Chorus outsinging indifferent soloists, again calling into question Rattle's taste in singers. </p> <p>Guaranteed a standing ovation these days, the minute that shock of grey hair escorts him onstage, Rattle is to be commended for making his loyal following work hard for their desert-island delights. Only the promise of the 'Choral' symphony, surely, could have filled the sauna that was the Albert Hall, with queues stretching vainly round Kensington Gore, for Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra . </p> <p>For all its ornate complexities, so seamlessly stewarded by the conductor that even a well-meant programme guide could not help the novice tell where one variation yielded to the next, this is one of those austere works of rather more academic interest than sensory pleasure. </p> <p>Compare and contrast William Christie, the cultish conductor who (surprisingly) only half-filled the hall for an all-Charpentier evening (<strong> Prom 72</strong>), dominated by the Grand office des morts. This was early Baroque as good as it gets, with ethereal playing and singing from Les Arts Florissants, and soloists hand-picked by the genial control-freak whose minimalist style suggests rehearsals so intense that the public results can seem over-wrought. The real pain in Paul Agnew's cries of 'Hei, mihi Domine!' came as a rare moment of welcome spontaneity. </p> <p>Jukka-Pekka Saraste, by contrast, was about as anonymous as conductors come (apart, of course, from Cleveland's Franz Welser-M\u00f6st) while guiding the BBC Symphony Orchestra through the UK premiere of his Finnish compatriot Kaija Saariaho's Orion (<strong> Prom 69</strong>). While purporting to add up to a sonic portrait of a myth-inspired constellation, the work's three quasi-symphonic movements seemed to come from very different, unrelated musical worlds. </p> <p>'Memento mori' is a spooky evocation of human mortality, 'Winter Sky' a calmer exercise in orchestral polyphony, 'Hunter' a frenetic, often jagged dalliance with dynamics, finally fading to black. Most departments of the orchestra, especially the percussion, are given their brief moment beneath the moon, but the shimmering if spiky sound-world conjured by Saariaho somehow adds up to less than the sum of its parts. If contemporary Finland is a veritable production line of such prolific, children-of-Sibelius composers, she is at the frostier end of a distinctly glacial, monochrome rainbow.</p>",
  "<b> 'There is no greater shame than to see your country occupied'</b> <br> <p>Early one morning this week, when the police have yet to set up too many checkpoints, Abu Mujahed will strap a mortar underneath a car, drive to a friend's in central Baghdad and bury the weapon in his garden. In the evening he will return with the rest of his group, sleep for a few hours and then take the weapon from its hiding place. He will calculate the range using the American military's own maps and satellite pictures - bought in a bazaar - and fire a few rounds at a military base or the US Embassy or at the Iraqi Prime Minister's office. Then Abu Mujahed will shower, change and, by 10am, be at his desk in one of the major ministries. </p> <p>Last week he sat in a Baghdad hotel speaking to The Observer. A chubby man in his thirties with a shaven head, a brown sports shirt, slacks and a belt with a cheap fake-branded buckle, he gave a chilling account of his life fighting 'the occupation'. He talked for more than three hours and revealed: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> How his resistance group, comprising self-taught Sunni Muslim Iraqis, is almost completely independent, choosing targets and timings themselves, but occasionally receiving broad strategic directions from a religious 'sheikh' most of them have never met. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> How it is funded by Iraqis in Europe, including the UK, and from wealthy sympathisers in Saudi Arabia. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> How it has rejected any alliance with al-Qaeda affiliated 'foreign fighters' and Shia militia. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> How it receives intelligence from 'friends' within the coalition forces. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> How it runs a counter-intelligence operation that has resulted in the execution of two suspected spies in recent weeks. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> How it is learning increasingly sophisticated techniques and plans to detonate big bombs in Baghdad soon. </p> <p>He also spoke about the difficulties of continuing security operations against them and admitted that many Iraqis do not support their actions. Much of Abu Mujahed's account is corroborated by various independent sources. </p> <p>Intelligence experts in Iraq talk of three main types of insurgent. There is the Mahdi Army of Shia Muslims who follow the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and have led recent resistance to coalition forces in northern Baghdad, the central shrine city of Najaf, and Basra, the southern port under British control. There is also 'al-Qaeda' - non-Iraqi militants who have come to Iraq to wage jihad. And finally the 'former regime loyalists', who are said to want the return of Saddam Hussein or, if that is impossible, his Baath party. </p> <p>Abu Mujahed, worryingly for the analysts, fits into none of these easy categories. For a start, he was pro-American before the invasion. 'The only way to breathe under the old regime was to watch American films and listen to their music,' he said. He had been a Bon Jovi fan. </p> <p>'It gave me a glimpse of a better life. When I heard that the Americans were coming to liberate Iraq I was very happy. I felt that I would be able to live well, travel and have freedom. I wanted to do more sport, get new appliances and a new car and develop my life. I thought the US would come here and our lives would be changed through 180 degrees.' </p> <p>He spoke of how his faith in the US was shaken when, via a friend's illicitly imported satellite TV system, he saw 'barbaric, savage' pictures of civilian casualties of the fighting and bombing. The next blow came in the conflict's immediate aftermath, as looters ran unchecked through Baghdad. </p> <p>'When I saw the American soldiers watching and doing nothing as people took everything, I began to suspect the US was not here to help us but to destroy us,' he said. </p> <p>Abu Mujahed, whose real name is not known by The Observer, said: 'I thought it might be just the chaos of war but it got worse, not better.' </p> <p>He was not alone and swiftly found that many in the Adhamiya neighbourhood of Baghdad shared his anger and disappointment. The time had come. 'We realised. We had to act.' </p> <p>Nothing had been planned in advance. There has been speculation, and especially among American officials, that Saddam's henchmen had planned a 'guerrilla war' if defeated. But Abu Mujahed, who described himself as 'a Muslim but not religious', and the others in his group were not working to any plan. Everything they did was improvised. And each of his seven-man group had a different motive: 'One man was fighting for his nation, another for a principle, another for his faith.' </p> <p>Significantly, his group contains several former soldiers, angry at the controversial demobilisation of the Iraqi military by the coalition last year. Others, like Abu Mujahed, have salaried government jobs. The cell is not part of any broader organisation and does not have a name, he said. 'We are just local people ... There is a sheikh who co-ordinates some of the various groups but I do not know who he is.' </p> <p>To start with, the group lacked armaments and know-how. 'We made some careful inquiries. Some people gave us weapons, others sold us stuff they had looted,' he said. The group also sought out experts, often former military officers, who gave impromtu tutorials in bomb-making and communications . </p> <p>The group's first operation - in June last year - was an attempted ambush of three US soldiers in Adhamiya. It was a fiasco. 'We were so confused and scared we opened fire at random,' Abu Mujahed said. 'They took cover and we ran away.' </p> <p>Their next try was more successful. The lead vehicle of an American military convoy ran over an anti-tank mine the group had laid in a road. 'We think we killed the driver,' he said. 'We found the mine in a house that had been used by the military during the war. The Americans were not expecting that sort of device.' </p> <p>Over the next months the group varied the tactics. 'One day we try and snipe them, the next we use an IED [Improvised Explosive Device], the next a mine. We never get any orders from anybody. We are just told: \"Today you should do something,\" but it is up to us to decide what and when.' </p> <p>Black soldiers are a particular target. 'To have Negroes occupying us is a particular humiliation,' Abu Mujahed said, echoing the profound racism prevalent in much of the Middle East. 'Sometimes we aborted a mission because there were no Negroes.' </p> <p>In contrast to many militants, who have killed hundreds of Iraqis in the last year, Abu Mujahed said his group was careful not to kill locals. 'We are now planning to use bigger bombs in central Baghdad. But it is hard because there are so many civilians.' Support for the militants is far from universal. They are not attracting new recruits and finances are tight, he admitted. </p> <p>'We used to be able to use banks and bank transfers. Now it is harder,' Abu Mujahed said. 'Often sympathisers buy cars in Saudi Arabia or Jordan and we get them driven to Baghdad or Basra and we sell them. A supporter in the UK has recently sent an Opel pick-up. But most of our money comes from local people who support what we do but can't fight themselves.' </p> <p>Tactics depend on resources. The price of rocket-propelled grenades has gone up recently as supplies dried up during August's heavy fighting between Americans and the Mahdi Army in Najaf. The missiles now cost 25,000 Iraqi dinars (around \u00a310) in markets in Sadr City, the northern Shia Muslim-dominated area of Baghdad - 10 times the immediate post-war price. The group is restricted to one attack every few days. </p> <p>There are also spies. He boasted of information from 'friends within the coalition' and said that his group have executed two suspected informers within Adhamiya. One was killed less than three weeks ago, after being under surveillance for a month. 'He had a wife and child but I did not feel bad. He was a fox. He was made to kneel and shot in the head.' Other suspected spies have been threatened and fled Baghdad. </p> <p>Western intelligence analysts worry that various resistance elements might combine. But Abu Mujahed dismissed the Mahdi Army as 'thugs and traitors who ... welcomed the Americans to Iraq with flowers and then went looting' and said that relations with Islamic militants coming from overseas are worse. </p> <p>'Some have no allegiance to any group, others have so much money they must come from al-Qaeda. It is impossible to work with them. They are bloody people, far too irrational. They do not care if they kill innocent Iraqi people. They are terrorists.' </p> <p>Last week US military casualties in Iraq passed the 1,000 mark, most killed since the end of the war by the actions of men like Abu Mujahed. The former engineering student said he does not know how many his group has killed: 'It is impossible to say what has been hit. I could boast of killing maybe 25, but to be honest we don't know,' he said. 'Maybe only five or six.' </p> <p>'I know the soldiers have no choice about coming here and all have a family and friends,' he added. His justification for the struggle was an inconsistent mix of political and economic grievances and wounded pride: 'We are under occupation. They bomb the mosques, they kill a huge number of people. There is no greater shame than to see your country being occupied.' </p> <p>He dismissed the interim Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi, as 'the Americans' Barbie doll' but then says that if everyone had 'full bellies' no one would fight. </p> <p>'Iraqis' top priority is to provide a good living for their families. I take home less than 250,000 ID (\u00a3100) a month and I have four children. I have to pay the rent, doctor's bills, my wife needs something, my house needs something. And a kilo of chicken costs 2,500 ID.' </p> <p>'The US or the UK are not my enemy. I know that any individual US or UK citizen is very good, but we will keep fighting the occupying forces. We have no choice.' </p> <p>And with that he left. The Observer was told not to contact him again.</p>",
  "Outside a courthouse in Bakirkoy, an unfashionable neighbourhood of Istanbul, a dozen or so women gathered in the brittle autumn sunshine. They had come to demonstrate at the first hearing in the trial of the killers of Guldunya Tore, a 22-year-old woman shot dead in the city in February. <p>Guldunya had fled her home in Bitlis, south-east Turkey, after she fell pregnant to her cousin's husband. Her family sent her to live with relatives in Istanbul. Soon after her child was born she was shot in the street and left for dead, but she survived. In hospital she asked for police protection. It was refused. Later, gunmen burst into her room and killed her. </p> <p>Her two brothers are charged with her murder in an 'honour killing'. Friday was the first day of their trial. </p> <p>For the demonstrators the link between Guldunya's murder and a proposed adultery law, due to be voted upon in the Turkish parliament on Tuesday, is terrifying. They believe the criminalisation of adultery will effectively legitimise honour killings. The government gives every impression of being baffled by the uproar that has followed its proposed law. But this week, as news of it began to leak out into the international media, ministers began to feel the heat. </p> <p>Asked what he thought of the new law, the EU's Enlargement Commissioner, Gunther Verheugen, gave the Eurocrats' version of 'no comment'. Standing next to the Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, he was in the capital Ankara on his final trip to Turkey before the EU Commission gives its verdict on the country's once appalling human rights record. When the commissioner met the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an official revealed he'd told him to dump the proposed law. Europe, he said, was different when it came to these matters. </p> <p>There is a dark irony surrounding these events, because this government has done more than any other to bring Turkey to the edge of EU membership. It forced the military to relinquish privileged positions within government. It applied pressure to persuade the Turkish Cypriots and the military to accept a compromised Cyprus reunification plan. </p> <p>The state broadcaster TRT was even made to broadcast Kurdish language programming. </p> <p>All of this took considerable nerve, which makes the move over adultery hard to fathom, coming as it does less than a month before the Commission's report. </p> <p>Rusen Cakir, a journalist who has written extensively on the Islamist movement, believes the governing Justice and Development party (AK) has miscalculated: 'They couldn't foresee that the Europeans would show such a big reaction. If they thought it would be taken very seriously they wouldn't have done it.' </p> <p>As with previous proposed reforms on headscarf regulations and religious schools, Cakir believes the adultery law is an attempt by AK to prop up its core constituency, the 20 per cent of its voters who are religious conservatives. </p> <p>The logical thing to do now might be to look for a tactical retreat, but most people think it is too late for that. 'If they take a step back they'll lose prestige in the country,' said Cakir. 'And if they take a step back this will be because of the EU, not because of the people's reaction.' </p> <p>'The problem is,' said Soli Ozel, Professor of International Relations at Istanbul's Bilgi University, 'that it gives ammunition to those [in the EU] who say \"Turkey is not like us\".' </p> <p>Ozel is not a fan of the proposed law: 'If we want to join the EU we have to accept that it is a set of norms, not just political norms, but also about the rights of the individual, equality between men and women, and the sanctity of private life.' </p> <p>Turkey's poor may adore the AK - the latest opinion poll gives the party more than half of the vote - but the secular middle class, the bureaucrats and the military fear it. They don't believe the government has embraced secularism. Every time the government moves on a religious issue they cry foul, with much of the media behind them. </p> <p>Nimet Cubukcu, 39, an AK party founder, helped draft the new penal code and sits on parliament's constitutional committee. 'Of course, Turkey's image is important,' she said. 'But we have to remember who we are and what we are. Our law is not degrading people's human rights and the punishment is not degrading people's honour. The punishment will either be money, a fine or imprisonment. We are not talking about stoning anyone here.' </p> <p>One poll suggests eight out of 10 Turks think adultery should be a criminal offence. Many of the reforms of recent years have passed over the heads of the people, coming down from the EU to the government. Now debate has been joined. Europe may not hear quite what it expected.</p>",
  "<p>The news that Tony Blair will this week reinforce Britain's commitment to the fight global warming is timely. The omens of climate change have never been so striking or alarming. After a British summer of rain and ruined harvests, and of disappearing polar ice-caps and rising sea levels, we now have the sight of hurricane Ivan maintaining its deadly path across the Caribbean, the third to have battered the region this summer. </p> <p>Of course, climatologists are - rightly - cautious about linking this profusion of storms with manmade activities. Other explanations, involving decades-long cycles in ocean current behaviour, can still account for their appearance and for the billions of dollars of damage hurricanes have inflicted. </p> <p>But it would be a distinctly unimaginative individual who could look at Ivan's handiwork and fail to note humanity's frailty when faced with the fury of the elements. For all our sophisticated meteorology and communications, satellites and radar, our ability to organise emergency airlifts and evacuations, we remain vulnerable when battling against Nature at its angriest. </p> <p>As the distinguished Harvard scientist EO Wilson has noted: 'More frequent heat waves, violent storms, forest fires, droughts, and flooding will be the spawn of our historically unprecedented pace of climate change.' Gainsayers may deny mankind's role in global warming, but scientists who have been monitoring the atmosphere for the past 15 years are convinced our indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels, in cars and factories, has raised atmospheric temperatures by one degree Celsius over the past century. A further four or five over the next 50 years is also forecast, and is expected to unleash weather of undreamt-of ferocity. </p> <p>Can we rectify our behaviour, cut our industrial emissions and make greater reliance on renewable sources of energy in order to save our world? Mr Blair will no doubt claim we can. More cynical commentators may disagree, for the power to halt climate change lies outside our direct control. Until America - responsible for almost a quarter of the planet's total carbon dioxide emissions - commits itself to the cause, hopes of stopping our world overheating will be doomed to failure. </p> <p>The Prime Minister has been pressed several times by his cabinet colleagues to underline his climatological differences with the White House and to show that he is capable of standing up to the Republican right on issues of principle. Until he does, there is no prospect of America understanding its isolation on this issue, and therefore no prospect of our planet saving itself.</p>",
  "Gay christians are accusing homosexual bishops in the Anglican communion of caving in to a conservative agenda and plunging the church into further crisis. <p>They are outraged that a number of bishops known to be gay but not 'out' in public have refused to speak up for homosexual rights in the church while the Eames Commission looked at the issue, which could split the church. </p> <p>The commission was set up after election of the openly gay Gene Robinson as Bishop of New Hampshire in the US last year and its findings, completed last week, will point to the future for the 70 million-strong Anglican communion. </p> <p>'When Gene was consecrated we expected other gay American bishops to put their heads above the parapet. This has not proved to be the case,' said Martin Reynolds, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. 'We're dismayed Gene has been left to stand alone.' </p> <p>He warned that the bishops' failure to act would hurt the church by forcing gay clergy to keep their sexuality hidden. 'Secrecy is the church's worst enemy. The present crisis stems from forcing people to keep quiet or tell lies.' </p> <p>Yesterday Robinson warned the furore was distracting the Anglican Church from speaking out on issues such as Sudan and Aids: 'How self-absorbed can we be, to be fighting over this when people are dying everywhere?' </p> <p>The final draft of the commission's report, completed after months of investigation by Archbishop Eames, Primate of the Church of Ireland, has been handed to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. </p> <p>The commission is expected to recommend censuring the Ecclesiastical Church of the USA (Ecusa), which backed Robinson's appointment, and the diocese of New Westminster in Canada, which has approved same-sex blessings. </p> <p>Possible action could involve breaking links with Canterbury for a number of years, so they can 'repent'. They could be barred from the Lambeth Conference in 2008, when important matters governing the future of the communion are discussed. </p> <p>Williams, spiritual head of the Anglican communion, is expected to appoint alternative bishops to offer an episcopal overview for US and Canadian parishes seeking to stay linked to Canterbury. </p> <p>A failure to censure the two bodies would prompt many African dioceses - known as 'the Global South'- to break their links with Canterbury, and take more than half of the communion's 70 million members with them. </p> <p>The Rev David Hillborn, head of theology at the Evangelical Alliance, which is opposed to the appointment of openly gay bishops, warned: 'I suspect that some kind of measure with teeth will be necessary for the communion to hold together.' </p> <p>But censure would be greeted with dismay by liberals in the church and would also threaten the financial viability of the communion. More than 30 per cent of its revenues comes from Ecusa. </p> <p>Some theologians believe such a move would breach the Anglican emphasis on diversity. 'There is no one moral issue about which Anglicans all agree, whether it's birth control or homosexuality. That is what being an Anglican amounts to', said Professor Andrew Linzey, Fellow of Blackfriars Hall, Oxford.</p>",
  "<p>Sylvie Guillem's athletic, sinuous dancing is unlike anyone else's. As physically exhilarating as she is rawly emotional, she seems constantly to be in search of new ways of touching her audience. She has no compunction about ditching the conventions if she thinks it will have more impact, which, in a form that is driven by conventions, can be controversial. So her distinctiveness has come at a price - she has a reputation. </p> <p>Guillem is difficult, it is said, known for being arrogant and argumentative. She stormed out of the Paris Opera following fights with Rudolf Nureyev and took off for the Royal Ballet, where she had more rows, this time with Kenneth MacMillan. She said no to an amazing number of parts and, even where she said yes, she refused to do them in the usual ways or wearing the costumes that other people provided. She is protective of her image and insists on vetting all photographs. </p> <p>I got up at 5am to travel to the south of France to see her and wouldn't be home until midnight and we're meeting at the Colombe d'Or (where Picasso and Braque paid for meals with pictures) but she won't have lunch because she doesn't like eating while she's being interviewed. This is a person, it would appear, with very decided views about a lot of things and a limited sense of the need to accommodate other people. </p> <p>At the appointed time, a car draws up and Guillem slips out, a long, narrow figure in jeans, Bondi surfing T-shirt and trainers, with a skein of hennaed hair still kinked from a plait, and a body that looks as if someone has got hold of it and stretched it head to toe to its absolute limits. Everything, even her fingers, is longer and thinner than it has any right to be; her hips are impossibly narrow, her upper arms taut with muscle but still tiny in circumference. </p> <p>This strong and limber body, slippery but under minute muscular control, has made Guillem a phenomenon: she can lift a leg to six o'clock, leap higher and bend more sexily than most dancers. Some critics, especially early on, accused her of being 'just a gymnast', of distorting the traditional shapes of ballet, of leading a generation of dancers astray as they tried to be bendier and bolder. She should make nice a little bit more, they suggested, both onstage and off it. </p> <p>But Sylvie Guillem was never interested in being a pretty, virginal girl in a tutu. For her, the extraordinary physical gift with which she found herself was a means to an end. She was exasperated with the empty gestures and pointless prettiness she felt dominated much dance. She wanted to be passionate on stage, to communicate directly, and she didn't care too much what it cost. </p> <p>It certainly did have a cost. 'Some choreographers have been cautious about working with me. And sometimes partners have said to me, \"I didn't know you were like this. I was afraid to approach you.\"' In fact, the Guillem I meet in St Paul de Vence is intelligent, considerate, even funny. But, boy, she is driven, powered by a self-belief that is all the more extraordinary when you consider her background. </p> <p>Guillem was born in a working-class district of Paris. Her father was a garage mechanic and her mother taught gymnastics. Her suppleness, strength and early coaching ensured that she became a talented gymnast; when she was 11, she was one of three girls selected from national trials to spend a year at the Paris Opera ballet school in an effort to turn her into a more graceful gymnast with a view to Olympic competition. </p> <p>She didn't like it much. 'I thought the discipline was too hard. I couldn't see where the freedom was. And it didn't feel dangerous; it was too square, maybe, for me.' But she was invited to participate in the end-of-year performance: 'Then I saw that all the discipline had a purpose, that it was something quite out of the ordinary.' </p> <p>She had to choose. 'I knew that if I went for gymnastics, it would be over very fast. It's a short career and it's dangerous.' She was already training with the national team, and they 'wanted me to go somewhere else to train, and I didn't want to leave Paris and my parents'. She elected to remain at the Paris Opera and came top of her class in every subsequent year. </p> <p>She says now that gymnastics didn't make her a dancer - 'I had the same physical quality before' - although they might have contributed to a certain freedom of movement. One difference between her and many of the other Paris Opera pupils, though, was: 'I was not passionate about ballet in the sense of wanting to wear the tutu and diadem. And when I started doing ballet, a lot of things disturbed me. I saw performances and thought, \"Why are they doing that? It's ridiculous.\" And when they asked me to do the same thing, I said, \"Hold on a minute, there is another way.\"' </p> <p>Guillem had not been brought up to be forceful and certainly not princessy. She says she was 'a shy child of shy parents'; even now, she's not sure what her family think about having bred such a phenomenon. 'They never tell me what they think. Each time I go to Paris, my father says, \"Have you seen such and such? I love him very much.\" And I've just danced three incredibly demanding acts.' She smiles. 'It's fine. It's nice. No problem. They are shy about it.' </p> <p>Claude Bessy, the director, protected the prodigy who had come so late to ballet and, no doubt, encouraged her to trust her instincts, to become an artist as well as a spectacular technician. Guillem joined the company at 16 and, adored by Nureyev, its director, who once said she was the only woman he would have considered marrying, was appointed to the second highest rank of dancer when she was 19. Five days later, after she had danced a triumphant Swan Lake, he came onstage to name her etoile, the highest rank. </p> <p>Two years later, she made her debut at the Royal Opera House when Nureyev chose her to dance Giselle with him in celebration of his 50th birthday. Increasingly, though, he found her independence and determination to control her career infuriating. 'He was not used to having someone question him, and I must say that even if I was not very gifted in terms of communication, he was even worse.' So they shouted at each other, about small things and about the terms of her contract. She wanted the freedom he had to dance elsewhere, to explore her potential. She chafed under the restrictions of 'the big family thing in the company. I was never really part of the family, because I had such problem with the discipline'. </p> <p>When she left to become a guest star at the Royal Ballet, questions were asked in the French Assembly about the loss of this national treasure. In London, she had more freedom, but fewer friends: 'People were attacking me before I even arrived: \"If she thinks she's going to come in here and change things...\" and I hadn't done anything, hadn't even walked into the theatre.' </p> <p>I ask if she feels she's had to fight all the way along for control of her career and she makes a Gallic noise - 'Ouff!' - and says: 'Yes, yes. I was afraid when I came to the Royal Ballet that it would be easy to have everyone walking all over me if I didn't stick up for myself. I was trained like everyone else to be polite, to say \"hello\" and \"please\". But as soon as I started, I found there were things I couldn't do because they didn't make any sense, gestures I couldn't make, fake things that I couldn't feel, and I found I would rather not do them at all than do them badly. </p> <p>'I didn't mind if people explained to me why I was supposed to do these things, but too often they would say, \"That's just the way it is.\" There would be costumes I was supposed to make do with, because that's how they were, even though the line was not very nice. We were supposed to be making something visually interesting and beautiful and yet we had to do it because, \"That's the way it is.\"' </p> <p>Guillem's unprecedented assertiveness was aggravated at the Royal Ballet by shyness. She was criticised for not eating with other dancers in the canteen, but, she says now: 'What they didn't understand was that I was much more afraid of them than they were of me. I arrived not speaking a word of English and I felt that I was taking their place. I didn't feel very confident, and I was young, and perhaps that's also why you go to another extreme.' </p> <p>She says she has no regrets. She danced the roles she wanted, in the way she wanted, pushing at the boundaries physically and emotionally. You get a sense of what really matters to her about dancing when she describes what she looks for in a partner: 'To respect and love what they are doing as much as I do, to have an instinct on the stage, to know how to react and an ability be authentic. And you can see right away in their eyes when you work with them whether they are here or not.' And then, ever in control, she adds: 'Sometimes you can push them in directions that they don't expect, and that can be good for them.' </p> <p>Probably she couldn't have been a great artist any other way. If she didn't push herself and others towards perfection so fiercely, she might not hit the top notes with such unerring frequency. </p> <p>In a matter of months, though, she will be 40. Throughout our meeting, even inside, she wears a green raffia hat like an upturned flowerpot. It's very fetching and sets off her eyes, which are also green, but I harbour an unkind suspicion that it has a more important function in covering up any lurking grey roots. Anyway, she is dancing the classical repertoire less and less these days, some would say because it becomes too demanding the older you get, although she prefers to see it as a mental issue. </p> <p>'When you start at 19 and go on a long time, you have a chance first of all to be excited, then to refine what you are doing and then to get bored by it. You don't feel the same excitement any more; it doesn't drive you at the same level of excitement to keep going.' </p> <p>In a couple of weeks, she will dance at Sadler's Wells with Michael Nunn and William Trevitt, the Ballet Boyz, in works by contemporary dance choreographer Russell Maliphant. The climax is his piece, Broken Fall, which they premiered at Covent Garden last November to rapturous reviews. This is a testing work, in which the three dancers twist, tumble and knot themselves around one another as power and trust shift between them, and in which Guillem is carried aloft and plummets to earth, almost defying gravity. </p> <p>She dances in Broken Fall as spectacularly and intensely as she has ever danced, so it's not really surprising that she can't see it as in any way a second-best departure from the classical repertoire, or even particularly as a way of extending her career. </p> <p>When I ask if she enjoys dancing as much as she ever did, she says: 'Oh, yes, I do!' with a breathiness that is almost salacious. And when she occasionally thinks about giving up, it's not because of her age, but because she's been to see something, classical or contemporary. 'It has no emotion, stupid gestures, and people are accepting it because it goes on long enough and it's glittering enough, and I think, \"If they can be satisfied with that, I'll just put my shoes away and look after my flowers or my cat.\"' Later, she acknowledges that she would stop dancing 'if it becomes too painful or I have to start making compromises. But it's not easy to give up, I guess. It's a beautiful thing to live experiences that are very rare'. </p> <p>With her long-term boyfriend, fashion photographer Gilles Tapie, she continues to divide her time between Notting Hill and St Paul de Vence. I wonder if she has many friends. 'More now than before,' she says. 'For a while, I didn't. I start again with friends.' This makes them sound a bit like the saxophone, to which she has also reapplied herself recently. </p> <p>Inside the company, she says, it's never been easy to have friends; too cliquey and political. 'If you become friendly with one group, you cannot then be part of another, because you can't be close to everyone. When you are not in a group, you are better able to observe and see that what some person has said, he does not do... it does not make you want to be friendly with someone, because betrayal is always not very far.' </p> <p>Beyond the company, the different trajectories of people's lives make real, sustained relationships with more than a very few people difficult, she thinks. So she gardens, reads, and works on her languages (English, Italian and Japanese). She isn't sure that whenever she does retire, she would have enough money not to need to work, although she says her tastes are simple. She hints that she might like to live in Italy, in Parma or Modena, maybe. It is not something she needs to worry about, anyway, when Broken Fall shows her still so triumphantly in command of her powers. </p> <p>Sylvie Guillem has mellowed from the spiky kid scared she wouldn't be allowed her say, the defensive dancer who said 'no' so much they called her Mademoiselle Non. She no longer has rows at the Royal Ballet: 'When they have a position and I have mine, it stays there. We know how far we can push each other,' she grins. She now admits: 'I was not always right', but she has no regrets; ultimately, her self-protection worked. </p> <p>'I did what I had pleasure in, one thing after another, with no plan in mind, no basket to fill. When things pass by and I feel ready for the fight, I go for it. And it is still possible for me to have a lot. Whether I want it, I don't know. It depends whether it is something that appeals to me, and whether I have the courage.' </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> Sylvie Guillem and the Ballet Boyz perform Broken Fall and other works by Russell Maliphant at Sadler's Wells, London EC1, 28 September-2 October</p>",
  "The ramrod-straight back and perfectly executed salute were to be expected from a man who had lied to join the US army at the age of 15. <p>When Charles Jenkins reported for duty at the US army's headquarters in Japan yesterday, however, it was not as an ordinary soldier, but as one accused of turning his back on his country almost four decades ago to live in North Korea. </p> <p>His surrender marked the start of a legal process that will be keenly watched in Japan and will, perhaps, bring to a satisfactory end a case that has harmed Japan-US relations. </p> <p>Jenkins, 64, is accused of deserting his unit while on patrol in South Korea in 1965 and fleeing across the border to the communist north, where he taught English and occasionally played sinister Americans in North Korean propaganda films. </p> <p>Among his English students was Hitomi Soga, a nurse from Japan who had been abducted from her home in 1978 and taken to North Korea to teach Japanese to Pyongyang agents. They married in 1980 and had two daughters. </p> <p>Soga, 45, and four other abducted Japanese citizens were permitted to return home two years ago, but Jenkins stayed behind with their daughters because he feared arrest by US military authorities in Japan. The four were reunited in Jakarta last July and flew to Japan so that Jenkins could receive medical treatment. </p> <p>Most Japanese are desperate for a happy ending for Soga, who has won widespread praise for the dignified way she has handled her family's plight. The Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has much to gain if Jenkins avoids prison. He was instrumental in persuading him to come to Japan and has made repeated pleas to the US government to show leniency, for Soga's sake. </p> <p>US army spokesman Major John Amberg gave assurances yesterday that Jenkins would 'be treated with dignity and fairness', adding that he was 'innocent until proven guilty'. </p> <p>'Sir, I'm Sergeant Jenkins and I'm reporting,' he told Lieutenant Colonel Paul Nigara, when he arrived at Camp Zama, just outside Tokyo. Nigara replied: 'You are now under the control of the US army.' </p> <p>Jenkins was expected to be given a uniform, ID card and haircut. He will be entitled to the benefits afforded any other sergeant and will perform administrative duties. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the charges against him are serious. Aside from desertion, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, he is accused of aiding the enemy, encouraging disloyalty and urging other US servicemen to defect. </p> <p>Jenkins has spent the past few weeks preparing his defence with an army-appointed lawyer. The most likely option is a plea bargain in which he would plead guilty to one of the four charges and tell the US all he knows about North Korea in return for a dishonourable discharge. </p> <p>Soga remained characteristically optimistic. 'I expect we'll have a lot more to face in the days to come,' she said. 'But we hope the four of us can live together as soon as possible.'</p>",
  "Katherine Gun, the former GCHQ employee who alerted the world to the United Nations bugging scandal in the run-up to the Iraq war, will launch a campaign this week to encourage whistleblowers to reveal evidence of government wrongdoing. <p>Gun was sacked from the top-secret government eavesdropping centre last year, after revealing details of a US 'dirty tricks' operation to win UN Security Council votes for a second resolution to authorise the use of force in Iraq. The government controversially dropped her prosecution under the Official Secrets Act in February after it was put under pressure to reveal the legal advice that took Britain to war. </p> <p>Speaking at the TUC annual conference in Brighton, Gun will announce the establishment of the Truth-Telling Coalition, set up with a group of prominent international whistleblowers who have challenged their governments over the war on terror and the conflict in Iraq. She will be joined by TUC chairman Brendan Barber at an event to celebrate the 70th anniversary of civil rights campaigners Liberty. </p> <p>Last week Gun travelled to Washington to lend her support to an appeal for the disclosure of a series of US classified documents. These include Red Cross reports on abuses at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq withheld by the US government, FBI reports on the organisation's knowledge of events leading up to the al-Qaeda suicide attacks on 11 September 2001, the unpublished sections of a UN report on weapons of mass destruction from before the war on Iraq, and the 28 pages on Saudi Arabia redacted from the joint House-Senate inquiry on intelligence activities prior to 9/11. </p> <p>The call was backed by America's most celebrated whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers in 1971, revealing the full extent of American involvement in Vietnam before the outbreak of hostilities. </p> <p>Similar documents in Britain would include the full legal advice provided by Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith on intervention in Iraq, the Foreign Office legal advice on the war, and details of meetings between Goldsmith and US Attorney General John Ashcroft. </p> <p>Gun told The Observer this weekend: 'The government should publish the legal advice on the war. If we had that, it would be a good start. If the war was shown to be illegal through disclosure of the Attorney General's advice, there would be a very strong case for further disclosures.' </p> <p>The Truth-Telling Coalition already counts two FBI whistleblowers among its membership: special agent Coleen Rowley and translator Sibel Edmonds, who claim that senior staff, including FBI director Robert Mueller, ignored warnings of al-Qaeda activity in the US. </p> <p>Next, the organisation will take up the cause of Major Frank Grevil, a Danish military intelligence officer sacked after leaking classified reports that showed weapons of mass detruction were unlikely to be found in Iraq. The leaks caused deep embarrassment to the Danish government, which joined the so-called coalition of the willing in March 2003. Grevil faces trial in November for breaches of Denmark's secrecy laws. </p> <p>On the brink of war last March, The Observer obtained a top-secret email from the US National Security Agency asking spies at GCHQ to help carry out an illegal intelligence 'surge' on the UN Security Council. The memo asked for 'the whole gamut of information that could give US policymakers the edge in obtaining results favourable to US goals or to head off surprises'. The operation targeted Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Bulgaria, Guinea and, most controversially, Pakistan. </p> <p>Gun, a 28-year-old Mandarin translator at GCHQ, was arrested for leaking the memo and charged with breaches of the Secrets Act eight months later. Her trial collapsed in February after her lawyers demanded disclosure of the Attorney-General's legal advice. The government said the trial was dropped because new intelligence had been received which revealed they would be unlikely to gain a conviction. </p> <p>The Official Secrets Act prevents Gun from inciting others to breach Britain's tough secrecy legislation, but the documents concerned are not classified. The government has consistently argued that they are covered by conventions of legal confidentiality, which safeguard the relationship between lawyer and client. </p> <p>At present there is no 'public interest' defence for whistlebowers unless they can argue that their leak was intended to prevent an immediate threat to life.</p>",
  "It is one of Britain's most enduring murder mysteries. In March 1987 private detective Daniel Morgan was found in the car park of the Golden Lion in Sydenham, south London, with an axe buried in his head. <p>Morgan's business partner, with whom he had fallen out, was friendly with a number of police officers who have since been accused of being implicated in the killing. Allegations of police involvement were made at the inquest but, in spite of hundreds of statements, hours of covert surveillance and four investigations that identified several key suspects, no one has ever been charged. </p> <p>Last week Morgan's family were granted legal aid to attempt to compel the Home Secretary to order a public inquiry into the murder, a request he has refused despite several prominent MPs insisting that it is the only way to resolve the case. </p> <p>This latest development has emerged as Alastair Morgan, Daniel's brother, launches a website that he hopes will help to focus attention on his brother's case. 'I believe Daniel was murdered to prevent him going public with information about police corruption,' he says. 'He used to tell me that corruption was absolutely everywhere and that I would not believe the scale of it. I believe his murder proves that.' </p> <p>This year Roger Williams, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, told the House of Commons that a full judicial inquiry was 'the only way of obtaining fresh and independent scrutiny of the murder and of the circumstances in which successive investigations into it have come to nothing'. </p> <p>The inquest, which took place in April 1988 and ended in a verdict of unlawful killing, heard allegations of involvement by Metropolitan Police officers in the murder and in covering up that involvement. It also heard claims that Jonathan Rees, Daniel Morgan's business partner in their private detective company, Southern Investigations Ltd, had talked about having Daniel killed and arranging for police officers at Catford CID to be involved in the murder and its subsequent cover-up. </p> <p>Morgan had enjoyed a number of careers before starting up Southern Investigations. Once the agency was established, he took on Jonathan Rees as his business partner, chiefly to take advantage of his contacts with the local police. According to the company bookkeeper, Kevin Lennon, Morgan and Rees got on well at first, but the relationship soon began to fall apart over differences in their approach to work. </p> <p>The relationship between the two men came to a head when Southern Investigations was asked to provide security for a car auction company in Charlton, south London. Though Morgan did not want the work, Rees agreed and took the job on, using some of his police friends to provide the security work, moonlighting while off duty. On 18 March 1986 Rees was in charge of the night's takings for the auction, which amounted to more than \u00a318,000. He took the money to a local bank, but discovered the night safe had been glued shut. He decided to take it home, but claimed it was stolen on his doorstep by two men who sprayed noxious liquid in his face. </p> <p>No one was ever caught in connection with the robbery. Many believed the attack was a sham, including the car auction company, which demanded the return of its money. Rees agreed to repay the cash and wanted to take it from the Southern Investigations company account, but Morgan refused to allow him to do so, arguing that the loss had been down to Rees alone. </p> <p>Desperate to take control of the company, Rees allegedly tried on several occasions to have Morgan arrested for drink-driving, knowing that if he lost his licence he would have to give up working at the agency, but to no avail. </p> <p>According to Lennon's statement, read at the inquest, Rees soon decided his only option was to have Morgan killed. 'John Rees explained that, when or after Daniel Morgan had been killed, he would be replaced by a friend of his who was a serving policeman, Detective Sergeant Sid Fillery.' </p> <p>Lennon also told the inquest that Rees said to him: 'I've got the perfect solution for Daniel's murder. My mates at Catford nick are going to arrange it.' Lennon added: 'He went on to explain to me that if they didn't do it themselves the police would arrange for some person over whom they had some criminal charge pending to carry out Daniel's murder.' </p> <p>In the hours after Daniel's death a murder inquiry was launched headed by Detective Superintendent Douglas Campbell. One of the detectives assigned to the squad was none other that Detective Sergeant Fillery. </p> <p>Roger Williams told the House of Commons: 'Not only was Sid Fillery among those officers, but he played a key role in the initial murder inquiry during the first four so-called golden days before he was required to withdraw from the murder squad for reasons of personal involvement with the primary suspect, Jonathan Rees. During those four days, Fillery was given the opportunity to manage the first interview under caution with Rees, and to take possession of key incriminating files from the premises of Southern Investigations Ltd, including Daniel's diary, which has never since been found.' </p> <p>Rees, Fillery and two other police officers were subsequently arrested in connection with the murder, but no charges were ever brought. Fillery went on to take up joint ownership of Southern Investigations. </p> <p>Pressure from Morgan's family and intelligence suggesting that Fillery and Rees were involved in activities with corrupt police officers led to the planting of a bug in the Southern Investigations office in June 1998. Fillery was heard discussing his fears that a police officer who had been jailed for corruption might have given information about the Morgan murder, but little other relevant evidence emerged. </p> <p>A final investigation ended with a file being submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service which, despite compelling evidence, declined to bring a prosecution. 'Only a public inquiry will reveal the truth of what happened to my brother,' Alastair Morgan said.</p>",
  "First he survived a horrific crash and the media frenzy that followed. Now Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard who nearly died with Princess Diana and Dodi al-Fayed when their car ploughed into a tunnel wall in Paris seven years ago, is facing what may be his toughest test of all: working as a security expert in Baghdad. <p>Rees-Jones, 35, arrived in the Iraqi capital earlier this year to work for a European telecoms company, which cannot be named for security reasons. His duties include protection of key personnel as they travel in the city and arranging security for their offices. </p> <p>The former British soldier is believed to be based in the 'international zone' in the centre of Baghdad, a high-security area where diplomats, the new Iraqi government and many private companies are based. The zone is heavily guarded by American soldiers but is still attacked with mortars almost every day. Residents call the morning strikes the 'dawn chorus'. </p> <p>Rees-Jones, who spent six years with the Parachute Regiment and served in Northern Ireland, is believed to carry a weapon much of the time. Almost all security contractors in Baghdad, and especially those involved with close protection of western specialists and officials, are armed. </p> <p>Rees-Jones has been seen at Baghdad airport, which is on the outskirts of the city and one of its most dangerous places. </p> <p>One of his jobs is to ensure the safety of technical experts travelling to and from the airport. The road to the airport, though heavily patrolled by US and Iraqi troops, is frequently ambushed and security companies usually rush their clients along it in a convoy of heavily armoured vehicles. All planes landing at the airport 'corkscrew' down to cut the threat from surface-to-air missiles. </p> <p>Last week, two Italian aid workers were kidnapped from their house in central Baghdad in a professional operation undertaken for money. More than 80 foreigners have been taken hostage in the country in recent months and many of them have been executed. </p> <p>There is some respite from the danger of living in Baghdad, however. Security men patronise bars in several hotels and in the international zone. Rees-Jones has a number of friends working for other organisations in the city. </p> <p>It is unclear how long Rees-Jones, who has recently set up a security firm in northwest England, will be in Iraq. Close protection work can be lucrative, with top operatives commanding fees of up to \u00a31,000 a day. But most earn a fraction of that. </p> <p>Contacted through an intermediary, Rees-Jones, who remarried two years ago and whose new wife was recently reported to be pregnant, refused to comment. A friend said: 'He is getting on with his life, doing something he does very well. He needs to earn a living like anyone else.' </p> <p>It will surprise many that Rees-Jones, who suffered terrible facial injuries in the crash, has to take on such dangerous work. It was widely thought that Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods and Dodi's father, had provided a generous financial package for him. However, Rees-Jones fell out with his former employers after the tragedy. </p> <p>'After the accident, Mohamed al-Fayed looked after all of Trevor's medical needs,' a Harrods spokesman said. 'We broke all contact a couple of years ago with Trevor so do not feel we can comment on why he is doing this now.' </p> <p>Three years ago Rees-Jones published a book describing the events leading up to the death of Diana and Dodi. The pair died, along with their French chauffeur, trying to outrun paparazzi photographers after leaving the Ritz Hotel early on 31 August 1997. </p> <p>The chauffeur had been drinking. Rees-Jones has said he used the proceeds from the book to buy a \u00a3300,000 house in Oswestry, Shropshire, and to pay off legal bills. </p> <p>He was in a coma for 10 days following the crash and underwent months of reconstructive facial surgery. He has said he cannot remember the accident. </p> <p>He was kept in London for several months after his return from Paris while investigators tried to jog his memory for details of the events leading up to the crash. But nothing came back to him, except flashbacks and half-memories which he cannot be sure are real. At one point he said he remembered a voice 'calling out' Dodi's name in the armoured Mercedes moments before it spun out of control. Rees-Jones has been criticised for not insisting on a police escort for Diana and Dodi when they left the Ritz. However, in his autobiography he said he did everything he could to protect the princess. 'They died on my shift and I'll live with that for the rest of my life. But I look in the mirror every day and know I did the best I could,' he wrote. </p> <p>One source closely involved at the time of the crash said that Rees-Jones had been 'traumatised' by it. 'He may think [taking the job in Iraq] will absolve some of the guilt. But a big part of it will be money and to escape life in Oswestry. Trevor has been running ever since the accident happened.' </p> <p>Friends said such talk was 'rubbish'. 'He's not the sort of man to run away from anything,' one said.</p>",
  "The Russian military yesterday extended its offer of a $10 million reward for information leading to the capture of two separatist leaders who, the Kremlin claims, were behind the Beslan massacre. The Russian security service announced it would be willing to pay the bounty to any Chechen terrorist who turned informer. <p>Moscow has claimed militant commander Shamil Basayev and separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov ordered the raid in which at least 326 people, 150 of them children, died. The Russian foreign minister has said that Basayev had directly controlled the raid, being in touch with the hostage-takers while they were in the school. </p> <p>Amid growing discrepancies between the Kremlin's version of what happened at Beslan and the accounts of survivors and locals, people in the North Ossetian town prepared to send their remaining children back to school tomorrow. </p> <p>The Russian Red Cross reported that about 200 people were still missing. On Friday, 90 bodies remained unclaimed, including 53 children, in the main morgue in the regional capital of Vladikavkaz. </p> <p>The gunmen were first reported to be largely Arab with one African in their ranks, later as Chechen and Ingush. The terrorists who surrounded the school numbered about 32. But there is still little evidence, either from survivors or investigators, to confirm statements by President Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov that the attackers included several Arab Muslims. </p> <p>A senior official of the FSB security service claimed last week it had precise information the attack had been ordered by 'Islamic circles in the Middle East', yet declined to specify from where. Putin took a call from the Saudi Arabian leader, Crown Prince Abdullah, last Sunday, during which the prince pledged to step up co-operation against terrorism. </p> <p>Russia has long insisted that its conflict in Chechnya has become part of the world's Islamist militant movement, and is funded from abroad. </p> <p>One senior FSB official said that it had 'precise data' that there were terrorist bases in the Pankisi Gorge - a remote part of neighbouring Georgia which Russia has repeatedly claimed is being used as a sanctuary by terrorists. Military tension between Russia and Georgia grew as the Russian military said it preserved the right to pre-emptively attack such bases anywhere in the world. The Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, was furious at Kremlin hints that access to Beslan may have been gained by militants through the Georgian border. </p> <p>The prosecutor's office also denied yesterday persistent reports that the leader of the Beslan militants - dubbed 'the Colonel' - had escaped. Deputy to the general prosecutor, Vladimir Kolesnikov, said: 'He has received what he deserved and is in a refrigerator now.' He said his identity was known yet had to be 'legally' confirmed, and further information would be released this week. </p> <p>Beslan's siege survivors are adamant their captors spoke in fluent Russian. 'Some of them looked Russian, they were very good-looking,' said Zara Medeyeva, 65, a grandmother who accompanied her two grandchildren and daughter-in-law to their first day back at school. 'It was impossible to say if they were Chechen, Ingush or someone else but nobody around here wears beards like that.' </p> <p>Anonymous sources in the prosecutor-general's office have identified 11 hostage-takers to local media as Ingush and Chechen. The only militant taken alive is Nur-pashi Kuvayev, a Chechen. </p> <p>Medeyeva said she heard the Colonel talking on his mobile phone the day before the end of the siege: 'We've done our part, what was demanded of us. What should we do next?' She remembers him saying. Then throwing his phone on the floor in anger, saying, 'For how long should I wait?'. </p> <p>In Beslan yesterday, in a community where family ties run deep and distant cousins refer to themselves as brothers, all of the 239 dead who have been identified had been buried. </p> <p>The burnt-out school gym, still carrying the stench of charred wood and flesh, has become a shrine. Mourners leave flowers, toys, food and drink, light a candle and pray, or trace a path through shattered classrooms. </p> <p>A deep hole in a library storeroom betrays the place where the militants buried their explosives during summer renovations; the torn pages of a thousand books carpet the floor. Blood spatters line the walls, blood-stained dresses are tossed in corners, and dozens of shoes litter each room. </p> <p>Aza Pukhayeva, who came from St Petersburg to search for her missing 12-year-old niece, Madina, wept as she stepped through the school's cafeteria, then grew agitated at the rancid smell. 'There's someone rotting under here! I can smell it!' she screamed, pulling feverishly at a chair buried under rubble. The discovery of rotting chicken did little to calm her. </p> <p>While grief rules the day, rising anger takes hold at night. The normally bustling streets empty and men haunt street corners, talking quietly among themselves. Political leaders have implored with Ossetians not to respond with more violence, and military checkpoints have closed the border between Ingushetia and North Ossetia. Aslan Maskhadov, former Chechen president and separatist leader, has condemned the hostage-taking. </p> <p>'If we want to preserve our national identity and to maintain the moral rightfulness of our struggle, we must decisively disassociate ourselves from those few whose reason has been clouded by revenge,' Maskhadov said. </p> <p>Rumours swirl of attacks planned by North Ossetians against their regional neighbours and ethnic rivals, the Ingush, to come after the 40th day of mourning, an important ceremonial time in Orthodox Christianity. There are reports of gatherings at night of Ossetian men looking for Ingush in border towns. </p> <p>'Our revenge is blood for blood. For these children, we have to take three times more blood than they did,' said a 45-year-old man clad in black who gave only his initials, MMM, after burying his four children. 'The people will make their decision after the funerals finish.'</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown has struck a deal to derail Brussels plans for a rapid expansion in the EU's budget, wresting back control for the finance ministers of member states.</p> <p>The European Commission had proposed raising spending to \u20ac1 trillion, 1.6 per cent of the EU's national income, between 2007 and 2013. </p> <p>But a group of six countries, led by the Netherlands, insisted that, instead of the Commission dictating the budget, the finance ministers should set bottom-up spending priorities. 'The big difference that has happened here is that this is a massive rejection of Commission control of the budget process,' said a Treasury source. </p> <p>The Dutch finance minister, Gerrit Zalm, chairing the weekend meeting of finance ministers in the Dutch resort of Scheveningen, said the existing budget proposals did not command support. </p> <p>The Chancellor, Gordon Brown, and French finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy, both spoke opposing the rapid growth in spending, which the Treasury said amounted to a 30 per cent increase in real terms. </p> <p>Brown pointed out that if one of the eurozone member-states proposed such a rapid increase in spending in its domestic budget, it would probably be censured by the Commission under the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, which control spending. </p> <p>He and Sarkozy backed the Dutch plan, known as 'building blocks', under which member states will first negotiate on which areas should get extra cash, before spending plans are agreed. </p> <p>The Treasury is keen to keep a ceiling on total EU spending, and to redirect money towards Britain's priorities of enhancing employment and competitiveness, rather than to areas such as culture and health which had been due to get hefty increases under the Commission plan. </p> <p>Late on Friday, the Treasury released a scathing assessment of the EU's progress towards its goal of making Europe the world's most competitive market, and creating millions of jobs, by 2010. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a predicted row about Britain's annual rebate from the EU - secured by Lady Thatcher 20 years ago when the UK's economic performance was lagging behind that of France and Germany - failed to arise at the talks. </p> <p>Several finance ministers have suggested that in the new 25-member EU, Britain should no longer receive the payment, which is calculated using an arcane formula, and amounted to more than \u00a33.5bn last year. </p> <p>Brown challenged his fellow finance ministers to comment on the rebate, but was met with silence.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Alastair Morton, who died recently, was a close friend. Three weeks ago we went out to dinner together. He was on good form and we talked, among other things, about what he considered the recent 'disastrous' changes in the railways. </p> <p>He was keen on making a film setting out his case and outlined at length why he thought the railways were in such a mess, and why the decision to scrap the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) would only make it worse. I was about to send this idea off as a TV proposal when he died suddenly. </p> <p>This is without doubt his last interview and as ever a provocative interpretation from the inside. He would have relished the idea of being heard from beyond the grave. </p> <p>Morton was head of the SRA for two years (1999 to 2001) before he decided to leave in disgust at the government's unwillingness to invest. He was above all shocked at the fact that the government had no coherent strategy and yet felt it needed to be constantly meddling. As he saw it, ministers were focused on one thing - avoiding bad press. </p> <p>Morton felt strongly that the railways saga is 'a classic study of Blair's executive incompetence'. In the latest change of plan, 'having reduced Tory privatisation to a simple contracting out of the rail service to train operators, Blair has decided to scrap the SRA, the supposed executive agency, and make Whitehall bureaucrats run the railways under Number 10 control'. </p> <p>From 1999 to 2001, from the arrival of Lord Macdonald (as minister for transport) to the appearance of Stephen Byers 'there was virtually daily intervention from the Prime Minister's office'. Morton, an alumnus of the public private partnership and the former chairman of Eurotunnel, believed passionately that the railways cannot be run on a part-time basis by people who 'have no experience in industry, no culture of managerial decision, no experience in running a complex company and are subject to intense political interference'. </p> <p>This, he thought, is what centralised control by bureaucrats means: the worst of all possible outcomes. As he put it: 'nationalisation by stealth, with amateurs in charge; long-term objectives addressed by incurably short-term minds.' </p> <p>Blair's tactics, he felt, were to set endless targets. 'The targets are rarely met, and - as in the NHS - are relentlessly manipulated and serve to distract and distort service delivery. None of the creative people with experience is allowed to get on with the job in stable circumstances.' </p> <p>In addition, 'there is deadly confusion between Blair's management tactics and Brown's spending preferences at the Treasury. That bedevils future investment and puts pressure on the spin machine'. </p> <p>In his view, this railway story begins in the Sixties. From then to the Nineties the railways were starved of capital. Far too little was invested in the infrastructure except for a short period between 1959 and 1964. So in the Nineties, Tory politicians arrived at the decision to privatise, with the network desperately needing investment in capital, trains and rail. </p> <p>In the beginning it was hoped that the investment would work through Railtrack. 'Unfortunately that imploded as a corporate enterprise while operating companies showed themselves unwilling to invest on anything like the scale required.' </p> <p>Then (in October 2000) came the Hatfield crash. Morton described it as 'the railways having a collective nervous breakdown. Outmoded networks that were unsafe were no longer an option, but there was no consensus on the way forward. Faced with this the government dictated that Railtrack be propped up until after the election. It then decided, without consultation, on the unwise option of terminating Railtrack rather than sorting it out. The finances of rail were renationalised but not the operations. The Treasury began to put in money. The extra costs of Byers and Blair lashing out incompetently at the problem were put by [rail regulator] Tom Winsor at \u00a314 billion. The situation created by Number 10 intervention began to spiral out of control.' </p> <p>The Treasury needed desperately to cut back on the spend. Morton calculated that the only way they could do that was 'by either reducing services or investing less, or both. Fewer trains may run better for engineers but not for passengers. Unfortunately, both passenger and freight numbers have increased by more than a third since 1995.' </p> <p>He watched the triangular contest continuing 'between Number 10, the Treasury and the realities of rail - a capital intensive, complex, industrial operation of huge scale. The SRA, which [deputy prime minister] John Prescott created to bring order from within the industry rather than from the bureaucracy, is to be abandoned rather than redirected'. </p> <p>Morton summed up with a blistering conclusion. 'In the third shake-up in seven years, Whitehall now has control, day to day - God help us - and the disputed but vast borrowings by Network Rail complete their journey back on to the public sector borrowing lists, putting near-fatal pressure on Gordon Brown's strategy and reputation. In this bind, will the weak Department of Transport get what it needs from the Treasury? And will it be left alone by Number 10? </p> <p>'Don't hold you breath on either. Breakdown beckons, and minister Darling will move on just about the time he grasps why, leaving a successor to shift the deckchairs into a new formation - again. What hope is there now, of getting an effective rail system? Can Blair be held to account for this typical but glaring failure to deliver on his promises of better public service; and Brown for the ongoing failure at the Treasury to understand investment?' Be warned.</p>",
  "<p>Ireland's largest young offenders' centre is awash with drugs, plagued by gang culture and breaking numerous UN and EU conventions over the jailing of juveniles alongside adults, according to relatives of prison officers who work at St Patrick's Institution in Dublin. </p> <p>They claim that chronic understaffing and low morale have led to: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A drug culture supported by ingenious methods of delivery, including eggs containing heroin and hashish. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> No patrols of exterior walls while drug dealers' runners on the outside openly hurl the narcotics into the exercise yard. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Workshops being closed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Juveniles held alongside adults in breach of EU and UN treaties on children's rights. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rival gangs clashing on the wings and in the exercise yard. </p> <p>The Observer met the main spokeswoman for the officers' relatives, the wife of a prison officer with nearly 25 years of service in youth detention. </p> <p>She said the officers were too frightened to speak themselves as they feared they could lose their jobs, face fines or even imprisonment under the Department of Justice's news rules barring state servants such as Garda officers from speaking to the media. </p> <p>On security, she said that drug runners are openly throwing drugs over the exterior wall beside the Royal Canal: 'There are no officers with dogs patrolling around the walls. The drug dealers' runners aren't even worried about the CCTV cameras looking down on the raised ground where they throw the drugs over. They wear baseball caps and scarves over their faces when they do it, some of them don't even bother covering their faces up, they are so brazen.' </p> <p>The officers have noticed a new method to deliver drugs to the young offenders on the other side of the wall - eggs. </p> <p>'The dealers cut an egg at the top, place heroin or hash in tin foil or plastic and drop it into the egg. Then they seal it up and tie it with twine to a stone. They are then thrown on to the net. The egg cracks and the wrap falls out with the yolk. It either falls onto the ground or the young offenders distract prison officers and others form a pyramid until one of them can get to the net and take the drugs off it.' </p> <p>The relatives of the prison officers said that during exercise time there are only five staff to watch 70 to 80 young inmates. The prisoners use mobile phones smuggled into St Patrick's to text their dealers on the outside. </p> <p>The new \u20ac25,000 net was installed to replace nets that were unable to stop tennis and golf balls containing drug wraps falling onto the yard. </p> <p>Founded in 1858 and situated beside Mountjoy Jail, St Patrick's currently holds 170 inmates aged 16 to 21 who are serving a range of sentences up to life. </p> <p>Through their relatives, the officers also claimed that a \u20ac12 million school built beside the north Dublin complex, which the inmates were to attend, has been closed for 18 months because of staff shortages. </p> <p>'The school has a big gym and gym hall, changing rooms and state-of-the-art facilities and it is all lying empty. There is even a gym teacher who has been on the payroll for a year and a half without teaching any of the inmates. </p> <p>'The metal and woodwork workshops have been closed because there are not enough officers to secure the units. There is some education but not much; most of the young offenders' spare time is taken up with passive activities such as watching videos in the library or TV in their cells,' the officers' spokeswoman said. </p> <p>Their claim that housing juvenile offenders (those aged 16 to 18) alongside 19 to 21-year-olds breaches EU and UN conventions on children's rights was backed up yesterday by one of Ireland's leading human rights experts. </p> <p>Ivana Bacik, a law lecturer at Trinity College, Dublin, said that holding juveniles and adults together breached Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Children's Rights. </p> <p>An Irish Prison Service spokesman confirmed that juveniles were incarcerated at St Patrick's with adults but that under the 1999 Children Act there were plans to separate the two age groups. He also said that there were at least two incidents where drugs came over the exterior wall inside eggs and that a workshop was closed due to financial reasons. </p> <p>He denied the officers' claims that drugs were widely available and that mobile phones had been smuggled into St Patrick's. He also denied lack of staff has resulted in security breaches at St Patrick's. </p> <p>'Over 400 prisoners have used our drug-free wing of St Patrick's, which has been highly successful. Indeed there have been comments from drug users sent to St Patrick's describing their time there as like undergoing cold turkey. There are also random searches of prisoners following visits,' he said. </p> <p>He said the prison service did not patrol the exterior walls, as this was the remit of the Garda Siochana.</p>",
  "What will give you some satisfaction this week? It probably won't be sunny weather, but it might be having a good meal or enjoying a drink with friends. It could be having a cigarette in the pub. <p>Smoking is satisfying because seven seconds after you inhale, nicotine releases high amounts of dopamine into the brain which make you relax. The other components of tobacco smoke will rob your heart and blood vessels of oxygen. If you quit before the age of 35, you will probably escape the worst harm. If you don't, you'll face a range of problems in old age and a greater possibility of a premature, death. That is why the tide is turning against smoking. The public, hungry for health knowledge, is well aware of the range of cancers related to tobacco, and the respiratory problems it causes in children. </p> <p>Even though 26 per cent of the population smoke, the vast majority would like to quit. The government is struggling to keep up with a fast-changing shift in opinion. Ministers reacted with tardiness about the growing concern over rising rates of obesity and the prevalence of junk food. It is now in trouble over its new law allowing 24-hour drinking in Britain. Smoking is its next great hurdle. </p> <p>There is a range of measures which would help curb smoking, including a proper crackdown on the sales of cigarettes to children. There also needs to be a full debate on whether or not Britain should go for a full ban in public places. Pubs and restaurants have already said that they will turn up to 80 per cent of their bars into smoke-free areas, which is welcome. A full ban may turn out to be too draconian for a public which is ambivalent on how far to go in outlawing smoking, but we should at least be allowed to have a grown-up discussion.</p>",
  "A former public schoolgirl dubbed Britain's most wanted woman is back living in Britain, The Observer can reveal, despite a five-year police search for her across five European countries. <p>Conservative politician's daughter Fiona Mont, 34, is wanted by police over her alleged involvement in a \u00a3300,000 computer fraud in 1999 - a charge she denies. But Mont, whom friends dubbed 'the cat' because of her ability to avoid capture, is living in a caravan park with her boyfriend and two children just a few miles from her mother's home in Hove, East Sussex. </p> <p>Mont, a one-time law student from a prominent Sussex family - her late father was a criminal lawyer and county under-sherriff and her mother Joan chaired the Conservative county council - was arrested by East Sussex police late in 1999. </p> <p>After being bailed Mont went on the run, first faking her own death in January 2000, leaving her car with the keys in the ignition at notorious suicide spot Beachy Head, and then fleeing the country the following day in a light aircraft piloted by her boyfriend Graham Hesketh, 42, a convicted drug smuggler. Hesketh this week told The Observer how the couple had seen their flight from the authorities together as a romantic Bonnie and Clyde style adventure. </p> <p>'First we went to Holland, then Belgium, the French Riviera for a bit, oh, and Germany. Then Spain, Gibraltar and Portugal,' said Hesketh. 'We had a caravan so small we called it \"the egg\" and my old Land Rover, but we were very much in love and we had a great time.' </p> <p>Hesketh picked up jobs as a labourer and the couple had their first child, Samantha, in 2001 but they were tracked down by British police officers and Interpol in December that year and Mont was arrested at a caravan site near Malaga in Spain. She spent a month in a Spanish jail while extradition procedures were processed. 'She was very low at that point,' said Hesketh. 'She thought that was it, she was going to be sent back and go to jail.' </p> <p>But, to the fury of British police, a Spanish magistrate allowed her out on bail and she was on the run again. Back home in the UK her friends set up a website which mocked police for their inability to catch the fugitives. Meanwhile the officer in charge of the case, Detective Constable Steve Skerrett, was reduced to seeking new leads from the public by making television appeals for information on Crimewatch and Britain's Most Wanted . </p> <p>Sussex officers have spent thousands of pounds pursuing her - the two-day police helicopter and coastguard boat hunt at Beachy Head alone cost Sussex taxpayers an estimated \u00a330,000 before Mont's mother admitted she had had a call from her runaway daughter, revealing she had left the country. </p> <p>But now, Hesketh claims, Mont has been living openly back in Sussex for over a year. Their 11-month-old son, Benjamin, was born at Worthing hospital and the family still use the distinctive white Land Rover that Skerrett had asked British holidaymakers to look out for in TV appeals. </p> <p>Hesketh said: 'She's not using any disguises or false names like she has before, just going about her business as normal. We have two children, we just want to get on with life, get married, maybe go back and live in Spain. </p> <p>'The police would be gutted if they knew how long we'd been here. I'm working, doing odd jobs, but it's all legit, I'm paying tax and everything.' </p> <p>He went on: 'It's no fun being on the run and having to uproot yourself every few weeks, especially with children. It was romantic at first but it was hard too. </p> <p>'We just want to lead a straight life now and if she has to face any charges, she's ready for it.' </p> <p>Hesketh revealed that Mont first flew back into Britain on a Monarch Airlines flight from Faro in Portugal to Gatwick on 21 November 2002 'to test the water', but was fully expecting to be arrested when she presented her passport to immigration officials. To her shock, she wasn't. </p> <p>'It was then we realised they didn't really care. Fiona even has the occasional text message from Skerrett and rang the East Sussex Chief Constable's office to ask if she should come in to be questioned. But they never returned her call. So we all started making regular trips and then we moved back permanently.' </p> <p>Hesketh went on: 'We want to clear the air for the sake of the children. We're sick of all this fraud stuff. She says she had nothing to do with it at all. We want to put it behind us and get on with the rest of our lives.' </p> <p>Skerrett has since left the police force and with him, apparently, went much of the interest in closing the open file on the original fraud. </p> <p>A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'The warrant for Fiona Mont's arrest would seem to have expired. The file on this case remains open. We would be very interested in information about Fiona Mont's current whereabouts if she was here on a long-term basis.'</p>",
  "David Blunkett will herald a return to traditional 'bobby on the beat' policing this week when he argues that every citizen in Britain should know the name of their local police officer and play an active part in the fight against crime and antisocial behaviour. <p>During a speech to the Police Superintendents' Association conference, the Home Secretary will urge middle-ranking officers to embrace changes proposed in a forthcoming White Paper on police reform allowing local communities to trigger action against members of the community who cause a nuisance. </p> <p>PSA president Chief Superintendent Rick Naylor said he backed the Home Secretary's calls for a move back to the concept of the beat bobby. </p> <p>'Authority needs a name, otherwise you don't know who to blame when things go wrong. This is all about local accountability. If it's harking back to the days when you personally knew the officer on the beat, then so be it.' </p> <p>The superintendents will call for a national police service, as part of the reform package, to replace the present 43 forces in England and Wales. A Home Office spokeswoman said Blunkett had not ruled out change to the local structure of Police Authorities and forces headed by chief constables, but was yet to be convinced of the need for a centralised national force. </p> <p>She said the results of a nationwide public consultation exercise have persuaded the Home Secretary that the public's priorities are often very different from those of chief constables. 'We are listening to what communities tell us. They are concerned by antisocial behaviour and low-level crime. This is about little old ladies frightened to leave their homes.' </p> <p>A source close to Blunkett said the first phase of police reform was 'unfinished business that Michael Howard was afraid to deal with as Home Secretary'. This included renegotiating police terms and conditions, setting up a national Police Standards Unit and introducing community support officers. </p> <p>Blunkett believes the second phase of reform will prove more controversial because it will take power away from chief constables and allow local communities to define local priorities. </p> <p>The Bichard Inquiry into failures around the Soham investigation discovered inconsistencies of approach between forces and a failure to share crucial information. </p> <p>The PSA believes a layer of the present structure could be removed, with local policing dealt with by one of the country's 250 Basic Command Units under the control of chief superintendents answerable to a national leadership. </p> <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers is known to be concerned that any reform to the structure of the police service could lead to instability.</p>",
  "<p>Having often described the Blair-Brown relationship as a 'duumvirate', I was reminded, while reading Tom Holland's Rubicon in deepest Roman Provence, that, until things got out of hand, consuls in Ancient Rome were elected for a year at a time.</p> <p>The idea of having two consuls was that the one would balance the other. So far from working together, or against each other, for a year, Blair and Brown are now in the eighth record-breaking year of their duumvirate. </p> <p>For all the 'soap opera' aspects of their political partnership, the two have endured. I went away on holiday thinking - somewhat wistfully, I acknowledge - that the coming Labour party conference would be the perfect time for Tony Blair to resign, and for the party to elect a new leader in time to put his own imprint on the next electoral manifesto. </p> <p>Against the background of the worsening situation in the Middle East (including growing speculation about an American pre-emptive strike against Iran) and warning signs about sluggishness in the world economy, it was a bit of a shock to return to Britain and find that the two great preoccupations in Westminster were fox-hunting and the latest developments in the Blair-Brown saga. </p> <p>Without wishing to push the parallel too far - unlike Caesar at the time, Tony Blair already has the top job - the Prime Minister seems last week to have crossed the Rubicon in his relations with the Chancellor.</p> <p>When John Prescott referred earlier in the summer to the 'plates shifting', he appeared to have in mind an understanding reached at a dinner of the triumvirate (Blair, Brown, Prescott) last November in Admiralty House. My understanding (which was shared with certain other commentators) is that Blair indicated an intention to step down in the course of 2004, and appealed to the others for help in getting 'from here to there'. </p> <p>At some later stage, Blair even thought of announcing his intentions in advance in the spring, but was dissuaded by Brown and others. This is not incompatible with Brown's well-known ambition, the Chancellor's fear being that a pre-announcement would cause chaos, and only damage the Labour party. </p> <p>But it is clear that in the course of the summer the Prime Minister emerged from his slough of despond, hoping, among other things, that serious Labour party disquiet over Iraq would prove to be 'a phase, not a continuum'. His change of mood was undoubtedly assisted by encouragement from a handful of ministers who would not describe themselves as 'friends of Gordon Brown'. (It is tempting to think that Blair took one look at the pensions crisis and decided that he couldn't afford to retire; but he will, of course, be made for life on the memoir front and the American lecture circuit.) A close friend of Blair's commented the other day: 'He may have had dark moments, but Tony loves the job and the world stage.' </p> <p>The appointment of Alan Milburn as 'election co-ordinator' looks like a snub to Brown, has been reported as such, and most certainly is. This is not just a case of 'idle gossip' on the part of members of the various retinues.</p> <p>In the circumstances the publication this week of Roy Jenkins, A Retrospective (Oxford, edited by Andrew Adonis and Keith Thomas) could hardly be more timely. Until now it has been widely assumed that New Labour (very much the creation of Blair and Brown) was, for all the soap opera aspects, a remarkably successful party of government, in contrast to the supposed shambles of Old Labour.</p> <p>If the events of the past week have proved anything, it is that the top of the Labour party is now a shambles, and needs to get its act together if it is not to squander its many hard-won gains. </p> <p>Roy Jenkins was almost as ambitious for the premiership as Brown has been, and of course never got it. But the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, did not dilly-dally about the timing of his resignation. </p> <p>As David Marquand points out in one of the essays in Roy Jenkins, Wilson's confidant, Lord Goodman, told Jenkins at a Box ing Day party in 1975 'that Wilson had made up his mind to resign in March'. </p> <p>Wilson's impending resignation remained a closely guarded secret, and was announced on 16 March, 1976. There had been several occasions in the past when Jenkins would have been the favourite to succeed Wilson, but by then it was too late. Jenkins came third in the first ballot and withdrew, proceeding to make his next contribution to history by being the driving force, as president of the European Commission, behind the setting up of the European Monetary System in 1979, the necessary precursor to the formation of the eurozone. </p> <p>It is clear that there is a faction around Blair that wants to make it too late for Brown, and the irony is that on several occasions Brown and Prescott have combined to save Blair from parliamentary humiliation and the danger of an enforced resignation in messy circumstances. </p> <p>I have suggested before that a promise from Tony Blair is not worth the paper it isn't written on. It looks at this stage as if this may be the case, even if there are highly placed witnesses present. </p> <p>This is a potential tragedy for the Labour party and the country. It is surely not too late for the party to get its act together, but the omens do not look good. I don't care what the focus groups say, but everywhere I go I find people in all walks of life who are not prepared to vote for a Labour party led by Tony Blair, because they feel misled over Iraq. </p> <p>Apart from being the most disgraceful foreign policy venture since Suez, Iraq has also been an immense distraction from other policies. We shall return to the economy next week. </p> <p>In the meantime, I am still scratching my head over the pride of place being given to banning fox-hunting.</p>",
  "Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have been locked in a mammoth power struggle. So what's new? The latest orgy of infighting has been rancorous and extraordinarily public even by this government's standards, but it is tempting to dismiss the eruptions of the past seven days as just another chapter really no different to so many other turbulent episodes over the past seven years. <p>The divisions at the top of the government were hardly a state secret when the week began. There has been vitriolic spinning, dark manoeuvres, explosions of pique, bouts of the sulks, shouting matches, fallings out, makings up and vengeful settlings of scores from day one of this government. And yet there has always been one essential fact about Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - they have somehow just about held it together to become the longest-lasting combination of Prime Minister and Chancellor in well over a century. </p> <p>So it is quite tempting to think that nothing fundamental has changed. Tempting, but wrong. A new dynamic has been injected into the relationship between Prime Minister and Chancellor which takes them into uncharted waters shrouded in dangerous mists. </p> <p>The original settlement between the two men, in which Tony Blair ceded so much power to Gordon Brown that he made him an effective dual monarch, is now unravelling. The Prime Minister has decided that the throne is only big enough for one of them. The Department of Work and Pensions, which the Treasury has treated as its colony, has been transferred into the non-Brownite hands of the highly able Alan Johnson who won his Cabinet spurs during the battle for the student tuition fees that the Chancellor vehemently opposed. </p> <p>In an average episode of the TeeBee-GeeBees, that would have been sufficient to provoke an explosion from the Chancellor. The real stinger for him was the return to the Cabinet of Alan Milburn, aggressive Blairite and arch-antagonist of the Chancellor, to run Labour's next election campaign, shearing from Mr Brown the key role he played in the past two elections. </p> <p>For those Blairites who have long been urging the Prime Minister to assert himself over the Chancellor, this marks the moment when he finally takes full control of his government and sets the direction and tone of its third term. Tony Blair has been persuaded by his supporters that he must slip the surly bonds of his Chancellor to secure himself a legacy from public-sector reform. Gordon Brown fears that another burst of Blairite boldness could wreck his rightful inheritance, even rob him of it altogether. </p> <p>The Treasury has trembled its lip with injured bewilderment that Tony Blair should want to sideline the man who did so much to deliver two previous landslide election victories. That is the perplexed face of a seething internal fury. Protestations from Downing Street that they still want to use the brilliant campaigning skills of the Chancellor at the election are received with scorn by his friends. </p> <p>One confidant of Gordon Brown even describes what has happened as a 'coup' against the Chancellor, engineered by those whose central objective is to prevent him from ever becoming Prime Minister. There is only thing wrong with that description of coup. It suggests that what happened was meticulously planned and cleanly executed. </p> <p>The Prime Minister lurched into this trial of strength. His original plan was to bring Alan Milburn back to the cabinet as a replacement for Ian McCartney as chairman of the Labour Party. Gordon Brown was not so against shifting Mr McCartney. What he wanted was his talented protege, Douglas Alexander, in the job. The unfortunate Mr Alexander ended up being a casualty of the infighting. </p> <p>After John Prescott's loyal defence of Mr McCartney, and the diminutive Glaswegian's winning public appeal to his party in which he presented himself as an unwilling sacrifice to English snobbery about his accent, the Prime Minister could have persisted with his first plan only at the risk of thrusting Mr Prescott into permanent alliance with the Chancellor. </p> <p>Once the leaking had began, it became a virility contest, whether the Prime Minister fancied one or not. Andrew Smith had pre-empted him by jumping from the Cabinet before he was pushed. To have tried and failed to bring back Alan Milburn would have shredded Mr Blair's authority. 'He would have been done for,' is the stark assessment of one of his allies. </p> <p>This presented an opportunity to be exploited by those Blairites who have long exhorted the Prime Minister to take on Gordon Brown. When Alan Milburn went to Number 10 on Wednesday night to discuss the terms of his return to the Cabinet, he audaciously arrived with a job description for himself. For all that he is a close ally of the Prime Minister, you might think that presumptuous from a man who threw a previous Blair reshuffle into chaos 14 months ago with his sudden - and now reversed - desire to spend more time with his family. </p> <p>But Mr Milburn went for his conversation knowing how vital it is to delineate exactly where the power lies in the New Labour family. He wanted to be sure that he would be a made man with a real job. To have accepted an ill-defined role would have been to offer his feet for the fitting of concrete overshoes by his enemies at the Treasury. </p> <p>The job description was drafted at lunchtime that day in the Commons office of his close friend and fellow Blairite, Stephen Byers. The drafting group in Mr Byers's room also included John Reid and Tessa Jowell. They were among the cabinet ministers who earlier this year went to Tony Blair to urge him not to resign. They were again fearful that afternoon that a wobbly Prime Minister might not stand firm. Characteristically, Mr Blair was all for making an announcement about Mr Milburn and filling in the details later. </p> <p>The Prime Minister habitually finds it hard to fathom why his colleagues attach so much importance to who chairs what committee. So it was smart of Mr Milburn to insist on having his precise powers over campaigning, policy and manifesto work nailed down by Downing Street. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is a silly title. He had to have guarantees that it was serious role. </p> <p>This is a gamble both for himself and the Labour Party. If the manifesto doesn't sing, if Labour fights a bad campaign at the next election and if it ends up with a much reduced majority, Mr Milburn's ambitions will surely be ashes. </p> <p>The Chancellor feels as warmly about Mr Milburn as he does about Peter Mandelson. And Mr Milburn does not have Mr Mandelson's one redeeming feature of not being a potential contestant for the leadership. </p> <p>Many previous Blair reshuffles have been presented as cutting down Gordon Brown. And yet the real Chancellor always emerges from them as massive as ever. It is a tribute to Mr Brown that over all these years he has sustained his position as the heir transparent against all-comers. To challenge that, Alan Milburn will have to succeed where every other Cabinet rival has so far failed. </p> <p>All of which can make it seem rather baffling why this has caused the fury and distrust of the Brown camp to rage at quite such a new pitch of intensity. </p> <p>There are some genuine differences about policy. But they are more complex than the crude painting of the Chancellor as an unreconstructed statist and the portrayal of the Blairites as reckless neo-Thatcherites. Neither bears much relation to the true and subtler picture. Gordon Brown and Alan Milburn are arguably closer to each other on some issues than either is to the Prime Minister. Mr Milburn has been one of those urging that the government should define itself more around equality, which ought to put him on the same page as the Chancellor. It is a sign of how poisoned the atmosphere has become that the adversaries depict each other in such dark caricature. </p> <p>The ferocity of this eruption appears to have taken both sides by some surprise because it followed a period of relative calm. The Chancellor has been unexpectedly accommodating of the Prime Minister's desire to assert himself more in the domestic realm. When Number 10 drove the five-year plans for the public services, Mr Blair's aides expressed private surprise that they faced so little resistance from the Treasury. They were wrong if they concluded that Gordon Brown was suddenly content to surrender territory to Tony Blair. The explanation is that the Chancellor thought he could afford to relax because he would be moving into Number 10 before the election. </p> <p>Even Tony Blair's friends don't deny that he has managed his Chancellor by continually manipulating his hopes. There has been a series of 'arrangements' about the handover which always turn out to be much less firm than the Chancellor took them to be. Someone who has known both men extremely well for many years wryly remarked to me recently: 'No deal exists unless it's written down on paper, especially with Tony.' </p> <p>The Chancellor believes the Prime Minister has once again led him a dance over the succession; the Prime Minister flatly denies that the music was ever playing. </p> <p>One remarkable suggestion has come from close friends of Mr Brown about the period earlier this year when Tony Blair was at his most embattled over Iraq. It is claimed that the Chancellor nobly put aside his ambitions by persuading Mr Blair not to pre-announce he would resign before the election. This does stretch credulity to snapping point, does it not? Can we really picture the scene? A despairing Tony decides he is finished and will declare that he plans to quit Number 10. A distraught Gordon talks him out of it: 'Please, God, Tony, don't go. Anything but that. I don't want to hear another word from you about quitting.' </p> <p>There is just one way this could make sense. That is if the Chancellor was convinced that Mr Blair was going to quit before the election and wanted to delay the public declaration in order to control the timing of the handover. Allies of Mr Blair are as adamant that nothing like this ever occurred as associates of Mr Brown are emphatic that it did. </p> <p>So the two sides cannot agree on their history anymore than they can on their future. Through all the many turmoils of their partnership, Prime Minister and Chancellor have held it together on the basis that the government's record, Tony Blair's legacy and Gordon Brown's prospects of securing the premiership were mutually served by avoiding a terminal meltdown in their relationship. However awful things have got, they have always been forced back on to the conclusion that they were stronger together. </p> <p>Do they still believe that? I'd say it's no longer sure. That is what is so significantly different now. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:a.rawnsley@observer.co.uk \">a.rawnsley@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>For Andrew Smith, the work and pensions minister who resigned last Monday, it was the last straw. His department has been quietly working away for more than two years on schemes to coax some of the 2.7 million people claiming incapacity benefit back into work; but Number 10 was keen to impose a far tougher solution, which would slash the annual \u00a38 billion spent on the benefit in half. </p> <p>The row about the best way to reduce the number of people dependent on this benefit will be one of the first tests of the renewed grip of the Blairite wing of the Labour party over social policy, after last Thursday's cabinet reshuffle. Sources say the pressure for radical cost-cutting measures, which infuriated Smith, had been coming from the Number 10 Strategy Unit, now to be headed up by Alan Milburn. </p> <p>And Alan Johnson, the former union leader parachuted in to take over as secretary of state at the DWP, is widely seen as being on the right wing of the party. </p> <p>Recorded unemployment in the UK is at the lowest level in a generation; but incapacity benefit is one of the few corners of what used to be called the social security system that has been left virtually untouched by Labour's welfare-to-work revolution. Medical checks have been toughened, and new claimants now have to attend a 'work-focused interview' with a Jobcentre personal adviser when they first start receiving the benefit. But after that they don't have to have any kind of check-up for three years. </p> <p>Once a claimant has been receiving IB for more than six months, they stay on it for an average of 18 years - and once they have been on it for two years, they're more likely to retire or die than leave the benefit for a job. Paul Gregg, a special adviser to the Chancellor on social policy, explains that because it is more generous than jobseeker's allowance, and doesn't require repeated checks on what the claimant is up to, IB 'becomes a benefit of choice'. </p> <p>Professor Steve Fothergill of Sheffield Hallam University has carried out several studies on the 'hidden unemployment' that lies beneath the incapacity figures. He and his colleague Christina Beatty have calculated that 1.1 million of the 2.7 million people claiming incapacity benefit would probably be in a job if Britain's economy were at full employment, one of the Chancellor's major goals. </p> <p>Of the 7 million people in the UK who, when surveyed, say they have long-term health problems at any one point, about half manage to do at least some paid work. 'Where the economy is strong, and employers can't be so fussy, people with health problems do work,' Fothergill says. </p> <p>The Treasury and DWP have been looking at the problem of incapacity benefit for some time. The DWP, under Smith, has been piloting a scheme called 'Pathways to Work' in areas covering 10 per cent of the country. The scheme operates rather like Gordon Brown's series of New Deals, which Labour believes have been a success. Claimants who volunteer to participate are provided with personal advice, help from the NHS with rehabilitation from their health conditions, and a \u00a340-a-week top-up payment for a year if they manage to find a job. </p> <p>So far, the Pathways scheme has been voluntary, but the early anecdotal results, the DWP says, have been positive. It would cost \u00a3500m to roll the programme out across the country, but the department is keen to keep gathering evidence until the pilots have been running for two years (late 2005). </p> <p>However, with the bill for IB standing at almost \u00a38bn per annum, and an elec tion likely within a year, Smith was under pressure to move more quickly - and to apply the stick more heavily than the carrot, with the aim of cutting in half the number of people claiming IB. </p> <p>Richard Holmes, campaigns director at the lobby group Disability Alliance, is concerned that 'everything is up for grabs' in the debate. He accepts that some claimants could work, given the right kind of help and a flexible enough employer; but says Labour needs to be understanding of those who continue to need support. 'When they came to power they said \"work for those who can, security for those who cannot\". We're worried that the \"security for those who cannot\" bit is slipping further and further down the agenda.' </p> <p>The Disability Alliance will be watching any reform proposals closely, and is ready to fight anything that seems to be aimed simply at cost-cutting. </p> <p>Kate Stanley, head of social policy at think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, says with the Pathways programme still being piloted, it is too soon to make radical, untested changes. 'One of the issues at the moment is that there's an impatience to do something, but the evidence just isn't there.' </p> <p>There is an important regional dimension to the problem of incapacity benefit dependence. Claimants are concentrated in a relatively small number of areas, mainly the former industrial heartlands of the north east and north west of England and in Wales and Scotland. In Easington, in the former coalfields of the north east, 21 per cent of the working-age population is on incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance. By comparison, in West Berkshire, the figure is below 3 per cent. Merthyr Tydfil, in the Welsh valleys, and the former shipbuilding areas around Glasgow are other black spots. </p> <p>'I think if you look at the numbers, what really shines through is that this is not a problem that you find evenly all over the country,' Fothergill says. </p> <p>'The sort of jobs that many of these people would have occupied in the bygone world have disappeared. The Treasury and the DWP tend to be a bit blind to the geography of all this. Once you get on incapacity benefit in some of these hardcore areas, you tend not to come off.' </p> <p>In this context, he believes, benefit reforms would just be 'tinkering at the edges'. But actually cutting benefit lev els, he says, would be a 'sledgehammer'. 'It comes down to regional policy as the solution,' Fothergill says. 'What's got to happen if you're going to make significant inroads is you're going to have to direct the jobs being created by the economy into the areas where there's still substantial slack: the north east, the Welsh Valleys, Clydeside. This government makes a lot of positive noises about regional policy, but it hasn't actually done a lot.' </p> <p>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and Gordon Brown are both keen to stimulate regional redevelopment through devolution, tax breaks for entrepreneurs in deprived areas, and so on. </p> <p>But old-style targeting of direct government spending to boost poorer regions is out of fashion; and for a government approaching a general election and keen to demonstrate its radical credentials, a quick-fix for the \u00a38bn problem of incapacity benefit is bound to seem more appealing. </p> <p>Milburn, with his brief to co-ordinate social policy across government (and prepare for the election campaign) is likely to push the Treasury hard to use more sticks than carrots to persuade expensive IB claimants back into the workforce.</p>",
  "<p>Labour is moving towards introducing controversial measures to compel companies to provide occupational pensions for their employees.</p> <p>Labour's July National Policy Forum, the body that devises party policy across all areas of government, has concluded that ending the voluntary system of pension saving would be necessary if people were not increasing the amount they saved.</p> <p>A Policy Forum document seen by The Observer states that if the independent Pension Commission, chaired by the former head of the CBI, Adair Turner, finds that savings are not increasing, moves, including legislation, will be needed. </p> <p>The document, entitled Full Text on Pensions, states: 'If commission reports show that there is not a significant increase in the numbers of people taking steps to provide for a secure retirement on top of the state pension, the Labour Party will support moving beyond the current voluntary system, including legislation if necessary and other measures.'</p> <p>Recent evidence indicates that household savings are low and are not increasing. Official statistics show the savings ratio falling from 7 per cent of total household wealth to 6 per cent in 2003.</p> <p>Policy forum decisions are not binding, but they are ignored at the Government's peril. Pensions will be at the top of the agenda at this week's Trades Union Congress. </p> <p>The TUC General Secretary, Brendan Barber, will today highlight the importance of the pensions crisis. On the eve of Congress, he said: 'Our message will be going out loud and clear this week to the government. First recognise the depth of the pensions crisis. </p> <p>'Second, accept the state's responsibility to give us all a firm pensions foundation. Restore the link between the state pension and earnings.</p> <p>Third, recognise the special position of women. Give pensions an equality audit.</p> <p>'Fourth, phase in compulsory employer contribution. And fifth, we accept employees have a responsibility. That is why we are happy for employers to make membership of a quality scheme a condition of employment.'</p>",
  "It wasn't the wolfish grin that gave the game away last Wednesday afternoon, as Alan Milburn came bowling down the underpass that separates his Commons office from the main building. It was the hair. <p>Creeping steadily over his collar ever since he left the Cabinet last year to spend more time with his two sons, his longish locks had signalled that the former radical bookstore owner really had dropped out of public life. By last week, however, he was sporting a businesslike short back and sides - as one MP put it, Power Hair.</p> <p>Alan Milburn's locks were not all that were pruned last week. In a bold putsch, Tony Blair hacked up Gordon Brown's empire - and handed most of the spoils to the former Health Secretary, who emerged this week as Brown's clearest rival for the leadership, at a stroke changing the dynamics of the race to succeed Blair.</p> <p>The Chancellor was forced to sit and watch as his closest ministerial ally, Douglas Alexander, was stripped of his role co-ordinating the election campaign: it went to Milburn. Brown's most gifted minister, cheery mother-of-four Ruth Kelly, was plucked from the Treasury: to work for Milburn. A Downing Street office has been cleared: for Milburn. And finally, Alexander was made junior trade minister, forcing him to work closely with the Brown camp's b\u00eate noire , European trade commissioner Peter Mandelson. </p> <p>Someone in Downing Street, it seems, likes a macabre joke. 'What really raises eyebrows was the scale of the aggressive, abusive, vituperative briefing,' says one friend of Alexander. 'It's pathetic. Douglas feels humiliated. This is someone who has won everyone's respect, and he has been deprived of his job because somebody wanted to score points off Gordon.' </p> <p>The past week has certainly been messy for all sides: it took three long days, from last Sunday's leaked revelation that Milburn was to return to government before he formally agreed to do it, days during which Blair's Cabinet looked at times wilfully beyond his control. </p> <p>But, as the logic of the reshuffle becomes clear, the tables are slowly turning. Alarmingly for Brown, there are signs of a backlash even among some of his most ardent supporters, disappointed by what many see as the end of hopes for a leadership contest before the election. </p> <p>Clare Short, the former international development secretary, hinted darkly last Thursday that she felt let down by her old Cabinet ally, adding: 'Many who think the country and the Labour party badly need a new leader _ feel disappointed that Brown has not made his stand.' It looked, Short concluded, 'as though the moment has passed'. </p> <p>The question now being asked at Westminster is whether she is right: has Brown had his 'Portillo moment'? Just as the former defence secretary famously installed phone lines in preparation for a coup against John Major and then backed down, the Chancellor held back from wielding the dagger this summer, when Blair was clearly wobbling over Iraq. Portillo lost to an arguably less talented candidate when he eventually did fight a leadership contest in 2001. Could Brown, too, have blown his chances? </p> <p>'Politics is a story in which there are moments when things just happen decisively, and if you miss them they're gone forever,' said one senior Whitehall source. 'There's a palpable sense around Gordon that, while he's still very strong, that window of destiny has just closed. </p> <p>'It's about having the nerve or not having the nerve, and the truth is, when it mattered he didn't. He's a decent individual ... and, when it really comes to it, that makes it difficult.' </p> <p>Such talk infuriates Brown's friends, who argue that, if he challenges Blair, he is decried as a traitor - and, if he doesn't, 'he's accused of having bottled it'. </p> <p>But both sides at least agree that last week's scrappy reshuffle has its roots in the crisis that engulfed Downing Street earlier this summer. It is no coincidence that, at the height of the tensions, whispers again resurfaced about Blair's now infamous dark night of the soul: the point, towards the end of May, when brooding over Iraq led him to fear he had become a liability to Labour, convincing many Brownites their time had finally come. </p> <p>Reports last week suggested that, before the summer, Blair was ready to make a public announcement that he would be gone by the next election - only to be talked out of it by Brown, who argued that would make him a lame duck. </p> <p>For a chancellor always portrayed as crazed by ambition, it was an interesting twist. Could Brown really have saved Blair from himself, only to be let down when the Prime Minster decided to stay? And if so, does that mean Brown lost his nerve - or has he simply been playing a long game, one that will be fully understood only after the next election? </p> <p>Andrew Smith is not much given to public emotion. So it was no surprise that the mild-mannered work and pensions secretary betrayed little sign, settling into one final radio interview last Sunday night, that it was to be his last as a cabinet minister. </p> <p>He had just read the latest batch of headlines predicting, yet again, his imminent sacking - and the triumphant return of Milburn, possibly even snatching the post of chairman from Smith's old friend Ian McCartney. Ever since July's aborted reshuffle, when Blair tried and failed to switch his team around following Peter Mandelson's exit to Brussels, Westminster gossip had seen Smith - Brown's closest cabinet ally - as a dead man walking. Over the long summer, he had concluded that he no longer wanted to fight. </p> <p>Claims that Smith quit after a battle with Downing Street over incapacity benefit reform may be exaggerated, but his friends admit that a string of forthcoming struggles - over everything from welfare reform to the sacking of thousands of civil servants, imposed on him by the Treasury - did little to entice him to stay: 'He could see a number of pinch points that would be difficult.' </p> <p>The morning after his radio interview, Smith announced his decision to his aides, then had a brief conversation with his old friend Brown, before heading to a scheduled policy meeting with Blair. To his boss's surprise, he used it to hand in his resignation. </p> <p>If Smith jumped before he was pushed, he may have been premature: Blair had by then decided to keep him where he was, at least until the election.</p> <p>But his resignation forced Blair's hand, tipping him into an unseemly scramble of a reshuffle and turning what had been just an embarrassing leak - about Milburn's return - into a fullblown power struggle. If Blair failed to get Milburn on board, he would be seen to have lost a crucial battle with the chancellor. Was the timing of Smith's resignation - and its leak - a deliberate attempt by the Brown camp to throw a spanner into the works? </p> <p>Smith's friends insist not. And for once, Blair's plans were largely being frustrated not by dark forces in the Treasury, but by someone closer to home. </p> <p>Blair had first privately asked Milburn to return in July. The spring local election campaign, run by Brown and Alexander, had provoked ministerial complaints about being forced to stick to boring scripts highlighting past achievements, rather than ideas for the future. Blair was casting round for a different way of doing things before the election. </p> <p>Milburn was already dropping in on strategy meetings during spring: he has been a confidant of Mandelson since his first days in cabinet. In the telegenic Geordie with the steely will, Blair finally saw someone to fill gaps left by the departures not only of Mandelson but also of Alastair Campbell - a counterweight to Brown's instinctive caution. </p> <p>Milburn refused the job, insisting he was not yet ready to abandon his relaxed new life. 'People think that all politicians are really desperate for the next big job. It's quite difficult when you find one who isn't, because what do you offer them?' says one Downing Street source. While Mandelson's agonies over whether to go to Brussels were blamed for the shelving of a planned July reshuffle, it was Milburn's refusal to fall into line that finally ensured the shake-up never took place. </p> <p>But after long discussions with his partner, Ruth, over summer, friends say Milburn finally accepted that - with the Government in growing difficulties - it was his duty to come back. Fearful of charges of hypocrisy so soon after resigning to see more of his children, he insisted that any job had to be presented as temporary, allowing him to leave after the election if necessary. </p> <p>That meant, Downing Street aides admit, 'a tricky and shaky' start. While McCartney gave a defiant interview making clear he was not going to be pushed aside, Milburn spent much of last Wednesday holed up in the office of his old friend Stephen Byers, drafting - with help from Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, and health secretary John Reid, who advised him on exactly where power lies in the party machine - his job description. Bruised by years of fighting Brown, Milburn knew he needed sufficient authority to defend himself against the chancellor if he was to come back. </p> <p>But, as the horse-trading dragged on, the Tories saw their chance to embarrass Blair by bringing forward their own reshuffle. Stephen Sherborne, Michael Howard's chief of staff, began sending discreet pager messages to a handful of MPs, among them a baffled John Redwood, who had long given up expecting a recall. </p> <p>By Tuesday evening, as the Tory great and good gathered in Soho for a champagne reception hosted by chairman Lord Saatchi, reshuffle rumours were swirling. And when Howard released the final line-up of his surprise new team just before 6pm on Wednesday, it seemed he had stolen a march on Blair. But within minutes, Alan Johnson - the tough-talking former postman now promoted to take over Smith's old job - was slipping into Downing Street: finally, if jerkily, Blair's reshuffle was under way. Now it was time to pick up the pieces. </p> <p>When Alan Milburn emerged onto the doorstep of Number 10 on Thursday morning after his first cabinet meeting, he was accompanied by Ian McCartney, the man he had originally been tipped to replace. Both know the appearance of unity must be swiftly restored, or this month's Labour Party conference risks descending into a bloodbath. </p> <p>At first glance, there are not too many cracks in the facade. Brown may have made clear his fury at the briefing surrounding the reshuffle during a private conversation with Blair after Thursday's cabinet meeting, but - contrary to some fears - he did not walk out. </p> <p>And Downing Street is hoping that Alexander made enough enemies during his meteoric rise to stop him becoming a martyr: his failure to suffer fools gladly has irritated even some sympathisers. 'Douglas has been guilty for some time of over-reaching himself,' admits a Brownite backbencher. </p> <p>Downing Street, none the less, is nervous enough of the consequences of Brown's wrath to be pumping out emollient messages. Gordon is 'a great chancellor': the reshuffle was not an attempt to provoke him out of office. Of course he still has a role in the election campaign: and, even if Milburn is now pulling the manifesto together, he is not in charge of it ... well, not exactly.</p> <p>More privately, there are soothing suggestions that Blair still plans to retire during the next parliament, allowing Brown his rightful inheritance. </p> <p>But behind the scenes, there is a different, harder mood, one revealed when Byers - in an interview to be screened by GMTV this morning - let it be known that Milburn would make an excellent prime minister. </p> <p>The unspoken message of the reshuffle is that Brown no longer has a clear run at the crown: his hesitation before the summer - when he could have run, if not unoppposed, at least against opponents he was confident of beating - may be fatal. Milburn's friends may insist he does not want to be leader, but he has clearly been pushed into pole position should he change his mind. 'There is this sense now that there isn't just one show in town when it comes to the succession,' says one senior Whitehall source. </p> <p>No wonder, under such provocation, whispers emerged last Thursday of how Brown supposedly talked Blair out of quitting prematurely in spring, only to be let down when the Prime Minister changed his mind - an almost exact replay of the so-called 'Granita deal', when Blair supposedly agreed over an Islington restaurant table eventually to step aside in favour of Brown. </p> <p>While Blairites officially rubbish the reports, it is clear Blair did go through a crisis of self-doubt in the spring - before the local election results and the Butler inquiry convinced him he could survive - and many Brownites were convinced their man would be in Downing Street by October. True or exaggerated, the story marks a clear warning that the chancellor could - if provoked - always ensure more skeletons fell out of closets: it also helped explain to disgruntled backbenchers why the fatal blow they had been led to expect never actually came. </p> <p>Whatever has been decided - and only Brown and Blair know exactly what transpired between them - Milburn and Brown do at least have one vested interest in resolving their differences: whichever camp has the upper hand after the next election needs a healthy parliamentary majority. </p> <p>'The personal chemistry isn't good, but they have got to find a way of working with each other. They've both got a hell of a lot to lose if they can't,' says one Blairite bluntly. One key link will be Brown's adviser Ed Miliband, brother of the Blairite schools minister, David, who gets on well with Milburn. Kelly, a relaxed and pragmatic politician who enjoys good relationships with both camps, will also do much of the detailed work on manifesto policy. </p> <p>None the less, there is a difficult autumn ahead. This weekend sees the publication of a book by Derek Scott, a former economics adviser to Number 10, which is expected to re-open old wounds by detailing spats over policy, but the real test remains the party conference. </p> <p>Brown will make his keynote speech on Monday afternoon, before Blair's: last year, he mocked Blair's insistence that Labour is at its 'best when it's boldest' by arguing the party was best when it was Labour. Now, says one aide gloomily, it is 'anybody's guess' what he might say. </p> <p>Meanwhile, while an uneasy truce is settling this weekend, battle has been not so much finished as delayed. While nobody was actually sacked in last week's reshuffle, that has simply left many ministers jumpy that much more radical surgery will follow after the election. </p> <p>A swath of either older cabinet ministers - such as Margaret Beckett - or those out of favour, such as the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, are vulnerable to a cull that would enable Blair to bring on ambitious young deputies such as Miliband, John Hutton and Hazel Blears. Another chipping away of Brown's powerbase is almost inevitable.
