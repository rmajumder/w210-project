  "<p><strong>9am</strong> Up early today to meet a group of lobbyists. The broadcasters are intent on getting a quota forcing the UK's three big producers to give them each a percentage of their best shows. It's an unwarranted attack on the immense but justified power of the major production studios in Britain. We worked hard for our billion pound turnovers. As most of television is now centred in Manchester, we have breakfast in the city's trendy canalside area, which means a gay breakfast - egg white-only omelettes and pink grapefruit. (As Manchester is the new London, there's now a whole new regional policy: 30% of programmes have to be made outside the Manchester/Liverpool conurbation.) </p> <p>The broadcasters are saying we're screwing the marketplace, we're too dominant, we've got a handle on all the talent, both behind and in front of the camera, and that it's quite unfair. Furthermore, we've forced them to reorganise the whole electronic programme guide, so that you can only access programmes via the name of the programme, the talent in the programme, but not via the channel. Nobody knows the channel names any more anyway. With me at breakfast is the largest independent producer, Granada. When Roman Abramovich bought ITV he flogged the programme-making bit. More fool him. </p> <p><strong> 11am</strong> A production meeting about the making of Big Brother 15. The problem with Big Brother is that it's now firmly in the category of NRP - that is, Nostalgia Reality Programming, much beloved of people in their 50s and 60s. Kids in their teens are saying, why can't we get that rubbish off air? What is it those old people like about it? The average age of the people in the Big Brother house is now 72. And they're still taking their clothes off. Which is a bit of a problem in itself. </p> <p>BB is still being made for Channel 4, although it has its own 24-hour digital channel as well. And C4, the channel we were all told was going to be marginalised, is now the major commercial network. The desirability of focusing on specific demographics, which C4 has always done, proved to be the winning business model for commercial channels. Those that tried to appeal to a general audience - BBC1, ITV - were screwed long ago. </p> <p>C4 eventually did a 100-year deal with us because there weren't many other television shows ever invented that essentially converged the media and got people using the telephone, web and TV all at the same time, creating multiple revenue streams. And so BB turned out to be the exception rather than the rule and its value grew over time. Of course the fact that it appeals to this older demographic helps because they're the ones with the money. It's sponsored by Senokot in collaboration with the London Hernia Centre. Sir Kevin Lygo, who inherited his knighthood, now identifies closely with the sponsors. </p> <p><strong> 1pm</strong> At lunchtime we have a teleconference with the different parts of our worldwide organisation. It's a set lunch. We insist everyone eats the same dish across the world, which on this occasion consists of some noodly things from Wagamama, the international chain. We encourage drinking at lunchtime because it aids the afternoon siesta, which is also company policy. </p> <p>We're like the education department of France. Back in the 20th century they said the French education minister could look at his watch and say: \"It's now eleven o'clock - everybody in France aged 10 is studying Latin.\" That's how we run our company. </p> <p><strong> 4pm</strong> After the siesta, we have our annual negotiation with advertisers - we sell the ads now, not the broadcasters. We've also gone one beyond product placement. We have mostly replaced the old system of commercials between programmes with subliminal messages in programmes which are done via flash frames and by subtle, motivational wording of scripts that make you want to buy products. Far from objecting to this form of mind control, TV audiences actually prefer it. It's so much simpler to buy consumer durables under hypnosis. Supermarkets used to have 2,000 different items but now have up to 80,000. We have an annual negotiation and then tell the broadcasters which ads will be delivered packaged with our shows. We cut them in on the revenues - which is more than they used to do for us. </p> <p><strong> 6pm</strong> Final meeting of the day - about reviving popular but long forgotten formats. The BBC's charter has been amended to oblige the corporation to produce more cynical and derivative programming. The BBC is now available by subscription only and nobody's subscribing to it - it's just not popular enough. What they need is more cynical and derivative programming. </p> <p><strong> 7pm</strong> Time to read the media papers before retiring for the evening. There's a reverential profile of Michael Grade, now the BBC's President-for-Life. There's scheduling news as well - since they decided to take Sky One upmarket it proved a powerful force in persuading octogenarians to subscribe to digital. This enabled analogue switch-off and a grateful nation voted Barry Cox a personal rickshaw in perpetuity. </p> <p><strong> 8pm</strong> Off home to watch a live cabinet meeting from Downing Street. Ministers have a debate and then we vote on the proposal and get an instant result. Live programming is very, very important because it's the last thing broadcasters have where people really do watch old style linear ads scheduled in the breaks. They want to see something happen in real time, whether it's a football cup final or even a reality show. Later there will be the live evening celebrations for William V's coronation. Such events have become very highly prized - the 2014 equivalent of the Roman arena. Not to be confused, of course, with Alan Yentob's Arena, the arts strand, coming soon to Sky One. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Taken from UKTV's book, TV in 2014: the future isn't what it used to be, published by Premium Publishing on August 30, priced \u00a39.99</p>",
  "<p>Studies show that while people are watching more TV than ever, they're paying increasingly less attention to it. Wallpaper TV was fine when we only had to compete with wallpaper, but if we're going to compete with media such as the internet we need to fight for our share of the national attention span. A new form of experimental programming may just be the way forward: </p> <p><strong> Hey! Over Here!</strong> Long stretches of ambient music, punctuated by sudden, high-volume shrieking, a few quick adverts and then more music. It allows viewers time to check their email and read their digital radio manuals, while ensuring that we have their attention when we really need it. </p> <p><strong> I'm a Celebrity, and This is my Bum.</strong> Industry insiders are always banging on about Lowest Common Denominator television as if we had already struck bedrock, but this show proves how far we have to go. The format is simple, the presentation basic and it makes Big Brother look like an all-party debate on proportional representation. Abi Titmuss's people are very excited. </p> <p><strong> The Krispy Kreme Drama Hour.</strong> It's actually just old episodes of Columbo and Inspector Morse, with an added interactive quiz at the end to see how carefully you watched them. For every correct answer, you get a doughnut. The technology is here, and it works; it's the large-scale, same-day shipping of doughnuts that is causing the biggest headache so far. </p> <p><strong> Compello-vision.</strong> We're experimenting with pupil-trackers and some computer software which will trigger an alarm whenever viewers look away from the screen. For one test, we connected the equipment to a burglar alarm that operates at a frequency which induces instant vomiting. Effective, messy, quasi-legal. </p> <p><strong> We're Coming to Beat You Up.</strong> A macho reworking of Queer Eye, with an interactive element: any viewer could be this week's star victim. Clues to the identity of the unlucky viewer are given throughout the programme, intercut with live shots of our team of heavies getting tooled up for action. The result is you must watch the first 25 minutes in order to know whether you need to make a run for it or not. </p> <p><strong> Fame Penitentiary.</strong> This has two parts, each on a different channel: first, the weekly trial of a celebrity for various \"crimes\", with the viewing public acting as jury and, with any luck, Des Lynam as the judge. Second, the 24-hour goings-on at HMP Fame, a maximum security facility staffed by real warders and run by Anne Robinson. The government wants real trials to be conducted this way in the future, so we're hoping for some Lottery money.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> It must be the first time a Playboy article has made it into an IPO prospectus. Google has been forced to reprint an entire interview with founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin that could land them in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission after it was printed during the \"quiet period\" ahead of the float. And if potential investors weren't already worried by the likely high price or the hiccups that have plagued the IPO (and led some to suggest that Brin and Page keep making mistakes on purpose, for publicity), the content of the interview won't soothe their nerves much. \"We try to use elements from different companies, but a lot is seat-of-your-pants stuff,\" says Page. Reassuring, eh? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ofcom's first annual review of the media and telecoms industries provided fascinating reading. Not least, the fact that we are seemingly spending more time and more money doing more of everything - usage of \"old media\" such as television and radio has increased alongside the huge surge in use of the internet and mobile phones. Which, said the Henley Centre, leads to the logical conclusion that we're consuming them all at the same time. Radio was held up as the shining example of convergence, with people listening through DAB, digital television and the internet as well as their traditional transistor set. Indeed, the report highlighted the hidden trend of radio listening through the TV - almost one third of the population have tried it, according to the figures. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> A new study has, apparently, found that people with handheld Blackberry mobile email devices have 14 extra days to play with a year because they can check and respond to their email on the move. \"Respondents almost universally agreed to the statement 'Blackberry has enhanced my workflow efficiency' with teams equipped with Blackberry on average 29% more efficient,\" it said. Which is odd, because in Diary's experience those with the little black email boxes find themselves permanently attached to the office via the things. If they're not checking their messages, they're glancing surreptitiously in its direction, in the hope that one will arrive. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Terry Wogan and Johnnie Walker might not be the names that immediately spring to mind when one wonders who is doing most to turn the nation digital. But their impact could be greater than any number of bright young things as they're heading a Radio 2 campaign to persuade listeners to use the net. The initiative will apparently see the launch of 'World Wide Wogan', encouraging far-flung listeners to email the jocular breakfast host, and the 'Johnnie Walker MP3 Shuffle', in which the superannuated DJ will play clips from his iPod and encourage listeners to vote for their favourite.</p>",
  "<p>Introspection is not a quality associated with enterprise, so when the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) asked 430 employers how they rated their support for employees during pregnancy and the subsequent return to work, virtually all awarded themselves excellent marks. </p> <p>Further questioning, however, revealed that more than a quarter were unable to name a single statutory maternity benefit. The remainder fared better on maternity leave and maternity pay. Awareness of other benefits, such as time off for ante-natal classes, was lower. And 28% of employers agreed with the statement \"It is not worth offering training to a pregnant woman because she might leave.\" It is illegal to refuse training on the grounds of pregnancy. </p> <p>The EOC research, which has yet to be fully written up, also indicates that some kinds of enterprise are more likely to be aware of maternity benefits than others. Unsurprisingly, large employers with predominantly female workforces are most likely to be up to speed. Small businesses, especially those which employ more men then women, are least likely. </p> <p>The adverse effects of legislation on small businesses are often cited by those opposed to statutory benefits. This is unfortunate because it creates the idea in the public mind that small businesses are petty-minded, hand-to-mouth operations. Small businesses, which are often dedicated to doing technically complicated things, are at the forefront of sponsoring students through university, are the backbone of the modern apprenticeships scheme, enjoy much better employee retention rates than corporations, and make far fewer redundancies. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it is true that small businesses seldom employ anyone with human resources expertise, and do not always keep up to date with employment law. To remedy this, the charity Working Families has set up a web page specifically for small businesses, which provides simple checklists of employers' responsibilities not only with regards to maternity rights, but also the new obligations about flexible working for parents, and leave for fathers. The emphasis is on the positive side of flexibility for employers as well as employees.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> <a href=\"http://www.workingfamilies.org.uk.\">www.workingfamilies.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Do you dream of the day you're the boss, able to unwind on the golf course while your subordinates keep your organisation ticking over efficiently in your absence? Well, think again. Britain's hard-pressed managers are finding less and less time to enjoy their annual leave, with almost half unable to take their full complement of holidays. </p> <p>A survey by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) has discovered that, of more than 3,000 managers surveyed, only 53% found time to use their entitlement, down from 66% last year. Most managers cite the main causes as deadline pressures and an inability to delegate tasks. To make matters worse, modern communications mean that managers are increasingly unable to \"get away from it all\" - they are anchored to a virtual desk by an umbilical cord of emails, mobile phones, laptops and PDAs. </p> <p>Professor Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University Management School, is not surprised by the findings. \"Jobs are less secure these days,\" he says. \"As a result, managers feel insecure. They want to show commitment and so stay in the office so as to appear indispensable.\" </p> <p>Roy Hodges, an IT manager from Ipswich, found himself falling into a habit of not taking holidays three years ago. \"Then, I probably had three days left at the end of the year, but things were hectic in December and I just couldn't find the time,\" he says. But it was even worse last year. By September, I'd taken only five of my allotted 25 days. I couldn't see where I'd find the time for the other 20 days before the end of the year. In the event, I squeezed in only another five, and I was on my mobile or laptop for a few of those.\" </p> <p>Such behaviour has repercussions for both employee and employer. Regular breaks are essential for the well-being and effective performance of workers, and the natural consequences of long hours without a break are illness and stress. Liz Tucker, a wellbeing consultant for Champneys Health Resorts, says that an opportunity to relax is vital. \"Some working people even find holidays stressful as they have to work so hard to clear the decks before and have a backlog to deal with afterwards. But a change of environment, an ability to switch off, is a must for good health.\" </p> <p>Advertising agency manager Melissa Frew found this out after being unable to book more than three consecutive days off in more than two years. She eventually suffered periods of stress and, when enforced leave failed to work, she resigned from her job altogether. \"I just became obsessed by the fact that other people couldn't do my job, or if they could, they'd do it badly or inefficiently,\" she says. \"Of course, it wasn't true. They replaced me within weeks of my resignation, so I've spent the last couple of years working like a dog for nothing. But I've had to break away totally to recognise that.\" </p> <p>This, says Honey Langcaster-James, a psychologist and coach at the University of Hull, is a symptom of the \"fear factor\" among modern managers. \"They worry about their own position or of outcomes at work that reflect on their performance, and this fear can lead them to be reluctant to relinquish control, even though they desperately need a break.\" Quite apart from the health concerns, Langcaster-James also cites deterioration of the work-life balance and a possible breakdown in family life as a result. \"Without down-time or a proper opportunity for relaxation,\" she says, \"they may reach a state of burnout and eventually render themselves incapable of work through physical illness or stress-related mental ill health. By not wishing to be absent from work for even short periods, managers are paradoxically increasing their risk of long-term absence which could prove to be devastating to the manager, their family and the organisation.\" </p> <p>Roy Hodges listened to similar advice from his GP. \"I felt stressed and anxious all the time,\" he remembers. \"The doctor took one look at me after I finally grabbed five minutes in the evening to see him and convinced me that I needed to look after myself and if I wanted to still matter at work, to take a step back and unwind. I'd lost weight, my diet was appalling, and my sleep patterns were awry.\" </p> <p>According to Professor Cooper, many managers are victims of poor time management. He suggests an organised plan to alleviate the constant flow of work. \"Every day managers need to come into work, look at their in-tray and prioritise. They have to be able to ask: what needs to be done today and what can be left till tomorrow? Managers should take advantage of new technology in every way possible and get someone to run off emails on to hard copy, read them, sort them into piles and prioritise. Don't do them as they come in, pick a time in the day to concentrate solely on emails. And if you have a lot of meetings, ask yourself - do you really need that meeting or could things be sorted without one? The answer is often 'yes'.\"</p> <p>But, ultimately, it is down to individuals to cut themselves some slack and recognise where delegation is possible and when non-priorities can be left for another time. The old favourite needs re-jigging - you shouldn't have to go mad to work here. It doesn't help.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Riley works in the heart of London. Her working day is filled with meetings, phone calls, project deadlines and all the other responsibilities of corporate life. She is good at her job and has steadily progressed over the last six years to her current position as marketing consultant for a large communications and marketing consultancy. </p> <p>It is a demanding job but well paid and Sarah loves it. Yet for the past year and a half, Sarah has been leaving her job every Wednesday evening to drive to Brighton where she spends the rest of the week and part of the weekend working as a junior barber in a city centre salon. She doesn't need the extra money nor is she planning a career change. The fact is that like a small but growing number of workers, Sarah has simply decided that two careers are better than one. </p> <p>Dual careerists (also sometimes called \"sunlighters\") are not contractors who work for several clients or moonlighters who take on extra jobs for money. Instead, they are people who are actively committed to more than one career. Celebrity hybrids like singer/actress/children's author Madonna, rock star/painter David Bowie, and even actor/champion poker player Ben Affleck, are notorious for having more than one career on the go and it is a trend that experts say is gathering force among office workers. </p> <p>Sarah is now completing her NVQ Level 2 barber training. \"I've always been interested in men's hairdressing and I find it quite creative,\" she says. \"I would often look at someone's hairstyle and think 'I can do that' and one day I just decided to do it. Initially I enrolled on an evening course, which gave me a very basic grounding and a chance to see if I could actually do it. When I realised I could and that I enjoyed it, I decided to train properly.\" </p> <p>City and Guild recently conducted a forward-looking analysis of the trend and concluded that increased life expectancy and pension under-funding will lead to longer working lives, while the rise of (particularly online) technology will mean people can re-train while holding down their current jobs. This creates an encouraging climate for dual careerists. The study predicts that the 1.2 million people who currently have two or more jobs will double in the next 20 years.</p> <p>Like Sarah, the majority of dual careerists work part-time. But executive assistant Nicola Wright, 27, who has a full-time job as a PA, opted for an additional career when faced with the prospect of otherwise having to give up her childhood passion for dance. She decided to train as a dance teacher in the evenings and weekends and has spent the past six years establishing her own dance school in Portsmouth while holding down her original job. For her, top-notch organisational and time-management skills and the goodwill of her employers were fundamental in helping her realise her ambition. </p> <p>\"The school is growing and in a couple of years, I would like to employ another teacher. I have a lot of good opportunities [in my PA job] and I would like to stay on to see what bigger opportunities come my way. But it also gives me huge satisfaction to watch the kids I teach improving before my eyes. I wouldn't give up either job. I like the fact that many people rely on me,\" she says. </p> <p>However, taking on two careers can require almost superhuman determination and efficiency. Apart from the training, there are administrative chores like completing tax returns, which many people with more than one employer are required to do. \"It is exhausting,\" Nicola admits, \"And you have to be prepared to constantly move from one place to another. The school is not a big earner, so I class my [first] job as my main career but I am also registered as self-employed, so I have to do the rest of that tax myself.\" </p> <p>But despite their punishing schedules, both Sarah and Nicola maintain that being able to do creative jobs makes them appreciate their mainstream jobs even more. As Sarah explains, \"I've always wanted to live by the sea and have a country lifestyle. In Brighton I live within walking distance of my job, I can go home for lunch and feed the dogs and on Sundays, I can go for country walks. But I also have my city life with my London job, with the salary, friends and social life that goes with that. Both jobs really complement each other.\" </p> <p>Professor Peter Nolan, director of the Future of Work programme funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), points out that the notion that people are becoming less interested in holding down a career in favour of quality family life is a myth. There is in fact, he argues, a revival in the desire for a career. </p> <p>\"Statistics show that the length of time people stay with employers hasn't changed much, but the number of different and/or additional jobs people do in their working lives has been growing significantly and this is linked to people being offered more flexible working hours. Part-time work no longer conforms to the stereotype of being temporary, insecure or a stopgap. Often it is a secure, long-lasting career and changes in employment law over the years mean that the benefits and rights make it comparable to full-time employment work.\" Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems that doubling your careers could also double your freedom.</p>",
  "A Jamaican woman who fled to Britain after gangsters murdered her son and shot her in the head has been told she must return to Kingston despite her fears that the gunmen will kill her. <p>An immigration appeals tribunal has backed the Home Office's rejection of her asylum application on the grounds that her experiences did not constitute persecution in terms of factors such as race, religion or political opinion. </p> <p>But supporters say the government may be sending her back to her death by refusing to use its discretion to grant her the right to remain on compassionate grounds. </p> <p>Doctors were astonished that Joan Shurland survived the attack, which left her in a coma for three months. She requires facial surgery, has lost one eye, is partially disabled and has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. </p> <p>Relatives urged her to flee Jamaica because of further threats. </p> <p>In January her house in Kingston was burned down. </p> <p>\"If I go back I will be dead,\" Ms Shurland, 45, said yesterday from her home in the west Midlands. </p> <p>\"My son is afraid to go and look for work in town or even take the bus. This kind of life is like a prison.\" </p> <p>Her ordeal began in late 1999 when her daughter Rickkesha Duhane, now 24, fled home after being warned that a gang of men planned to rape her. </p> <p>They told others that Rickkesha was being \"disrespectful\" by seeing a man from another neighbourhood. </p> <p>Ms Shurland believes that the family was also targeted because they supported a different political party from the gunmen. </p> <p>Despite Rickkesha's escape, five men stormed the family home, shooting Ms Shurland in the head after murdering her son Rasheed Lopez, 18, in front of her. </p> <p>\"The first one threw up the mattress off the bed to see if she was hiding under the bed. When he saw she wasn't there he just turned and shot my son in the face. Just like that,\" Ms Shurland said. </p> <p>\"Can you imagine, you stand there and see your child dying? He fell on the table and the glass shattered. He died with his eyes and mouth wide open. His girlfriend had just had his first child. </p> <p>\"The police didn't take no action and there was nothing I could do. Because we were poor and couldn't afford a lawyer they were still free walking up and down and my life was still in jeopardy.\" </p> <p>Rickkesha had fled to the United States, but the same men subsequently slashed her former boyfriend in the face so badly that he required 42 stitches. </p> <p>Several months after that, Ms Shurland was walking to church when two of the attackers spotted her, pulled out knives and chased her. </p> <p>She escaped into a police station. She flew to Britain in 2002 after hearing that the men were looking for her again. </p> <p>Tauhid Pasha, legal director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \"This is a startling case and a prime example of how the government are entirely devoid of compassion in how they exercise their discretion.\" </p> <p>Lester Holloway, the editor of the website Black Information Link, which is supporting Joan's case, said: \"It seems amazing that someone shot through the head, with her son killed before her eyes, should have their claim for asylum rejected. </p> <p>\"She is convinced she will die if sent back to Jamaica. There is every reason to fear this will be the case.\" </p> <p>The Home Office does not comment on individual cases. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"All asylum claims are considered on their individual merits in accordance with the UK's obligations under the 1951 UN convention relating to the status of refugees. </p> <p>\"If asylum is refused we will consider whether humanitarian protection or discretionary leave should be granted in accordance with obligations under the UN convention on human rights. </p> <p>\"If the individual is unsuccessful in an appeal to the independent immigration appellate authority and has no valid legal claim to remain in the UK, we would seek to remove them.\"</p>",
  "Bruce George, the Labour MP and outgoing president of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly, addressed its annual session in Edinburgh last month. Terrorism, inevitably, was on his mind. \"The cold war was dangerous because one bomb could have finished off Scotland,\" he said, \"but it was an unrealistic threat because both sides were intimidated by each other into not using those weapons. You could rely on the Americans and Soviets being rational, but you cannot rely on these super terrorists negotiating or having any legitimate values. Their aim is to control the world, and that is not a negotiating position.\" <p>He seemed to be claiming that all those postwar nuclear nightmares were misplaced, and such trifles as the Cuban missile crisis and President Reagan's imagined limited nuclear war in Europe had probably been nothing to worry about - but now that al-Qaida was here, we had genuine reason to be scared out of our wits. One could even discern a backhanded glee: at last, proper enemies.</p> <p>If George was attempting to differentiate between the nuclear fears of yore and alarm about al-Qaida, his words served to imply a strange kind of continuity. \"Their aim is to control the world\" - in the minds of the more hot-headed cold warriors, wasn't that exactly what the Soviets were plotting? The speech was another example of this summer's most fashionable manoeuvre: the rolling-out of age-old archetypes by cold war nostalgists who are convinced that a life without fear of imminent apocalypse is no life at all.</p> <p>Once we marvelled at Protect and Survive; now, the postman delivers Preparing for Emergencies, an instruction manual with much the same emphasis on tinned food, quick thinking and proximity to a radio. Lest anyone be unsure of the kind of \"emergency\" the authorities have in mind, this autumn the BBC will screen Dirty War, a drama focused on a terrorist assault in London using \"a crude conventional bomb packed with radioactive waste\".</p> <p>Nearly 20 years have passed since the screening of Threads, the BBC production in which missiles rained down on the UK and the country began a descent into social breakdown, starvation and disease. Now the generation lucky enough to grow up free from apocalyptic dread have their own fear-stoking equivalent. </p> <p>During the cold war, fear was largely manifested passively: aside from bulk buys of beans and CND membership, there wasn't much you could do to avoid the possible launch of Russian missiles. However, this new alleged threat leaves room for the kind of precautionary action that soon turns futile. Trains seem safer than planes, until Madrid's commuter lines become a target. You quit using the tube, only to hear about a plot to attack London buses. Often, the government seems no less confused.</p> <p>And that's the nature of this soup of amorphous, conjectural anxiety. Who exactly are we fretting about? \"Individuals and groups, whether British nationals or not,\" reckons Mr Blunkett. What do they want? Sweeping political change in the Middle East, say some; nothing less than global dominion, claim others. And the means of dealing with them? According to a recent speech given to a Police Federation conference, it's all a matter of \"policing the unknown\". Pardon?</p> <p>If all that suggests a comical kind of bafflement, our more illiberal politicians have been gifted with a context even more empowering than the one provided by communist missiles. If we've no idea of the exact nature of the supposed threats - to London's airports one week, a Manchester United game the next; ricin today, a shoulder-launched rocket tomorrow - then the suggested panaceas will not only extend into the distance, but also stand a good chance of being meekly accepted. As US congressman Jim McDermott says in Fahrenheit 9/11: \"You can make people do anything if they're afraid.\"</p> <p>Voices at the centre confidently advocate a future of identity cards, endless surveillance and obligatory assimilation. The shadowy cadres on the fringes, meanwhile, gleefully make the most of multiculturalism creaking under the weight of it all.</p> <p>The strange thing is, the UK has lived with an ongoing terrorist menace before: a drilled, passionate army of gunmen and explosives experts with a talent for carnage and destabilisation. For almost two decades, however, disquiet about the IRA failed to turn apocalyptic: along with the old-fashioned British talent for getting on with one's life, the distractions of the cold war presumably had a lot to do with it.</p> <p>Still, as Mr George says, they were mere terrorists; our new adversaries are super terrorists. But what to do about them? \"The dilemma for the government,\" he concluded in Edinburgh, \"is to take the issue seriously without being excessively alarmist. If they go too far, they will create paranoia... but people have to know what the threat is. And it is high.\"</p> <p>It amounts to what might be termed the Crimewatch option. Be scared, by all means.

  "The Germans have a special word for it: Reformstau - reform gridlock, the act of holding off overdue change. So popular has Reformstau become that it was even named \"word of the year\" by the gatekeepers of the German language at the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr deutsche Sprache, ahead of Bildungsmisere - education calamity. The adoption of such doom-laden catchphrases highlights the malaise within Europe's powerhouse: for the last 10 years discussion of the causes and consequences of inertia have dominated public life, with everything from the sluggish performance of the economy to the failure of the German football team being blamed on Reformstau. <p>This decade-long bout of national self-doubt is something of a surprise, given the success that Germany enjoyed in the 1970s and 1980s, when its booming economy and Rhineland model was held up as an example to the rest of the world. Now, though, on many indicators the country has not only fallen behind its Anglo-Saxon rivals in the US and Britain, but has also been outpaced by its European neighbours, such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, which retain social welfare and taxation policies similar to those in Germany. </p> <p>Germany does face several troubling problems. The economy has been all but stagnating, driven forward by exports. Domestic demand remains weak. Job creation has fallen away, with unemployment rising well above 4 million. Its traditional strengths in manufacturing are being eroded, and its ageing population will soon place an enormous strain on its already tightly stretched welfare system and overtaxed fiscal structure. </p> <p>With this background, the ruling SDP party is right to push on with its Agenda 2010 reforms and \"Hartz IV\" law, designed to rein in Germany's unemployment benefits. The proposals - relatively modest ones, by some standards - have attracted large protests, mainly in east Germany, a region blighted with 18% unemployment. But the workers of the east suffer compared with their comrades in the west through the use of national pay levels. To make matters worse, there is a thicket of industrial regulations that has restricted the labour market and held back the development of the modern service sector-based economy that Germany has seemed unable to nurture. </p> <p>This does not mean that the country must shed its social welfare system and embrace slash-and-burn capitalism. Germany may need only mild stimulation to revive its economy and help it out of its national rut. Better some reform today than root-and-branch in years to come.</p>",
  "A downpour had been expected in Baghdad, and it arrived right on cue. <p>The predictions had been for mortar bombs, of course, not rain, but the thud of shells exploding so close to Baghdad's convention centre caused scarcely a blink among the delegates to the much-anticipated national conference gathered inside. </p> <p>Some were asked to move away from the windows, while it was explained that Saddam Hussein had built the centre to withstand direct hits. </p> <p>The delegates knew what to expect and appeared neither shaken nor disturbed. </p> <p>\"I came here from Najaf so my voice could be heard,\" said one woman, a teacher. \"Do you think I'm going to be silenced by a few mortar shells?\" </p> <p>She, like everyone else, had come from across Iraq yesterday, defying the parlous security situation. There were tribal sheikhs from Kirkuk, women's activists from Basra, businessmen from Falluja and former peshmerga from Kurdistan. There were Muslims, Yezidis, Shabaks, Christians, Turkomen, Kurds and Arabs. There were teachers, judges, doctors and preachers. </p> <p>It was the first time since the fall of Saddam that Iraq's disparate and often discordant voices could be heard in one place. And for those desperate to see some light at the end of the tunnel it was a long-awaited first step. </p> <p>Held under the shadow of the insurgency and counter-insurgency, that the conference was taking place at all was seen as a victory. </p> <p>\"Your presence here today is the biggest challenge to the forces of darkness that want to tear this country apart,\" the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, said in his opening remarks. \"This is not the end of the road, it is the first step on the way to democracy.\" </p> <p>The task before them is to elect Iraq's first post-Saddam assembly and start a \"national dialogue\" on the country's most pressing problems. </p> <p>It was words, not bullets, that did the fizzing. A delegate from the province of Anbar in the Sunni triangle called for self-rule for his region. Another from Basra complained about the marginalisation of Iraq's second city. </p> <p>A woman from Najaf raged against the occupation of her home town - not by US forces but by the black-shirted young men of Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army. </p> <p>From the outset, the violence in the holy city of Najaf threatened to dominate proceedings. If the Americans or the interim government were expecting a pat on the back for their tough stand, they had to think again. </p> <p>As the opening session wound up - after speeches from the Iraqi president, Ghazi al-Yawer, the prime minister, and the UN special representative, Ashraf Qazi - a group of Shia delegates standing near the back started to heckle, then to chant. </p> <p>\"Yes, yes Najaf,\" they shouted, punching the air with clenched fists. \"We want the president to hear what we have to say. Unless the blood shed in Najaf stops, we will withdraw.\" </p> <p>Iraq's new political leaders were sanguine. \"The point of this conference is to get talking to one another, to get some kind of national dialogue going,\" said Hamid al-Khifai, the cabinet spokesman. </p> <p>\"Najaf is an emotive issue and it is understandable that it be raised. If you had shouted like that under Saddam you would have been taken out and shot.\" </p> <p>The conference organisers decided to deal directly with the issue. They passed a resolution calling on all sides in the conflict to stop the violence, and appointed a negotiating committee to try to find a solution. </p> <p>Then it was on with other important business: the election of the interim assembly and the creation of four working groups dealing with topics such as security, transitional justice, and reconstruction. The delegates will elect 80 of the 100 seats in the assembly, with the remaining 20 going to former members of the governing council. </p> <p>The assembly, or Iraqi national council, will have the power to veto legislation with a two-thirds majority, approve Iraq's 2005 budget, and appoint a new prime minister or president should either resign or die in office. </p> <p>There were of course some who stayed away, whether out of pique at not being given the prominence they thought they deserved or because they preferred not to have anything to do with the interim government or its American backers. </p> <p>Mr Allawi insisted the political process was open to all. But the selection of delegates had been criticised for not being inclusive enough, and organisers were accused of stacking the conference with pro-government delegates. </p> <p>The most important absence was that of Mr Sadr's movement. Although organisers continued to insist that he or his representatives were welcome, the militant cleric under siege in Najaf shunned the invitation. </p> <p>There was no show either by Ahmad Chalabi, the controversial leader of the Iraqi National Congress. Mr Chalabi is wanted on counterfeiting charges. </p> <p>\"This will be no magic wand,\" said Fouad Massoum, the conference chairman. \"We cannot solve all of Iraq's problems in three days, but we have to start somewhere.\"</p> <p><b>Who turned up - and who didn't</b></p> <p><b> Present:</b> </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b> </b>Iraq's main ethnic groups: Arabs, Kurds and Turkomen </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Main religious groups, including Sunni, Shia, Yezidi, Christian, Shabbak, Sabeans </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Representatives from the country's 18 provinces. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Iraq's main political parties: Dawa, Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (both Shia), Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Iraqi Communist party, Kurdistan Democratic party, Iraqi Islamic Party. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Civil society activists, including doctors, judges, lawyers, and teachers </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Tribal representatives </p> <p><b> Absent:</b> </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> The movement of the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

  "<p>Women in uniform greet patrons from behind a reception desk while others rush back and forth with drinks. Men in waistcoats talk frantically into their lapel microphones, ensuring their guests have everything they need. </p> <p>Is it a smart restaurant? No. Espace Tower, a stone's throw from Shinjuku's notorious red-light district, satisfies a much more urgent need among Tokyoites than a mere meal. This is where thousands come every day to play pachinko, the national obsession of the working Japanese man and woman. </p> <p>The scene inside - rows of punters sitting transfixed before the noisy, brightly lit machines, is repeated at thousands of pachinko parlours up and down the country. Millions of players, from salarymen to housewives, endure the ear-splitting din of the machines and the clouds of cigarette smoke for the chance of turning a few thousand yen into a small fortune in the space of an afternoon. </p> <p>Pachinko halls are as common a sight in Japanese towns as karaoke joints and noodle stalls. At the last count, there were close to 18,000 of them with more than four million machines. </p> <p>Pachinko has proved resilient to hard times. \"I think it is going to continue on an upward trend,\" said Takashi Kadokura, an economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. \"Many parlours have attracted a new generation of female players by organising creches, specially reserved seats for women and ladies' days.\" </p> <p>The pachinko industry is worth an eye-watering 29 trillion yen (\u00a3140bn) - more than Japan's top five carmakers combined. Last year it grew by more than 5%. The country's 21m enthusiasts played an average of 25 times last year, spending more than \u00a5100,000 (\u00a3485) each, according to government figures. </p> <p>Pachinko is derived from Corinthian, a pinball-style game brought to Japan from the United States (where it never caught on) in the 1920s. In the modern game, all players have to do is adjust the speed at which steel balls are propelled to the top of the machine. If the speed is spot on, the balls fall through a series of metal pins into a winning pocket, releasing more balls that can be played again or exchanged for gifts. </p> <p>This is where the game's relationship with the law becomes ambiguous, because Japan's strict gambling laws mean players cannot exchange balls for cash on the premises. </p> <p>Instead they are offered gifts such as handbags, chocolates, cigarettes, TVs and DVD players. But most winners select \"special\" gifts, often tablets containing tiny ingots of \"gold\". Once outside, they take the tablets to a booth - often nothing more than a hole in the wall - and exchange them for cash. </p> <p>These furtive transactions make the industry a target for organised crime. Many of the exchange booths are controlled by the yakuza, who take a cut of the winnings. </p> <p>It is estimated that 10% of pachinko profits find their way into the pockets of gangsters. </p> <p>Despite growing concerns about addiction, particularly among young women, for the vast majority of players pachinko is an enjoyable distraction, no more harmful than an occasional flutter on the horses. </p> <p>For Seiji Goto, however, it is a serious business. The Osaka native prepares for a day at a pachinko parlour with the same meticulous attention to detail of a spy on a mission. When he plays pachinko, he does so not for fun, but for sums of money most of his fellow players can only dream about. </p> <p>That is because he cheats. Unbeknown to his fellow players and the parlour managers, concealed beneath his clothes is a sophisticated - and illegal - box of tricks that can earn him \u00a5100,000 in a single day. </p> <p>He uses a signal emitted by a battery-powered antenna to propel the steel balls at exactly the speed required to send them tumbling through the pins and into a winning hole. Then it is simply a matter of sitting back and watching the ball-count rise. </p> <p>Mr Goto (not his real name) began playing pachinko in his late teens. Now 32, he is a senior member of a group whose members travel the country milking pachinko machines dry. </p> <p>Though his face is well known at many pachinko parlours in Osaka, he asks not to be described in print, fearing it could jeopardise his livelihood. </p> <p>\"Many of the pachinko parlours are on to people like us,\" he said as we sipped iced coffee in the lounge of an Osaka hotel. </p> <p>\"They keep a special eye out for people who seem to be doing too well, and some have installed transparent covers that block the signal from the antenna.\" </p> <p>Without his technological crutch, for which he pays the maker \u00a530,000 a day, he is not, he admits, a particularly good player. </p> <p>But in a good month, Mr Goto takes home between \u00a53m and \u00a54m. Over a year, he can earn as much as \u00a524m (\u00a3115,000) after he has paid a sum to his boss, who, in turn, gives his yakuza associates a cut in exchange for protection and negotiating with complicit pachinko operators. </p> <p>\"It's a comfortable way of life and an easy way to make money. I can't seem to leave it alone.\" </p> <p>Their methods may differ, but millions of other Japanese know exactly what he means.</p>",
  "<p>Lost Buildings of Britain<br> 8pm, Channel 4 <br> Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire is the subject of the fourth in this series. Built by plantation owner William Beckford, the building started life as a simple garden folly before being transformed over the years into a vast mansion which spearheaded the gothic revival in Victorian Britain. Then, in December 1825, it collapsed. Here, Simon Thurley \"recreates\" the building, finds out why it collapsed and gains an insight into Beckford's strange habits and obsessions. </p> <p><strong>Whicker's War</strong><br> 9pm, Channel 4<br> \"And this is where I invaded Europe,\" says Alan Whicker as he stands on a beach on the southern tip of Sicily in a rather racy blue-and-white striped shirt. It's 60 years since the 18-year old Whicker and his Army Film and Photo Unit - AFPU - covered the gruelling invasion of Sicily and Italy by the 8th and 5th Army; and in this two-part film he retraces his steps. Eight of the team's 40 cameramen were killed in the conflict and 13 were seriously injured. And while Whicker's style veers towards self-deprecating bravado at times - so the invasion fleet becomes a jolly \"sail down to the Med\" - he doesn't shy away from evoking the crushing fear of combat. \"There was a new, naked feeling,\" he says of the experience of landing in enemy territory. \"You got the feeling that a million angry eyes were watching you over gun barrels.\" </p> <p><strong>The Sopranos</strong><br> 11pm, Channel 4 <br> Praise be, it's back.

You've never seen the other one ... that's the one I want to show you.\" Meanwhile, old tensions erupt between Paulie and Christopher, a wild bear scares AJ witless and Steve Buscemi joins the cast as Tony's cousin, Tony Blundetto.

  "<p><strong>Kathimerini</strong><br> Editorial, August 14 </p> <p>\"The controversy surrounding the failure of Greek sprinting champions Costas Kederis and Katerina Thanou to be present at an International Olympic Committee drug test on Thursday grabbed the headlines and cast a shadow on [Friday's] grand opening ceremony. The recent events have created a strong impression that [they and their] coach, Christos Tsekos resorted to a very crudely stage-managed affair. Even if that is not the case, the damage to the games has been done. </p> <p>\"Neither the government nor the games' organisers bear any responsibility should an athlete fail a drug test or violate the code of ethics. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the doping fiasco has tarnished the image of the games, not just because of the bad publicity in the foreign press but also because of the major letdown for the Greeks, just when they were ready to celebrate a grand event.</p> <p>\"Everyone knows that the use of banned substances is the rule rather than the exception among big-track athletes. This fiasco is even more embarrassing given that Greece had promised to thwart such abasement and organise the cleanest games in modern history.\" </p> <p><strong>Expresso</strong><br> Editorial, August 14 </p> <p>\"Our hearts are shattered, our hopes dashed, our smiles have gone. As of [Thursday] night, 10 million Greeks have been left speechless by heroes who have wounded us Kederis and Thanou kept the bitterest drink of all for the worst possible moment. It is a drink made all the more bitter by the hide-and-seek that they, and their entourage, have played. A hide-and-seek which must end before the trust of millions of Greeks and innocent fans of the 'ancient spirit of the immortals' is totally shaken.\" </p> <p><strong>Ta New</strong><br> Editorial, August 14 </p> <p>\"None of us dare believe that our two champion athletes deliberately avoided the IOC control and disappeared from the [Olympic] village because they were doped. Or that the motorcycle accident was staged just so they could win time and not appear before the IOC disciplinary committee. Or that doctors were accomplices to such deceit, violating their oath and every other notion of medical duty. Just as we did not want to think that members of the athletics leadership of the country, and the Greek Olympic committee, would do everything possible to consciously cover up a doping scandal among Greek athletes. </p> <p>\"And, of course, we don't want to believe that it is possible that the image of the Greece that has emerged through the organisation of the games, as a modern, open, self-confident country, could co-exist with the image of a closed Greece, which resorts to and tolerates such methods in order to ensure a few more medals. Precisely because all of these things have emerged and poisoning public opinion, the authorities should stop filibustering and throw ample light on the issue.\" </p> <p><strong>Ethnos</strong><br> Editorial, August 15 </p> <p>\"The climate before the opening of the games [on Friday] was heavy because of the adventure with our two champion athletes. And nor was the anxiety baseless, or the fear too big, regarding the possible reactions of the crowd which had flooded the stands of the stadium. </p> <p>\"For that reason only, the applause from the crowd was extraordinary when [the head of the IOC] Jacques Rogge referred to the committee's decision to make every effort to drastically limit doping and fight it head on. This applause was the biggest possible gift to the ideals of 'Olympism'. And the most valuable medal that our country could win on this particular day, and under these particular circumstances. Firstly, because it was a spontaneous round of applause and secondly because it was a round of applause that certainly explained those who were doing the clapping. </p> <p>\"That round of applause will last longer than anything else, in time. And, already, it has become the most fundamental gift [we could have made] to the Olympic spirit.\" </p> <p><strong>Eleftheros Typos</strong><br> Editorial, August 14 </p> <p>\"It was a truly unique opening ceremony. But this great celebration, which highlighted the aura of modern Greece, was in danger of being sullied by the thriller being enacted around Kederis and Thanou. </p> <p>\"The handling of the issue on the Greek side showed a lack of preparedness and weakness to prevent a crisis for which one would expect better political reflexes. The Olympic games have cost Greek taxpayers around \u20ac4bn [\u00a32.7bn]. And if only because of this, it is our duty to protect them from [people such as] Tsekos, who is proving to be lower than the circumstances of such a great moment for Greece.\" </p> <p><strong>Eleftherotypia</strong><br> Editorial, August 15 </p> <p>\"For months the tortuous question was, would we be able to pull it off and host safe games? And we managed, to such a degree that, impressed, everybody began to speak of a modern miracle.

  "<p>The lawyer-industrialist Sir David Steel, who has died at the age of 87, negotiated his way through a tense period at the head of British Petroleum, and ended his business career by controversially selling off the Wellcome drugs business to make the Wellcome Trust an incomparably wealthy medical foundation. </p> <p>He took over as chairman of BP at the end of 1974, when the industry and the world economy were shuddering in the aftermath of the first oil price hike. In Britain the Labour government was struggling with the resulting massive inflation, and eyeing the emerging North Sea oil bonanza as the kind of windfall which could help to balance the Treasury's books. The group was also embroiled in controversy over breaking the oil embargo against the illegal regime in Rhodesia. </p> <p>Sir David's time at the top was characterised by tense negotiations with the Labour government as the company sought to win greater independence for the oil company and to neutralise attempts by Tony Benn, the then Energy minister, to muscle in on North Sea resources. The situation was complicated by the fact that while BP was a public company whose shares traded on the stock market, the government still owned the majority of the shares. </p> <p>It was a frustration for Benn, and an indication of Steel's independence, that even in that situation the government could not make the company do its bidding. The situation was resolved closer to Steel's liking than Benn's, with the government selling off a large chunk of shares to help shore up its finances. </p> <p>The Treasury did manage to grab a slice of the North Sea action through the government-owned British National Oil Corporation (BNOC), and slapped a special tax on oil pumped ashore. But at the end of the 1970s the BNOC chairman was still to complain that BP had made \u00a31bn profit on the North Sea and paid only \u00a3180m in tax. </p> <p>The North Sea fields were important in shifting BP's focus from the Middle East. The Forties field pumped its first oil ashore in 1975 - a great boon for BP as well as the government. The company also benefited during Steel's tenure from its lengthy investment in Alaska, bringing the Prudhoe Bay scheme on stream in 1977- the year Steel was knighted. </p> <p>Steel had joined BP in 1950, when the company still operated under its old imperial name as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He joined as one of the first members of the new legal department, having qualified as a solicitor with Linklaters &amp; Paines two years previously. </p> <p>One of his first jobs was to sort out the aftermath of Iran's nationalisation of the company's Iranian assets - good practice, perhaps, for battling with Benn 20 years later. He was promoted and moved to New York in 1959 as president of the group's North American operations. In the next few years he took senior jobs in London and the Middle East, before joining the main board in 1965 as the managing director responsible for exploration - including the North Sea and Alaskan fields. Steel spent seven tumultuous years at the head of the group, leaving in 1981 after the Conservative government had sold off even more of its shareholding. </p> <p>At the age of 65 he took on the chairmanship of the Wellcome Trust, a post he held until 1989, and managed to create more controversy by floating the drug company on the stock market. The rationale was that the Trust could capitalise on the value of the company and could lock in the wealth that then depended primarily on the company's profits. Critics argued that \"privatising\" the company in this way would force it to jettison much of its less commercial research, and would leave it vulnerable to takeover. The latter proved correct when it was absorbed into Glaxo a few years later. </p> <p>Sir David lent his hand to public service in the arts, chairing the Mermaid theatre, helping to rescue it from a financial crisis.

  "<p>The match itself will be little honoured outside the sporting annals, but last Thursday night an obscure team called Bnei Sakhnin made football history in a Tel Aviv stadium by appearing in an international qualifier against the Albanian side Partizani Tirana in the Uefa Cup. They were the first Arab team ever to compete in the European competition. </p> <p>But more intriguingly, as Sakhnin romped home to a 3-0 victory, they carried with them the hopes of Israel's legions of football fans. It is the first time the Jewish state has been represented in an international football competition by an Arab club. </p> <p>Sakhnin, a town of 22,000 Arabs in the country's northern Galilee region, has the poorest squad in the premier division. It qualified for the Uefa competition after unexpectedly beating Hapoel Haifa 4-1 for the state cup in May. </p> <p>Ever since, the Hebrew media has been accentuating the positive, suggesting that the Jewish state is finally proving its multicultural credentials - and its acceptance of 1 million citizens who are Palestinian. After the match reporters crowded around the team's Jewish coach, Eyal Lachman, as he announced: \"This team is making history.\" Sakhnin, led by an Arab captain, includes Jewish and foreign players. </p> <p>But there is a side to Sakhnin's story which has been kept out of the headlines. A mere 2,000 spectators turned up at the national stadium. Sakhnin's fans were loath to venture into Tel Aviv amid the mood of hostility to Arabs, and Jews appeared reluctant to wave the Star of David flag in support of an Arab team. </p> <p>In fact, during the four-year intifada, Israeli football has been one of the social pressure-valves for the expression of tribal sentiments. Opposing chants of \"Allahu akbar\" (God is great) and \"Death to the Arabs\" are common at matches, particularly since Sakhnin and another Arab squad, Nazareth, qualified for the premier division last season. In June the first fan was convicted of incitement to racism, and more cases, mostly involving rightwing supporters of Jerusalem Beitar, are in the pipeline. </p> <p>For historical reasons, Sakhnin's success is resented by a far wider spectrum of Israeli opinion. In 1976, the town won notoriety when security forces quelled protests from residents opposed to a wave of land confiscations that were strippingits reserves. In the clashes, six unarmed demonstrators were shot dead by police, forever branding the town - in Jewish eyes - as a fifth column. </p> <p>A cross the Arab world the deaths were seen differently: as a symbol of the David and Goliath struggle of the Arab-Israeli conflict. </p> <p>Each year the incident is commemorated in the Middle East as Land Day. Maybe not coincidentally, Bnei Sakhnin are reported to have recently earned a strong following in Arab states. </p> <p>Today, overcrowded Sakhnin is hemmed in on all sides by luxury Jewish communities, which have been given control of the town's lands. \"Once Sakhnin was one of the most important farming communities in the region, and now we don't have room for gardens or new homes,\" said Ali Zbeidat, whose home, like many others in Sakhnin, is under threat of demolition. He says he was forced to build illegally on his family's ancient olive groves after the local Jewish regional council, Misgav, refused him a construction permit. </p> <p>Not only private citizens are suffering. The local municipality has been battling Misgav officials for several years to free up land to build a football stadium; meanwhile, the players train on a makeshift pitch. With most big business in Jewish hands, Sakhnin has also found it impossible to win sponsorship deals. </p> <p>Uefa spared Israeli blushes by declaring that all matches in Israel would be played in Tel Aviv to ensure visiting teams' safety. None the less, apparently worried by bad publicity, Ariel Sharon has stepped in to pledge $2m for a stadium. The only trouble, say Sakhnin residents, is they are not sure where he will find the room to build it.</p>",
  "There is a general perception that effective policing ideas are either American or European. Western journalism focuses on the troubles in the Middle East and has helped to build a caricature of Muslim countries as hotbeds of despotism whose law enforcement agencies are renowned for human rights breaches and corruption rather than for good policing innovations. The British public can be forgiven for believing that, once one enters the Middle East, sensitive, innovative and efficient policing is replaced by that of corrupt, camel-hoarding officials and feudal warlords who chop off the hands of thieves and stone adulterers to death. <p>The implication is that Islam and harmony don't mix; that freedom and choice cannot be found in a Muslim country. </p> <p>Sensitive policing won't work in Afghanistan because of the warlords; it won't work in Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), or the rest of the Arab world because of autocrats and Muslim extremists. </p> <p>And thus the critics conveniently dismiss the millions of Muslims who remain true to their religion but thrive under peace and revere it. </p> <p>I set out to examine policing in the UAE. The way a nation polices its people is indicative of its national values, and a true gauge of its commitment to its citizens' wellbeing. </p> <p>Dubai is one of the most ethnically diverse societies in the world and, by examining the governance, structure, accountability and legitimacy of its police force, it was patently obvious that British policing can learn an enormous amount about how law enforcement can help achieve community harmony. </p> <p>Here is a state in the most volatile part of Middle East where commercialism and capitalist philosophies walk hand in hand with Islamic values. </p> <p>Strong religious values seem to merge easily with the growing western influence imported by British and US companies and expatriates. </p> <p>Its population is much more diverse than in most British cities, with over 180 nationalities speaking more than 100 languages - yet there is a conspicuous absence of inter-community tension. It is one of the busiest tourist destinations in the Middle East, with 45,000 British expatriates. </p> <p>Unlike in Britain, the host community is in a minority and the majority of the population are there to work - invited for their skills. Hence immigration and asylum is celebrated rather than demonised. </p> <p>Dubai has transformed its standing as a centre of commerce by utilising the skills of migrant workers and professionals, who are subject to stringent but realistic conditions. T</p> <p>heir welcome does not include placing them in holding centres and giving them food vouchers; there is no daily tabloid press portraying them as parasites. </p> <p>There are, however, a number of conditions. For example, they cannot buy property unless it is in designated zones. These zones are not ghettos - the aim is to ensure that the country's Islamic values are not undermined by western mores. </p> <p>In a recent public opinion survey, 84% of Dubai residents said they felt \"secure and safe\", despite being a stone's throw from some of the most problematic countries in the world. The crime detection rate of 89% puts to shame our own struggle to detect crime. </p> <p>Every police district employs a team of officers whose job is to ensure compliance to human rights. Senior police officers and politicians welcome these rights rather than see them as a hindrance. </p> <p>And, rather than adopt Britain's conventional method of putting police officers in classes and telling them what a Muslim or a Hindu looks like, operational officers are sent on intensive courses to learn the languages of the migrant communities, encouraging a true understanding of different cultures. They are expected to conduct interviews in these languages. </p> <p>The greatest threat to the UAE, and to Dubai in particular, is from the organised criminals who are inevitably attracted by the country's wealth. </p> <p>There is growing evidence of the presence of south-east Asian gangs, west African drugs cartels and major-league British criminals using Dubai as a base for their activities. </p> <p>The extent of money laundering through the country's banks, and drug trafficking via its ports, are serious concerns for its government and for Britain. </p> <p>If Dubai is not to become a haven for organised criminals, the police forces of Britain and Dubai must collaborate. But while British officers can assist Dubai's police, there is a lot that British policing can learn from the Muslim world and its attitude to community relations. </p> <p>The idea that we know best in the west how to police our communities may soon have to be given a decent but final burial. </p> <p>\u00b7 Dr Ali Dizaei is a chief superintendent in the Metropolitan police and legal adviser to the National Black Police Association </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Unless you have spent the penultimate day of your holiday searching for a dodgy gift shop that will let you use your debit card to get cash (for an exorbitant amount of commission) so you can pay your hotel bill, you may not have learnt this vital lesson: when abroad, it is not always possible to use your plastic. </p> <p>Not being able to pay with a debit or credit card can also cause problems if you book holiday accommodation independently rather than as part of a package. Sending a personal cheque is not the most sensible option when paying for holiday accommodation abroad, as a cheque drawn on a British bank must be made out in sterling. </p> <p>So, for example, if the deposit on your holiday apartment in the Dodecanese islands of Greece needs to be paid in euros, you'll have to guess the amount of sterling you'll need and hope that exchange rates don't shift too much between the cheque being written and cashed. A bit of guesswork will also be necessary to cover any bank charges to the recipient. </p> <p>But even if you get the amount of sterling right, sending a cheque abroad - to secure a booking, for example - is also a bad idea because it can take weeks or even months to clear, as it has to come back to Britain before any payment can be released. </p> <p>A better alternative is to ask your bank to transfer money directly into your intended recipient's account. Not only can you make the payment in the appropriate currency but even the slowest international money transfer services will deliver your payment within seven working days, with transfers in euros and US dollars taking half that time. </p> <p>Another plus is that most banks - with the exception of Abbey and internet bank Cahoot - will let you pay any charges levied by the overseas bank. This means that if the owner of the charming B&amp;B in Verona requires a deposit of \u20ac300, you can be sure that he or she will receive that amount, rather than, say, \u20ac284.90 after bank charges. </p> <p>You'll have no choice but to pay the charges levied by your bank but this will usually be less than the surcharge added by many travel companies if you pay for a package holiday with your credit card. </p> <p>The cheapest transfer option is LloydsTSB's economy international moneymover at \u00a35.50. This, like most budget transfer services, has restrictions on the amount you can send and is limited to certain currencies and countries. </p> <p>The most expensive options, with a fee of \u00a325 per transaction, are the standard services from Abbey, Alliance and Leicester and Cahoot. However, customers of Alliance and Leicester can get away with paying only \u00a37.50 if payments can be made into a postal giro account held at an institution that is a member of the Eurogiro network (to check, go to <a href=\"http://www.eurogiro.com\">www.eurogiro.com</a>). </p> <p>The only alternative for customers of Abbey and Cahoot is to pay \u00a320 to use the standard service from Barclays - the only bank which makes (some) of its international services available to non-Barclays account holders.</p> <p><strong>What you need to get your money across</strong></p> <p>Although banks differ in what they charge (see table below), information they need to make sure that your money gets to the right person is largely the same. You will generally need to tell your bank: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the amount to be sent and the currency in which you want to send it</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the name on the recipient's bank account</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the recipient's IBAN (international bank account number) or bank sort code and full address if the bank is outside Europe and so no IBAN is available</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the foreign bank's BIC (bank identifier code, otherwise known as a Swift address) Your bank should be able to look this up if the foreign recipient doesn't know it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> any reference you'd like to quote - your surname plus any booking reference, for example. </p> <p>But what do you do if you can't get hold of the necessary bank details? If you want to be able to make a payment in currency, the alternative to a bank-to-bank transfer is to send a foreign draft.</p> <p>For amounts up to the equivalent of \u00a32,000, the best value is the \u00a38 charged by Barclays for its international money order, available even if you aren't a Barclays customer.</p> <p>However, drafts can be made payable only in euros, Australian, Canadian and US dollars, and sterling.</p> <p>If you want to pay by foreign draft in any other currency - or you want to send more than the equivalent of \u00a32,000 - you will have to use your own bank's service, which costs from \u00a310 to \u00a318. But whatever your bank charges, you will have to add on the cost of using a secure postal service if you want to avoid the main drawback of sending a foreign draft: the risk that it won't arrive.</p>",
  "<p>Having danced with delight at Old Trafford last season en route to a Champions League victory, Jose Mourinho this time contented himself with a simple handshake as he retained his superiority over Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>And while Porto's European victory was achieved with a last-minute goal of heart-stopping drama, he needed similar nerves of steel in his first Premiership victory as Chelsea.</p> <p>As well, Mourinho believes Chelsea proved Mikael Silvestre wrong after the United defender said in midweek he did not expect Chelsea to click straight away, with so many new arrivals arriving in south-west London this summer. </p> <p>Mourinho said after the game: \"When Silvestre said we haven't got the time to create a big team spirit he was wrong. </p> <p>\"We were a team mentally today - and we had to win this match because of the three points we get against our direct opponent. </p> <p>\"And I think we deserved them because of the team spirit.\"</p> <p>Mourinho continued: \"If you have to play a little bit different to win a game then you have to do it. \"But I have to say it's maybe a bit unfortunate for Manchester United to leave Stamford Bridge without a point. </p> <p>\"They played well, weren't afraid of us, and risked everything at 1-0 down. </p> <p>\"Mr (Alex) Ferguson pushed me to make changes that normally I don't do to play a safer match - and in fact the team defended very, very, very well. </p> <p>\"We have to work every day as I was saying. </p> <p>\"Manchester United and Arsenal have great teams and have worked with their managers for a long time. </p> <p>\"We've been together for three weeks but we have this spirit and organisation and we play with maximum effort and quality at certain moments.\" </p> <p>The Portuguese boss was impressed with the atmosphere generated by the fans at today's game. </p> <p>He said: \"I thought before the game 'this is an unbelievable atmosphere'. </p> <p>\"In Portugal we have this four times a year with Porto, Sporting Lisbon and Benfica. </p> <p>\"I think I'm a lucky person to work in the Premiership - and I want to stay as long as I can.\" </p> <p>Chelsea captain John Terry revealed Chelsea have the belief to win the title - but the Blues will not get carried away with today's win. </p> <p>He said: \"We'll take each game as it comes - but with form like that there's no reason we can't go all the way. </p> <p>\"I think we took 15-20 minutes to get into the game but we kept the ball well. </p> <p>\"They put us under a lot of pressure near the end but we kept them out.\" </p> <p>Goalscorer Gudjohnsen added: \"They put us under some real pressure but we dealt with it - the boys at the back were brilliant and Petr was there to take the crosses. </p> <p>\"We could have played much better at times but we showed real character and defended with our lives.\" </p> <p>Ferguson himself said: \"I hoped for more from our possession, which we dominated, although our crosses were a bit scrappy and overhit. </p> <p>\"It was a good performance by us, we worked really hard, we can consider ourselves a bit unlucky. </p> <p>\"We had a lot of possession last year too and lost to a penalty so it's not been a good ground for us the last two seasons. </p> <p>\"But I'm confident in the ability of the team - I was before the match and I've no reason to think any differently after it.\"</p> <p>With Eidur Gudjohnsen having put Chelsea into a 14th-minute lead, Mourinho's new club soaked up enormous amounts of pressure in the second half. </p> <p>And so the Stamford Bridge gauntlet was thrown down, hot on the heels of Arsenal's comfortable win away at Everton, with the early-season problems for the United boss already mounting. </p> <p>Ferguson's injury-ravaged side may have recovered to take a lead in their midweek Champions league qualifying round first leg tie, but this time - just as in the Community Shield - they found themselves on the wrong side of the ledger. </p> <p>Not that Chelsea were entirely convincing themselves, with Mourinho adopting the sort of defence-first tactics after seizing an early lead which came unstuck for Sven-Goran Eriksson at Euro 2004. </p> <p>However, United suffered badly from the loss of Roy Keane from central midfield as he was being deployed as an emergency central defender. </p> <p>While United started confidently enough, with Alan Smith directing an early header over the top, Chelsea soon seized the lead. </p> <p>United's hesitancy in defence was exposed when Geremi took advantage of Quinton Fortune's failure to control a clearance and the Cameroon international attacked down the visitors' left flank. </p> <p>His deep cross was headed powerfully downwards by Didier Drogba towards Gudjohnsen, and he clipped the ball easily past Tim Howard, who was slow off his line and hesitant in his attempted challenge. </p> <p>Gudjohnsen then showed the strength to bundle the ball over the line as Keane desperately tried to recover in time. </p> <p>While Paul Scholes flashed a free-kick wide shortly afterwards, Chelsea quickly broke free again only for Howard to dive at Drogba's feet to claw the ball away in the nick of time. </p> <p>United nevertheless regrouped and started exerting pressure of their own, but their final ball was still lacking and Paul Scholes mishit one half-chance well wide. </p> <p>Chelsea resisted those advances and seized back control, with Frank Lampard firing a free-kick just inches wide of the far post. </p> <p>Mourinho seemed relaxed enough to lounge on the Chelsea bench, with his feet up and a wide grin on his face, an expression matched by his boss, Roman Abramovich, in the directors' box. </p> <p>The former Porto boss was rather more animated at the start of the second half, although United were still struggling to rouse themselves into any real action. </p> <p>Mourinho tried to inject more energy into his side, with Kezman replacing Drogba with 21 minutes left, although Sir Alex Ferguson's options on the bench were rather more limited. </p> <p>When he finally acted, it was to replace Djemba-Djemba with Diego Forlan, but the Uruguay international blazed his best chance into the upper tier. </p> <p>United were at least throwing men forward in the closing stages, with Giggs directing a header just wide and Keane finally thrust forward into midfield along with substitute Kieran Richardson. </p> <p>However, Chelsea, with defender Ricardo Carvalho sent into midfield late on, still prevailed and a late break by Russia's Alexei Smertin brought a broad grin to Abramovich's face. </p> <p>First blood to Mourinho. Or is it second?</p>",
  "<p>When I first laid eyes on Dubrovnik's main road I had an overwhelming desire to rip off my shoes and slip down it in my socks or, even better, dive belly first and see how far I could slide. The road, known as the Stradun, was so shiny I could almost see my face in it. </p> <p>'It's made out of pure marble,' a companion told me and I spluttered in disbelief. Isn't marble reserved for the lobbies of five-star hotels or the bathrooms of the super-rich? Apparently not. </p> <p>But it's not just the polished Stradun that's helping this Croatian jewel move up the list of unmissable city getaways. Last spring, British Airways introduced thrice-weekly flights from Gatwick. At under three hours, the flights make the city a viable short break option. </p> <p>As the coach from the airport snaked its way down the coastline, the views were mesmeric: to my right, mountains with towering, thin cypress trees; to my left, the translucent Adriatic. </p> <p>The Old City of Dubrovnik came into view, looking almost unreal, as if it were plaster of Paris moulded intricately into hundreds of tiny white buildings, roofs the same shade of orange, packed together inside a circular wall dotted with fortresses.</p> <p>Beyond towered a hill crowned with a single white cross and a fortress, signalling a city that has known siege. The law insists that the image, so steeped in history and culture, is retained. </p> <p>In the early 1990s, Dubrovnik was attacked from all sides by the Serbian and Montenegrin elements of the Yugoslav army. Every few steps I could see the scars of shrapnel damage, left as a pointed reminder. </p> <p>But there is no unsightly tourist detritus in Dubrovnik: no discarded chewing gum, no gutters filled with litter. Buildings look scrubbed clean and you can barely distinguish between what's original and what rose from the rubble of the war. </p> <p>The hotel Excelsior stands just outside the Old City, so close to the sea that the balconies and terraces overhang it. My room was simple and elegant and, on entering, I pulled open the balcony doors, drawing in the fresh sea air. Even from the fifth floor, squinting in the bright afternoon sun, I could make out details on the sea bed. </p> <p>From here, Dubrovnik transformed with the changing light of the day, ultimately into a silhouette against a hypnotic sunset. It was all I could do to drag myself away for dinner. </p> <p>Dubrovnik is bliss for food lovers - by the time I stumbled back into Gatwick my stomach was pushing uncomfortably against my once-baggy jeans, but it was worth it. Restaurants in town serve excellent food - three courses for as little as \u00a310 a head with wine. Squid, mussels and risotto are specialities but meat eaters will find plenty to satisfy cravings. </p> <p>We dined one night at the Taverna Rustica, the Excelsior's own restaurant, done out like a Swiss chalet, serving fish from different parts of Croatia. After delicious shell fish - for the first time ever I wasn't lying when I said I loved the oysters - a black pasta dish with half a lobster landed before me. </p> <p>As a guitarist serenaded from a balcony above, I spent 20 minutes trying to break open the shell and pull out the meat. It was hard to disguise my embarrassment on discovering eventually that the meat was already sliced and mixed with the pasta. </p> <p>Later, the cosy Hard Jazz Caffe Troubadour offered a chance to discover the joys of aperitifs and digestifs: plenty of grappa and a local herb brandy. I ordered Ecstasy (a lethal cocktail) and listened to live music, chatting to the regulars. </p> <p>The owner Marko is famous locally, his claim to fame being that, in the year Cliff Richard came second in the Eurovision Song Contest, Marko and his band came fifth. Over a grappa or three we organised a speedboat trip to the island of Locrum, which you can also reach in summer by larger tourist boat for 15 kuna (\u00a31.50). </p> <p>Surrounded by a rocky coastline popular with nudists, Locrum has beautiful botanical gardens, an ancient monastery and a fort. Following the signs, I came across a steep, rocky hill and, gasping for air every few minutes, I scrambled up through the fort and out on to the roof. </p> <p>It was a round building with window holes and I imagined a time gone by when city guardsmen would have stood there poised with bows and arrows. On the steps were some flowers to mark the death of a 22-year-old man in a more recent war, another reminder of what this community has been through. </p> <p>Looking back to Dubrovnik, I wondered how such a tiny place supports the influx of tourists at the height of summer, then headed down the steep hill to the beach and fell, fully dressed, face first into the freezing water. </p> <p>Back on the sunny hotel terrace, nursing a gashed knee, I consoled myself with cocktails and the prospect of an imminent massage and algae wrap in the hotel spa. It was here that I met a couple who were moving to Dubrovnik to set up a business hoping to cash in on the booming tourist market - many Germans and Italians already own holiday homes here but now Brits are getting in on the act. </p> <p>'We had English and Irish banging on our door in the summer, asking if we would sell,' one local woman told me. Not quite ready to set up a home I decided to take in one final luxury. I lay down in my room and let the warm sea breeze float from the balcony doors as I flicked to the news channel to watch the UK weather reports. </p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>British Airways (0870 240 0747; <a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">www.ba.com</a>) has return flights from Gatwick from \u00a399, out and back on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. </p> <p>Until 30 September, doubles with sea view at the five-star Excelsior Hotel (00 385 20 414222; <a href=\"http://www.hotel-excelsior.hr\">www.hotel-excelsior.hr</a>) start from about \u00a3178 per night including breakfast.</p> <p><strong>The pride of the Balkans</strong></p> <p><strong>Ljubljana</strong><br>Slovenia's capital is known by the hip crowd as 'LJ', according to style magazine Wallpaper, yet it feels traditional - made for strollers and drinkers.

  "<p><strong> 56th over: WICKET! Sarwan c Trescothick b Harmison 60 West Indies 154-8 They lead by 219 </strong> That's the one England wanted. Maybe he was getting tired, but this was a lazy shot, a forward defensive where he never really got to the pitch of the ball, and caught an edge to the forward-diving Trescothick who took a great catch. Sarwan wonders whether the slip-fielder got to the ball before it grounded, but Tresco's in no doubt, and that's good enough for the umpire.</p> <p>This game's right back in the melting pot, and if England need 250 tomorrow, you'd say they were favourites. There's still 12 overs left today, but I'm afraid that's your lot from us today. Log on tomorrow for the climax. </p> <p><strong> 55th over: West Indies 152-7 </strong> Not much doing for Giles, just a minor scare for Sarwan when he comes down the wicket, pads the ball away and turns to ground his bat back in the crease only to drop it and be forced to scuttle back, much to the amusement of the English fielders.</p> <p><strong> 54th over: West Indies 151-7 </strong> Sarwan negotiates Harmison well, threading two runs through the off side and then cliiping a single to leg, thus exposing Collins to just one delivery, a yorker which he digs out well, even getting a couple of runs for his efforts. </p> <p><strong> 53rd over: WICKET! Mohammed c Key b Giles 9 West Indies 146-7 </strong> Giles gets his reward, as Mohammed prods once to often, and pops up a catch off the glove to silly mid-off. Collins is next in, and finds himself with four men around the bat for company.</p> <p><strong> 52nd over: West Indies 145-6 Sarwan 56 Mohammed 8 </strong> </p> <p><strong> 51st over: West Indies 144-6 </strong> Dave Mohammed should be back in the pavillion by now. First he gets an edge to Giles which flies past Andrew Flintoff's left hand and races to the ropes. Then he comes down the wicket, swings at thin air, only for Jones to miss the stumping opportunity. Finally he gets a top edge attempting to sweep, but the ball doesn't carry to leg gulley.</p> <p><strong> 50th over: West Indies 138-6 </strong> 50 for Ramnaresh Sarwan, who's looked about the only West Indian batsman willing to knuckle down and tough it out. He can play his shots too though, and latches on to two loose deliveries from Harmison to drive them savagely to the ropes.</p> <p><strong> 49th over: West Indies 128-6 </strong> Dave Mohammed is looking to get down the wicket to Giles, but is not convincing in doing it, getting an inside edge down to third man for two. It seems as though a wicket is likely to come with every Giles over, but there's nothing doing here. </p> <p><strong> 48th over: West Indies 126-6 </strong> </p> <p><strong> 47th over: West Indies 125-6 </strong> At last Sarwan manages to connect cleanly with a sweep off Giles, sending it speeding to the boundary for four. He's content to kick most of the other balls away though, prompting the predictable LBW appeals, and the predictable shaking of the head from Umpire Taufell.</p> <p><strong> 46th over: WICKET!! Baugh c Sub b Harmison West Indies 121-6 </strong> Another poor choice of shot from a West Indian batsman, this time Baugh trying an uppercut off Harmison when there's a third man stationed on the boundary. Predictably, it goes straight down his throat, the man in question being Alastair Bressington, who shows laudable calmness in pouching it, having spilt an earlier effort. </p> <p><strong> 45th over: West Indies 121-5 </strong> Sarwan is content to shoulder arms to Giles, who responds by appealing every time the ball hits Sarwan's pads. Nothing doing. </p> <p><strong> 44th over: West Indies 120-5 </strong> More short stuff from Harmison, skilfully negotiated by Sarwan, though without much reward by way of runs. </p> <p><strong> 43rd over: West Indies 118-5 </strong> Sarwan is wearing a natty Bandana under his helmet, the knot of which is visible at the back. Not particularly notable, I realise, but this was a quieter over. </p> <p><strong> 42nd over: West Indies 118-5 Sarwan 40 Baugh 1 </strong> Harmison is on for Flintoff, and now's the time for him to earn his keep. He sends down a decent maiden here, but one can't help feeling he's going to need something a little more special than just quick, short balls. A bit of variety wouldn't go amiss.</p> <p><strong> 41st over: West Indies 118-5 </strong> Sarwan is playing with fire here. Or rather, more precisely, he's trying to sweep Giles against the spin, or clip him away on the leg side in a similar fashion. He's coming perilously close to being bowled around his legs, or catching a leading edge. </p> <p><strong> 40th over: West Indies 117-5 </strong> </p> <p><strong> 39th over: West Indies 115-5 </strong> With a host of fielders around the bat, Sarwan enjoys some relief by guiding a short Giles delivery down to the third man boundary. </p> <p><strong> 38th over: West Indies 111-5 </strong> This is a Herculean effort from Flintoff, who's sending down some fearsome deliveries. Sarwan is none too happy trying to negotiate them, and looks decidedly uncomfortable, none more so than when Freddie again raps him on the pad, and launches into a monster appeal, turned down by the umpire. </p> <p><strong> 37th over: WICKET!!!! Bravo c Flintoff b Giles 6 West Indies 110-5 </strong> Poor shot selection from Bravo, who goes for a big sweep off a ball which he doesn't quite get to the pitch of, thus catching a top edge which is gleefully collected behind the keeper by the ubiquitous Flintoff, making up the ground from slip. Suddenly all the momentum is with England. If they can remove Sarwan, you'd have to have them as favourites. Wouldn't you?</p> <p><strong> 36th over: West Indies 109-4 </strong> Freddie's running out of steam, and probably coming to the end of his spell. The question is, can Harmison or Anderson step up to the plate and carry on where he left off?</p> <p><strong> 35th over: West Indies 106-4 </strong> Bravo eases some of the pressure with a cheeky guided edge down to the vacant third man area. </p> <p><strong> 34th over: West Indies 101-4 </strong> The fourth hostile over in a row from Freddie, and he's knackered. Understandably so. </p> <p><strong> 33rd over: West Indies 100-4. Sarwan 30 Bravo 0. </strong> Giles continues to pressurise the West Indian batsmen, and it's anyone's game rught now.</p> <p><strong> 32nd over: WICKET!!!! Chanderpaul c Vaughan b Flintoff 2 West Indies 99-4 </strong> Freddie's firing on all cylinders, ripping one into Sarwan's pads for a decent LBW shout, and then getting one to rise on Chanderpaul quicker than he was expecting. And ill-advised pull is barely completed, and the ball is skied to the skipper at cover, with Flintoff and the crowd celebrating before the catch is even taken. Luckily, he doesn't disappoint them. </p> <p><strong> 31st over: West Indies 98-3. They lead by 163 </strong> Still 38 overs to go today, and time for each side to take control. The stats are still massively in favour of the tourists, but if England could take another couple of quick wickets, we'd really have a game on our hands. That said, another 100 for the Windies ought to put the game beyond England. Either way, it's looking more and more likely that this game will see a positive result.</p> <p><strong> 30th over: WICKET!!!Lara c Strauss b Flintoff 7 West Indies 95-3 </strong> Flintoff for Anderson, and Lara goes after his first ball, a wide one well outside off-stump, and slashes it in the air past the diving Anderson at point to the boundary. The stroke brings up his 10,000th run in Test cricket, acknowledged by all and sundry, but he's undone by Flintoff's very next ball. It's a beauty - rearing up at Lara, who hesitates, tries to fend it off, but can only glance a dolly to the jubilant Strauss at second slip. Flintoff is jubilant, and is mobbed by his team-mates as the Old Trafford crowd rise for the second time in two balls. </p> <p><strong> 29th over: WICKET! Gayle c Hoggard b Giles 42 West Indies 91-2. </strong> At last, Giles grabs the breakthrough, and deservedly so. Gayle can't resist coming down the wicket and launching one over the top. He doesn't quite meet it though, and Hoggard dives forward to take a splendid catch five yards inside the ropes. Lara's next in and swipes his first ball to deep point for three.</p> <p><strong> 28th over: West Indies 88-1. Gayle 42 Sarwan 28 </strong> It's not happening for Anderson, and the Windies break free from the mini-pressure that was building up thanks to two sumptuous half-volley off-drives from Sarwan. Expect a bowling change shortly. </p> <p><strong> 27th over: West Indies 78-1. </strong> Tight. Giles is on the verge here. Three more appeals, two for LBW and one for a bat-pad catch to short leg. Umpire Taufel correctly turns down all three, but the pressure's building, with no run for four overs.</p> <p><strong> 26th over: West Indies 78-1. </strong> Better stuff from Anderson, though no sign of a breakthrough. </p> <p><strong> 25th over: West Indies 78-1. </strong> Giles is still causing problems for the West Indies' batsmen, but he's getting more and more desperate in his LBW appeals. Gayle had taken a massive step forward and was a good yard outside of stump when this one hit. </p> <p><strong> 24th over: West Indies 78-1. </strong> Anderson's having a tough time of it, and goes for four thanks to a fine, sly glance from Sarwan. </p> <p><strong> 23rd over: West Indies 74-1. </strong> More tight work from Giles. And Chelsea have taken the lead against Man Utd.</p> <p><strong> 22nd over: West Indies 71-1. </strong> Anderson is toiling away, and draws a false stroke from Gayle, via a wafty drive in the air to deep cover. The fielder is a certain Alastair Bressington of Gloucestershire, on for the injured Graham Thorpe, but he fluffs his moment of fame, not quite making up the ground and spilling the ball as he dives forward. Thorpe has a hairline fracture of the little finger on his right hand, sustained when facing Fidel Edwards this morning. He'll bat in the 2nd innings, but may miss the last Test. </p> <p><strong> 21st over: West Indies 70-1. </strong> Giles looks like the man most likely for England, and he ties Sarwan up in knots in this over. The West Indian butter-fingers is lucky to survive one ball to which he offers no stroke, and is almost bowled around his legs, and Giles chucks in a cheeky LBW appeal for good measure. </p> <p><strong> 20th over: West Indies 68-1. </strong> James Anderson is into the attack, and Gayle looks to take him on straight away, latching on to a wide loosener and crashing it through the covers. He has a slash at another later in the over and sends it flying down to third man, where Hoggard performs heroics in saving a boundary. </p> <p><strong> 19th over: West Indies 61-1. They lead by 123 </strong> Ashley Giles takes up the fight after tea for England, but half the crowd seem to be stuck in the pavillion bar. Probably watching the Chelsea/Man Utd game.</p>",
  "<p>Around seven million people collect Air Miles by making purchases from certain companies, in order to swap them later for flights, but the scheme may not always be providing best value for money. </p> <p>To collect enough Air Miles to make a saving requires members to spend thousands of pounds at affiliated stores and service providers.

  "<p>Up on the screen, the hero meets his true love for the first time (cut to shooting stars). Later, the lovers lie on a beach wrapped in each other's arms (cue the sound of waves washing gently against the shore). He discovers a fiendish plot to kidnap her (Bam! Thunder and lightning) and a boat sets sail to seize her (a foreboding wind rustles the towering palm trees). The movie is the 1931 silent classic, Tabu - the soundtrack and special effects are provided by nature alone. Imax, eat your heart out. </p> <p>I am on a tiny, deserted coral island - or motu - in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, watching, bewitched, as the FW Murnau film, shot entirely in Bora Bora some 10 miles to the east, is projected on to a piece of sailcloth tied between two coconut trees. The evening is just one of the gems laid on by Bora Bora Cruises, whose yacht, the Tu Moana, my floating home for the week, lies twinkling at anchor some half a mile offshore. </p> <p>If the sensual experience of watching Tabu in situ somewhat blurred the lines between reality and fantasy, it is only the continuation of a theme. Two days earlier, I had taken a 160-mile, 30-minute flight from Tahiti to Bora Bora. As the plane began to descend, the island hove into view: a heart-stopping, pupil-dilating moment; a perfect Morse-code ring of motus, mop-topped with palms, separating the cobalt of the ocean from the variegated aquamarines and baby blues of the lagoon beyond. </p> <p>At the lagoon's heart, a tombstone of a volcano, its pastry-cutter peak snagging a wisp of cloud. At the volcano's base, the main island, just five miles long and two miles wide, carpeted with African tulips and coconut groves. And all this, on the day I arrived, with the proscenium arch of a perfect rainbow. Fantasy island in all its glory. </p> <p>Heralded by ukulele players and garlanded at the traditional welcome with shells and tiare, a delicate gardenia that is French Polynesia's national flower, I set about looking for Ricardo Montalban in a white linen suit and a Panama. Instead I got Mahea, the company's cruise director, in a Bora Bora Cruises T-shirt. After a melon kebab and a glass of fizz, he ushered me into a speedboat and whisked me across the lagoon, accompanied by hundreds of flying fish, to the Tu Moana, sitting under the aforementioned Mt Otemanu. </p> <p>Now, having established the Elysian credentials of Bora Bora, my cruise ship was patently never going to be one of those bloated behemoths so beloved of lottery winners and mystery viruses - oh no. I got a 70-metre, \u00a310 million, 37-cabin gin palace, complete with two football-team sized Jacuzzis, a library, a fully equipped gym, a bar, a restaurant and most definitely no Jane McDonald. </p> <p>Bora Bora Cruises was founded in the late 1990s by Mehiti Degage, a Tahitian businesswoman. Because of the narrowness of the gaps in the coral rings that access the lagoons, and the shallowness of the lagoons themselves, large ships cannot cruise these waters. So Degage commissioned two shallow-keel luxury yachts, had them fitted out to the standards of the finest boutique hotels, and adorned the decks, guest spaces and corridors with exquisite original Polynesian art and furniture from top Italian design houses. </p> <p>In the cabins, there are bathrooms by Philippe Starck, toiletries perfumed with tiare, bed throws by Kenzo and flat-screen plasma televisions and DVD players. In the galley is a world-class chef, creating superb French haute cuisine fused with traditional Polynesian dishes, while the ultra-contemporary dining room is staffed by permanently sunny French waiters, recruited from V Ships, the Monaco company that supplies personnel to the planet's most upmarket hotels. </p> <p>Such a craft would provide a luxury break moored off Canvey Island, but when you factor in the cruising grounds of Bora Bora and the surrounding archipelago - which, apart from local fishermen in their outrigger pirogues, you have to yourself - the result is the stuff of, well, fantasy. </p> <p>Later, in the gloaming, as I dined on the open deck, I looked out to the foothills of frangipani and hibiscus, the red spire of a church popping up through the coconut trees, a carpaccio of tuna in front of me and the Southern Cross above. </p> <p>That night, in my cabin, I was awoken by a noise. Bizarrely, my sunglasses and camera had thrown themselves off the table and clattered to the floor. I got up to retrieve them and promptly fell over. The room was swaying - the result, I feared, of my earlier enthusiasm for the wine list. Like Captain Kirk on the bridge of the Enterprise during a meteor storm, I staggered to the window and lifted the blind. In the moonlight, the silhouette of Mt Otemanu stood on the horizon. </p> <p>We had set sail for the next island on the cruise's itinerary, Taha'a, in the dead of night. With her shallow keel, the Tu Moana lacks some of the stability of larger vessels on the swells of the open sea. A small price to pay, I thought, as I crawled back into bed, closed my eyes and imagined I was in a hammock. </p> <p>Next morning, we were picked up off the yacht's stern platform by local fisherman Mata in his pirogue to feed the stingrays. With his mother-of-pearl necklace, grass skirt and laurel wreath of banana leaves, Mata looked straight out of Central Casting (South Pacific branch) as he steered the boat with his toes and regaled us on the ukulele. At the feeding site, he jumped in, armed only with a bucket of dead fish, and beckoned us to join him. Wearing masks and snorkels, we looked into the blue, attended by emperor angelfish and butterfly fish, and waited. First, one faint flickering shadow, then another, then all around dozens of enormous stingrays, perhaps five feet across, flapping, gliding, nudging against us, their skin the pallor and texture of forest mushrooms, swishing their tails coquettishly like contented cats. </p> <p>Instead of taking us back to the mother ship, Mata dropped us off on another deserted motu. Well, deserted apart from a band of Polynesian ukulele players and the entire crew of the Tu Moana, who had spent the morning transforming it into an alfresco dining room. </p> <p>There we drank cocktails and local Hinanu beer and feasted on camargue fish fresh from the lagoon, pumpkin marinated in the milk of coconuts plucked from the motu's trees and breadfruit and taro root, baked slowly in an ahimoa, a traditional Polynesian cooking pit dug into the ground. On the tables, centrepieces of moss and driftwood and banana leaves, the chairs like mini-thrones, each adorned with a giant palm frond. </p> <p>For the hedonist, the Tu Moana can be treated simply as a giant floating fridge, the perfect place to lie back on your designer teak steamer, drenched in tropical sun, daiquiri in one hand, salmon roulade in the other, and watch in a soporific stupor as paradise drifts by. But there are plenty of excursions for the culturally and actively inclined, too. At the island of Ra'iatea, we were taken ashore to visit the Marae Taputapuatea, French Polynesia's most sacred temple, dedicated to Oro, the god of war, and once the site of human sacrifices. </p> <p>Mahea explained how the giant banyan trees that stand sentinel have the skulls of ancient ancestors buried in the roots, and how it was from here, during the reign of King Hiro, that Polynesians departed in dug-out canoes the size of bathtubs to sail the 4,000 miles to New Zealand. And no Jacuzzi. Imagine! </p> <p>Then into the kayaks that are stored in the Tu Moana's stern garage for a paddle up the Faaroa river, into Ra'iatea's tropical interior and a visit to Rodier and Loveine's rambling, informal gardens. Spread over four acres, it was the horticultural equivalent of Willy Wonka's factory. Here were grapefruit and plumbago, bananas and cocoa trees, myriad dazzling butterflies and iridescent dragonflies. I plucked a star fruit and swallowed its gloopy, ambrosial syrup. Around were countless ylang-ylang trees, cat's tails and bird of paradise plants, trunks and branches latticed with vanilla pods. The olfactory hit was like some mad dash through a perfume department. </p> <p>After a cruise to the island of Huahine, and the cancellation, due to bad weather, of a breakfast served on a beach with your feet in the water (hey, it rains, even in paradise), it was time to head back to Uturoa on Ra'iatea, the archipelago's only deep-water port and the place where I would be leaving for a much unlonged-for reunion with the real world. There, as I sat in the deck restaurant and had a final lunch of moon fish tartare followed by a seafood bouch\u00e9e and chocolate torte, the sun went in. </p> <p>Well, actually, it didn't. It was stolen by the Tahitian Princess, a floating apartment block of a cruise ship which loomed terrifyingly over us, each one of its lifeboats about the size of the Tu Moana. As its gangplanks crashed onto the jetty and an army of Hawaiian shirts and pasty legs disgorged into the assorted black-pearl shops and henna tattoo parlours, the spell was utterly broken. And I swear I could hear Jane McDonald belting out 'I Will Survive'. </p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>Mike Carter travelled with Talpacific Holidays (020 8288 8400; <a href=\"http://www.talpacific.com\">www.talpacific.com</a>).

  "<p>'They bring us up on James Bond and then want us to sit in and watch television,' says Jake. 'We need excitement and graffiti gives us that. It's a fix.' </p> <p>Jake is a 34-year-old graffiti artist who says he started painting more than 30 years ago. He has signed his 'tag' - his identifying mark - all over London and has spent hours in the city's 'halls of fame', the walls around basketball courts and children's playgrounds that are used as blank canvasses by street artists and which are generally ignored by police. </p> <p>Jake has painted on bridges and in tunnels, and once abseiled with a friend down a building. 'It is like a game, and a game is no fun without risk,' he says. 'I have no problem with police officers doing their job: if they didn't it would be less fun.' </p> <p>But graffiti today is more than an illegal sub-culture - it has become big business. Catapulted by 'art-terrorist' Banksy and others, corporations are cashing in. Red Bull, Adidas, Puma, 55DSL and Lee Jeans have all incorporated graffiti into their marketing campaigns, so it is hard to walk down a major shopping street without seeing spray-can art decorating shops. </p> <p>And the art world is following suit. The Urbis in Manchester is one of many museums currently holding an exhibition showcasing the work of 10 graffiti artists from across the world with murals being sprayed in the museum itself. Next month the Art Fund, the UK's leading arts charity, is hosting an 'Art Happens' debate, about whether graffiti taggers are selling out in an increasingly commercialised art world. It is good news for Jake, whose reputation means he can now make a living from his love. </p> <p>But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. Graffiti hit the headlines last week in a big way, with the right-wing press running stories calling for a crackdown in 'graffiti louts', following the news that a 17-year-old teenager from Bath was fined only \u00a3250 for causing \u00a360,000 of damage to the historic city. </p> <p>For its part, the government has promised a clean-up campaign. This year, local authorities were given new powers to dish out penalty notices to culprits with Home Office Minister Hazel Blears calling graffiti an 'eyesore which blights communities'. </p> <p>A Keep Britain Tidy report recently claimed that graffiti was costing councils \u00a327 million a year and London Underground have targeted artists. The British Transport Police have also set up their own graffiti squad to pursue taggers. Sergeant Tim Naughton insists that those who consistently offend will be caught. 'It is a massive problem,' he says, 'but we nearly always catch the criminals and they often end up in prison.' </p> <p>They estimate that it costs London Underground \u00a312m a year and would cost another \u00a348m if they were to replace the damaged windows. There are rumours that lasers and heat sensors are being used to catch intruders. To Jake it simply adds to the fun: 'It is like mission impossible. Every time your tag appears someone notices it. The more it appears, the more you are recognised, and the better the spot that you get, the more respect you earn.' </p> <p>Jake, who asked for his name to be changed, is well respected and has left his mark across the world. 'We go on graffiti holidays. I have been to Cape Town, hit a wall on the Paris-Versailles train line, sprayed in broad daylight in Milan and did the Amtrak rail line in New York. It does not take long to meet writers [graffiti artists] in each country.' However, he has still not managed to break through the tough security of the New York subway: 'That is the ultimate challenge,' he says. </p> <p>Aside from the thrill that painters get from illegal painting, their work is becoming an increasingly applauded art form. Banksy, who gained cult status a few years ago with his stencils graffitied around London, has received national acclaim. 'His genius is his capacity to surprise,' says art expert Godfrey Barker. 'His is a positive contribution wherever he goes.' </p> <p>This month his latest work - a \u00a322,000, 20ft statue that was an amalgamation of the Statue of Liberty and the Old Bailey's statue of justice dressed up in thigh-high PVC boots - was unveiled as a jibe to the British legal system. He has also designed the cover to the Blur album, Think Tank. </p> <p>And the list of commercial ventures using graffiti art is growing. British fashion designer Wal\u00e9 Adeyemi has combined youth culture and fashion with his trademark graffiti print. His designs have been snapped up by Alicia Keys, David Beckham, Missy Elliott, Ms Dynamite and Usher, among others. </p> <p>The pattern has been imitated by high street stores such as Kookai and Miss Selfridge. In October Adeyemi's work will be showcased at an exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert museum. </p> <p>At 55DSL's flagship store in London the walls are covered in paintings. 'This is not about condoning vandalism, this is about an expression of individualism in art where the streets are an open sky gallery,' says a spokesman. 'To forbid it would be to deny youth culture.' </p> <p>Lee Jeans have also invited graffiti artists into their stores. The company proudly states that its jeans were worn in the 1980s New York hip-hop scene. They admit they are 'going some way to elevate the status of graffiti' but insist this is as 'a legitimate and acceptable art form'. </p> <p>'Art burst out of the confines of a formal and flat canvas 90 years ago,' says Barker. </p> <p>Scores of other companies are tapping into the scene. Adrienne Merrill is the communications manager of Diabolical Liberties, a marketing agency that helps brands reach a youth audience. 'Brands are adopting this because the visuals are stunning,' she says. 'It is done legally. These are beautiful pic tures, not tagging, which is not graffiti art and not attractive.' </p> <p>To many tagging is more than unattractive - it is a scourge to society and they argue that by publicising the art form, brands are encouraging children to break the law. </p> <p>Sue Nelson, deputy chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy says: 'It is not a question of whether it is art - one person's art is distasteful to someone else. Graffiti makes people feel unsafe and costs a huge amount that could go to other things such as hospital equipment.' </p> <p>Her view infuriates graffiti artists. 'Money saved from cleaning up graffiti will not buy a kidney machine,' says Boyd from south London. 'Money could be diverted from elsewhere and \u00a327m is not much in the NHS. But that sort of argument wins public sympathy. This is a revolutionary art form - a huge movement created by children.' </p> <p>Tizer, another artist, says his hobby kept him from drugs: 'It gives you an identity. I have been into neighbourhoods and approached by kids who shake your hand. London is the second mecca of graffiti after New York and we should celebrate it.' </p> <p>The pair say that the idea that graffiti is the domain of disillusioned kids is misleading: 'There are solicitors, teachers and lots of professionals doing it. I once painted with someone who is part royal and someone with diplomatic immunity,' adds Tizer. </p> <p>The artist is taking part in the Art Happens debate next month. 'Scrawling your name is saying, \"I exist\",' says Francesca Gavin, a journalist and curator who is chairing the talk. 'Graffiti can be beautiful - a lot better than demoralising concrete walls.' </p> <p>Research shows tags are far from random scribbles. A hierarchy of painters follows unwritten rules. 'It is a misconception that this is just mindless, lazy youths,' says Nancy Macdonald, author of The Graffiti Subculture. 'They are destroying property but it is anything but mindless. You have to work hard to be recognised in the graffiti community.' </p> <p><strong>Godfrey Barker</strong><br> <strong>Expert in the art market</strong><br> 'This 16ft wide, \u00a32.5 million Basquiat is the most expensive graffiti in the world. It was painted in 1982 when Basquiat was still on the way up and had an angst that was real to him; he was not yet a corrupted Greenwich Village fashion icon and celeb. The grinning horned demon here has frightening power. It is not just the emanation of Basquiat's drug-smashed brain but an authentic vision, we want to believe, of his early death. The abstractions on either side of the head are his own and as good as Pollock.'  </p> <p><strong>Francesca Gavin</strong><br> <strong>Journalist and curator</strong><br> 'Basquiat, although a huge influence on many contemporary artists, is very much the respectable face of graffiti. Andy Warhol's approval definitely made him acceptable to a mainstream audience. There's something so visceral about Basquiat's images - the paint is scratched on the canvas and exudes an emotional violence that is unnerving and attractive.' </p> <p><strong>Godfrey Barker</strong><br> <strong>Expert in the art market</strong><br> 'This graffiti is a million miles from authentic street protest; it's an ad, a billboard, as commercial as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Mear, who calls himself \"King of West Coast graffiti\", is a Los Angeles gallery owner and artist selling posters, canvases and cards. He turns sub-Marxist Che Guevara bollocks into dollars, announces he paints \"to serve the people\" and attacks America \"where back-broken slaves carried the upper class from one coast to another\". The technique's assured, though he's not free of those swirling Masonic abstractions that make so many graffiti so deeply boring. He's made a fortune defacing other people's walls, he's preying on the genuinely poor and ignorant, and he should be locked up for vandalism.'  </p> <p><strong>Francesca Gavin</strong><br> <strong>Journalist and curator</strong><br> 'The work injects colour and meaning into a dirty car park, transforming it into something completely arresting. The skill to create the detail in the portraits and the freeform lettering is extraordinary when you consider how basic a spray can is. Undoubtedly a thought-provoking take on modern urban experience.'</p>",
  "<p>'I love mongrels. I'm mongrelly, and my music is mongrelly. The deeper a gene pool is, the better.' So says teenage songstress Nellie McKay, who has gone from music school dropout to 120,000-selling success story in 18 stellar months. The 'mongrelly' nature of her entirely self-penned debut, Get Away From Me, is the reason for her swift ascent: if the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Interpol and the Strokes play out a monochromatic NYC story of leather jackets, not brushing your hair and being rock, 19-year-old Nellie McKay evokes a whole other Big Apple, one where Fifties pop vies with wordy, witty raps that rhyme 'coffee black' with 'bombing Iraq'; where Cole Porter is as important as Kanye West and where showtime rules. It's no wonder that one US headline proclaimed that Get Away From Me was sung 'in the key of gee'. </p> <p>It's an unusual recipe for success, but then McKay, currently on tour with Alanis Morissette and soon to support Sting, is keen to trumpet difference. Cool, says the longtime vegetarian and vocal supporter of animal rights charity Peta, is the bane of all existence. 'Self-consciousness and the necessary cruelty of being cool are the root of much evil. Cool is the antithesis of self-expression and being an individual.' Not that McKay - real name Eleanora Marie - has a problem with individuality. Her favourite films are Goodfellas and Bambi ('oh, and Bob Roberts, of course'); she doesn't have a TV, claiming she doesn't know 'how to hook it up' and her first song, written when she was 12, was a protest song against elephant hunting, titled 'Please, Please Don't Shoot Us'. And she's written an album whichreferences both Eminem and Doris Day. </p> <p>The London-born singer lived in Harlem until she was 10, then moved to Washington after she and her actress mother Robin Pappas - who had small parts in Chariots Of Fire and The Shining - were mugged and their Tenant Association leader was murdered. It's a background you couldn't make up: her grandfather went to prison in Sacramento on a murder charge, her great-grandfather was a bullfighter and the clan claim Dylan Thomas as a distant relation. 'I guess it's a colourful life,' she agrees. 'Y'know, I really enjoyed growing up in Harlem. There's a great sense of community behind the crime and the violence and the crack vials. But suburbia freaked me out.' </p> <p>At least suburbia gave McKay the chance to extend her musical skills. Aside from piano and saxophone, she took up cello and mallet percussion and hung out in high school jazz bands. In 2000, McKay moved back to New York and entered the Manhattan School of Music. Two years later she dropped out, preferring sets of Fifties and Sixties standards at Greenwich Village piano bars like Don't Tell Mama and Stonewall Bistro to 'the Fame contingent'. Playing in late-night jazz joints might sound stupidly glamorous but the reality, she says, is more prosaic. 'You have to apply your make-up and count your tips in the bathroom where people have been sick and missed the toilet.' </p> <p>In February 2003 she opened for the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players. There followed a superlative page of press in Time Out New York and a record label bidding war, which culminated in her inking a deal with Columbia Records. Once on board, two of her demands were instantly met - that Sgt Pepper engineer Geoff Emerick should be hired as producer and that the record should be released as a double CD. Her first choice of title, however, was chopped. 'I really wanted to call it Penis Envy. But Wal-Mart blocked it.' </p> <p>While the contents of McKay's songs, which cover animal rights, feminism and electoral sabotage, have long been part of the pop canon, they're currently controversial - at least in Bush's America. 'I've had some interesting feedback while I've been supporting other people. I introduced one song and said it was about gay marriage and people started booing. It's extremely scary, mob mentality.' </p> <p>Next she's recording a live album in a women's prison. 'Johnny Cash did it and Dylan always wanted to,' she says. 'I'm doing it because I don't like playing for an easy audience and I don't like playing to all white people. I'd rather have a hard crowd and people in prison have a pretty rough time. They could use the music.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> 22nd over: England 298-6 </strong> Collins serves up more bait and Thorpe duly goes fishing wide outside off-stump, but fails to oblige with a bite. A couple of 1/2 strength pulls later in the over keep the scoreboard slowly ticking over, and that's lunch. A painfully slow session, but no doubt who'll be happier with the outcome. Join us again in 40 minutes for (more) action.</p> <p><strong> 21st over: England 295-6 </strong> Dwayne Bravo takes up the fight, replacing Colleymore, and Thorpe promptly sends his first ball to the ropes via an effortless square drive. Geraint Jones is looking to get in on the act, and has made his way to 7, but can't find a way through the infield here. </p> <p><strong> 20th over: England 290-6 </strong> Pedro Collins launches an optimistic LBW shout as Jones is trapped in his crease, but he's outside leg-stump. </p> <p><strong> 19th over: England 288-6 </strong> Corey Collimore's turn to invite Thorpe to pull, but the left-hander is in no mood for such frivolity and continues to rebuff all advances. </p> <p><strong> 18th over: England 284-6 </strong> Ramnaresh Sarwan is having an eventful time in the field. Guilty of dropping a dolly from Thorpe at gulley yesterday, he pouched Hoggard in the last over - just - but now he's dropped Thorpe again. If anything, he's even more culpable here, Thorpe's flashing drive going straight to him at slip, and popping straight back out of his hands. Cue a host of glares from his teammates. </p> <p>Peter Richards is back to offer words of support, pointing out sagely that my comment about Thorpe wisely pulling out of a flamboyant hook for fear of what might be conceived, is, in fact, not anti-catholic but pro-catholic. </p> <p><strong> 17th over: England 283-6 100 FOR THORPE! </strong> And a gutsy one at that. Not one of Thorpe's more cavalier innings, but a very valuable one for England, and his teammates are out on the balcony to recognise the fact, including Andrew Flintoff juggling a rugby ball. Then...</p> <p><strong> WICKET! </strong> Hoggard's luck runs out, as he edges Colleymore to second slip, where Sarwan snaffles a good, low catch at the second attempt.</p> <p><strong> 16th over: England 282-5 </strong> The first boundary of the morning off the bat, and it's from Hoggard's bat, via a streaky downward nick through the slip cordon. </p> <p><strong> 15th over: England 278-5 </strong> Thorpe gets to 99, and then sees an in-swinger from Colleymore go right through him. Luckily, it evades the stumps too. </p> <p>Thorpe's taken 120 balls to move from 75 to 99, and Ian Simons suggests that Boycott's praise is because he respects anyone who can manage to score less runs than him in such a long period. </p> <p><strong> 14th over: England 276-5 </strong> Thorpe has edged his way to 98, and the crowd are ready and waiting to salute him. To be honest, I think they'd probably salute pretty much anything at the moment, such is the paucity of entertainment. I'm talking as an impartial observer though, and any England fan will still be cheering every dot ball. Let's just hope that if and when Thorpe reaches three figures, though, he throws of the shackles.</p> <p><strong> 13th over: England 273-5 </strong> More extras for England, this time leg byes. Thorpe's showing signs of opening up, albeit via a mistimed cover drive and a missed pull. The latter comes mighty close to Thorpe's off-stump, and prompts Hoggard to proffer a word of advice to his senior partner. Now there's confidence. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Windies have been warned for slow bowling. And I've been warned not to drop in any more anti-Catholic jokes. My argument is that, on a Sunday morning, I'm safe, since any argument of causing offence is immediately shot through by the fact that anyone reading such comments should surely be at church...</p> <p><strong> 12th over: England 265-5 </strong> Edwards and Hoggard might not become great drinking buddies, but they are at least providing some entertainment. First the Yorkshire man takes a single to gulley which was never there, and rubs it in by jogging the run while watching Brian Lara rush in, pick up and shy at the stumps. Hoggard is still two yards out of the crease when the ball flies past. Then Edwards, further enraged, sends another short one over the keeper's head and to the boundary. Lara is not impressed, but the crowd, desperate for any runs, lap it up. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Geoff Boycott is effusive in his praise of Thorpe's stoicism, the Surrey man having garnered five runs in the first hour and a bit of play. 'Great discipline.'</p> <p><strong> 11th over: England 259-5 </strong> Thorpe is being tempted by Colleymore, who sends down a host of short balls, though not as fearsome as those from Edwards. Thorpe makes as if to hook, but, like a good Catholic, withdraws at the last minute, lest he pay the consequences. </p> <p>Never let it be said that the Guardian isn't in touch with public opinion. 'Is being drunk the night before a condition of employment for Guardian freelance cricket commentators?' asks a slightly snotty Peter Richards. I'm just catering for our readership, Peter - check this out, from Adam Rutland: 'I'm hungover too, and was woken by the office summoning me in this morning at 6.50. Not amused, but at least I'll be back in the pub watching the cricket by 1.' Ah, the failsafe journalistic tool - lowest common denominator.</p> <p><strong> 10th over: England 257-5 </strong> Yes, the 250's up! Cue a trickle of applause around the 1/2 full ground. The crowd then breaks into a fully-fledged smattering when Hoggard displays some more of his eccentric range of shots, this time a carve down to deep point. Edwards is getting frustrated, and bangs one in short, only to see it evade batsman and wicketkeeper for four byes, which sort of qualifies as the first boundary of the morning, I guess. Cue a talking to from skipper Lara. </p> <p><strong> 9th over: England 249-5 </strong> Hoggard the hogger continues to take the lion's share of the strike, and provide the lion's share of the entertainment, this time notching up a hat-tricks of thin-air wafts outside off-stump. He's finding it pretty amusing. The Windies are not.</p> <p>I am constantly impressed by the devotion of followers to this site. Take David Keech in Seoul, Korea, who is 'also hungover, disoriented and sleep-deprived, after a 24 journey from USA to Korea'. Undeterred, however, David felt he 'just had to make your day worthwhile by tuning in to your GU commentry. It is costing me $20 in internet charges - so it better be worth it!' And you thought Graham Thorpe was under pressure...</p> <p><strong> 8th over: England 246-5 </strong> Edwards livens things up with an 94mph, absolute snorter to Thorpe. The Surrey man fends it off in mid-air at throat height, and appears dazed as it loops up in the air and falls at his feet, just evading both onrushing bowler and the stumps. He survives the delivery, but is in trouble thereafter, having taken a blow to his hand. A spot of magic spray from the physio relieves the pain for the moment but it remains to be seen if there's any lasting effect. Edwards certainly has little concern, banging the very next ball in short at 96mph and rapping Thorpe on the helmet. Thorpe appears a little shaken, but if there's any batsman who's capable of riding it out, it's Thorpe. Having witnessed events from the other end, Hoggard appears to have retreated even further into his crouching stance. Edwards isn't impressed, and gives Hoggard a further glare after he plays and misses two further snorters in a row. </p> <p><strong> 7th over: England 244-5 A SINGLE TO THORPE! </strong> Yes, it's all happening... Mind you, it's easy to mock, isn't it? England will consider it a job well done if the whole morning session peters along at this pedestrian pace. And it suits my hangover just fine....</p> <p><strong> 6th over: England 243-5 </strong> It's as quiet as a librarians' conference at Old Trafford, with just a couple of minor sub-plots to enliven the 'action'. Edwards gets a couple fo fly past Hoggard's edge, drawing a fierce scowl from the bowler, a jovial smirk from batsman, and a quiet word from umpire to bowler about running onto the pitch. 'A sedate start' says expert summariser Michael Atherton, living up to his job description. </p> <p><strong> 5th over: England 243-5 </strong> A maiden from Colleymore, and a pretty uneventful one at that. I'm not sure which side will be more happy with that - England looking to consolidate, or the Windies looking to tie England down. England, I guess. The Windies need wickets. And I need some action, so that I've got something to write about...</p> <p><strong> 4th over: England 243-5 </strong> There I was thinking Thorpe was looking to play the slow, cautious game, and he essays a pull to a short one from Edwards, the first ball of the over. He doesn't quite time it, and collects just a single, but it's an encouaging signal of intent. Hoggard then plays a typically ungainly push past gulley for a couple more before digging out another useful yorker. Dogged stuff. </p> <p><strong> 3rd over: England 240-5 </strong> Hoggard is hogging the strike and relishing his rise to prominence, jabbing another two down to 3rd man. The crowd are already restless, and desperate for some entertainment, indulging in over-enthusiastic cheers and applause for any scoring stroke. I'm not sure Thorpe's quite so eager to play to the gallery, but Hoggard's displaying signs of wanting to enjoy himself. </p> <p><strong> 2nd over: England 237-5 </strong> Fidel Edwards takes up the fight for the Windies, and his first ball is an absolute corker of a yorker. Hoggard, with his ungainly crouch, does exceptionally well to dig it out, and then opens up later in the over with a not wholly convincing cover prod for two, followed by an off-jab for a further single. Much like your part-time, freelance correspondant, he's not a classical performer, but he's doing a job.</p> <p><strong> 1st over: It's a sunny day in Manchester. </strong> What, is that not big enough news for you? Oh. Well, how about the fact that England resumed this morning at 233-5 and have already raced to 234-5, thanks to a sumptuous leg glance from night-watchman-turned-morning-glory Matthew Hoggard? Graham Thorpe, meanwhile, is content to watch most of the rest of Corey Collimore's over fly harmlessly past. It looks like we could be in for a riveting day's play. Just stick with us...</p>",
  "As a young man, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez discovered that his great-grandfather was a renowned guerrilla fighter, though he had been brought up to believe he was a criminal. Ch\u00e1vez set off to explore the area around the Colombian border where he had fought, with the idea of writing his ancestor's history. With his camera, tape recorder and research materials, the Colombian military took him for a spy and arrested him. After arguing for hours beneath a portrait of Simon Bolivar, the continent's 19th century liberator who tried to unite South America, Chavez pointed to the picture of the freedom fighter and appealed to his captor. Less than a century ago, he said, we would have been brothers in arms in Bolivar's army. <p>Chavez's hopes of carrying forward Bolivar's legacy rest with the people of Venezuela, voting this weekend on the future of his left-wing presidency. Like the inhabitants of the fictional Macondo in Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude , the players in Venezuela's febrile politics seem fated to continually revisit the continent's troubled past. </p> <p>And both sides, Ch\u00e1vez's left-wing presidency and an opposition representing the business interests of Venezuela's ancien r\u00e9gime, appropriate the continent's historic giants to their cause, praising or condemning, inter alia, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, and Chile's Augusto Pinochet and Salvador Allende. But for Chavez, no figure looms larger than the man who tried to unite South America. </p> <p>Whether his cherished history will reassert itself in Venezuela as tragedy or farce - or as a moment of national redemption - will be decided at the ballot boxes today in a referendum on his possible 'recall' - the culmination of the opposition's attempts to depose the 50-year-old. </p> <p>The troubled six-year rule of Ch\u00e1vez ('El Commandante') has been marked by strikes, lethal demonstrations and an attempted coup. It is more than a parochial issue. Venezuela is the biggest exporter of oil to the US - ahead even of Saudi Arabia - so its political stability has profound implications in a time of soaring oil prices. </p> <p>And critical in deciding the result will be whether Venezuela sees its president as a champion of social justice against the country's elites, and an international champion of anti-globalization, or as a dictator in the making who wants to remodel the country as a second Cuba. </p> <p>The opposition, including most of the country's media, whose proprietors were parties to the attempted coup, line up behind the latter position. Their view is shared by the US, whose officials were implicated in the failed coup, and by those Venezuelans who have most to lose from Ch\u00e1vez's ambitious plans for social reform. </p> <p>By contrast, international support for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez comes from those who in a previous era spoke for the Sandanistas and against Chile's Pinochet, among them British writers and film-makers Harold Pinter, Eric Hobsbawm, Ken Loach and Mike Hodges, as well as new campaigners for social justice, including the Canadian writer Naomi Klein. </p> <p>The way in which the battle-lines have been drawn have as much to do with Ch\u00e1vez's position as a figurehead of opposition to US policy in the region (he called George W Bush an 'asshole') as with his domestic policies. In recent days, Ch\u00e1vez has insisted that today's referendum, far from being simply a Venezuelan issue, is a battle against US imperialism. </p> <p>Which leaves the question: who is the real Ch\u00e1vez? Even the sympathetic Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez struggled to answer this when he interviewed Ch\u00e1vez shortly after his election in 1998. He concluded that he had the potential to fulfil both the role ascribed to him by friends and that attributed to him by his enemies. </p> <p>In his article, The Enigma of the Two Ch\u00e1vezes , Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez remarked that he felt he had been speaking to two different men: 'One a self-styled visionary who had been granted the opportunity to save his country. The other... an illusionist, who might pass into history as just another despot.' </p> <p>Charismatic Ch\u00e1vez has deliberately identified himself with two of South America's most powerful historical icons: Bolivar, for whom he named his social revolution, and Fidel Castro, his autocratic mentor for whom he has declared admiration and to whom he is supplying Venezuelan oil. And his use of Venezuela's oil - and the revenues from it - are, in large measure, the reason Mr Ch\u00e1vez is such a bogeyman for the US and Venezuelan opposition. His threat to cut oil supplies if the US continued 'meddling' in Latin America did not go down well in Washington. </p> <p>Sitting on the world's fifth largest reserves of oil, Venezuela supplies 13 per cent of US needs. Ch\u00e1vez rose to power on the back of his allegations that the country's wealth was being squandered by the country's corrupt elites. </p> <p>His rhetoric, combined with his dark mestizo looks, provincial accent, modest background and populist persona (including a passion for baseball), galvanised his country's massive underclass against the existing political order, and delivered him the biggest majority in the history of Venezuela's democracy. </p> <p>When Ch\u00e1vez quickly made good on his threats against the management of the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela it triggered the country's rolling political crisis that at one stage saw all oil exports halted. </p> <p>A prolonged oil strike in 2002 after he tried to move against Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela's management was followed by a lock-out that in turn opened the way for Ch\u00e1vez to achieve some of his political ends. He fired thousands of the sector's most privileged employees and redirected millions in revenues to his pet projects, including funding Venezuela's welcome to 13,000 Cuban doctors. </p> <p>The battle provoked demonstrations and violence in Caracas leading in April 2002 to 17 deaths and hundreds injured when pro-government and opposition gunmen each fired on unarmed demonstrators. A short-lived 'media-military coup d'\u00e9tat' on 12 April put Chavez out of office for two days. Venezuela's poor took the streets and secured his return. </p> <p>By 2003, strikes, demonstrations and a coup having failed to remove him, the opposition - with US encouragement - began organising a 'recall' petition for a referendum on his presidency, a mechanism ironically only possible as a result of Ch\u00e1vez's constitutional reforms. </p> <p>The opposition's retreat from street confrontation has been matched by a kind of truce with the US which, with the high oil price, a weakening economy and an election in the autumn, has also pulled back from further conflict with Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (an invited international observer for today's referendum) found Chavez a paradox. Born in 1954 and brought up by impoverished teacher parents, the young Ch\u00e1vez was, by the age of nine, supplementing the family income by selling fruit and sweets on the streets. A talented musician, artist and sportsman as a youth, a career in the military was not his first choice, but he settled on it when a friend told him it could be a route to professional baseball. </p> <p>By the early 1990s, Ch\u00e1vez, by then a colonel, was one of the founders of the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, which launched a failed military coup against President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez over unpopular austerity measures. He spent two years in jail but, pardoned and released, relaunched his group as the democratic Movement for the Fifth Republic. </p> <p>On the 'visionary' side of the balance sheet, Ch\u00e1vez himself lists his achievements since his election largely in terms of social justice. He claims to have reduced infant mortality by 30 per cent, improved child vaccination and access to health services and hired thousands of new teachers on higher salaries while giving land to more than a million landless or largely landless agrarian poor. </p> <p>The counterpoint to Ch\u00e1vez's campaign for social justice for the poor, has been an attack on the ingrained privileges of Venezuela's old elites. </p> <p>The opposition, and their sometime US backers, believe that this demonstrates his 'Jacobin tendencies'. Faced with institutions stacked with opponents - including the judiciary, military and congress - Ch\u00e1vez first came into conflict with Venezuela's business community in 1999 when he passed a series of new laws to apply his left-leaning economic policy. </p> <p>He also organised referendums to re-write the country's constitution, under a new Constitutional Assembly opponents say is packed with his supporters and has been allowed to hijack functions of the legislature. Ch\u00e1vez, too, has done little to reassure the 20 per cent or so of undecided voters, remarking that while his 'revolution is peaceful', it is also armed. </p> <p>This, perhaps, is the greatest unresolved mystery about Ch\u00e1vez. For, while the opposition accuses Ch\u00e1vistas of harassment, it is also true that for all their claims of Ch\u00e1vez's brutality, death squads do not roam Venezuela's countryside, nor are its jails full of political prisoners. </p> <p>Evidence of creeping authoritarianism is more subtle. From the Supreme Court to elements of the security forces that supported his enemies in the events leading up to the abortive coup, Ch\u00e1vez has moved to bring more of the state under his direct control. </p> <p>For now, though, Ch\u00e1vez and Venezuela will have to wait for the outcome of a referendum whose result remains too difficult to call. And to see whether Ch\u00e1vez can survive to bring about the promise of his democratic transformation of Venezuelan society - or whether, ironically, like Bolivar himself, his will be a flawed destiny that ends with dictatorship and eventual defeat. </p> <p><b> Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</b> </p> <p> <b> DoB:</b> 28 July, 1954 (Sabaneta, Barinas) </p> <p><b> Family: </b> Son of schoolteachers, he is married and has five children (three sons and two daughters) </p> <p><b> Education:</b> A degree in engineering from Venezuela's Military Academy </p> <p><b> Likes:</b> Baseball, Fidel Castro</p>",
  "<p>Paul McCartney found himself in Lagos in August 1972. The plan had been to record a new record - the record that became Band on the Run - at somewhere other than Abbey Road and EMI had offered one of its studios in Rio de Janeiro or Peking. Instead, the former Beatle insisted on the Nigerian capital, picturing himself 'lying on the beach all day doing nothing and recording at night'. </p> <p>As he drily noted later, 'it didn't turn out quite like that', what with being held up at knife point, the lepers in the streets, the omnipresent military, the corruption and the lack of security. Still, Lagos had its attractions. Chief among these was the chance to check out Fela Ransome-Kuti's band - 'the best band I've ever seen live ... When Fela and his band eventually began to play, after a long, crazy build-up, I just couldn't stop weeping with joy. It was a very moving experience.' </p> <p>Thrilled by his experience, McCartney thought of recording with some of the musicians working with the extraordinary 33-year-old firebrand. When Fela caught wind of the plan he denounced McCartney from the stage of his club and then arrived unannounced at the studio to berate him for 'stealing black man's music'. </p> <p>As McCartney said at the time: 'We were gonna use African musicians, but when we were told we were about to pinch the music we thought, \"Well, up to you, we'll do it ourselves.\" Fela thought we were stealing black African music, the Lagos sound. So I had to say, \"Do us a favour, Fela, we do OK. We're all right as it is. We sell a couple of records here and there.\" </p> <p>'I thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to Lagos and people would say, \"Oh, by the way, what's the music down there like?\" and I'd say it was unbelievable. It is unbelievable ... it's incredible music down there. I think it will come to the fore.'</p> <p>The incident caused a brief storm in Lagos, and illustrates Fela's fearlessness, his love of controversy and an unerring ability to piss on his own parade. When Motown wanted to set up an African label in the early 1980s, it offered Fela a million-dollar deal. This despite his insistence at the time of recording radio-hostile 60-minute songs, and never playing old material, so that live audiences would never hear his hits. </p> <p>Rikki Stein, one of his then managers, was hugely excited and flew to Lagos to discuss the deal. Stein says that Fela's response was to contact the spirits via his personal magician, Professor Hindu. The spirits refused to let him sign for another two years and Fela further insisted on only leasing his back catalogue. 'Even then, Motown went along with it. But after two years, in April 1985, the very month that Fela was about to sign, the Motown guy got sacked and the deal was off,' says Stein. 'Maybe the spirits knew something.' </p> <p>Certainly, Fela Kuti was the ultimate rebel, a spiritualist, pan-African revolutionary and a prodigious dope smoker and polygamist. Harassed, beaten and tortured by the authorities, he was a dancer, a saxophonist and a composer. He called himself 'Abami Edo', the strange one, the weird one. He dropped the Ransome part of his name - asking 'Do I look like an Englishman?' - and changed his surname to Anikulapo ('one who carries death in the pouch'). He also billed himself as the Black President, the Chief of the Shrine. Seven years after his death, the mysteries surrounding him continue to unravel, and a season of events at the Barbican in London this autumn will celebrate his complex legacy as a new generation of musicians discovers his work.</p> <p>In the 1970s, McCartney wasn't the only superstar to recognise Fela's musical innovations, the way in which he fused high-life and jazz with the rhythms of funk to create 'Afrobeat'. When James Brown toured Nigeria in 1970, bassist William 'Bootsy' Collins recalls, '[Fela] had a club in Lagos, and we came to the club and they were treating us like kings. We were telling them they're the funkiest cats we ever heard in our life. I mean, this is the James Brown band, but we were totally wiped out! That was one trip I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.' </p> <p>Tony Allen, Fela's drummer and a key architect of Afrobeat, claims that Brown sent his arranger, David Mathews, to check him out. 'He watches the movement of my legs and the movement of my hands, and he starts writing down ... They picked a lot from Fela when they came to Nigeria. It's like both of them sort of influenced each other. Fela got influenced in America, James Brown got the influence in Africa.' </p> <p>Fela's influence spread in all kinds of directions. Gilberto Gil, now the Minister of Culture in Brazil, says that meeting Fela in Lagos changed his life ('I felt like I was a tree replanted and able to flourish'). Brian Eno once told me that he owned more albums by Fela than by any other artist and that he listened to him 'over and over again'. Indeed, his one musical regret was that he never managed to produce a Fela record; he had been known to lie awake at night dreaming of what such a record would sound like. It was another musician, Viv Albertine of the Slits, who first turned me on to Fela in the early Eighties and I too became obsessed with the man, puzzled as to why he wasn't one of the biggest stars in the world. </p> <p>Born on 15 October, 1938, Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti was the fourth of five children in a middle-class family. His father, the Reverend Israel Ransome-Kuti, was the first president of the Nigerian Union Of Teachers; his mother, Funmilayo, was a political activist and feminist, also known as the first woman in Nigeria to drive a car and as the recipient of a Lenin Peace Prize who travelled to Russia and China and met Chairman Mao. His grandfather, an Anglican pastor, who encouraged Fela from an early age, had been one of the first West Africans to have his music commercially recorded, including a series of hymns in Yoruba for EMI's Zonophone label made on a trip to London in 1925.</p> <p>In 1958 Fela himself was sent to London - possibly to study medicine, though he enrolled at Trinity College of Music instead. For the next four years, he studied piano, composition and theory, and made a name on the R&amp;B club scene with his jazz and highlife band, Koola Lobitos. In 1961, he married his first wife Remi, with whom he had a son, Femi. According to JK Braimah, a friend at the time, '[He] was a nice guy, a really beautiful guy. But as square as they come. He didn't smoke cigarettes, let alone grass. He was afraid to fuck! We had to take his prick by hand, hold it and put it in for him, I swear!' </p> <p>In January 1984, when I first met Fela, at the Russell Hotel in Bloomsbury, central London, I asked him which musician he most respected. The answer was unexpected. 'Handel. George Frederick Handel.' I told him my father was a Handel freak and we discussed, amid the dope smoke, Dixit Dominus and the Concerto Grossi. </p> <p>Thinking about it, I decided a comparison wasn't improbable. In Fela's music there is the same mix of solidity and transcendence, and I thought I could detect echoes of the composer in Fela's organ lines. He told me he thought he was writing 'African classical music'. </p> <p>'Western music is Bach, Handel and Schubert - it's good music, cleverly done - as a musician I can see that. Classical music gives musicians a kick. But African music gives everyone a kick. Once you get music with a beat, that is African music. </p> <p>'Jazz was the beginning of rhythm music, which developed into rock and roll. But what the jazz musicians lost because they were so far from their homeland was the intricate rhythms of African music.' </p> <p>Can Europeans play African music, I asked? 'I tell you something. When I was in London 20 years ago the white boys couldn't dance, now they dance quite well.' </p> <p>Returning to Lagos, Fela worked as a trainee radio producer with Nigerian Broadcasting, and re-formed Koola Lobitos. But it was the band's first trip to the USA in 1969 that saw the sound really change, while Fela began a personal evolution, talking the language of revolution for the first time. Broke, depressed and working as an illegal immigrant now his visa had expired, he met Sandra Smith at one of the band's gigs at New York's Ambassador Hotel. She was a member of the Black Panther Party, the pair became lovers and she turned him on to Eldridge Cleaver and Malcolm X, persuading him to write 'conscious' lyrics. </p> <p>Fela's band, now called Africa 70, came into its own back in Lagos - the hits started coming, Fela coined the term 'Afrobeat' and set up a kind of hippie commune in a large house. Upwards of 100 people lived there - the band, roadies and anyone involved with the nightclub Fela set up, originally called the Afro-Spot and then the Shrine. And Fela became a hero of the underclass. A typical swipe at the ruling elite was found on the song 'Gentleman', on which he ridiculed those who wore western fashions in Africa: </p> <p>'Him put him socks him put him shoes, him put him pants him put him singlet, him put him trouser him put him shirt, him put him tie, him put him coat, him cover over all with him hat; him go sweat all over, him go faint right down, him go smell like shit. ' </p> <p>The authorities responded by sending the army to arrest Fela, razing his home almost to the ground. Fela promptly recorded a track titled after the Lagos prison ('Alagbon Close'), spoofing the authorities. </p> <p>When I walked into Fela's hotel room on that cold January afternoon, the self-styled Black President, The One Who Emanates Greatness, Carries Death In His Quiver and Cannot Be Killed By Human Entity was wearing just a pair of red underpants, smoking a cigar-sized spliff and watching a B-movie. The 22-year old Femi was there too along with three wives and Professor Hindu (aka a Ghanaian called Kwaku Addaie). </p> <p>At a show at London's Town and Country Club that week, the Professor, to the bafflement of a sceptical audience, had cut his own tongue, magicked watches and clothes from nowhere and asked for a volunteer from the audience whose throat he seemed to cut before burying him outside the venue in a grave he had dug earlier. Two days later 200 people witnessed the volunteer's disinterment; he explained that being buried makes people extremely horny and propositioned the music journalist Vivien Goldman, pleading: 'I have money. Plenty money' and waving a hotel key. </p> <p>'Everything was going against me,' Fela said of Hindu. 'Since I met him four years ago, I've seen so much spiritual light.' Fela said Hindu knows the past and the future, and he used him to talk to his dead mother each night. </p> <p>I had come to know Fela through records such as 'Algabon Close' and 'Zombie'. You could make a case for 1976's most revolutionary record being not 'Anarchy In The UK' but this second, perfectly conceived slice of pop subversion, with its killer groove sounding like no one else, thunderous brass with wonderful trumpet from Lester Bowie and lyrics in pidgin English attacking the mindlessness of the Nigerian military ('Zombie no go turn unless you tell am to turn/Zombie no go think unless you tell to think ...'). </p> <p>Fela's robotic stage moves had been copied by protesters in riots against the government; he was banned from Ghana for being 'liable to cause a breach of the peace' and this song provoked an attack on his new commune, named by Fela the Kalakuta ('Rascal') Republic. Indeed, Fela had declared independence from the repressive Nigerian state. On 18 February 1977, more than 1,000 armed soldiers surrounded the compound, set fire to the generator, and brutalised the occupants. Fela alleged he was dragged by his genitals from the main house, beaten, and only escaped death following the intervention of a commanding officer. Many women were raped and the 78-year-old Funmilayo was thrown through a window. She subsequently died. </p> <p>Fela kept up the polemic, delivering his mother's coffin to the army barracks and writing the song 'Coffin for Head of State' . One of his masterpieces, 'Unknown Soldier', followed an official inquiry that claimed the commune was destroyed by 'an exasperated and unknown soldier'. </p> <p>According to John Collins, who knew Fela in the 1970s and is the author of Fela: Africa's Musical Warrior, published next month: 'In his songs [Fela] went much further than the usual round-up of protest singers such as Bob Dylan, James Brown or Bob Marley. Fela's songs not only protested against various forms of injustice but often fiercely attacked specific agencies and members of the Nigerian government.' His targets even included the US multinational International Telephones and TeleCommunications, on 'International Thief Thief (ITT)'. </p> <p>In 1978, Fela had set up an organisation called Movement For The People and said he wanted to run for president but the authorities kept him off the ballot by various legal stratagems. I asked him, when we met, if he thought he could ever be president of Nigeria. 'Spiritually speaking, every human being has a destiny and a duty to perform,' he said. 'No African has ever seen anything like me - they see me sticking to my guns through all the violence. </p> <p>'In the last military regime I was the only one to speak out against the government and the army. Anything could happen in Nigeria. If they get to the point that everyone trying to rule the place isn't making any headway they might drop their guard and ask, \"Fela, do you want to rule us today?\"' </p> <p>So what sort of regime would he run? </p> <p>'It would be a cultural and spiritual revolution. Every individual would feel like a president - nothing would obstruct people getting what is due to them.' </p> <p>The fumes in the room were getting thick. I was trying not to look at his wives, nor seem that I was deliberately not looking at them. Also in 1978, to mark the anniversary of the pillage of Kalakuta, he married 27 of his dancers simultaneously. Fela claimed this was a traditional Yoruba ceremony, although some priests disputed this, pointing out that no bride prices were paid, and there is a suggestion that some sort of immigration scam was also involved. It was certainly a fabulous publicity stunt, although as DJ Rita Ray, who now runs a Fela-inspired club called Shrine in London, points out, 'Dancers weren't held in high esteem, so his argument was that he was making them respectable. He was wild, but very progressive.' </p> <p>In our meeting, I asked him about the importance of sex. 'Sex is one of the most important things in life, man. It's Christianity and Islam that have made sex immoral. People should be proud to say, \"I had a fantastic fuck last night.\" When a minister in Britain has an affair he loses his job. If a minister in Africa fucks 400 women no one will even notice him, you know.' </p> <p>In songs such as 'Lady' and 'Mattress' the impression he gave was that women were inferior. 'I'm not saying that women should not be political leaders,' he said. 'Women can do what they want - but once she's married in Africa she can't do anything against her husband's will. If a woman doesn't like a man she should find another - that's why polygamy is so fantastic ... An African man should not do anything called housework or cooking ...' But, Fela, cooking can be fun, I persisted. 'I can cook, I had to as a student in London. But if I have a party and do cooking, people call me a 'Less Man'. I don't see why I should go against the cultural values of my people.' </p> <p>So what is the gay scene like in Lagos? 'I've seen a few boys behave like sissies, you know. I found they had gone to England and been corrupted. If you are gay in Africa no one must know about it - they will stone you to death, man.' </p> <p>Fela claimed Aids was a 'white man's disease', but he caught the virus and died from complications on 2 August, 1997, at the age of 58. At the time we met, 12 of his 27 wives remained - he told me he employed a rota system to keep them satisfied - but following a 27-month jail sentence that began later that year (on a trumped up charge of currency smuggling) he divorced them all. 'Marriage brings jealousy and selfishnessness,' he was quoted as saying. His manager, Rikki Stein, maintains 'sex was where his inspiration came from, and considering the number of great albums he made ... In the Eighties, on tour, I witnessed fur-wrapped beauties queuing up for their turn ...' </p> <p>Fela's last song had been called 'C.S.A.S (Condom Scallywag and Scatter )', which described the use of condoms as 'un-African'. To the end, Fela refused to be tested to determine the cause of his weight loss and skin lesions. After much discussion among the family after his death, his brother, Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, publicly disclosed the cause, paradoxically enabling, as one commentator put it, 'Aids awareness in Nigeria to leave the dark ages'. In that sense, Fela's death helped save a lot of lives, although it's impossible to know how many women he himself put in mortal danger by his wilful denial of his disease. Stein says 'one or two women in Fela's entourage became ill, though I don't know whether it had anything to do with Fela. All the rest are still going strong, as I understand it. They say it was Aids. I say that he died of one beating too many. He was a giant of a man, but a man nevertheless.' It might otherwise be observed that it was a wilful contrariness - the same impulse that always animated Fela - that ultimately killed him. </p> <p>More than a million mourners filled the streets of Lagos. Towards the end of his life, as his energy waned, Fela was less involved with political crusades. Nonetheless, according to Femi Kuti: 'For two days, people didn't do any work in Lagos! This is the first time in the history of Lagos they have not had a complaint of robbery, rape or anything. Because all the robbers, the bad boys, they loved him, you know? Everybody was busy at the funeral.' </p> <p>One irony is that Fela, if anything, is more popular world-wide than when he was alive - his music is sampled by producers like Timbaland (on Missy Elliott's 'Watcha Gonna Do'), while Damon Albarn voted 'Zombie' the 'sexiest ever track' in a recent poll. In fact, the Blur singer is now working in Lagos on a project with Tony Allen. </p> <p>And Femi Kuti carries the family torch with his own band, Positive Force, while another son, Seun - a recent graduate of the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, the 'fame academy' endowed by Paul McCartney - fronts a version of Fela's old group Egypt 80. </p> <p>I spoke to Seun on the day he was supposed to be at his graduation ceremony, where he would have met Sir Paul. Instead, Seun - who's anti-marriage, and pro-dope, rebellion and black consciousness - leapt on a plane to Lagos. He said he had better things to do. </p> <p>Fela Kuti's biographer Michael Veal worried that 'Fela's message of African empowerment became increasingly intertwined with dominant racist stereotypes of the African as vulgar, intoxicated, primitive, hypersexualised and indigenous mystic.' </p> <p>For the 20-year old Seun, his father 'was a gift, an inspiration to Africa; there will never be another like him. But things in Nigeria are even worse now, and however hard it is to live up to his legacy, we have to carry on the fight for liberation and consciousness'. Both Positive Force and Egypt 80 will be appearing at the Barbican's Fela Kuti season. </p> <p>Did Fela ever fail himself? It is not likely that he ever felt that way, he told me he was a fatalist. 'Even death doesn't worry me, man. When my mother died it was because she finished her time on earth. I know that when I die I'll see her again, so how can I fear death?' </p> <p>'So what is this motherfucking world about? I believe there is a plan ... What I am experiencing today completely vindicates the African religions ... I will do my part ... then I'll just go, man. Just go!'</p> <p><strong>Fela: a life of struggle</strong></p> <p><strong>1938</strong> Born 15 October in Abeokuta, Nigeria to politically active and middle class family. </p> <p><strong>1958 </strong> Sent to London to train as a doctor, but instead enrolled in the Trinity College of Music.

When Fela caught wind of the plan he denounced McCartney from the stage of his club and then arrived unannounced at the studio to berate him for 'stealing black man's music'.</p> <p>As McCartney said at the time: 'We were gonna use African musicians, but when we were told we were about to pinch the music we thought, \"Well, up to you, we'll do it ourselves.\" Fela thought we were stealing black African music, the Lagos sound. So I had to say, \"Do us a favour, Fela, we do OK. We're all right as it is. We sell a couple of records here and there.\"</p> <p>'I thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to Lagos and people would say, \"Oh, by the way, what's the music down there like?\" and I'd say it was unbelievable. It is unbelievable...it's incredible music down there. I think it will come to the fore.'</p> <p>The incident caused a brief storm in Lagos, and illustrates Fela's fearlessness, his love of controversy and an unerring ability to piss on his own parade. When Motown wanted to set up an African label in the early 1980s, it offered Fela a million-dollar deal. This despite his insistence at the time of recording radio-hostile 60-minute songs, and never playing old material, so that live audiences would never hear his hits.</p> <p>Rikki Stein, one of his then managers, was hugely excited and flew to Lagos to discuss the deal. Stein says that Fela's response was to contact the spirits via his personal magician, Professor Hindu. The spirits refused to let him sign for another two years and Fela further insisted on only leasing his back catalogue. 'Even then, Motown went along with it. But after two years, in April 1985, the very month that Fela was about to sign, the Motown guy got sacked and the deal was off,' says Stein. 'Maybe the spirits knew something.'</p> <p>Certainly, Fela Kuti was the ultimate rebel, a spiritualist , pan-African revolutionary and a prodigious dope smoker and polygamist. Harassed, beaten and tortured by the authorities, he was a dancer, a saxophonist and a composer. He called himself 'Abami Edo', the strange one, the weird one. He dropped the Ransome part of his name - asking 'Do I look like an Englishman?' - and changed his surname to Anikulapo ('one who carries death in the pouch'). He also billed himself as the Black President, the Chief of the Shrine. Seven years after his death, the mysteries surrounding him continue to unravel, and a season of events at the Barbican in London this autumn will celebrate his complex legacy as a new generation of musicians discovers his work.</p> <p>In the 1970s, McCartney wasn't the only superstar to recognise Fela's musical innovations, the way in which he fused high-life and jazz with the rhythms of funk to create 'Afrobeat'. When James Brown toured Nigeria in 1970, bassist William 'Bootsy' Collins recalls, '[Fela] had a club in Lagos, and we came to the club and they were treating us like kings. We were telling them they're the funkiest cats we ever heard in our life. I mean, this is the James Brown band , but we were totally wiped out! That was one trip I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.'</p> <p>Tony Allen, Fela's drummer and a key architect of Afrobeat, claims that Brown sent his arranger, David Mathews, to check him out. 'He watches the movement of my legs and the movement of my hands, and he starts writing down... They picked a lot from Fela when they came to Nigeria. It's like both of them sort of influenced each other. Fela got influenced in America, James Brown got the influence in Africa.'</p> <p>Fela's influence spread in all kinds of directions. Gilberto Gil, now the Minister of Culture in Brazil, says that meeting Fela in Lagos changed his life ('I felt like I was a tree replanted and able to flourish'). Brian Eno once told me that he owned more albums by Fela than by any other artist and that he listened to him 'over and over again'. Indeed, his one musical regret was that he never managed to produce a Fela record he had been known to lie awake at night dreaming of what such a record would sound like. It was another musician, Viv Albertine of the Slits, who first turned me on to Fela in the early Eighties and I too became obsessed with the man, puzzled as to why he wasn't one of the biggest stars in the world.</p> <p>BORN ON 15 OCTOBER, 1938, OLUFELA Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti was the fourth of five children in a middle-class family. His father, the Reverend Israel Ransome-Kuti, was the first president of the Nigerian Union Of Teachers his mother, Funmilayo, was a political activist and feminist, also known as the first woman in Nigeria to drive a car and as the recipient of a Lenin Peace Prize who travelled to Russia and China and met Chairman Mao. His grandfather, an Anglican pastor, who encouraged Fela from an early age, had been one of the first West Africans to have his music commercially recorded, including a series of hymns in Yoruba for EMI's Zonophone label made on a trip to London in 1925.</p> <p>In 1958 Fela himself was sent to London - possibly to study medicine, though he enrolled at Trinity College of Music instead. For the next four years, he studied piano, composition and theory, and made a name on the R&amp;B club scene with his jazz and highlife band, Koola Lobitos. In 1961, he married his first wife Remi, with whom he had a son, Femi. According to JK Braimah, a friend at the time, '[He] was a nice guy, a really beautiful guy. But as square as they come. He didn't smoke cigarettes, let alone grass. He was afraid to fuck! We had to take his prick by hand, hold it and put it in for him, I swear!'</p> <p>In January 1984, when I first met Fela, at the Russell Hotel in Bloomsbury, central London, I asked him which musician he most respected. The answer was unexpected. 'Handel. George Frederick Handel.' I told him my father was a Handel freak and we discussed, amid the dope smoke, Dixit Dominus and the Concerto Grossi.</p> <p>Thinking about it, I decided a comparison wasn't improbable. In Fela's music there is the same mix of solidity and transcendence, and I thought I could detect echoes of the composer in Fela's organ lines. He told me he thought he was writing 'African classical music'.</p> <p>'Western music is Bach, Handel and Schubert - it's good music, cleverly done - as a musician I can see that. Classical music gives musicians a kick. But African music gives everyone a kick. Once you get music with a beat, that is African music.</p> <p>'Jazz was the beginning of rhythm music, which developed into rock and roll. But what the jazz musicians lost because they were so far from their homeland was the intricate rhythms of African music.'</p> <p>Can Europeans play African music, I asked? 'I tell you something. When I was in London 20 years ago the white boys couldn't dance, now they dance quite well.'</p> <p>RETURNING TO LAGOS, FELA WORKED AS A trainee radio producer with Nigerian Broadcasting, and re-formed Koola Lobitos. But it was the band's first trip to the USA in 1969 that saw the sound really change, while Fela began a personal evolution, talking the language of revolution for the first time. Broke, depressed and working as an illegal immigrant now his visa had expired, he met Sandra Smith at one of the band's gigs at New York's Ambassador Hotel. She was a member of the Black Panther Party, the pair became lovers and she turned him on to Eldridge Cleaver and Malcolm X, persuading him to write 'conscious' lyrics.</p> <p>Fela's band, now called Africa 70, came into its own back in Lagos - the hits started coming, Fela coined the term 'Afrobeat' and set up a kind of hippie commune in a large house. Upwards of 100 people lived there - the band, roadies and anyone involved with the nightclub Fela set up, originally called the Afro-Spot and then the Shrine. And Fela became a hero of the underclass. A typical swipe at the ruling elite was found on the song 'Gentleman', on which he ridiculed those who wore western fashions in Africa:</p> <p>'Him put him socks him put him shoes, him put him pants him put him singlet, him put him trouser him put him shirt, him put him tie, him put him coat, him cover over all with him hat him go sweat all over, him go faint right down, him go smell like shit. '</p> <p>The authorities responded by sending the army to arrest Fela, razing his home almost to the ground. Fela promptly recorded a track titled after the Lagos prison ('Alagbon Close'), spoofing the authorities.</p> <p>When I walked into Fela's hotel room on that cold January afternoon, the self-styled Black President, The One Who Emanates Greatness, Carries Death In His Quiver and Cannot Be Killed By Human Entity was wearing just a pair of red underpants, smoking a cigar-sized spliff and watching a B-movie. The 22-year old Femi was there too along with three wives and Professor Hindu (aka a Ghanaian called Kwaku Addaie).</p> <p>At a show at London's Town and Country Club that week, the Professor, to the bafflement of a sceptical audience, had cut his own tongue, magicked watches and clothes from nowhere and asked for a volunteer from the audience whose throat he seemed to cut before burying him outside the venue in a grave he had dug earlier. Two days later 200 people witnessed the volunteer's disinterment he explained that being buried makes people extremely horny and propositioned the music journalist Vivien Goldman, pleading: 'I have money. Plenty money' and waving a hotel key.</p> <p>'Everything was going against me,' Fela said of Hindu. 'Since I met him four years ago, I've seen so much spiritual light.' Fela said Hindu knows the past and the future, and he used him to talk to his dead mother each night.</p> <p>I had come to know Fela through records such as 'Algabon Close' and 'Zombie'. You could make a case for 1976's most revolutionary record being not 'Anarchy In The UK' but this second, perfectly conceived slice of pop subversion, with its killer groove sounding like no one else, thunderous brass with wonderful trumpet from Lester Bowie and lyrics in pidgin English attacking the mindlessness of the Nigerian military ('Zombie no go turn unless you tell am to turn/Zombie no go think unless you tell to think...').</p> <p>Fela's robotic stage moves had been copied by protesters in riots against the government he was banned from Ghana for being 'liable to cause a breach of the peace' and this song provoked an attack on his new commune, named by Fela the Kalakuta ('Rascal') Republic. Indeed, Fela had declared independence from the repressive Nigerian state. On 18 February 1977, more than 1,000 armed soldiers surrounded the compound, set fire to the generator, and brutalised the occupants. Fela alleged he was dragged by his genitals from the main house, beaten, and only escaped death following the intervention of a commanding officer. Many women were raped and the 78-year-old Funmilayo was thrown through a window. She subsequently died.</p> <p>Fela kept up the polemic, delivering his mother's coffin to the army barracks and writing the song 'Coffin for Head of State' . One of his masterpieces, 'Unknown Soldier', followed an official inquiry that claimed the commune was destroyed by 'an exasperated and unknown soldier'.</p> <p>According to John Collins, who knew Fela in the 1970s and is the author of Fela: Africa's Musical Warrior , published next month: 'In his songs [Fela] went much further than the usual round-up of protest singers such as Bob Dylan, James Brown or Bob Marley. Fela's songs not only protested against various forms of injustice but often fiercely attacked specific agencies and members of the Nigerian government.' His targets even included the US multinational International Telephones and TeleCommunications, on 'International Thief Thief (ITT)'.</p> <p>In 1978, Fela had set up an organisation called Movement For The People and said he wanted to run for president but the authorities kept him off the ballot by various legal stratagems. I asked him, when we met, if he thought he could ever be president of Nigeria. 'Spiritually speaking, every human being has a destiny and a duty to perform,' he said. 'No African has ever seen anything like me - they see me sticking to my guns through all the violence.</p> <p>'In the last military regime I was the only one to speak out against the government and the army. Anything could happen in Nigeria. If they get to the point that everyone trying to rule the place isn't making any headway they might drop their guard and ask, \"Fela, do you want to rule us today?\"'</p> <p>So what sort of regime would he run?</p> <p>'It would be a cultural and spiritual revolution. Every individual would feel like a president - nothing would obstruct people getting what is due to them.'</p> <p>THE FUMES IN THE ROOM WERE GETTING thick. I was trying not to look at his wives, nor seem that I was deliberately not looking at them. Also in 1978, to mark the anniversary of the pillage of Kalakuta, he married 27 of his dancers simultaneously. Fela claimed this was a traditional Yoruba ceremony, although some priests disputed this, pointing out that no bride prices were paid, and there is a suggestion that some sort of immigration scam was also involved. It was certainly a fabulous publicity stunt, although as DJ Rita Ray, who now runs a Fela-inspired club called Shrine in London, points out, 'Dancers weren't held in high esteem, so his argument was that he was making them respectable. He was wild, but very progressive.'</p> <p>In our meeting, I asked him about the importance of sex. 'Sex is one of the most important things in life, man. It's Christianity and Islam that have made sex immoral. People should be proud to say, \"I had a fantastic fuck last night.\" When a minister in Britain has an affair he loses his job. If a minister in Africa fucks 400 women no one will even notice him, you know.'</p> <p>In songs such as 'Lady' and 'Mattress' the impression he gave was that women were inferior. 'I'm not saying that women should not be political leaders,' he said. 'Women can do what they want - but once she's married in Africa she can't do anything against her husband's will. If a woman doesn't like a man she should find another - that's why polygamy is so fantastic... An African man should not do anything called housework or cooking...' But, Fela, cooking can be fun, I persisted. 'I can cook, I had to as a student in London. But if I have a party and do cooking, people call me a 'Less Man'. I don't see why I should go against the cultural values of my people.'</p> <p>So what is the gay scene like in Lagos? 'I've seen a few boys behave like sissies, you know. I found they had gone to England and been corrupted. If you are gay in Africa no one must know about it - they will stone you to death, man.'</p> <p>Fela claimed Aids was a 'white man's disease', but he caught the virus and died from complications on 2 August, 1997, at the age of 58. At the time we met, 12 of his 27 wives remained - he told me he employed a rota system to keep them satisfied - but following a 27-month jail sentence that began later that year (on a trumped up charge of currency smuggling) he divorced them all. 'Marriage brings jealousy and selfishnessness,' he was quoted as saying. His manager, Rikki Stein, maintains 'sex was where his inspiration came from, and considering the number of great albums he made... In the Eighties, on tour, I witnessed fur-wrapped beauties queuing up for their turn...'.</p> <p>Fela's last song had been called 'C.S.A.S (Condom Scallywag and Scatter )', which described the use of condoms as 'un- African'. To the end, Fela refused to be tested to determine the cause of his weight loss and skin lesions. After much discussion among the family after his death, his brother, Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, publicly disclosed the cause, paradoxically enabling, as one commentator put it, 'Aids awareness in Nigeria to leave the dark ages'. In that sense, Fela's death helped save a lot of lives, although it's impossible to know how many women he himself put in mortal danger by his wilful denial of his disease. Stein says 'one or two women in Fela's entourage became ill, though I don't know whether it had anything to do with Fela. All the rest are still going strong, as I understand it. They say it was Aids. I say that he died of one beating too many. He was a giant of a man, but a man nevertheless.' It might otherwise be observed that it was a wilful contrariness - the same impulse that always animated Fela - that ultimately killed him.</p> <p>More than a million mourners filled the streets of Lagos. Towards the end of his life, as his energy waned, Fela was less involved with political crusades. Nonetheless, according to Femi Kuti: 'For two days, people didn't do any work in Lagos! This is the first time in the history of Lagos they have not had a complaint of robbery, rape or anything. Because all the robbers, the bad boys, they loved him, you know? Everybody was busy at the funeral.'</p> <p>One irony is that Fela, if anything, is more popular world-wide than when he was alive - his music is sampled by producers like Timbaland (on Missy Elliott's 'Watcha Gonna Do'), while Damon Albarn voted 'Zombie' the 'sexiest ever track' in a recent poll. In fact, the Blur singer is now working in Lagos on a project with Tony Allen.</p> <p>And Femi Kuti carries the family torch with his own band, Positive Force, while another son, Seun - a recent graduate of the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, the 'fame academy' endowed by Paul McCartney - fronts a version of Fela's old group Egypt 80.</p> <p>I spoke to Seun on the day he was supposed to be at his graduation ceremony, where he would have met Sir Paul. Instead, Seun - who's anti-marriage, and pro-dope, rebellion and black consciousness - leapt on a plane to Lagos. He said he had better things to do.</p> <p>Fela Kuti's biographer Michael Veal worried that 'Fela's message of African empowerment became increasingly intertwined with dominant racist stereotypes of the African as vulgar, intoxicated, primitive, hypersexualised and indigenous mystic.'</p> <p>For the 20-year old Seun, his father 'was a gift, an inspiration to Africa there will never be another like him. But things in Nigeria are even worse now, and however hard it is to live up to his legacy, we have to carry on the fight for liberation and consciousness'. Both Positive Force and Egypt 80 will be appearing at the Barbican's Fela Kuti season.</p> <p>Did Fela ever fail himself? It is not likely that he ever felt that way, he told me he was a fatalist. 'Even death doesn't worry me, man. When my mother died it was because she finished her time on earth. I know that when I die I'll see her again, so how can I fear death?'</p> <p>'So what is this motherfucking world about? I believe there is a plan.... What I am experiencing today completely vindicates the African religions.... I will do my part... then I'll just go, man. Just go!'</p> <p>'Black President', a season of events celebrating the music, art and legacy of Fela Kuti, is at the Barbican Centre, London EC2, 9 September until 24 October.

  "<p>Great Britain's shooting medal hopes now lie with Richard Faulds after Sydney hero Ian Peel was left to rue the clay that got away as his Athens Olympic dreams disappeared into a cloud of shotgun smoke. </p> <p>Peel, who won silver in Australia four years ago, missed out on the chance to end his Olympic career with another medal after failing to qualify for the trap final today. </p> <p>Any British medal claims in shooting can now only rest with double trap Sydney gold medallist Faulds, who opens the defence of his crown on Tuesday. </p> <p>The 46-year-old Peel gave an honest assessment of his performance, admitting he \"didn't shoot good\", but cited a defining moment in his second round of qualifying yesterday which he believed ultimately decided his fate. </p> <p>Looking to recover from missing two of his 25 targets during the opening round in searing heat at the Markopoulo shooting range on Saturday morning, the Yorkshireman was on course for a faultless second session, until he second-guessed the final clay wrongly and missed. </p> <p>\"It was a big disappointment. That target cost me dearly, I felt it was the one target that really set my day up,\" said Peel. </p> <p>\"It put me so far back that I really couldn't recover from that moment.\" </p> <p>As he was winding up to end the second of five rounds, Peel thought the clay disc would fly out of the trap to the left, but instead it went straight, and the surprise caused his two shots to miss. </p> <p>\"You don't know what the targets will be but after a while you can work out the sequence,\" explained Peel. </p> <p>\"I thought it was a left-hand target but it was a straight one and it was a big disappointment then because one thrown-away target at that stage was too much to have. </p> <p>\"It meant from that moment on I probably needed to shoot 99 of the next 100 to have a chance and it's always going to be a tough act in these conditions.\" </p> <p>It was a sad way for the likeable Peel, a man who is often referred to as the last of the great amateurs, to end his Olympic career. </p> <p>\"I'd have liked to have gone out shooting a better performance than this but at the end of the day I can only go out and try my best and it wasn't to be,\" said Peel, who reiterated that he would not be competing at Beijing in 2008. </p> <p>\"I could go on for another four years but I'm 46 now, I've been to three Olympics and I'm the oldest shooter here. </p> <p>\"I think I've been doing it so many years my family has suffered in some respects because we haven't had a holiday. It's time to give a little bit back to them. </p> <p>\"I'm not giving it up completely, I'm still going to shoot back in the UK and hopefully pass on my experience and knowledge to some of the juniors we have.\" </p> <p>A textile quality control manager, Peel commuted between his home and the events at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, and he only trains on the weekends due to the fact that the East Yorkshire Gun Club - where he trains - is 100 miles away. </p> <p>Peel freely admitted that this was a disadvantage to him and to compete at the highest level these days, shooters need to be professional. </p> <p>\"You're going to struggle to be honest as an amateur,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think it's still possible as shooting is one of those sports that doesn't lend itself to being full time really. </p> <p>\"But I think to compete you have to be shooting at least five days a week. </p> <p>\"Prior to this event, you could say I was at a disadvantage to the other competitors because I only shoot at weekends and not every day of the week. Some of these guys are full-time professional shooters and I'm not.\" </p> <p>Great Britain's other trap contender Ed Ling hit three less targets than his senior team-mate, ending five rounds of qualifying with figures of 113 from 125. </p> <p>The 21-year-old, who was competing in his first Olympics, was a picture of dejection at the end, but Peel had some words of consolation for his young team-mate. </p> <p>\"Ed Ling has had a lot of pressure on him in the build-up to the Games and he's done well for a first Olympics,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I went to Seoul in 1988 and didn't win a medal, that was my learning curve. </p> <p>\"I'm sure Ed will be representing Great Britain for many years to come.\" </p> <p>Russian Alexei Alipov claimed the trap gold with an astonishing 149 from 150 targets. Italy's Giovanni Pellielo took silver with 146, and Adam Vella of Australia put Sydney gold medallist Michael Diamond in the shade, claiming bronze with 145.</p>",
  "<p>It's just over a year since Mervyn King assumed the throne at the Bank of England. In that time, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has had something of a monetary makeover, if not the full-blown nip and tuck. </p> <p>Some of these changes have been imposed from the outside, such as the new target for inflation. </p> <p>But the biggest area of controversy, say some influential City voices, has come in how the monetary policy committee (MPC) functions. Is the still newish Bank of England governor more autocratic monarch than philosopher King?</p> <p>No Room for Mavericks in Mervyn's Kingdom is the title of a concise report analysing the remarkable unanimity of votes on the MPC under the new regime. The Bank has tried to dismiss it as silly season tittle-tattle. But the authors are the respected economists at Roger Bootle's consultancy, Capital Economics. </p> <p>'King was a dominant member of the committee even before his appointment, and his elevation may have increased his influence over other members even further,' says Jonathan Loynes, author of the report. </p> <p>King's tenure has coincided with an unprecedented lack of dissent on the committee. Only once in the past year has more than one member voted against King. Five of the last six meetings have produced unanimous votes. 'The last year has seen the highest degree of unity in voting behaviour since the committee gained control of interest rates in mid-1997,' says Loynes. </p> <p>The coincidence is irresistible. The elevation of the dominant intellectual voice within economics, and on the MPC to the top job at the Bank, and then a year of unprecedented unity. Does the King walk into the committee room and dictate his economic genius to the eight other members? That certainly wasn't the modus operandi of Eddie George. </p> <p>King told me that nothing had changed: 'I've been on the committee since its inception and I don't really see any change in the way the arguments are discussed. What matters is the vigour of the debate on the committee and the issues that are debated and the fact that all the relevant considerations that ought to go into a decision are taken on board and discussed thoroughly. So I don't see the impact of the votes as being as important as the quality of the debate.' </p> <p>But Loynes points to one reason why the vigour of the debate may have waned a little. He says there is a lack of maverick independents to compare with committee rebels from the past, such as DeAnne Julius, Sushil Wadhwani, and Willem Buiter. Few would argue with that assessment. </p> <p>But one current member, the respected former LSE professor and BoE chief economist Charlie Bean, says the intensity of debate remains as strong as ever. </p> <p>'I can only endorse that [Mervyn King's assessment],' he says, before realising he is slightly proving the point about unanimity. 'I really would emphasise the point that the vote is not a measure of the degree of vigour of the debate actually in the committee room - what really matters is that we're testing out the alternative arguments and so forth.' </p> <p>Paul Tucker, another MPC member and a Bank of England high-flier, says: 'I think people should be in no doubt that the incentives to get it [the vote] right yourself are incredibly powerful, and that I'm sure is true for the other eight [MPC members].' </p> <p>But all three concede that the past year has seen a previously unknown unanimity. Should we worry? King says it's a function of where we are in the interest-rate cycle. </p> <p>'If, at a very low level of interest rates, you form a judgment that it's time to make a change, then it's a lot easier to agree that rates need to go up than when you get to a level where its much harder [even] to be confident about whether a change is needed,' he says. </p> <p>He draws a parallel with the beginning of the MPC in 1997, when the committee 'was unanimous for seven months in a row because we started at a level of rates thought to be too low'. </p> <p>And King says that his love of the committee method of decision-making is rooted in empirical academic economics. He gave a speech in 2002 which proved, using experiments on LSE students, that decision-making is superior when made collectively. </p> <p>'I genuinely feel that committees where individual's votes are accountable make better decisions than any one individual. And I think the committee is working extremely well.' </p> <p>Loynes believes that it is self-evident, particularly during this time of uncertainty over the housing market and hikes in interest rates, that votes should have been more greatly contested: 'It is perhaps striking that there has not been more disagreement between members over the appropriate timing and extent of the rate hikes.' </p> <p>But he also makes the point that perhaps none of this should really matter. No one really doubts that King was the best man for the job and that he knows more than mere TV reporters about house prices, the short-run Philips curve and monetary policy's long and variable lags. </p> <p>And perhaps, given the tricky task of gently bringing Britain's debt-fuelled shopping and property binge to its heel, a squabbling committee is the last thing the economy needs. </p> <p>But behind the words there is no doubt that the character of the Bank's monetary policymaking has changed. Much less formal emphasis appears to be placed on the quarterly inflation report, except as a communication tool. Most of the communication is done through words, hints, and speeches - such as this summer's 'warning' on house prices. </p> <p>King has also adopted a new trick - emphasising the inflation projections which use the market expectations of the Bank's rate decisions. An arcane statistic, perhaps, but also a subtle way of generating headlines that suggest rates are close to a peak. </p> <p>This move has been made possible by another of King's innovations - his adoption of a souped-up, state-of-the-art economic model. In turn that may well have had a profound impact on the Bank's assumptions about the 'neutral level' of interest rates. Only two years ago King suggested that a base rate of 4 per cent was 'well below any likely long-run neutral rate and implied a continuing inflationary stimulus'. </p> <p>As this paper suggested last year, the new model means that 'the calculation of the neutral rate could plausibly be lower, suggesting interest rates may eventually settle nearer to 5 per cent, than 6 or 7 per cent'. Which is basically what we got from King last week. </p> <p>It's a way of conducting monetary policy which is distinctly different from before - closer to the Alan Greenspan way of doing business through exercises in mass psychology. As long as it works, few will complain. But the Old Lady has definitely had a makeover. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:faisal.islam@itn.co.uk\">Faisal Islam</a> is business reporter of Channel 4 News and The Observer's former economics correspondent.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Charley blew out of Florida yesterday leaving death and destruction in its wake. </p> <p>The storm had battered the US coast with an unexpected wind force and a 15ft-high surge of seawater that destroyed airports, hospitals and homes. Initial estimates of fatalities ranged from 'dozens' to more than 200. It was the worst storm to hit the state in more than 40 years and knocked out power in 1.3million homes and businesses as it swept from southwest Florida to the Atlantic coast at Daytona Beach. President George W. Bush declared it a major disaster area. </p> <p>In Punta Gorda, a town of 15,000 people 70 miles south of Tampa Bay on Florida's south-west coast, took the most savage hit with winds estimated at more than 145 mph. The local sheriff's office said '60 body bags' had been requested but as rescue teams with lifting machinery arrived at Punta Gorda and its neighbouring Gulf coast towns of Fort Myers and Port Charlotte, officials said that it was too early to know how many had died although 25 morticians with refrigerated trucks had been called in. There are 31 mobile home parks in Punta Gorda alone, at least two with up to 1,000 residents each. </p> <p>The director of emergency services in the area, Wayne Sallade, said it would take days to trace those still unaccounted for. 'We believe there is significant loss of life,' he said. </p> <p>Many residents are retired people living in mobile homes who decided not to leave after Charley was estimated at force two. In fact, it struck with unexpected ferocity at force four. </p> <p>Computer predictions had also wrongly predicted Charley - which had already killed three people in Cuba and one in Jamaica - would hit the land in the Tampa Bay area and nearly two million people were urged to leave their seaside homes and head inland. But Charley swung south and drove across country for Orlando, the centre of the Disney tourist complex, and one of the areas to have attracted the largest number of evacuees. The area was also hit simultaneously by tornadoes. </p> <p>'This is beautifully terrifying,' said Evan Lyon, 21, a Canadian tourist, as he filmed from the entrance area of the Renaissance Hotel. 'It's kind of fun but it's probably different if you live here.' Lyon, like many in the hotel, had been evacuated from Tampa. </p> <p> The Fitzpatrick family, from Jordanhill in Glasgow, said that they had also been evacuated to Orlando from their holiday location in Longboat Key to the north of Port Charlotte only to find that the storm had followed them. They watched it lashing past from the hotel entrance. 'It was better than Disney,' said Christine Fitzpatrick. </p> <p>Earlier in the week, the Florida Governor Jeb Bush he had declared a state of emergency and mobilised the National Guard. Yesterday Jeb Bush predicted that the cost of the damage would reach at least around $15 billion. One of the most comprehensive casualties was the airport at Lake Wales. </p> <p>More than two million peo ple in the state lost power as Charley reached Daytona Beach on the state's Atlantic coast. Charley then headed for South Carolina as it left Florida, prompting further evacuations. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> At the same time on the other side of the world, rescue workers in eastern China were still searching for the victims of massive typhoons that hit on Thursday, killing 115 people and injuring more than 1,800. </p> <p>Residents in the rice-growing province of Zhejiang woke up to power outages, uprooted trees and collapsed houses after Typhoon Rananim cut a swathe of destruction with torrential rain and gale-force winds. More than 40,000 buildings were knocked down. </p> <p>'The power supply has still not yet resumed in all parts of the city. It's hot and humid outside,' a nurse at the Taizhou city Central Hospital said. </p> <p>The storm has weakened and moved inland to the province of Jiangxi, but the death toll is expected to rise, officials had said. </p> <p>More than 8.6 million people had been affected by the storm. Most were injured by shattered glass or buried under collapsed houses, doctors said. </p> <p>Officials had evacuated more than 460,000 people from coastal areas of Zhejiang province to escape the storm. </p> <p>The typhoon caused more than 15.3 billion yuan (\u00a31billion) damage in direct economic losses, the official Xinhua news agency quoted the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters as saying yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's Tracy Hallam produced one of the shocks of the Olympics with a stunning performance to knock out defending champion Camilla Martin and reach the quarter-finals of the badminton tournament. </p> <p>With a display of power, control and sheer courage worthy of any Games, the 29-year-old, competing in her first Olympics, found her very best form when it mattered most to edge out the Dane 11-2, 5-11, 13-10. </p> <p>\"I am thrilled with that,\" said Hallam. \"Even in the first few points of the game I knew I was feeling good. </p> <p>\"I just wanted to focus on my control and making sure I kept safe, which has perhaps been a problem for me in the past. </p> <p>\"I was quite tired in the yesterday's game and it was hard work again out there today but now I am in the quarter-finals.\" </p> <p>The opening set saw total dominance from the British No.1 as she made the seventh seed appear decidedly ordinary. </p> <p>But Hallam visibly tensed in the second set with the realisation of what she might be about to achieve and allowed Martin back into match.</p> <p>The deciding set was a question of fitness. </p> <p>The Dane, who was peerless in Sydney four years ago, has been injured for five months of this year and in the heat it seemed that Hallam would have the upper hand. </p> <p>And in the end it proved to be the case but not before Martin had demonstrated the qualities that had taken her to the Olympic title. </p> <p>Three times she held match points at 10-9 but Hallam's fighting spirit never dulled and she levelled the match before securing victory in the tie-breaker of three extra points. </p> <p>\"Even at the change of ends, when I was down, I kept trying to think of it as the start of a new set with everything to play for and not as though I was coming to the end of the match. </p> <p>\"I have nothing to lose in the quarter-finals. I am the underdog again and so I can just go out there and play my own game without any pressure.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Britain's main medal hope, the mixed-doubles pairing of Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms cruised through their opening match in straight sets. </p> <p>The fourth seeds, who are hoping to emulate Simon Archer and Jo Goode who won bronze in Sydney, were rarely troubled on route to the last eight beating the German pair of Bjoern Siegemund and Nicol Pitro 15-11, 15-4.</p>",
  "<p>The fact that we have finally been treated to some sunshine is likely to enhance our appetite for salads. Few would doubt that salads offer a good deal from a nutritional perspective. However, where flavour is concerned, I reckon that what turns a good salad into a really great one is the dressing. </p> <p>Unfortunately, conventional wisdom dictates that the oily nature of traditional dressings does not bode well for our waistlines or weight, and such fat-phobia has spawned an ever-expanding number of low-fat and even 'fat-free' dressings. However, as I explained in a previous column, review studies have found that long-term low-fat eating is quite ineffective for the purposes of weight loss. Research has also revealed that fat can actually enhance the nutritional value of the food we eat. </p> <p>Specifically, studies have shown that fat aids and abets our ability to extract and absorb carotenoid nutrients such as betacarotene (found in many green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables) and lycopene (found primarily in tomatoes). The role that fat plays in the extraction of carotenoids from food was most recently assessed in a study published this month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. </p> <p>Researchers measured the levels of three carotenoids (betacarotene, alphacarotene and lycopene) before and after the consumption of a mixed salad accompanied by either a fat-free, reduced-fat or full-fat dressing. Researchers found that eating salad with a fat-free dressing did not lead to a significant rise in the levels of any of the carotenoids measured. </p> <p>However, when the salad was eaten with a reduced-fat dressing, there were appreciable rises in the levels of all three nutrients. What is more, the full-fat dressing boosted carotenoid levels significantly higher than the fat-reduced variety. The reason for this is not known for certain, though it has been suggested that fat assists the release of carotenoids from food and eases their passage through the gut wall into the bloodstream. </p> <p>Whatever the precise mechanism, the effect undoubtedly promises significant benefits to our health: carotenoids have been found to offer an array of beneficial biochemical actions for the body, and a mass of evidence now exists which suggests that they have considerable cancer-protective properties. </p> <p>When it comes to choosing an oil for a dressing, I prefer cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil. Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fat, which can bring benefits for the heart and circulation. The oil is extracted with minimal processing and with no application of heat - factors that are believed to help preserve its innate healthy properties.</p> <p><strong>Nutrition news</strong><br>Atherosclerosis is the name given to the process in which cholesterol-like substances deposit themselves on the inside of the body's arteries. Atherosclerosis in the vessels supplying blood to the brain (the carotid arteries) increases the risk of problems such as stroke and dementia. In a recent study, researchers assessed the effects of drinking pomegranate juice in a group of people with confirmed carotid atherosclerosis. The pomegranate fruit contains a variety of 'antioxidant' compounds (including phenolic substances, tannins and anthocyanins), one effect of which is to protect cholesterol from oxidation, thereby reducing its tendency to be deposited on the inside of the arteries. Individuals drinking 50mls of pomegranate juice each day enjoyed an average 35 per cent reduction in the extent of their carotid atherosclerosis over the course of a year. </p> <p>In comparison, those not having pomegranate juice (the control group) saw an average increase in the extent of their carotid atherosclerosis of 9 per cent. This study suggests that regular consumption of pomegranate may stimulate important anti-atherosclerotic actions within the body.</p>",
  "<p><strong>If it's your birthday this week:</strong> Although Leos are known to act high-handedly - don't apologise, it's the royal gene - they also take their share of flak. Steadfast loyalty to partners, friends and causes is admirable, but open to abuse - outworn allegiances drop painlessly from your orbit in December and January. April stretches you with new interests and acquaintances. Choose financial advisers with care; money from the past may be there to be grabbed. Happy returns. </p> <p><strong>Leo 23 Jul-22 Aug:</strong> You gotta have heart. Belonging to the sign of the Lion, every Leo knows as much. Tomorrow's early hours new Moon asks that you duly honour the passions lurking in that literal and mythical organ. Put off big decisions until dawn and make a resolution. With several planets in the sector of your scope to do with values and property, it's time to get super-organised with more prosaic matters - get aggressive with your accounts, or even your accountant (poor chap, being savaged by a Leo).</p> <p><strong>Virgo 23 Aug-22 Sep:</strong> Analysis and criticism are Virgo's thing, but with assertive Mars heavily involved in your dealings this week, you'd best not start pointing any fingers unless you are prepared to do something about what you find wrong. It's quite a time for hellos, goodbyes and personal encounters; use your discrimination to decide who's offering what during the coming weeks, as you tumble into one of the most intriguing and potentially profitable patches of your year.</p> <p><strong>Libra 23 Sep-23 Oct:</strong> Tuesday's new Moon falls in the sector of your scope concerned with society at large; a suitable moment to re-address your relations with the gang/fellow MPs/Masonic lodge. Gatherings on Thursday and Friday find you in superb form. The more you can discover what's going on behind the scenes the better; secrecy is a theme in your 'scope for several weeks. </p> <p><strong>Scorpio 24 Oct-21 Nov:</strong> Potentially crazy, jumbled-up week incoming. As your planetary ruler, warrior Mars, is mixed up (indeed, mixing it) with several other planets, a degree of mayhem is to be expected in your public life. Nothing that a discriminating mind can't handle, but try and leave your emotions out of it before weighing in to the fray. Turn to the sweet, helpful people with whom you are truly tight.</p> <p><strong>Sagittarius 22 Nov-21 Dec:</strong> The principled cast of mind and wide-screen vision for which your sign is celebrated are symbolically renewed at tomorrow's new Moon. Make an appropriately large wish, especially if your birthday is 15 December. Good moment to be scudding across waves rather than slugging it out on the 9 to 5; if the latter's dominant, combine short-term compromise with that long view of yours. You'll find more equable climes at the weekend. </p> <p><strong>Capricorn 22 Dec-19 Jan:</strong> If you can stomach the go-slow of everyday tasks - cars and computers starting, for example - then this promises to be an exciting month or two. With Venus and Jupiter in play, your less austere appetites aren't going to be under much control - suppress the work addiction and indulge yourself. You have to keep the peace with the siblings, however, no matter how weirdly they are behaving. </p> <p><strong>Aquarius 20 Jan-19 Feb:</strong> Take Tuesday's new Moon as an opportunity to redefine your one-to-one relationships. These are heading for calmer climes, despite any evidence to the contrary this week; other people will be doing plenty of mind-changing in the weeks to come. It's better to mop up strictly practical issues than to apportion blame; property and financial matters are superbly starred, even if the actual contract would be best postponed until September. </p> <p><strong>Pisces 20 Feb-20 Mar:</strong> Many Pisceans (especially February-born Fish) have had quite a ride this year, and this week delivers another whammy of thrills and spills. A choice of kid gloves or boxing gloves is the deal when handling established relationships, be they best friends or open enemies. Any aggravation is a two-week wonder, however. As pleasure princess Venus is beaming your way, the more you duck any fight, the better.</p> <p><strong>Aries 21 Mar-19 Apr:</strong> Up for a challenge? Tomorrow's new Moon is a moment of renewal and resolve (especially for 13 April birthdays), when you plunge once more into the river of life and love. Make a wish and leap. By next weekend you're into muddier, more contrary waters, where your least-favourite virtue, patience, proves the most useful. Adopt dogged pragmatism. </p> <p><strong>Taurus 20 Apr-20 May:</strong> No one needs tell a Taurean not to rush, and, for once, slow-and-steady is the perfect approach for your most cherished plans. A squall of planets this week infuriatingly mixes interesting developments with snippy exchanges. When the rest of the team go into panic, rule by calm, thoughtful action. If you're more interested in your romantic life, there's fresh movement there, too - don't bother not rushing: grab it. </p> <p><strong>Gemini 21 May-20 Jun:</strong> Keep a steady nerve if the idiots who are in charge of your career are acting in what might charitably be called an unpredictable fashion. A planetary storm across your 'scope's career axis calls for a cool head and an awareness that things are wildly in flux for weeks yet. Mercury, your totem planet, is in retreat, making the recent past as important as the next leap forwards. </p> <p><strong>Cancer 21 Jun-22 Jul:</strong> After six relentless, bruising months, it is surely time for salve and healing. These seem to be on offer, with particular help from siblings - those you aren't squabbling with - and bosom buddies. Venus, the planet that is lightening your load, allows you to call in and grant favours and get mutually amicable. Retail therapy is another option, though probably more expensive than, say, a visit to the osteopath. It's a good week for healing.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Le Bouchon Bordelais, 5-9 Battersea Rise, London SW11 (020 7738 0307). Meal for two, including wine and service, \u00a380</strong></p> <p>Snails in garlic butter. Steak frites. Profiteroles. Let me repeat: snails baked in garlicky butter, the shells crusted with chopped parsley; steak cooked au point, seared without, purple within, chips and luscious bearnaise on the side; profiteroles of the lightest choux pastry, filled with a vanilla cream rich enough to invite the sanction of law. Just the sound of those dishes makes me feel warm in all the right places. I'm almost moved to make like Julie Andrews and give you a few choruses of 'My Favourite Things', but it might frighten the children. This is the problem, and the obscenity, of the job that I do: it cultures gastronomic ennui, much as babies culture colds. Yes, I have been thrilled by the promise of millefeuille of duck gizzard with chorizo-spiked puy lentils, say, or fillet of sea bass with oyster caramel dressing, pan-fried fiddleheads and shiitake mushrooms. Salt and pepper quail? Yes please. Crispy pig's spleen? Bring it on. But, inevitably, there comes a time when I crave the basics. It might be less than politically correct to say this, perhaps even grossly eurocentric, but in the restaurant game first position is the French bistro. Everything else derives from there. (No, really: according to Rebecca Spang's scholarly study The Invention of the Restaurant, the very first was opened in Paris by Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau in 1766.) Le Bouchon Bordelais in Battersea is a good French bistro, or at least, it is now. It hasn't always been this way. For a long while the food at this bar and restaurant and at its nearby sister, Le Bouchon Lyonnaise, was as ersatz as the nicotine-stained paint on the walls. The menus read right but they didn't always eat right. Recently, though, something wonderful happened. Le Bouchon Bordelais acquired a new partner in the business, Michel Roux, chef-patron of Le Gavroche in London's Mayfair. The Roux name is about as good as it gets in matters of British-French restaurants. It's like getting Wayne Rooney in to player-manage a bunch of Conference wannabes. Le Gavroche, opened in the Sixties by Michel's father and uncle, is as classy an operation as you can hope to find in Britain, making a virtue of the essentials done properly. Michel Roux Jnr has brought the same sensibility (though neither the complexity nor the prices) to bear on what is, essentially, a suburban operation. One of his former head chefs, Eric Landeau, is at the stove. Now the menu both reads right and eats right. I don't need to tell you what I had because it is there in the first line and it was as lovely as it sounds. The chips could have spent another 30 seconds in the fat, but I will forgive them this for the completely reliable execution of everything else. My wife had a starter of scallops in a light wine-based sauce, in an open puff-pastry case baked with care and precision, then leg of lamb with green beans and dauphinois potatoes, and a plate of perfectly kept cheeses to finish. The meat was of the very highest quality and the pricing fair: \u00a35-8 for starters, \u00a312-15 for all main courses, save for the Chateaubriand and cote de boeuf at \u00a334 each for two, which passed by on their carving boards, shyly surrendering the pink. My appetite for braised squirrel and crispy pig's spleen will come back, but for now, steak and chips does it for me. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Rhys Darby </strong>Pleasance </p> <p><strong> Stewart Lee</strong> Underbelly </p> <p><strong> Lucy Porter </strong> Assembly Rooms </p> <p><strong> David O'Doherty</strong> Gilded Balloon Teviot </p> <p><strong> Jim Sweeney </strong> Gilded Balloon Teviot </p> <p><strong> Helen Lederer</strong> Assembly Rooms </p> <p> If anyone had tried to describe <strong> Rhys Darby</strong>'s show, I probably wouldn't have gone to see it. They would have had to use such chilling words as 'physical theatre' or, more disturbing still, 'mime, with sound effects', which couldn't begin to do justice to this quirky and hugely enjoyable show. New Zealander Darby has created a futuristic version of the Jekyll and Hyde story in which he plays every character as well as the set and all the props. The sheer energy of his performance is astonishing, but this is more than mere clowning; deadpan asides, inventive twists and cameo roles all contribute to a strikingly imaginative and funny show. Even the fact that much of the story is set on a spaceship and is therefore heavy on the kind of Dr Who -type noises made by 10-year-old boys somehow doesn't detract. You could even take your children. </p> <p>Don't take children to see <strong> Stewart Lee</strong>, however. Not because he's too rude or too satirical, although he is, but because when he kicks off with a line about how 9/11 is actually 9 November, they will quite reasonably turn to you and ask why someone as good as Lee still thinks this is a joke worth using three years after it did the rounds of every playground and office water cooler in the land. </p> <p>This quibble aside, Lee's show is a masterclass in what the best stand-up can look like. With a fine balance between current affairs and fart jokes, self-mockery and derision of celebrities (Graham Norton is 'like a pink jackboot stamping on a human face for all eternity'), Lee, co-writer of Jerry Springer: The Opera, delivers so many good lines at such high density that the audience barely has time to keep up. The greatest target of his wrath is Ben Elton; rebutting comparisons for the musical thing, he asserts that more people like Osama bin Laden than Ben Elton, because bin Laden 'has at least lived his life to a consistent code of ethics'. </p> <p>This is Lee's 17th show at the Fringe; <strong> Lucy Porter</strong>, on the other hand, is only on her second full-length show. Last year, she was loved by audiences and critics and sold out. This year, her act is noticeably more developed and ought to get serious attention from the people with the fizzy water. She has retained the same engaging warmth and enviable ability to win the audience's affection from the outset with banter that mocks only in the way your best friend might. </p> <p>But her material is more carefully structured and substantial. She entirely disproves the theory that aggression is the root of all stand-up and shows that women can be funny without resorting to the blokey hectoring of a young Jo Brand or Jenny Eclair. She's so lively and smiley that her responses to the audience seem entirely unforced and spontaneous. When someone's phone rings, she says sweetly: 'It's nicer to turn them off, unless you're expecting a kidney.' Lady Luck is a sparkling show, and gives Porter a better showcase than does the hexed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, though she obliges the audience by performing her lines from that play at the beginning: 'No, no!' and 'Stay back!' </p> <p>One of the best recommendations for any show is the praise of fellow comedians, and <strong> David O'Doherty</strong>, a former winner of So You Think You're Funny and last year's Irish Comedian of the Year, is certainly one of this year's comics' comics. His laid-back but composed delivery, well-written lines and idiosyncratic slant on fairly standard subject matter - relationships, families, his own shortcomings - make for an accomplished Edinburgh debut, complete with original songs. But what marks him out is the same indefinable quality of warmth and comic presence that audiences and critics loved about Daniel Kitson when he started, a quality given to few, and which seems to be innate rather than learned. </p> <p><strong> Jim Sweeney</strong>'s show couldn't be described as stand-up by any stretch of the imagination, largely because he can't. Sweeney, stalwart of the Comedy Store Players and former star of Whose Line Is It, Anyway?, has had multiple sclerosis for 19 years, and has almost lost the use of his legs. Seated in a Ronnie Corbett-style chair, he delivers a candid, lively and entirely un-self-pitying account of the absurdities of living with an incurable illness. That may not sound like a laugh a minute, but My MS and Me is very much in the spirit of John Diamond's book about cancer; Sweeney doesn't gloss over the painful or humiliating aspects of his condition, but he does consistently find comedy in all the many instances of your body rebelling against you. </p> <p>There's the cruel misfortune of no longer being able to make a gun shape with his left hand, while holding one of the few jobs in which it's often necessary to do so. There's the problem of the wobbly walk being misunderstood. 'The MS Society make badges that say, \"I'm not drunk, I've got MS,\"' he explains. 'Unfortunately, I could never wear those badges.' The show is profoundly affecting as well as funny, but Sweeney dislikes being thought of as heroic. 'Particularly when well-wishers tell me I'm so brave, because if it was them they'd just go and fucking kill themselves.' </p> <p><strong> Helen Lederer</strong>'s spoof lifestyle show, Finger Food, also features plenty of pratfalls, though hers are deliberate. Her hapless presenter, Bella Le Pard, is a variation on her giggly character from Absolutely Fabulous, battling through an ill-fated television pilot with the help of a bottle of Blue Curacao and some amusingly shaped vegetables.

  "<p>At one end of a dusky, crusty, mosquito-ridden bit of scrubland on the outskirts of Turin, sits the spandex-clad epitome of glamour in a contemporary rock'n'roll style. He's a little glum. Two hours before he's due on stage to strut and frolic and squeak signature falsetto at a couple of thousand Italian fans, Justin Hawkins - singer and guitarist with the Darkness and the only man to make a catsuit make sense in 20 years - is downbeat. </p> <p>'Somebody stole our joy,' he says. He's pretending he's not entirely serious. He's drawing from his vast repertoire of arch, knowing, ironic devices, and employing a comedy nasal pastiche of his own (already quite nasal) speaking voice, so that the impact of what he's saying is lessened. But, on some level at least, he means it. </p> <p>'We had joy,' he goes on. 'Joy was what set us apart. It was the one true marketing angle we had. But somebody from the record company stole it.' He bangs a fist against the wooden trestle table directly in front of him. 'And now we want it back.' </p> <p>This is not the kind of thing you expect from the Darkness. Their public persona is uncontrollably upbeat. They wear their hearts and their dedication to debauched, extravagant fun on the sleeves of their lurid, sparkly stage wear. Their currency is haute camp and naked torsos and preposterous videos and lyrics like: 'My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel.' And that's only entry-level the Darkness. Multiply that by the past 18 months - by a multi-platinum album, four top 10 singles, a Brit Award and an Ivor Novello, an imminent headline at Reading, a besotted British public, and (incredibly, given its rep as virtually unassailable) an increasingly besotted American public - and the Darkness should be the all-singing, all-dancing, all-rocking embodiment of pure glee. And yet, right now, two-thirds of the way through a medium-successful tour of Europe, the overriding sentiment in the Darkness camp seems to be of angst. Angst, and some anger, and some bitterness, and quite a lot of spikiness. I know, because Justin and I are having conversations like this. </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>Are you having the time of your life? </p> <p><strong>JH: </strong>Not really. </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>Oh dear. Is there stuff you miss about life before you got successful, then? </p> <p><strong>JH (employing the silly nasal voice again):</strong> Yes. Enjoying it. Enjoying it. </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>So you're not enjoying it any more? </p> <p><strong>JH: </strong>I enjoy aspects of it. But the majority of it is bullshit. </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>For example? </p> <p><strong>JH (sneering): </strong>The interviews. (Dan, rhythm guitarist and Justin's self-contained, sensible and infinitely more on-message younger brother, shoots warning looks at his sibling across an espresso.) </p> <p><strong>Me (nervously): </strong>Ha ha!. </p> <p><strong>JH: </strong>I'm kidding. </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>Yeah, you're not though, are you? </p> <p><strong>JH: </strong>No. I'm not, actually. </p> <p>It wasn't always like this. Forty-eight hours earlier, when we first met, the Darkness were everything I hoped they would be. Drunk, grand and loquacious in the lobby of a once-glamorous hotel in downtown Turin. Admittedly, Frankie Poullain, mustachioed Scottish bandito of a bassist, had gone to bed uncharacteristically early, and Dan Hawkins had shaken my hand, had another beer, and then followed him up, at around 2am. But drummer Ed Graham, Justin, and their various 'people' are toying with a moderate version of late-night hedonism. Ed's boozing, fluidly and with determination, beating out the rhythms in his head on the armrest of a leather banquette, and inquiring after the possibility of fashion freebies. 'I've heard, if you just phone'em up, and tell 'em you want stuff, they'll give it to you.' </p> <p>Justin, meanwhile, has dropped the latest of a series of flaming Sambucca shots down the leg of the only pair of jeans he's brought with him. He has threatened to spin five square feet of glass table top on one finger, and even made valiant attempts to follow through, until the sterner factions of his entourage made it clear that he really, really shouldn't. He's made me watch his endless attempts to flick a fag off the back of one outstretched finger and into his mouth. 'Look! No, again! Look !' Now, he is outlining plans to take up the prime minister's office at the next election. His manifesto is severe, and involves sending disagreeable factions away overseas. 'It's going to take four years to get the next album together,' he estimates. 'I'll need something to do, you know, as a sideline. Andy?' He turns to his long-suffering PR. 'Sort it out for me.' And so it goes on. A rollercoaster of glamour and decadence-lite and outspoken, devil-may-care silliness. Justin holds court, and I am gratified. I'm giddy on the unadulterated rock-band-on-touriness of it all. I'm convinced that as promised, the Darkness in general and Justin in particular have come direct from Lowestoft in Suffolk, to save the music world from the damaging influences of self-conscious, precisely styled, Strokes-ified cool. </p> <p>The Darkness's back story is really rather life-affirming. Pop justice in action, if you like. Justin and Dan spent their formative years being snubbed and ridiculed by the hip kids of smalltown Suffolk. They were good at football, but bad at hiding their proclivities for Queen and power ballads, and so were never invited to take drugs underneath the pier with the cool set. Instead, they stayed in their bedrooms and taught themselves guitar. They formed various sixth-form bands together, and toured local pubs, until the more ambitious and driven Dan went to London, aged 17, to make music however and wherever he could. 'I was completely naive. I hadn't even been on a train on my own. I got to London, pulling my granny's shopping holdall full of clothes. At Liverpool Street instead of going to the ticket machine because that looked too intimidating, I went up to the bloke at the barrier to ask him. These two East End girls spotted me doing it, and ripped me off: \"I'll get you a ticket mate!\" Annoying. Then about a year later, I got mugged. So I've seen the best bits, and the worst bits.' </p> <p>But he found his way. 'You harden up quick. You learn how to walk the right way. And to wear clothes that suggest you might have a gun on you.' He became a session musician, and hooked up with Frankie Poullain and fellow Lowestoft survivor Ed Graham, to form Empire, a synth pop outfit, in 1999. Justin came to visit regularly, and flirted with the peripheries of the band, playing keyboard and guitar, while the others auditioned endlessly and fruitlessly for a lead singer. And then, on New Year's Eve 1999, Justin entered a karaoke competition at his aunt's pub in Norfolk. He did a version of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', employing the absurd, inspired falsetto he is now famous for, and performing with such outrageous panache that Dan realised they already had their frontman. The Darkness was born. It took another three years, some serious debt, and the unstinting support of Sue Whitehouse, their psychotically dedicated manager and Justin's girlfriend, before 'Growing on Me', the third release from their self-funded album Permission to Land, made the top 20. Within months, 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' was number one, an entranced Jo Whiley had played 'Get Your Hands Off My Woman' four times on Radio 1 before realising it had the word 'cunt' in it, and the British public had fallen in love with their arch lyrics, sincere guitar riffs and heady flamboyance. Even the realisation that the band was not - as had first been assumed - a gimmicky spoof act, did nothing to damage the sales or the reception at the festivals which the band toured exhaustively. Like Justin says: 'The tunes speak for themselves. You can't hear a catsuit.' So hoorah for the Darkness, who are finally living their dream. </p> <p>Yet by the time I meet them again, 12 hours later, on their tour bus en route to headline at the fabulously named Chicobum Festival, the angst has begun to surface. The atmosphere is subdued, a bit bleak, a bit tense. Sober and mildly hung over, the Darkness are a less hectic proposition than they were the night before. Dan is quiet, aloof and reserved. He sits at the back of the bus, reading schedules, fretting about the lack of pyros for the night's show. It's instantly apparent that his and Justin's sibling dynamic is completely skewed. It's Dan who pulls his older, lairier, infinitely less responsible brother back into line, time after time. (When Justin attempts to befriend a very nervy, wide-eyed Italian puppy backstage at a concert, Dan wearily says: 'Justin, if you're going to pet the dog, use your right hand, mate. Use your strumming hand.' If the dog bites that one, Dan reasons, Justin will still be able to play.) </p> <p>In the mid-section of the bus, opposite the holographic wallpaper of the kitchen area, Frankie Poullain reads a book. We're introduced. Frankie is smart, and considered, and quite gorgeously pretentious. He is inclined to say things like: 'A proper rock 'n' roll band should be a little bit hard to digest. A little bit ugly, and a little bit beautiful too,' at any moment. Ed is sitting next to Dan, watching Godzilla on DVD and eating his way through large bags of nachos. He is normal to the point of being ordinary. And then there's Justin, who emerges from his bunk to deride the pathetic technique of most interviewers. It's hard work. Hawkins is so perpetually arch that I truly don't think 'he' knows when he's being sincere any more. Every statement is tinged with knowing superciliousness. You want to say: 'What? 'Really'?' the whole time. </p> <p>We arrive at the Chicobum venue, circumnavigate a scattering of lacklustre female fans, and enter a specially demarcated section of field. And we wait. The build-up to the show is not the edgy, fluttery exercise in nerve-control that I anticipate. The stage - which they take everywhere with them - was erected hours ago, and now, there's not a lot to do. There's some aimless loitering. Justin does some alarming high-pitched squawking. There's some tea. 'Yeah,' says Justin. 'It's a bit like we're in a factory canteen, isn't it?' I watch the band being interviewed by a hapless Italian MTV VJ. Justin swears constantly, knowing, presumably, that it will make a lot of the tape un-broadcastable. Every time the VJ asks them a question that Justin or Frankie considers stupid or unnecessary or obvious, they look over at me and roll their eyes. It's a warning. Don't you be that obtuse, lady. A few flinty eyed Italian minxes in customised Darkness T-shirts attempt to fling themselves over the barricades and into band members' arms, but they're stopped. It starts to rain. </p> <p>Later, Justin plays a game of football with the crew, as is customary. A girl fan approaches him and asks if she can have her picture taken with him. He agrees, then stands too close to her, and she faints, which distracts him for a while. An ambulance is called. 'Beatlemania! Bit of Beatlemania there!' Justin mutters, half perplexed, half excited. 'It's just something girls do. I mean, look at me. These people wouldn't look twice, if I wasn't famous.' But there's an edge to this display of humility. 'He's definitely liking that a bit,' mutters Ed. Dan, meantime, is trying to buy a belt from a Chicobum organiser. 'Got a belt obsession,' he explains. 'She paid 15 euros for this one, and I want it. I've offered her 400, but she still says no. That's when you realise you get your own way too much, because it's put me in a right fucking mood.' </p> <p>Eventually, I sit down with Justin, Dan and Frankie to try and get to the source of what I'm beginning to identify as the Darkness's darkness. So how are you feeling? I ask. 'Angry,' says Frankie. 'We always were angry. There's a punk element to everything we do. Which seems ridiculous when you look at our videos. But the energy that drives us is definitely one of disgust at the way things are. The whole reason we started the band was to shake things up, do it with a certain attitude and a certain edge. But now, we're blunter than a pair of old scissors.' </p> <p>We've got caught up in the corporate machine,' spits Justin. 'We've done a lot of things that we knew in our heart of hearts we shouldn't have done, and we knew it was a waste of time, but we did it, and were proved correct on every level. After the Brits, we all got on a plane to go and do a TV show in Germany, when what we should have done, for our own sanity and health, is stay and acknowledge the achievement, have a big party and a big hangover the next day. When you push it to the extent that you're getting blood from a stone, your morale hits rock bottom, and your next record's shit. We all knew that would happen, and it is happening to us.' </p> <p>Dan attempts to say something along the lines of, it's not really all that bad, when you ignore the bullshit, it's actually the best job in the world, etcetera, but Justin interrupts. 'There are certain things you have to do,' he says, 'and a myriad of hoops you have to fucking jump through, to keep people happy. The one set of people's happiness that suffers a bit is ours, really.' </p> <p>But isn't it all phenomenally glamorous? At least, sometimes? 'The private jets are good. Although you can't smoke on some of them, which I find offensive,' says Justin. 'I know people who only smoke on private jets.' 'And you can't shit on the tour bus,' adds Dan. </p> <p>It's probably not the best moment to mention the next album, but I do anyway, just in case it inspires enthusiasm. I've heard rumours about an evolution in sound, a change in look. But they'll only really discuss it in abstract terms. 'We just need to get the hunger back, and we can do a better album,' says Frankie. 'An album that competes with the heavyweights - Guns 'n' Roses, Highway to Hell. We have to have the confidence not to be quite so wacky. People call it 'wackiness,' I prefer to call it wit.' 'The next album will be awesome, simple as that,' says Dan. 'Fucking awesome, or we won't release it.' </p> <p>The crowd are getting more insistent, the flinty-eyed minxes more inventive in their attempts to breach security. It's time. The Darkness traipse off to the dressing room, where Dan puts on the Thin Lizzy T-shirt that transforms him into a rock star, and Justin is sewed into his first catsuit, a fantastic leather affair that plunges almost to his groin, in the interest of exposing the flame tattoos that lick the bottom of his belly. Frankie wraps a scarf around his head, draping the trailing end over one shoulder, and generally does himself up like the drug dealer he's told me he once was. Ed puts on some more kohl. Then they form a huddle at the back of the stage, Madonna-stylee, while Abba's 'Introduction' booms over the PA, and the crowd scream enticements in broken English: 'Dark-Niss! DARK-NISS!' </p> <p>An hour and a quarter later, the show's over. There's no encore. How was that? I ask. 'It was good,' says Dan. 'Going through the motions,' thinks Frankie. 'We performed average. But it was below average in terms of audience reactions.' 'They didn't understand a single word I was saying,' adds Justin. 'It's arrogance though, to just turn up and try and talk to them in English. And also - ha ha! - at some pace.' </p> <p>We hook up again in Rome, where things take a turn for the worse. The Darkness are scratchier yet, following two hours sleep and a lot of drink. They're genuinely angry to discover that my hotel is nicer than theirs. 'We should fucking swap,' says Justin, and the perma-irony makes way for unadulterated resentment. 'We're paying for you to be here.' But there are occasions when the Darkness offer gleaming chinks of sweeter insight into themselves. I ask Justin what he couldn't do without, for example, and he replies: 'My bird. Yeah. My sweet lady woman wife. Sue. I don't think I'd be able to do it otherwise. I wouldn't be able to not have her to come home to, really. It would be too depressing.' They split up for a little while, he says, and it was the lowest point of his life. He got himself a Prince Albert piercing as a kind of punishment. </p> <p>There are other human moments. After the Rome gig, Frankie steals a platter of cheese and a bottle of wine from hospitality to take out to his mum, who is in the crowd. Ed gets asked for an autograph, then talks about his experiences at the hands of autograph-hunting German eBay professionals. 'They come up to me, right, and they go: [assuming comedy German accent,] 'Number four? Are you number four?' And I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm number four. Ha! You must be genuine fans\". But I don't mind. I'm only the drummer. Just sit at the back and drum.' </p> <p>And there's some surprising stuff. I ask them how they all stay thin. Dan says he's not thin, he's just tall. Frankie says he's been on a champagne and sushi diet. Justin, meanwhile, erupts at the suggestion. 'Ha ha! We don't keep thin at all! My weight fluctuates all the time! To the extent that I'm the ... what's her name ... Geri Halliwell of the band. Look at pictures of me two years ago, so thin I look ill. Three years ago, fat as fuck!' 'He's got tiny head syndrome,' confirms Dan. 'And I do find myself comfort eating sometimes. And throwing up and all that crap. It's not a thing that exclusively affects women. It's just that people notice it more with women. Karen Carpenter.' </p> <p>Very occasionally, the Darkness even inadvertently let on that they are still having fun. When Frankie catches me picking my way through the underwear that assorted fans have thrown on stage one night, he runs me through cultural divisions in lingerie throwing. 'There are always more bras and knickers on the stage in the States. Americans are more spontaneous. In the States, when a bra's thrown on stage, it's still warm, which means it's been actually taken off a body, whereas in Italy, it's cold.' Justin joins us. 'Yeah, they get their tits out in the States.' 'Higher boobie count, definitely.' 'Every where else, they take their bra off, but in the same way you might get changed into your swimming costume on the beach,' concludes Justin. 'The most embarrassing thing I had was two weeks ago, when I was gesturing at a big festival,' continues Frankie. 'I've got very bad eyesight, I should really wear glasses. So I was looking across at a long-haired skinny figure, who looked quite elegant, sitting on someone's shoulders, and I gestured they should take their top off and reveal their breasts. Which they did, and I realised it was a guy. And the whole crowd were looking over at me, like, huh? Looking from the guy to me. I probably should have learnt a lesson then. Look before you leap. No. Look before you leer.' </p> <p>But you'll only get 10-minute breaks of this kind of cheerfulness, before the angst and anger and preposterous arrogance kick back in again. After three days with the Darkness, I am beginning to think there's something to be said for just handing people success and recognition on a plate, in the style of Pop Idol. Then, at least, they're a bit bloody grateful. Clearly if, like the Darkness, you have to work at it for years before you earn recognition, you're going to wind up full of the bitter, chippy I-told-you-sos. I feel as if adversity and struggle and the comforting conviction that no one understood their true greatness defined and drove the Darkness. Now that's gone, they're left aimless, confused, and bad-tempered. </p> <p>And yet, when the Darkness get on stage, I forgive them quite a lot. Because they're truly good at that. Explosive, preposterous, and a little bit brilliant. Justin Hawkins is the outrageous prancing embodiment of any rock superlative you care to mention; a star, an unmistakeable, proper, card-carrying cliche of a star. Frankie and Dan are transluscent with glee. Even Ed's grinning uncontrollably. There's no trace of angst. At this precise point in their success trajectory, it seems that playing live is the one thing that still makes perfect sense to the Darkness.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Darkness headline the Reading and Leeds festivals on 27-28 Aug and will shortly announce a UK tour for November.</p>",
  "<p>With the rise in house prices putting many homes out of the reach of first-time buyers, those who want to get on the property ladder now need to think creatively. </p> <p>Former council houses are a well-kept secret in the property market and can still offer good value in areas where prices of more traditional homes have soared. You could also snap up a flat that is better built and more spacious than many new-build designs. </p> <p>Former local authority houses can be a good option for city dwellers and first-time buyers, although you need to choose your location carefully. High street lenders can still be reluctant to lend money for ex-council flats and houses on sink estates. </p> <p>There is also the possibility that blocks of flats and other properties with communal parts may need costly refurbishment or come with high service charges, although any decent conveyancing solicitor should find out about and flag up such an eventuality. </p> <p>Although Margaret Thatcher is probably most closely associated with allowing council tenants to buy their homes from 1980 onwards, the trend actually began in the 1970s. </p> <p>Since 1998 there have been about 90,000 council-home sales every year. Part of their popularity may have been due to rumours that the government was going to do away with the right to buy - speculation that has so far proved incorrect. </p> <p>There are some special considerations regarding former local authority property, says Jonathan Holland of the Transparent Group, a mortgage broking and property development group with offices in Northamptonshire and Gateshead. </p> <p>'First, traditional lenders are wary of giving a mortgage unless between 20 and 40 per cent of the estate is owner-occupied. This also applies if you are thinking of buying the property to let out. For example GMAC, a major buy-to-let lender, requires the percentage to be 40 per cent. Second, most lenders will not offer a mortgage on a prefab.' </p> <p>Most council properties were built from 1945 onwards and 20 per cent of these were prefabs - houses built in a factory and erected on site. They were only intended to last for 10 years, but there are still about 1.25 million prefab homes in Britain still standing and inhabited. </p> <p>Since they were not intended to be lived in for the long term, many lenders are uncomfortable about mortgages on these houses - even if you have a perfect credit history. </p> <p>One piece of good news is that some councils and developers are adding an outer brick skin to prefabs to make them more durable and allow people to raise a mortgage on them. </p> <p>While they are no longer quite the bargains they once were, council houses and flats still offer good value, particularly if you can benefit from what Holland calls the 'blotting-paper effect'. </p> <p>He says: 'As areas become gentrified, the effect spreads to adjacent areas: you could buy next to a good area and benefit from the rise in prices. It's a matter of doing your research, having some vision and seeing what the area offers.' </p> <p>Councils themselves are a useful source of information. They will give you all the information you need on what is happening in your chosen area and can provide details on regeneration and improvement projects on local authority estates. </p> <p>It's also important to think about the architectural quality of the property you are thinking of buying. Some council properties are well-built - for example the Alton estate close to Richmond Park in London. Others are just concrete jungles.</p> <p><strong>Right to buy?</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 1994 there were about 60,000 sales of council properties - this had risen to 90,000 homes a year by 1998 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> There are about 3.5 million homes still eligible to be bought by local authority tenants, out of a former total of about 5.5 million</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> About 1.5 million council homes have been sold off since the 1980 right-to-buy legislation</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For information on housing stock from your local council website, check out <a href=\"http://www.ukonline.gov.uk\">www.ukonline.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The heat is on and forest fires have started breaking out again in Portugal. Last summer was a particularly bad one: in one week, 60 fires were raging out of control and a state of national emergency was declared. In all, over 390,000 hectares of land were affected and 20 lives lost. </p> <p>One area prone to these fires and beloved by many Brits is the Monchique Hills region to the north of the Algarve coast. One homeowner was relaxing on a beach 20km from his home there when he noticed large pieces of ash falling from the sky. He looked up to see the sun a strange shade of red and a huge dark mushroom cloud of smoke enveloping the hills. </p> <p>'I tried to get back as quickly as I could, but the last stretch of road was a tun nel of flames,' he said. He lost his home, two caravans and five classic cars. </p> <p>For about 17 days last August the temperature was 5C above normal. 'It was so hot in Monchique, if you stepped outside the house you felt you couldn't breathe.' </p> <p>The combination of strong winds and temperatures of over 35C meant that it didn't take much for a fire to spread for miles, and the normally lush green forests looked like scenes from Dante's Inferno. In the Monchique area 50 houses were damaged. </p> <p>Many people had to evacuate their homes and in some cases watch them burn to the ground. But for the local fire services, saving homes is the next most important thing after saving lives. In one village, absentee British and Dutch homeowners were so grateful to them for saving their properties that they threw a party for them in a local restaurant. Others held fund raising events for the firefighters. </p> <p>While many of the British and German second-homeowners dusted themselves down and started again, oth ers decided to sell up and call it a day. With the wooded slopes looking rather forlorn, albeit temporarily, this could be a good time to acquire a farmhouse or mountain retreat. </p> <p>There is an interesting selection of rustic properties on the market. Unlike the cob buildings of the Algarve lowlands, most of the Monchique houses were built of stone, so they didn't burn to the ground. Cottages and farms in this area are more repairable, and builders in the Monchique area tend to be cheaper than on the coastal strip. </p> <p>Estate agency Gerontius specialises in country properties. It is currently selling a ruin high in the Monchique Hills with views across 15 miles to the coast. for \u20ac80,000 (\u00a355,200) It's attached to another cottage, but has an acre of land to itself. </p> <p>An old farmhouse set in 15 acres of wooded valleys, with its own lake and waterfall, is on the market for \u20ac185,000. The house will need complete renovation, but its setting is idyllic. </p> <p>Or what about a 450-acre estate with hills, valleys, streams, a lake, and four separate restorable houses? </p> <p>The land starts in its own private valley and rises up to the foothills of Monchique. It costs \u20ac1,650,000, but the sheer amount of land available ensures privacy and protection from future development. </p> <p>But if you choose to snap up one of these bargains, what can you do to safeguard your home? Not much if the wind chooses to send the fire in your direction. Even firebreaks cut into the forest to prevent spreading can be jumped by intense flames. </p> <p>So if you live in these areas you should clear trees and heavy growth from around your property, and ensure that flammable materials such as petrol are stored safely. Pick up any glass bottles you see lying around: sun shining through glass on to dried grass has been the cause of many fires. </p> <p>So will this year be as bad as last? There have already been a few serious fires, even though the Portuguese government has spent over \u20ac113 million on prevention measures. Large tracts of countryside have been cleared and firebreaks created to allow the rescue services access to the more remote houses. </p> <p>The army has been patrolling forest areas throughout Portugal, and campfires, barbecues and bonfires have been forbidden in the countryside for the summer months.</p> <p><strong>More information</strong></p> <p> All properties through <a href=\"mailto:gerontius@clix.pt\">Gerontius</a>, tel +351 282353659</p> <p>Property surveys and supervision of renovation works through chartered surveyor <a href=\"mailto:cape9@clix.pt\">Caroline Thomas</a>, tel +351 917735917</p>",
  "The suicide of Adam Rickwood, at Hassockfield secure training centre in County Durham, is the latest in a list of tragedies for children in the penal system. Adam, the 25th child to die since 1990, was 14 when he hanged himself, becoming the youngest person in memory to die in custody in Britain. There are many disturbing factors. His mother, and other family members who regularly travelled hundreds of miles to visit him, say they had asked that Adam, who had a history of self-harm, should be placed on suicide watch. <p>And yet he became the second child in four months to die in one of the secure centres supported by the Youth Justice Board. In comparison to much-criticised young offender institutions, the three privately run units, and a fourth, due to be opened next year, were designed to provide safe, productive and humane custody for a growing number of vulnerable children. A total of 2,637 under-18s are in secure detention, compared with 1,769 last November; the number of juveniles in custody has doubled in a decade. </p> <p>Such statistics, and the alarming number of suicides, have too few official repercussions. In a week in which Michael Howard reheated his creed that prison works and ministers touted headline-grabbing legislation to stop rapists winning the lottery, worrying new rules covering children in prison caused no stir. The Howard League warns that, under an order to come into effect next month, youngsters can be routinely strip-searched and may be locked up in their cells for longer and get less education. It is time, instead, for children to be treated in full accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and for the Children Bill going through Parliament to be amended according to tenets of redemption and humanity. </p> <p>Children of 14 and under should not be tried in an adversarial system designed for adults. Those who need to be held securely should be placed in local authority care, not in institutions that mimic adult jails and whose location keeps young teenagers in despair miles from their families. The Home Secretary should bow to pressure to hold a full inquiry into the death of Joseph Scholes, whose suicide, at 16, in Stoke Heath young offenders' institution, raises many questions about child custody. When the divide between vulnerability and criminality is a hair's breadth, there can be only one guiding principle. The desire to punish children must never eclipse their right to life.</p>",
  "They defined suburbia. Closely trimmed front lawns fringed by neatly clipped privet hedges have provided the showcase for Britain's middle-classes to display their horticultural prowess. <p>These precious squares of turf are now under siege, however. Entire streets of Victorian terraced housing and Thirties semis have lost their grass and seasonal blooms. Hundreds of thousands of front gardens lie smothered beneath a tide of asphalt laid to create spaces to park Britain's 32 million cars. </p> <p>Until now the trend has provoked anger on purely aesthetic terms. But government advisers are warning that the disappearance of the suburban front garden threatens millions with far more serious consequences and could ultimately help to bring Britain's major towns and cities to a grinding halt. </p> <p>They say the loss of front lawns is exacerbating the threat of widespread flooding following thunderstorms similar to those of recent weeks. Updated advice from the Environment Agency urges home owners to 'resist laying concrete or Tarmac over the whole' of front gardens. </p> <p>Front lawns provide a vital natural sponge for rainwater in urban areas. Without them, rain simply runs off driveways, increasing the likelihood of downpours overwhelming antiquated sewerage systems. The widespread flooding that followed the recent downpours, when millions of gallons of water were dumped on towns and cities in a few hours, offers a pointer to what will come. </p> <p>A fetid stench still hovers above the Thames after heavy rains last week again exposed London's dwindling cover of foliage. As much as 600 million litres of faeces and waste have made their way into the river. In response, the government's environment watchdog is telling homeowners across the UK to resist paving their gardens entirely. </p> <p>Councils such as that in Leicester are advising residents to keep their front gardens 'green'. Leading architects are concerned that the growing number of driveways are storing up problems. </p> <p>Robin Nicholson, a mem ber of the government-funded Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, describes the loss of lawns and flower beds as 'a lazy' solution to parking shortages: 'We know converting front gardens is leading to flooding and a number of local authorities are increasingly aware of this. We need to look at other solutions.' </p> <p>The environmental concerns do not end there. The loss of sunlight-absorbing plants can intensify the 'heat island effect', making the centre of cities several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside. </p> <p>Some London boroughs receive more than 1,000 applications a year from homeowners wanting to lower the kerbs outside their houses so that they can drive their cars right up to their front doors. In the affluent London borough of Kingston, 350 residents have applications in to convert their front lawns into parking areas. Councillors expect to approve three-quarters of these, with officials admitting a 'steady rise' in recent years. </p> <p>Horticulturalists believe that unless efforts are made to save the front garden as an institution, it will become a rarity. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is so concerned it is contemplating issuing advice to its 350,000 members on how they can build a parking space while retaining a colourful garden. </p> <p>Geoff Stokes, secretary of the National Society of Allotments and Leisure Gardeners, is among the homeowners whose front garden offers a lone burst of colour on a residential street. </p> <p>'Many are used as parking or for dumping rubbish or just for keeping the dustbin in. The front garden is now looked at as an additional space for living, rather than as something to enhance the neighbourhood,' he said. </p> <p>Many housing developments do not even bother with the notion of a front garden, a far cry from the observations of a French tourist in 1829, who wrote: 'The taste for gardens in England is so pronounced that one finds them before almost every house.' </p> <p>'It used to be somewhere you were proud of; it reflected status and that you were a respectable, law-abiding person,' said Guy Barter of the RHS. 'Now they are no longer valued as they used to be. We need to think more deeply about the role of the front garden in today's society.'</p>",
  "<p>Paula Radcliffe faces the threat of the Japanese trying to run as a team in an effort to stop her winning the Olympic marathon gold medal. </p> <p>A trio of Japanese women, including two world silver medallists, are determined to keep the title in their country after Sydney champion and compatriot Naoko Takahashi failed to qualify. </p> <p>\"The Japanese runners are thinking about strategy and how they can compete with Radcliffe,\" revealed Akemi Masuda, the former Japanese record holder. \"She is very strong, coming from a cross-country background, and is also good at 10,000 metres, but the Japanese coaches cite the fact that she has never won a marathon in extreme heat.\" </p> <p>Hiromi Suzuki, the 1997 world champion, believes the conditions are the Japanese runner's best opportunity of stopping Radcliffe. </p> <p>\"The three Japanese have chances,\" she said. \"It will be the first midsummer marathon for Radcliffe. She is unlikely to go full out from the start.\" </p> <p>But Masuda, who ran in the inaugural women's Olympic marathon in Los Angeles 20 years ago, believes the Briton is so good she can overcome whatever conditions she faces next Sunday. </p> <p>\"Nobody can beat Radcliffe if she runs in peak condition,\" said Masuda. \"She just runs away from the very start. The marathon begins at 6.00 pm and it should be about 32C when it starts. But Radcliffe can win in the heat. She has won a half-marathon in the heat and I believe she has what it takes. </p> <p>\"It doesn't matter what the conditions are. It is all a matter of what kind of shape you are in. The three Japanese runners are all talking about the hills and what the heat is going to be like. Radcliffe's style is to take the lead from the beginning and find her rhythm. She is not going to change her style.\" The Japanese have more strength in depth in the women's marathon than any other country in the world.

  "Last Sunday morning, Marc C\u00e9cillon, 45, woke up in a police cell, with an aching head and a mind full of questions. He called for his wife, 'Chantal, Chantal', but gendarmes came instead. 'I want my wife,' said the rugby star. 'You can't have her,' said the officers. 'She is dead. You shot her last night.' <p>Gendarmerie Lieutenant Luc Vanaud says that when 6ft 4in C\u00e9cillon was told that, at a party the previous night, he had killed his 44-year-old wife, he refused to believe it. 'But I love her. She means everything to me, I owe her everything,' he said repeatedly, then crumbled. Since then, Vanaud said, the 'Quiet Man' of French rugby has been monosyllabic. </p> <p>Whatever the domestic details that led one of France's toughest, most dependable rugby figures to kill his wife with four shots from a .357 magnum, it seems C\u00e9cillon's mental disintegration began years ago and came to head after his retirement last year. </p> <p>If Chantal was the victim of male brutality, Marc fell prey to fame, alcohol, shyness and, it seems, a terrible need to be loved. </p> <p>That Saturday night, at least 60 people were enjoying the end-of-season party at the Flosailles villa of Christian and Babeth Beguy, near Bourgoin. A marquee had been erected in the garden and spirits were high in the best traditions of rugby parties among the players of top-16 club Bourgoin and local sides Pont-de-Ch\u00e9ruy and Saint Savin. The host's oldest friend, Marc C\u00e9cillon - 46 times capped for France, five of them as national captain - was guest of honour. </p> <p>Chantal, a medical secretary who had married C\u00e9cillon when she was 17 and had two daughters by him, arrived on time but without her husband. </p> <p>That was not unusual; he had spent the afternoon riding his Harley-Davidson and would be along later. The couple were known to have their differences and, among the rugby wives, there were rumours of a mistress and a son born out of wedlock. </p> <p>When he arrived, at about 11pm, C\u00e9cillon was drunk. Almost immediately, he flew into a rage against his hosts and, according to some accounts, he slapped Madame Beguy before leaving the party. A few moments later, just before midnight, the Beguys' teenage son, Alexandre, was in the bathroom of the family house. </p> <p>Through the window, he saw C\u00e9cillon returning down the driveway to the house, which is lined by a maize field on one side and a vineyard on the other. He saw him tuck a gun into his shorts. The teenager ran to warn as many guests as possible that C\u00e9cillon was armed, and suggested they move further into the garden. </p> <p>But C\u00e9cillon, a terrifying colossus when drunk, headed straight towards Chantal, who was sitting at a table with friends. He shot her four times, in the arm, chest and head. As guests tried to overpower him, Alexandre threw a breezeblock which hit C\u00e9cillon on the back but, according to witnesses, made no impression. Several of the guests finally managed to tackle C\u00e9cillon to the ground. Gendarmes say that when they arrived, he had been tied to a chair with electrical cord and was asking for Chantal. </p> <p>The humiliating scene of the disabled, incoherent giant was in stark contrast to the image of C\u00e9cillon in France and the rest of the rugby-playing world. The former back-row forward and number eight, was first capped in 1988 against Ireland after entering first division rugby with Bourgoin at the age of 17. His 22nd cap, in 1992, was marked by him being named captain, though he said he felt uncomfortable with the responsibilities of the role. </p> <p>He continued to be selected for France and played his last international in 1995 at the Five Nations in Dublin. In 1989, he was named as the number eight in an all-star line-up to mark the centenary of the South Africa Rugby Football Union. </p> <p>C\u00e9cillon's friend of 15 years, retired rugby player Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Tordo, saw him on the fateful Saturday afternoon. 'Marco was on his Harley. He dropped by for a coffee and stayed about two-and-a-half hours,' said Tordo, 40, who runs the Insolite lakeside restaurant near Flosailles. 'We had played boules the night before and he had won. He wanted to stay on and play again. He did not want to go to the party. </p> <p>'Marc was always being invited for drinks, to parties - people looked good if they had him as a guest and they bragged if they had spent an afternoon drinking with him. He couldn't say no but he found it a burden to be in such demand. </p> <p>'He was a man with no limits. He did everything with passion. In a way, I think there was love in what he did - in killing her, I mean. At least there wasn't evil. I think what happened was the result of an accumulation of years of unexpressed emotions. He needed affection, he needed his friends but, equally, he did not show his emotions. He was this giant iceberg and we only saw the tip of him. As his friend, I feel I should have been more sensitive to the pain under the surface.' </p> <p>Tordo's wife, Pascale, in common with other women who knew the couple, gives a harsher view of C\u00e9cillon. </p> <p>'He was a drunk. He drank, he screwed, and he always got away with it because he was Marc C\u00e9cillon. That's what 20 years of alcohol does to you - little by little it destroys you. Marc could not cope with his life. When you kill your wife, you are killing your life,' she said. </p> <p>Further up the road, at the L'Aventure Caf\u00e9 in Chantal's home village, V\u00e9n\u00e9rieu, the C\u00e9cillon drama is the central focus of conversation. But that doesn't mean everyone is siding with Chantal. Rather, it's a men/women thing, with villagers refusing to demote C\u00e9cillon from the hero status he earned in 27 years of rugby. One man even suggests 'it takes guts to shoot your wife'. </p> <p>The women, on the other hand, suggest the heavy-drinking, macho rugby fraternity has closed ranks. 'C\u00e9cillon was a madman,' says one woman. 'If he came anywhere near you, there would be trouble.' </p> <p>At the rugby stadium in Bourgoin, where a stand was named after C\u00e9cillon last year, club chairman Pierre Martinet said the 'Quiet Man' appeared to have had trouble adapting to ordinary life - and a job as a salesman of artificial sports turf - when his professional career ended last year. 'I have known Marc for 12 years. I often saw him with Chantal, who was very proud of him. I never noticed problems between them and I never personally saw him drunk. But it is clear that his recent lack of activity tended to incite him to drink.' Earlier this year, sensing C\u00e9cillon was struggling with life as a ex-player, Martinet appointed him honorary manager of Bourgoin and put him in charge selling corpo rate VIP suites at the club's stadium. </p> <p>It was a role which aimed to keep him on the inside of the game - which he finally left last year after a season with F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 2 team Beaurepaire. No one can save another man,' said Martinet. 'If those of us who knew Marc put our hands to our hearts, we have to admit there were problems with alcohol and giving up playing. But no one had the full story. No one really knew what went on at home. It is too easy to be wise after the event.'</p>",
  "<p>From the world of projectiles going at alarming speeds comes a couple of near-birth and near-death experiences. First, there is <strong>Cornelia Pfohl</strong> in the women's archery, who is six months pregnant with her first child. Pfohl, a German soldier, adjusted her balance at the oche in the qualifying round to earn herself a seeding of eighteenth. Meanwhile, in the trap shooting there is 43-year-old Bret Erickson, another with a military background. Just three weeks ago, Sergeant First Class Erickson, of the US Army Marksmanship Unit, keeled over on the range with a heart attack. He received life-saving resuscitation on the spot and almost immediately afterwards was fitted with a pacemaker. And here he is in Athens, blasting away at full bore. </p> <p><strong>Stat of the week</strong>: 403 - the number of BBC personnel in Athens covering the Games. In contrast, there are 271 competitors in the Great Britain team. As one rival broadcaster remarked: \"That means that there's one-and-a-half BBC people here to cover just the reserve goalie in the GB hockey team.\" Nice work if you can get it. </p> <p>At an opulent media lunch in Athens laid on by his sponsor, Visa, <strong>Sir Steve Redgrave</strong> revealed the main danger of life in the Olympic Village: becoming a fat git. \"Competitors have too much time on their hands and can easily end up in the food hall all the time eating too much and putting on quite a lot of weight,\" said Sir Steve, sporting a slight paunch that has grown since he quit rowing. \"In Barcelona in 1992, there were free Magnum ice creams in the village. Research afterwards showed that athletes had eaten an average of eight each.\"</p> <p><strong>Rower Cath Bishop</strong>, from Leigh-on-Sea, will resume her other career as a diplomat in Sarajevo when she crosses the finish line on Lake Schinias on Saturday - win or lose. An Essex girl turned Cambridge PhD graduate with a passion for the piano and clarinet, Bishop took up rowing and raced in Atlanta as a member of the Britain eight, finishing seventh. Two years later she won a world silver medal and went to Sydney with high hopes but failed to make the final. </p> <p>A disappointing fifth place followed in 2001 and she quit rowing in disgust to go into the European Union department of the Foreign Office, as an aptitude for languages signalled a promising career in Whitehall. </p> <p>But the lure of the Olympics, coupled with a feeling of unfinished business and the persuasiveness of 2000 Olympic silver medal-winner Katherine Grainger (a lawyer in training), tempted Bishop back into a boat last year and they won the coxless pair world title, beating the world and Olympic pair champions from Romania. Now 'Cath and Kath' are seeking Britain's first Olympic women's title, here in Athens, and they believe that the close understanding that they have in and out of the boat will see them through. </p> <p>\"It's a bit like a marriage,\" says Bishop. \"We seem to know what the other is thinking.\" Bishop finished her last lesson in Serbo-Croat over the phone on Monday and can now concentrate on producing the golden performance that eluded her four years ago. </p> <p>Probably the most hated person in Athens, at least by the hosts, is <strong>Laura Peek</strong>, a reporter with The Times who has infuriated the Greeks with a series of articles lambasting stadium construction delays and security weaknesses and generally portraying these Olympics as a disaster waiting to happen (or not happen). But no more. </p> <p>Peek, back in Athens for the Games, has apparently been told to change her tune. \"She's been instructed to be much more on-message, to stop slagging the Games and generally be a lot more positive,\" says a Times insider. \"A piece she wrote about the lack of foreign visitors in Athens was turned into almost a tourist brochure for the city.\" The Greeks will be happy.</p>",
  "<p>As the 24th Olympiad opened in a blaze of colour, not every Athenian was filled with pride and relief. Albert Corcos viewed the end of frantic preparations for the Games with deep unease. As managing director of Herakles, Corcos runs Europe's largest cement-making factory near Volos, central Greece, which produced nearly a million tonnes of cement for Olympic-related projects. </p> <p>The Olympics has generated $87.5 million (\u00a347.5m) for Herakles. Its cement has been poured into 40 venues and helped to lay 76 miles of roads in Athens. </p> <p>Greece's annual cement construction totals 11 million tons.'I don't see a recovery to that level of consumption before 2008,' Corcos says. 'Business will go down by around 5 to 7 per cent.' </p> <p>The eyes of the world may be trained on sport and performance-enhancing drugs, but there are growing fears that the Olympics will deliver a nasty economic hangover to the smallest country to hold the Games since Finland in 1952. </p> <p>Before European Union enlargement, Greece was Europe's poorest country with average income just 75 per cent of the EU average. In recent years, however, it has been catching up. The economy has expanded by 4 per cent a year since 2000, easily outperforming the rest of the zone's average. The Olympics has contributed a quarter of that total. </p> <p>Handouts from Brussels to Greece have totalled more than \u00a350 billion in the past 20 years. This has been spent on an array of public infrastructure projects, including the new metro train system taking spectators to and from venues over the next fortnight. In Athens, anti-pollution measures have lifted the smog, revealing a city transformed. But there is a sense that investment has purely been centred on Athens, with little benefit to the rest of the country. </p> <p>What's more, the Brussels gravy train is about to hit the buffers. Enlargement means that Greece is unlikely to receive as much from European structural funds in the future. What the bulk of its 11 million citizens wanted most from the Olympics was a major economic shot in the arm to propel it up the international kudos league. Instead, there is the strong possibility that after the closing ceremony of what could be the most expensive-ever games, Greek taxpayers will be left with a huge bill as the country's debt levels breach strict EU budget rules. </p> <p>Public debt is close to 100 per cent of GDP and the budget deficit is 3.2 per cent. This breaches the 3 per cent limit set by the European Commission, which has demanded Greece comes up with a plan in three months to show how it will reduce its debts. </p> <p>Public debt has been fuelled by Olympics costs that have spiralled out of control. Previous cost projections have doubled. The newly formed Conservative government led by Costas Karamanlis has admitted that it has no firm idea what the final Olympics bill will be. Some say Greece's decision to publicly fund the games, instead of relying on the private sector, has rebounded on it. </p> <p>Meanwhile, insiders say 'legacy' planning for the dozens of facilities spread far and wide around the historic city has only just begun. There is a strong possibility that many facilities could lie dormant, draining further public funds. </p> <p>What's more, the hoped-for tourism bonanza has failed to materialise. Greece is the world's 15th most popular tourist destination, receiving 14 million visitors in a typical non-Olympic year, but hotels are running at just 50 per cent occupancy; only in the past week have they slashed prices to attract punters. </p> <p>Greek treasury officials are hoping tourism will rise by 60 per cent, to 20 million visitors, by 2010. But there is anger that the government has failed to take advantage of the pre-Olympics build-up to market the country. And bad publicity surrounding the frantic race to complete preparations, which saw the death of 13 construction workers on site, has tarnished the country's image. Even Greece's Olympic co-ordinator Fani Palli-Petralia, has admitted that the games have been a costly PR failure. </p> <p>However, this has not deterred sponsors from making Athens the most lucrative Olympics ever. Blue-chip corporations such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Samsung have paid a record-breaking $1.2bn to sponsor the games. </p> <p>'This in part reflects the time-zone issue,' said Nigel Currie, director of the sports marketing agency at GEM Group. 'Sydney did not work for US TV networks.' With television revenues just shy of $1.5bn, also a record, there are some who believe Greece will see an overall benefit to hosting the games. </p> <p>Lloyd Barton, a European economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: 'I do think in the long term that the Greek economy is likely to benefit. Athens will benefit from the new infrastructure and tourism is likely to increase, based on historical assumptions.' </p> <p>Greece exports about 40 million tonnes of olives, 28 million litres of retsina and 115,000 tonnes of feta cheese every year. It is still a shipping power, one of Europe's biggest cement producers and has strong financial services. The country sees its future as a south-east European business hub, in which it forms closer economic ties with Turkey and the Balkan states. </p> <p>After years of war, there is a new, but fragile stability in the Balkans, which has seen Greek businesses finally making profits from its subsidiaries operating there. It is the biggest investor in many Balkan states. However, a recent CBI report on Greece noted: 'Corruption is extensive, especially among civil servants. It is a major obstacle to much foreign direct investment. There is little transparency. Nepotism is even more pervasive and will not be easily eliminated ... bribes and favours are almost a necessary part of business.' </p> <p>It seems that for Greece's economy to be transformed will require a truly Herculean effort.</p>",
  "<p>Athens welcomed the Olympics home on Friday night with an opening ceremony that combined homage to the ancient Greeks with a rapturous welcome for 10,500 athletes. The dramatic climax, as ever, was the lighting of the Olympic flame. When Muhammad Ali had the privilege in 1996, tears were wept around the world. This time it was a former champion windsurfer and the world was left asking: 'Who was that?' </p> <p>The capacity crowd of 77,000 cheered Nikolas Kaklamanakis, a 1996 gold medallist, wildly enthusiastically, but it was hard for anyone to shake off the notion he was not the organisers' first choice for the games' showpiece spectacle. </p> <p>Kostas Kederis, whose victory in the Olympic 200 metres in Sydney four years ago propelled him from obscurity to Greece's most popular man, was watching the ceremony on TV from a hospital bed 20 miles away, contemplating not only the near certain end of his career, but also how he suddenly became the country's public enemy No 1. </p> <p>In the most startling drugs drama witnessed at the games since Ben Johnson was stripped of gold in 1988, a sequence that began on Thursday night with a missed doping test and a mysterious motorcycle accident, Kederis had almost single-handedly plunged the Olympic movement into crisis and cast a black cloud over an event in which his country has invested $6 billion. </p> <p>Kederis, 31, may have a relatively low profile internationally, but until last week in Greece his reputation was that of a modern-day god. When he came from seemingly nowhere in Sydney to beat Britain's Darren Campbell and claim the gold medal he became the living symbol of the games to the Greeks. </p> <p>He was the first Greek male to win an Olympic athletics gold since Spiridon Louis emerged victorious from the marathon in the games of 1896, fuelled along the way by some red wine and an Easter egg. The name of the young Greek shepherd entered the country's lexicon. The expression 'egine Louis' - 'became Louis' - means 'ran quickly'. </p> <p>Like Louis before him, Kederis also lent his name to more widespread use. A sign on the main street in Varia, the village on the island of Lesbos where the sprinter was born and raised, welcomes visitors to Odos Kosta Kenteri: Kostas Kenteris Street. </p> <p>A few miles up the road in Mytilini, at midnight each night the Aolos Kenteris pulls into dock from the Athenian port of Piraeus. Aolos is the Greek god of the wind. The Aolos Kenteris is one of the fastest ferries in the Greek passenger fleet. </p> <p>Last month, a poll voted Kederis the most popular man in Greece. In this city where he has lived and trained for the past five years, his image is everywhere to be seen: on billboards, on television commercials, on magazine covers. </p> <p>When the tickets went on sale for the final of the 200m on August 28 they were the first ones to be snapped up and were vastly oversubscribed. </p> <p>Only last year athletics chiefs had privately suggested to Greek Olympic officials that they should encourage Kederis to race more regularly and more often abroad to raise the profile of the Games. </p> <p>Since his triumph in Sydney he had won the 2001 World Championships in Edmonton and the 2002 European Championships in Munich, but had not raced on the high-profile and lucrative European grand prix circuit for three years - but where there is also regular drug testing of competitors. </p> <p>Yet even to the Greeks, the man whose victory in Australia had prompted the memorable headline in the Sydney Morning Herald 'Who the Hellas is Kostas Kenteris?' remained something of a mystery. </p> <p>Even Kenteris's name has proved elusive - he is now known officially as Kederis. But it was not doubt over how to spell this champion's moniker that caused some observers of the athletics scene a sense of unease. </p> <p>That stemmed from a succession of circumstances that had tended to undermine the Greeks' insistence that none of their athletes was using questionable methods in preparation for the Games. </p> <p>Just as unknown was Ekaterini Thanou, 29, Kederis's training partner who had finished second to American superstar Marion Jones in the 100m in Sydney. Both athletes came from nowhere to stun the world. And they just happen to share a trainer in Christos Tzekos. </p> <p>Kederis clocked 20.09 seconds in Sydney, while Thanou picked up her silver half a second behind Jones in a time of 11.12. Darren Campbell, who finished second, revealed earlier this year that after the final a fellow athlete came up to him before the medal ceremony saying: 'Don't worry, by the morning that will be gold.' </p> <p>As history relates, there was no positive test and, until the dramatic events of Thursday evening, Kederis looked like he would enter these Games as the defending champion. </p> <p>The chain of events had started at the end of last month when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) took over control of drug testing athletes who were due to compete in the Games. </p> <p>When a group of sampling officers turned up in Athens, Kederis and Thanou fled their home country to travel halfway round the world to train in Chicago. </p> <p>It evoked memories of two years ago when they had withdrawn from a major meeting in Greece shortly after drug-testing officials from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) had arrived. </p> <p>An even more extraordinary incident had occurred last year when the IAAF arrived at the address they had been given for Kederis by Greek authorities in Crete only to discover they were instead training in Qatar, then the headquarters for the Allied forces fighting in the Iraq war. </p> <p>The IAAF officially warned the Greeks over the incident but suspicions persisted they were engaging in illegal methods and were deliberately evading being tested to avoid detection. </p> <p>So, upon discovering the athletes were not in Athens, the IOC sent a team to Chicago to track down Kederis and Thanou. But, once again, they were not at the address provided. It was later claimed by officials they had instead travelled to Essen, Germany, for treatment on an injury. </p> <p>Under the rules of the IOC athletes who are not available for tests on two occasions are deemed to have committed a doping offence under its 'two strikes and out' rule. </p> <p>No-notice out-of-competition testing is considered to be so important because it is seen as the main weapon in the drug fighters' armoury, as steroids are most beneficial to athletes while they are in training. That is why it is enshrined in the code of World Anti-Doping Agency, the organisation that oversees drug testing around the globe, that any athlete who fails to take a test when asked should be treated as harshly as one who actually provides a positive sample. </p> <p>Back in Athens there was confusion among the Greek officials who claimed they did not know whether Kederis and Thanou would return in time for the opening ceremony and their whereabouts. </p> <p>But IOC officials had already contacted them to warn them that unless the two athletes were available for testing on Thursday evening they faced the threat of disciplinary action. </p> <p>Kederis and Thanou finally checked into the athletes' village at 3.20pm on Thursday and the IOC sent a pair of sampling officers to their rooms at the pre-arranged time of 6.15pm only to discover they were again not present. </p> <p>Phone lines buzzied across Athens as the gravity of the situation began to dawn on Greek officials. When Jacques Rogge, the Belgian surgeon who is now president of the IOC, returned to his hotel after attending an event at the Acropolis and was informed he was reportedly very angry. It took little more than an hour for the news to leak out and it was soon broadcast on Greek TV. There then followed a period of confusion as a series of conflicting stories began emerging. </p> <p>At 10.45pm the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) released a statement confirming Kederis and Thanou were not in their rooms because they had returned to their homes to collect some personal belongings. </p> <p>'This,' said Greece's former sports minister, Giorgos Liannis, 'is a Greek athletic tragedy.' </p> <p>The whereabouts of the athletes was still a mystery when Rogge convened an emergency meeting with the HOC in the Hilton Hotel. Rogge, who earlier in the day had warned the IOC would adopt 'a zero tolerance' policy on doping, emerged afterwards to announce he had called for Kederis and Thanou to appear before a disciplinary committee the next day. </p> <p>The ink was barely dry on the press release before the next strange twist emerged. Greek TV broke into their scheduled programmes to broadcast a newsflash that Kederis and Thanou had been involved in a motorcycle crash and had been admitted to hospital. </p> <p>Tzekos later claimed they had been sitting on the balcony of his flat in Glyfada when he had told them to get back to the village immediately to undergo the drugs test. </p> <p>Why, just a few days before they were due to compete in the most important races of their lives, they decided to get on a motorcycle with Thanou riding pillion is perhaps the biggest mystery of all. </p> <p>It is claimed that Kederis suffered a slight head injury, a sprain to the vertebra at the back of his neck, a knee sprain and scratches to his right leg and Thanou slight abdominal injures and a sprain to her right leg. </p> <p>They arrived at the KAT trauma hospital 15 miles away, rather than the much closer Voula hospital in Glyfada, but how they travelled there is not known. According to records they did not call the emergency services and the passing motorist they claimed who took them there has so far failed to come forward despite appeals on Greek TV and in the newspapers. </p> <p>A similar appeal to Tzekos to see how badly damaged the bike was also went unheeded. The controversial coach, previously a door-to-door salesman whose name has also been linked to doping scandals involving AEK Athens, one of Greece's biggest football clubs, did not produce the evidence. He has since employed a lawyer, who accompanied him to a meeting of the HOC yesterday. </p> <p>Olympic officials immediately had their doubts about the validity of Kederis and Thanou's story. 'Very theatrical,' is how one described it. Patrick Schamasch, the IOC's medical director, was dispatched on Friday morning to examine them. </p> <p>By the time he returned to the Hilton he was confronted with a hundred journalists, cameramen and photographers camped outside the hotel in temperatures nudging 100 degrees as the police struggled to contain them. </p> <p>After an appeal from Greek officials, Rogge, aware he had to been seen to give the athletes a fair hearing, reluctantly agreed to allow the disciplinary panel to postpone their hearing. </p> <p>But with public opinion turning unexpectedly against Kederis and Thanou, the Greeks and Olympic officials held secret meetings to discuss the possibility of them being withdrawn from the Games. </p> <p>'They should be strung up,' snapped Litsa Sarantou, a 33-year-old beekeeper. </p> <p>'I don't even want to say his name,' said Petros Papaioannis, who was selling Olympic trinkets near the stadium. 'We will never forget this insult.' </p> <p>It was agreed that if the sprinters withdrew then the IOC would postpone the disciplinary hearing until after the completion of the Olympics. It was hoped this would allow the controversy to subside and put the spotlight back onto the sport. </p> <p>Rogge was with Tony Blair and other heads of states at an Olympic truce ceremony in Athens when he was informed yesterday of the likely HOC decision to withdraw Kederis and Thanou. </p> <p>Eleven athletes have already been banned from these Games over drugs and some 1,200 top-flight competitors have failed tests in the four years since the Sydney Olympics. None, however, has been felt so painfully close to home. The Greek fleet may soon be renaming the Aolos Kenteris.</p> <p><strong>Fool's gold: Olympic cheats</strong></p> <p><strong> Fred Lorz </strong> St Louis, 1904 </p> <p>Won the marathon in three hours 13 minutes. But the crowd's cheers turned to jeers when news broke that the New Yorker had, at the nine-mile mark, hitched a lift for 11 miles. He received a lifetime ban, which was later lifted. </p> <p><strong> Boris Onischenko </strong> Montreal, 1976 </p> <p>The Ukrainian modern pentathlete, a KGB colonel, rigged his fencing sword so he could trigger a 'hit' on the electronic scoring system with his hand instead of actually having to land a touch on an opponent.

He was banned for life in 1993 after he tested positive again. </p> <p><strong> Michelle De Bruin</strong> Atlanta, 1996 </p> <p>The Irish swimmer won three golds. From 1995 she was unavailable for out-of-competition drug tests but in 1998 a sample she gave was found to have been tampered with and she was banned for four years.</p>",
  "<p>Ben Ainslie was disqualified from the second race in the Finn class following a late protest from Guillaume Florent of France over an incident 10 minutes into the race. As he came ashore, Ainslie had no idea a protest would be lodged, and when he met the media he was unaware he might be called to answer a protest. </p> <p>The decision puts the British sailor, in search of his second Olympic gold medal, under considerable pressure. He now has only one result that counts in his overall score and cannot afford a poor result in any of the forthcoming nine races as he is allowed only one discard from his final total. </p> <p>\"As far as I am concerned, there wasn't an incident and I wasn't in the wrong,\" said Ainslie after the protest. \"He tried to make something of it, as it was the Olympics and there were no witnesses. </p> <p>\"I am frustrated, disappointed and angry, and all I can do is get my head down and sail the best I have ever sailed to be in with a shot.\" </p> <p>Earlier, most eyes were focused on the battle between Ainslie and the 1996 gold medallist, Mateusz Kusznierewicz of Poland. The first race fizzled out for Ainslie, who had a perfect start taken from him by Enver Adakan of Turkey. </p> <p>\"I was set up perfectly,\" said Ainslie, \"but the Turk did a double tack beneath me and forced me to tack away.\" </p> <p>Going the other way proved expensive as Ainslie rounded the first mark fourteenth of the 25 competitors. He worked through to ninth after four legs of the course, but there was a big gap that stopped further improvement. </p> <p>It made him all the more determined to start well in the second race of the day, and this he did, going bow-to-bow with the Pole. But it was all to no avail when he crossed the Frenchman who he is deemed to have fouled. </p> <p>Others in the British sailing team opened their accounts competently in three classes on the Saronic Gulf. </p> <p>They were in medal positions in two of them, and eleventh in the other on a day of light southerly breezes that were extremely tricky and required guile rather than athleticism. </p> <p>Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield are clearly delighted that things went their way in the Men's 470s. After being edged out of the medals in Sydney by a single point, their attack came from the first gun. A second in the opening race to the American team of Foerster and Burnham was followed by a third that gives them a clear point lead over the unfancied Brazilian pairing of Paradeda and Arndt after two races. </p> <p>A fifth and a fourth gave Shirley Robertson, Sarah Ayton and Sarah Webb third place in the Yngling class, level on points with the Dutch trio that won the second race. Consistency looks to be ultra-important in this class as the Danes, who won the first race, were fourteenth of the 16 in the second. </p> <p>\"We had two cracking starts,\" said Ayton, \"but it is tough playing this talented fleet. We are fast downwind, and that helps.\" </p> <p>\"We didn't want risk on the first day,\" said fellow crew member Webb. \"The wind was light and dangerous.\" </p> <p>Mistakes were easy to make, but Robertson and her crew kept it all together on a very difficult day. </p> <p>In the Women's 470s, Christina Bassadone and Katherine Hopson lie 11th, three places ahead of the Australian Sydney gold medallists, Armstrong and Stowell.</p>",
  "<p>China grabbed the first two gold medals of the Olympic Games when Wang Yifu rallied to defeat Russia's Mikhail Nestruev on the final shot in the men's 10-metre air pistol competition. Earlier, China's Du Li had won the first gold medal of the Olympics with a remarkably similar triumph in the women's 10-metre air rifle event, coming from behind to knock another Russian, Lioubov Galkina, into second place.</p> <p>Wang, 43, had trailed throughout the 10-shot pistol finals but outscored his Russian rival, who was standing just to his left, on their crucial last shot to win with a total of 690.0 points to Nestruev's 689.8.Nestruev, the European champion who had set an Olympic record of 591 points in the qualifying round, took the silver medal, while his compatriot Vladimir Isakov outduelled Bulgaria's Tanyu Kiriakov for the bronze.</p> <p>Du Li, a 22-year-old student from the Shandong province, won with a score of 502.0 points, which included an Olympic-record final round of 104.0. Galkina, who had also set an Olympic record in the qualifying round with 399 points, took the silver medal. Katerina Kurkova of the Czech Republic won the bronze.</p> <p>Olympic men's trap shooting champion Michael Diamond of Australia, meanwhile, finished a disappointing ninth in the first round of qualifying on Saturday.</p>",
  "<p>It has been a while since there has been a realistic challenge to America's position at the top of the Olympic medals table, yet it is entirely possible that in four years' time the Chinese may not only compete with but also topple the Americans, something that has not happened since America's tit-for-tat boycott of the Moscow Games in 1980. Indeed so startling is the Chinese progress in many sports and so many junior world champions do they possess that they might even win more medals in Beijing than every one else put together. </p> <p>Such dominance might be considered unseemly in hosts, but winning the most golds, or Olympic bling as some Americans call it, is a must. To do so they will need to make gains on the American majority here in Athens so that the gap can be crossed in Beijing. Ideally they have to win medals in constituencies that were once American. Yesterday's under-48kg women's weightlifting contest was such a constituency. </p> <p>In Sydney the event was something of a farce. It was won initially by the Bulgarian Izabela Dragneva before she failed a drugs test leaving the American Tara Cunningham to benefit from her disgrace. </p> <p>In Athens it was expected to fall to the Chinese, who did not compete in this event in Sydney. Each nation can only enter four weightlifters across the categories and the confidence in the Chinese women's quartet was great. </p> <p>\"They will win all four because our domestic competition is very hot,\" said Wenbin Chen, deputy head coach of the Chinese men's team. \"Perhaps we should be more modest and say we want to catch at least three gold. That will give us room to manoeuvre.\" </p> <p>A brace of early shooting golds had put China head of the medal table with America back in fourth. The weightlifting, which took place in a magnificent stadium that was less than half full, offered a chance to increase their lead. There was not an abundance of western European media to watch, just the BBC's Dougie Donnelly and I. </p> <p>With less than two minutes to the start 'Daddy Cool' was played over the PA. Then various women, weighing less than Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorkina, appeared on stage and lifted unfathomably heavy weights. </p> <p>Dragneva having served her ban turned up wearing a Benny Hill-style wig, perhaps to disguise her shame at being allowed back in the Olympic arena. </p> <p>The art lies in assessing precisely how gifted you might be. Overrate yourself and you will end up flat on your backside, a fate that befell defending champion Cunningham, or fail to finish, which happened to Indonesia's Rosmainar Rosmainar who came in at 80kg but failed to lift it thrice and was eliminated before the clean and jerk. Underrate yourself and you may not fulfil your potential. </p> <p>The Chinese contender, 22-year-old Zhuo Li, had signalled her intent by announcing she would enter the snatch part of the competition at 5kg above anyone else and the clean and jerk 7.5kg higher. In sum, she expected to win by over 10kg. </p> <p>The gauntlet was picked up by the younger Turk, Nurcan Taylan, who revised her expectations upwards and finally entered at the same weight as Li. A piece of chutzpah that meant she would need to break the Olympic record with her first snatch. Not a problem. The lack of strain was palpable. </p> <p>Li was suddenly under pressure. She equalled Taylan's Olympic record, put 2.5kg more on the bar, and broke it, setting a world record in the process. Taylan raised the stakes to 95kg and retook the Olympic and world records, raising more than twice her body weight in the process. Li composed herself and with her third attempt tried to level everything up. She appeared to do so, but the judges deemed that she hadn't done it with one continuous movement. Taylan, wearing a huge sticking plaster over her right breast, upped the stakes again and raised the bar again. It is safe to say the world has never seen snatch like it, certainly not in the under-48kg category. </p> <p>When it came to the clean and jerk Taylan upped her original ante to enter only 5kg lower than Li. It was a head to head over three lifts. Taylon succeeded at 107.5kg. She pointed two fingers in the air. Li succeeded at 112.5kg. She bowed politely. </p> <p>Taylan again exerted maximum pressure by raising not 2.5kg but 5kg. If she lifted it Li would have to break her own world record to stay in the game. Taylon failed at the first attempt. She wobbled and wobbled on her second attempt and succeeded. Li jacked it up by 7.5kg. She had two chances to take gold. On both she cleaned but didn't jerk. Her coaches offered no congratulations on her silver.</p>",
  "<p>The only time I met Jeffrey Archer, he was ranting about the Greeks. 'These bloody people, they couldn't organise their way out of a paper bag.' </p> <p>It was the eve of the 1997 World Athletics Championships in Athens. Archer was standing in the foyer of the Hilton, fuming because an overworked saleswoman in the hotel bookshop had had the temerity to keep him waiting. 'To think that they're organising these games is a real joke,' he grumbled. 'They're bloody hopeless.' His tirade was embarrassing. But what struck me more, living in Greece and being British, was the ferocity of such Anglo-Saxon condescension. It was both disquieting and buffoonish. In the event, the championships were the best of recent times. </p> <p>As Greeks defy sceptics with world-class sports venues and a vastly improved city for the Olympics, I wonder what put-downs Archer and his ilk will come up with now? That Athens 2004 isn't a patch on what London could be in 2012? Or perhaps they will take a leaf out of Tessa Jowell's book? After touring the Greek capital last week, the British sports minister could only exclaim: 'We are here to learn ... and support the city in the face of doomsayers - they have turned it around.' </p> <p>Greece is the smallest country to stage the Olympics, which are the biggest ever. The feat will help dispel some of the self-doubt and nagging inferiorities that torment Greeks. Not even the humiliation of seeing the farcical flight from drug testers of their two star athletes could take the gloss off Friday's magnificent opening ceremony. </p> <p>If the Games go as well and remain incident-free - and the Greeks have spent a record \u00a3900 million providing security for the event - the organisers may just succeed in proving that Athens is no longer Europe's Christian Orthodox 'odd-man out'. That, actually, it can very effectively 'organise its way out of a paper bag'. But will the Olympics also change the prejudices against Hellenes? </p> <p>In Britain, it seems, there is still a readiness to think of the Greeks as barely civilised: they are all called Zorba, sport bushy moustaches and smash plates. If not that, then they are corrupt southern Europeans with a criminal justice system that goes out of its way to target British plane spotters. Such stereotypes are born of an idea of Greece as a Balkan backwater, a country that has no place in the European Union. </p> <p>Again and again, in the course of reporting from Greece, I have met such prejudices. What still surprises me, though, is the extent to which they appear to have colonised the minds of people I might otherwise respect. </p> <p>A year spent in the irrepressibly progressive environment of Harvard, as the new century dawned, only served to highlight how entrenched and peculiarly British such views tend to be. Like our fondness for that cliche of Greeks bearing gifts, we seem unable to abandon our belief that modern Greece is a contradiction in terms. Increasingly, I find myself thinking the British, rather than the Greeks, are trapped in outdated mindsets. </p> <p>As a Briton, I find much to squirm about, whether it's the Elgin marbles or my compatriots running wild in vomit-splattered Faliraki or feckless, bare-breasted English girls being incarcerated in Greek jails, which are, naturally, described as 'medieval' in the British press. </p> <p>Few ever stop to think how the British might behave if hordes of unprepossessing, out-of-control Greeks invaded our coasts? More often than not, Greek authorities react to such excesses with a leniency far beyond the call of duty. </p> <p>No one can deny the Greeks' bewildering last-minute work ethic. In recent months, preparations for the Games appeared so chaotic that they bordered on the burlesque. But, sadly, stereotypes tend to colour political views. </p> <p>What people tend to forget is just how far the Greeks have come. Three decades ago, Athens was under the iron grip of small-minded military dictators, men as intent on banning mini-skirts as banishing leftists to remote island prisons. </p> <p>Now, Hellenes worry not about human rights or the rule of law, but consumer goods and their second homes overlooking the sea. It is all the more miraculous when you remember that before the colonels came years of wars, coups and near-constant political and social unrest. </p> <p>It is true that with their extraordinary ability to be their own worst enemy, the tumult was often self-inflicted. The disastrous 1923 Pelepponese campaign, subject of Louis de Berni\u00e8re's latest book, did not enhance the country's reputation. Nor did Athens's fiercely pro-Serbian and less than magnanimous stance in the recent Balkan wars. </p> <p>But Greece is changing. Just as the country is no longer the economic laggard of the European Union (at around 4 per cent, its GDP growth rates are the second highest in the eurozone), it is no longer the political juvenile of yore. The trenchant nationalism of the 1980s and early 1990s is no more; instead of generating firebrand politicians with only thinly disguised dreams of conquering Constantinople, it produces men and women who want only to improve relations with Turkey. </p> <p>Progressive immigration policies, an area for which Greece deserves more credit, are rapidly changing the country's ethnic make-up. Around 10 per cent of its 11-million strong population are now foreign-born, mostly Albanian, although increasingly from the former Soviet republics, Africa and the Middle East. Admittedly, Greece was never a multicultural paradise; treatment of newcomers has not always been exemplary. But I have often wondered what the reaction would be in other European countries to such a great influx. </p> <p>In years to come, others might contemplate the wisdom of tasking small states such as Greece with the organisation of a show such as the Olympics. But of one thing there can be no doubt: no other single event has so effectively transformed or revitalised Athens in the 180-plus years since Greece won independence from the Ottoman Turks. </p> <p>In one fell swoop, it seems, the Greeks have cleaned up their act. They have cracked the nasty November 17 (the group that killed British military attache Stephen Saunders); they've used EU funds and dug deep into their coffers to build highways, a sophisticated transport network, a gleaming new airport and a metro system that makes the London Underground look primitive. </p> <p>They haven't built a new Acropolis Museum yet, but they've united all their ancient masterpieces into a giant and spectacular archaeological park, no mean feat in a city of more than four million people. How long has it taken to even agree to build London's Crossrail? It is unlikely it will be ready by 2012. </p> <p>The new Greeks are innovative. In contrast to the patronising eggheads who govern the likes of the British Museum, they come up with forward-looking polices: 'Why not loan us the Elgin marbles, instead of 'giving them back' and we'll display them in a branch of the British Museum beneath the Parthenon?' </p> <p>Lovers of Greece will weep to see that acceptance has taken so long, but it could prove to be one of the greatest legacies of the Games. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Will Hutton is away</p>",
  "<p>Today's women's road race will be among the most visually spectacular events of the Olympic Games. Mapped around the city centre of Athens, the route starts and finishes in Kotzia Square, taking in the Acropolis along the way. It would be the perfect sight-seeing trip, were the riders not required to complete nine laps for a total of 118.8km of punishing climbing, breakneck turns on the descent and, just to check they are all still concentrating, a short, sharp sprint for the line. </p> <p>British interest in yesterday's men's race would have centred on David Millar, were he not licking his EPO-induced wounds in the over-subscribed prison for drug offenders. Instead, we have an intelligent, eloquent, outspoken and determinedly individual 21-year-old called Nicole Cooke with a genuine chance of winning a gold medal. The biggest scandal in the build-up to the women's race came yesterday when her father, Anthony, was questioned by police for painting his daughter's name on the streets on which she will race. </p> <p>Cooke is not staying in the Olympic village, she did not attend Friday's opening ceremony and she has no interest in mixing with the big stars. She is here for a reason and does not intend to be distracted in any way. You might suspect that Cooke would be a cocky, brash brat who had alienated her fellow competitors with her arrogant attitude. You would be wrong. Yes, she is confident and feisty, but she is not naive, nor is she conceited. She has a mature and reasonable explanation for her approach, </p> <p>\"The experience of a lifetime,\" she says, \"is not wandering around saying 'I saw so-and-so,' it's potentially saying 'I stood on the podium at the Olympics' - that's the experience of a lifetime and I don't want to compromise the chance of making that real.\" </p> <p>The apartment in which Cooke is staying, owned by family friends, has a homely feel and has done the trick of making its professional guest relax. Cooke does not need to wait until the appointed hour to use the training track, she can walk out of the front door and head out on the coast road whenever it suits her. She has been training in the heat of the day, starting at 3pm, which is when today's race will take place. </p> <p>\"I really want to make the most of this experience,\" she says, \"but I'm here to do a job. After my events [she is also in the time trial on Wednesday] have finished, then I'd love to go to the Olympic village and enjoy the party atmosphere. But not until then.\" </p> <p>Cooke is very aware aware that competing at the Olympic Games is not a given. She was desperate to represent Britain in Sydney but, despite proving her worth, was deemed too young at 17. Having won the World Cup series last year and a bronze medal at the world championship, a damaged knee from two heavy falls necessitated an operation in the spring. </p> <p>She had only three months to get race fit for Athens and did not waste time. She won the National Championship at Celtic Manor in Wales, the country of her birth, and then went home to the country in which she is based, Italy. There she won the Tour of Italy at the start of July. </p> <p>\"For me there was a lot of emotional desire for that race. I wanted to show the cycling world 'Yeah, Nicole Cooke is back.' If I'd had a perfect run at this season and been able to train properly, I wouldn't have gone to the Tour of Italy; so it really fell my way and here I am, having won my first major stage race. It's given me lots of confidence.\" </p> <p>It is hard to imagine Cooke ever lacking self-belief. She has been racing competitively since the age of 12, was the youngest ever British senior road-race champion at the age of 16, has a penchant for maths with a GCSE in the bag before her thirteenth birthday and an A grade at A-level, taken a year early. Precocity is her middle name and she will not be short of work options when her career in cycling is over, but, for now, it fulfils her desires. </p> <p>\"From a very young age, I would always go out cycling with family and friends. I guess I must have a competitive streak in me because once I started racing, I loved it. For me, it's the perfect combination of physical strength with the mental and tactical side of it. </p> <p>\"It's a very tough sport and you can't get anywhere without hard training, but on Sunday, when we come to the end of 75 miles, there will be 10 or 15 riders and maybe five or six of us will be very evenly matched physically, so it will all come down to the right tactics and the mental approach.\" </p> <p>Sports people have been heard to say that someone is too nice to be a champion and there is no doubt that a streak of nastiness helps to separate the very best from the rest. Come the closing stages, Cooke has a mantra that helps to spur her on, forcing that nasty streak to come out. </p> <p>\"You may think I'm crazy but I tell myself, 'I deserve this more than you'. I look at my rivals and I don't want them to win because I deserve it more. The times when it's really hurting you just go into a different zone. You don't think 'This hurts,' you just take that for granted and decide that you will stay on this person's wheel, at this speed and it will stop hurting in the end.\" </p> <p>In the months of rehabilitation, that gifted and fiercely uncompromising mind must have had moments of doubt. A combination of hard work and concentration means that she is here in Athens, fit, pain-free and in form, allowing the race to take shape in her mind. </p> <p>\"I think I'll be one of the strongest on the day but cycling isn't like the 100 metres where you have your own lane and don't even have to look at your opponents. You need to elbow up against your rivals, look them in eye and battle with them. The tactical side has a big part to play and that's what's going to make it so interesting.\" </p> <p>And so to the plan, the chance of a lifetime to make sporting history. Cooke will line up against 66 opponents knowing that she is one of the best climbers and has a sprint finish to burn off anyone who can stick with her up the hills. </p> <p>Team tactics, so crucial on the professional tour, will be very different. Normally, Cooke would have eight or nine team-mates to protect her, chase down a break away and keep tabs on her rivals. Here, the British team is made up of three, the others being Rachel Heal, who won bronze at the Commonwealth Games behind Cooke, and the former triathlete Sara Symington. They will do their best to help but, ultimately, it will come down to Cooke's ability and her strategy. </p> <p>\"I could ride in one way to risk everything and risk losing in order to try to get the gold medal or I could ride in another way, take less risks but perhaps only get silver or bronze. I think, with the stakes so high, I have a chance to win gold and I want to make the most of that. When the stakes are high, you have to take greater risks.\" </p> <p>The high-risk strategy it will be. Was there ever a doubt? </p> <p>As well as this race representing a pivotal moment in the career of Nicole Cooke, it is also a chance for women's cycling to make an impact. With men's cycling tarnished by drugs scandals and the widely held belief that it is corrupt from the top down, it is a unique opportunity. </p> <p>Cooke's views on drug takers are uncompromising. She will not share a room with anyone who injects vitamin supplements, let alone anything stronger. She believes that Millar should be stripped of every medal and honour he has won and that whole teams should be banned if one of their cyclists tests positive. </p> <p>\"Luckily in cycling,\" she explains, \"the men's and women's tours are two completely different worlds. The whole team structure and the whole caravan is separate. I can tell you from my experience that women's cycling, perhaps because the money is less, doesn't have the same incentive for riders to take drugs because the rewards aren't there. </p> <p>\"At the moment, I'd say women's cycling is a clean sport. We do have riders who have taken drugs but they've been caught and dealt with. The men are in a very different and difficult situation. Doping does take place, it's been proven and I know a few male amateur cyclists who have wanted to turn pro and know they're not going to get there because they're not prepared to take drugs. </p> <p>\"On the men's tour, yesterday's riders are today's directors and today's riders will become tomorrow's directors so the line is never broken. It will take an awful lot to clean up men's cycling.\" </p> <p>The dilemma is that if women's cycling takes off, the money will flood in, the incentive to take drugs will be greater and the high principles will start to crumble. However, Cooke points out that as there is no tradition of taking drugs in women's cycling, it does not have to be that way. </p> <p>\"I'd say that right now is perfect timing for women's cycling to make the progression forwards because the anti-doping authorities are so up-to-date with testing that no one will be able to get away with it. What I'd love to see is women's cycling develop from where it is now and for the anti-doping agencies to keep it clean. And I honestly think that can happen.\" </p> <p>Women's cycling could not ask for a more forthright or eloquent spokesperson, but, for today, Cooke will be concentrating on the nine laps of Athens and the riders around her, that voice in her head screaming: \"I deserve it more than you, and you, and you.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone else,\" she says. \"It's my own personal pride at stake and my ambition. I don't want to disappoint myself and, believe me, that's all the motivation I need.\"</p>",

  "<p>Such is the indisputable depth of talent in British three-day eventing that the late withdrawal of Sarah Cutteridge, whose horse went lame, has resulted in the call-up of Mary King. A veteran of three previous Olympics, winner of three European championship team gold medals, a world championship team gold and two Badminton titles, King is not a bad substitute. </p> <p>The new format at this Olympics means that the team is made up of five members, with the best three scores counting. Fielding the top two riders in the world, Britain will be banking on Pippa Funnell, who rides her Burghley and Kentucky winner Primmore's Pride, and William Fox-Pitt, who rides this year's Badminton winner Tamarillo. Both will also be contenders for individual medals, which will be decided by an extra round of showjumping after the team competition has been completed. </p> <p>Leslie Law and Jeanette Brakewell were part of the Britain team who won silver behind Australia in Sydney. Law has made it clear that he is expecting to improve on that result. </p> <p>\"I think a lot of people are expecting us to win the team gold medal. It won't be easy, but I think we're capable of doing that,\" he says, \"and I'll be disappointed if we don't.\" </p> <p>Law and Brakewell are more willing to talk about the possibility of winning medals, whereas Funnell and Fox-Pitt are more reticent, preferring to approach this competition as if it was any other. Given that between them they win most of the 'ordinary' events, that attitude evidently works for them. </p> <p>\"We've all competed at high level under pressure,\" says Fox-Pitt, \"and we know how to cope. This has to be taken as no different. The fact that there are a few more flags around and a nice gong at the end of it has got to be kept out of our minds.\" </p> <p>All of the riders are delighted with the Markopoulo Equestrian Centre, the venue for the event, and pleasantly surprised that the heat is not unbearable. On days when the breeze blows, it is cooler than it was in Britain before they left. The horses have adapted well and seem to be relieved no longer to have to wear the thick fleece rugs they have had on for training over the past few weeks. </p> <p>Eventing is a notoriously unpredictable sport and there are dangerous rival teams from Australia, the US, New Zealand and, especially, France, but in the light of the exhaustive preparation and with a slice of luck, this Britain team should win their first gold medal in eventing since 1972.</p>",
  "<p>It took the arch pragmatists to restore order. Andrew Strauss and Graham Thorpe, barely distinguishable in the pale evening sunshine of one of Test cricket's longest days, dutifully rescued England from being humbled by this modest West Indian side. </p> <p> They joined forces when England were perilously placed - 40 for three facing a first innings total of 395 - and with noses over the ball they stifled the limited threat posed by the bowlers in a final session that lasted three and a quarter hours. </p> <p> At the start of their partnership of 177 the West Indies were buzzing purposefully, relishing the rare experience of controlling the game. By the end of it the tourists were ambling with resignation to their stations. It does not take much to prick the bubble of West Indian enthusiasm at the moment. </p> <p> But the tourists were finally indebted to the energy and optimism of Dwayne Bravo. His two wickets, those of Strauss, bowled off the inside edge for 90 and Andrew Flintoff, mistakenly adjudged lbw, meant England can taken nothing for granted over the last two days. </p> <p>The batting of Strauss and Thorpe was admirable, if not memorable. They sniff out the gaps and the loose ball with measured calm. Together this pair of left-handers displayed a cold discipline that was often lacking in England's performance in the field. </p> <p>Indeed there have been hints in this match that England are starting to believe their own publicity, always a dangerous state of affairs. Call it complacency, over-confidence or arrogance, but here they handed the West Indies the initiative despite the most promising of starts. In mid-afternoon on Thursday the West Indies were 108 for four, their fragile tail was exposed and a score of 250 seemed beyond them. Yet they finished with 395. </p> <p>The West Indies lower-order, inspired by Bravo on Thursday and Carlton Baugh yesterday, revelled. Baugh was impish and defiant throughout the morning session. There were classical cover drives and clips off the hip as well as a string of upper cuts from the constant diet of short-pitched deliveries. The ball disappeared over the slip cordon with such regularity that we could happily conclude that Baugh was playing these shots on purpose. </p> <p>Baugh and Bravo have brought new life to a touring party that seemed on the brink of disintegration but they were aided by a ragged, ill-conceived performance by England in the field. Once the West Indies had been reduced to 108 for four the impression was that England expected the lower order to fold obligingly - as they have done earlier in the series. </p> <p>The bowlers became profligate; their discipline deserted them. This did not seem to worry the captain or the rest of the team. \"We'll blast them out, no need to grind them out\" was the mindset. Ashley Giles bowled to extravagant fields on Thursday - three or four men clustered around the bat with the rest deep set allowing simple singles. The ball was not turning but the assumption was that Bravo would give himself up. Instead he milked runs easily. </p> <p>Yesterday the fast bowlers assumed that they could bulldoze through the tail. With the exception of Matthew Hoggard they pursued the policy of 'bouncer, bouncer, yorker, bouncer'. The good length ball went out of fashion and Steve Harmison, searching too hard for wickets rather than control, was the main culprit. As a result the West Indies raced along, their tail amassing 120 at a run a minute. This is an improving England side but it is no way good enough to desert the basic disciplines of the game. </p> <p>The tail was not frightened to be cavalier. Dave Mohammed set the pattern when he dispatched three Harmison half-volleys to the off-side boundary. Soon he heaved one of Giles's 12 deliveries of the morning over the rope at midwicket. </p> <p>This prompted the taking of the new ball and it's hardness, combined with Flintoff's extra pace, accounted for Mohammed. An attempted pull sliced gently to Strauss at cover. </p> <p>Another fifty was added in no time as Pedro Collins sliced away alongside Baugh until a bouncer from Flintoff hit him on the chin, forcing him to retire hurt and receive eight stitches. Eventually Hoggard had the sense to propel some good-length deliveries and Corey Collymore inevitably missed one of them. </p> <p>All the while Michael Vaughan had studiously ignored James Anderson, a slight the young Lancastrian must have felt and does not deserve. Eventually Anderson was tossed the ball and a leading edge from Baugh's bat was taken at cover just before lunch. </p> <p>Now news filtered through that Collins would resume his innings after the break. Out came the umpires and the England team but there were no batsmen. Apparently Collins was feeling such pain that it was decided at the last moment that he was unable to bat again. So technically the West Indies declared their innings closed. </p> <p>Perhaps this bizarre sequence of events disorientated Marcus Trescothick. He poked tentatively at his second delivery - from Fidel Edwards - and was well held by Ramnaresh Sarwan at second slip. </p> <p>Then Collymore struck. A fine delivery clipped Robert Key's off-stump, though the ball was not so good that Key should have missed it completely. He was playing the ball to the leg side instead of straight back down the pitch. </p> <p>Vaughan produced one masterful cover drive off Edwards, who was bowling with far greater vim and control than at Lord's, but he was undone by the gentler pace of Bravo. Like Key he was eyeing the wide gaps on the leg-side and missed a full-length delivery that, via a pad, removed his off-stump. </p> <p>England were on the ropes, but, deprived of Collins, the West Indies were unable to force home their advantage. The pacemen were blunted and the introduction of Mohammed, a purveyor of chinamen, was diverting rather than devastating. </p> <p>The departure of Flintoff, replaced by the nightwatchman, Hoggard, means the urgency to get there on time this morning has diminished.</p>",
  "<p>The announcement the Shaun Wright-Phillips has signed a new four-year contract with the club at least ensured that the opening day of the new campaign ended on a positive note for Manchester City. Events during the preceding game, however, suggested little has improved from last season's flirtation with relegation. </p> <p>Collins John's second-half equaliser cancelled out an impressive opening goal from Robbie Fowler and negated the long periods of superior possession and opportunities enjoyed by the home side - a depressingly familiar story at a stadium where City won just five times in the league last season. </p> <p>Still, whatever this potentially trying season holds for City, they will at least go through it with Wright-Phillips, a likely feature in Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's squad this season, and a summer target for Liverpool and Tottenham, who tabled a futile \u00a32 million bid for the versatile midfield player last week. </p> <p>Wright-Phillips was a key part of City's spirited early attacking play and his decision to remain at the club delighted his manager, Kevin Keegan. 'We've got him for the next four years, City fans will be delighted and I'm delighted,' said Keegan. 'I've worked with him for three years and he was a very good player when I joined the club - - now he's a great player. </p> <p>'I'm not scared to say this, I'll put my name on him, not only to play for England but to hold down a regular place and be a real star in the future,' Keegan added. </p> <p>'You can't find a weakness with this kid. He wants to learn, he behaves properly, he's got unbelievable balance and a terrific attitude. The biggest thing he's got is courage. You don't always get all those things in one player. </p> <p>'He's got an excellent contract now and he deserves every penny he earns. I'm pleased about that. You don't want cheap labour, you don't want kids thinking they're not going to be rewarded properly.' </p> <p>The reward, according to estimates, is to the tune of \u00a325-30,000-a-week, a sound investment given Wright-Phillips' improvement over the past 12 months and his performance yesterday in which he inspired City to a commanding opening 45 minutes. </p> <p>'I didn't really want to go,' said Wright-Phillips. 'There was speculation but the negotiations went the way I wanted them to go and I am really happy I am here for another four years. You expect a lot of speculation at a big club like this and it has been happening with other players as well, but I'm happy that the contract has been signed and now I am going to get my head down and concentrate on doing well for City.' </p> <p>Unfortunately, for the home side, City's dominant period resulted in a solitary goal, well taken by Fowler with a right-foot, over-the-shoulder shot from 15 yards after Antoine Sibierski had helped on Danny Mills's 28th-minute long throw-in. </p> <p>Chances came and went, however, without further end product for City who, true to form, conceded a goal from Fulham's first attack of any note, in the 56th minute. Claus Jensen swept over a right-wing cross, Mills inexplicably stood off and allowed John to control the ball before beating David James with a competent finish. </p> <p>James would be called upon again, saving well from Jensen when he tore through on goal one-on-one, to avert complete disaster while Edwin van der Sar was required to perform similar heroics in the Fulham goal. </p> <p>After Nicolas Anelka and Wright-Phillips had narrowly missed the target either side of the interval, the Dutchman saved well from Claudio Reyna's long-range effort, Sibierski's stooping header from a Reyna free-kick and a shot that his team-mate Jensen almost deflected into the goal. </p> <p>Still, Keegan, in a rare attack of brutal reality, was honest enough to assess his team's performance. 'Of course it's a concern that we missed so many chances,' he said. 'We created enough to win the match comfortably yet we're sat here with a point and quite pleased with that. You've got to be philosophical - we might have lost the game as well.'</p>",
  "<p>Winning is not everything, Bill Shankly once said; it's the only thing. Thus will Real Madrid, for whom above all or anyone else victory is paramount, be unhappy about winning one and losing one. Shankly's Liverpool used to be in that league. </p> <p>Michael Owen prepares for life at the Bernab\u00e9u, the leaving of Liverpool having become inevitable. Patrick Vieira, somewhat surprisingly, remains at Arsenal. Next time the topic of loyalty in the game crops up, let us not have the lazy generalisation that overseas players do not show the same commitment to clubs as the home-grown. </p> <p>Liverpool's victory in Graz in midweek showed, on the surface, that there is life without Owen. If the club think that all is well, however, Steven Gerrard having signed a new deal and scored twice to confirm himself their prime asset, then they are kidding themselves. One Liver bird does not make a season. </p> <p>In fact, the Owen sale tells of turbulence within the club, of transition at best but turmoil at worst. The new manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, was hired to take them that next step towards winning the championship. They might just be dropping further away. </p> <p>Owen, it is believed, did not take to Ben\u00edtez and had at least a couple of disagreements with him, indeed. Ben\u00edtez in turn apparently did not consider Owen worth the \u00a3100,000 a week he was reported to be asking. That is \u00a310m for two seasons. Now Liverpool are about to find out the cost of replacing him, in fees as well as wages. And merchandise. </p> <p>The willingness to sell Owen makes no sense at all, either in footballing or business terms, certainly not at the cut-price \u00a38m fee (when Didier Drogba goes for more than \u00a320 million?), plus a makeweight. He has had injuries and, yes, he had only a year left on his contract. But they had a guarantee of goals that any replacement is not sure to provide as he settles in. </p> <p>Liverpool also had the public-relations element: a native son, symbol of the club, a totem for fans. Better, surely, to do a deal for a few more years at the end of which his value and the market might be more buoyant. Owen, in theory, should still be a few years from his prime, after all. </p> <p>Had G\u00e9rard Houllier stayed, that would probably have been the scenario. Owen has always talked, even recently, about wanting to remain at the club. Ben\u00edtez, however, is clearly intent on establishing his own regime at the Melwood training ground, one that Owen could not have been happy with. The Spaniard is clearly a talented coach, given the wonders he worked at Valencia, but this is a key early moment for his management. </p> <p>One wonders what the club's potential new chairman, Steve Morgan, thinks of it all. The current captain David Moores, seasick in the choppy waters of late, is said to be ready to accept the Morgan money that the club apparently need to bridge the gap between them, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. It could all leave the chief executive, Rick Parry, eyeing the FA's equivalent position. </p> <p>Towards the end of last season, Morgan was critical of the Anfield regime, citing a lack of passion for the red jersey. The home-grown players of the 1960s, '70s and '80s possessed it in abundance, he said, unlike the current crop. </p> <p>Now Ben\u00edtez has lost two local lads in Danny Murphy and Owen. Murphy, indeed, said that he chose Charlton, rather than Tottenham, because he did not wish to work again under a foreign-style coaching set-up and preferred the Englishness at the Valley, where Alan Curbishley is building up a quietly impressive portfolio. </p> <p>Rather than Antonio Nu\u00f1ez, Ben\u00edtez now needs to make a significant signing, someone like Pablo Aimar from his previous club Valencia, a creative player capable of exciting the Liverpool public and getting them on his side. The mood, particularly with the departure of Owen, is one of scepticism if not suspicion. </p> <p>Naturally, good results will soften that mood. Houllier, in common with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger when he first arrived, sought to retain an English core to the team but it seems a policy that has had its day. Only Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Bobby Robson continue to retain that belief at the top of the Premiership. </p> <p>With the demise of his old guard, Wenger now introduces few Englishmen, though he will point out that Vieira's length of service at the club makes him as Arsenal as any domestic player coming through the ranks. The breakdown of the move to Real may have had more to do with a disagreement over personal terms, but the feeling remains that Vieira will still give his all, despite any disappointment, as long as freedom from injury permits. </p> <p>And so the Premiership loses another English player it can ill afford to. On Wednesday, we will see a half-empty St James' Park when a young England side take on Ukraine in a friendly. Excessive prices have something to do with it, as does an over-familiarity with the international game after Euro 2004, but it is also the arrival of the league of nations competition that is the Premiership that will hurt the attendance. </p> <p>Why watch works in progress when you can have the exotic finished article? And why have Liverpool thrown the baby, in Michael Owen, out with the bathwater when it was the underachievers and undercommitted they were supposed to be shedding? </p> <p><strong> Not quite last call for Zizou</strong> </p> <p>Some players, some moments, transcend partisanship. Zinedine Zidane is one of those, his added-time free-kick for France against England this summer earning admiration despite breaking a nation's heart. Now he has called time on his international career, after 10 years and 93 appearances. </p> <p>'Zizou' began in similar fashion to the England game near his ending. Following France's failure to qualify for the World Cup of 1994, he got his chance as a substitute that late summer against Czechoslovakia. The French were 2-0 down before Zidane rescued a draw with a fierce long-range shot and a bullet header and was dubbed Zorro by the French press the next day. My palate for the game was a little jaded but, watching on television on holiday in France, I could not help but be reinvigorated. </p> <p>Since then he has been the outstanding European talent of his generation. Quite apart from the instant control, the tricks, the passing range, the shooting and the powerful heading, he has always possessed a fierce work ethic and a respect for the team that marks out the great. </p> <p>The consolation for audiences is that by terminating his international career, Zidane has probably extended his time at the top level of the club game by at least a season. It should also be good news for Michael Owen. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A new season brought a familiar old story from Manchester City, who squandered a first-half lead and a position of apparent comfort to draw with Fulham. A year into occupancy of the City of Manchester Stadium, where they won just five times in the league last season, and City are showing few signs of improving on that dismal record. </p> <p>Received wisdom suggests that a solid start to the season is vital for a City team that capitulated in alarming fashion in the second two-thirds of the last campaign, crucial not only for the team's fragile morale but also for the future of manager Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>Certainly, the opening exchanges of the new term augured well, even if the two key performers in some promising attacking play from City were, up to kick-off at least, the subject of intense transfer speculation. </p> <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips, who is widely expected to win his first England cap in the midweek friendly against Ukraine, had been consistently linked in the summer with Liverpool and Tottenham, before the versatile midfielder signed a new four-year contract with City yesterday. </p> <p>Within two minutes of kick-off, Wright-Phillips had sped, in exhilarating fashion, from the edge of his own area to that of Fulham's, crossing superbly for Nicolas Anelka, who was only denied by Moritz Volz's covering header. </p> <p>Anelka, the itinerant Frenchman whose natural ability is exceeded only by his wanderlust, is the second City player whose future is in the spotlight, alleged moves back to his homeland having been given a regular airing throughout the close season. </p> <p>Yet he, like Wright-Phillips, remains hugely popular among City fans, who saw him come close on a couple of occasions, most notably when he just failed to connect with Claudio Reyna's 13th-minute cross. Reyna was the other influential figure in City's dominant opening, his free-kick soon after finding Wright-Phillips on the edge of the area for a wayward volley. </p> <p>However, when the opening goal arrived it was courtesy of Robbie Fowler, one of City's more anonymous performers to that point, who produced a precise 28th-minute finish after Antoine Sibierski had helped on a long throw-in from Danny Mills. Fowler, whose City career to date has been far from fruitful, scored with a clever, over-the-shoulder lob from 15 yards for a goal that was no more than the Blues deserved. </p> <p>With David James a virtual first-half spectator against a toothless Fulham, the Anelka/Wright-Phillips combination almost worked again just after the half-hour, the latter's shot kept out by Edwin van der Sar with Fowler close to netting the rebound. </p> <p>It promised to get better for City, Anelka narrowly missing the target from the edge of the area just before the break, Wright-Phillips heading just wide from Sibierski's cross just after it. But City would not be City without the inherent ability to self-destruct and, sure enough, Fulham's first attack of note proved the point. </p> <p>There should have been little danger posed from Claus Jensen's 56th-minute cross into the area, accurate as it was, but City's new signing Danny Mills inexplicably stood off Collins John, allowing the Liberian to control the ball and score, right-footed, from 15 yards. </p> <p>James would be required to make one save of importance, keeping out Jensen's 80th-minute shot to prevent City from complete disaster, but the home team's profligacy in front of goal will presumably have given Keegan as much concern as their inadequacy in defence. </p> <p>Van der Sar made a series of impressive saves to prevent City scoring again, first tipping over a Reyna shot from just inside the area, then saving a Sibierski header, denying a deflected shot from his own team-mate Jensen and enjoying a moment of fortune as Sibierski's shot whistled past his goal. </p> <p><strong> Man of the Match</strong> </p> <p><strong> Shaun Wright-Phillips</strong> The expected announcement that the youngster has signed a new four-year contract with City will come as a major fillip for the club and frustrate Tottenham and Liverpool, two of the clubs known to be among his suitors. Wright-Phillips' energy, intuitive play and pace more than make up for his lack of inches as he drove City on. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Derby</strong> picked up their first points of the season in dramatic fashion. Having gone ahead against <strong> Ipswich</strong> and then fallen behind 2-1, they showed admirable character in eventually getting a 3-2 win. </p> <p>The star of the show was their German midfielder Marco Reich, who scored twice. His first goal came early in the first half, when he converted Tommy Smith's cross with a powerful header. The lead lasted only five minutes as Ipswich - who had hardly been in the picture - capitalised on a moment of panic in the Derby defence. </p> <p>Ipswich's Ian Westlake was bundled over in the area by Derby's 17-year-old Nathan Doyle and Tommy Miller had no problem equalising from the penalty spot. Three minutes later Joe Royle's side went ahead as Dean Bowditch pounced on a misplaced back-pass and kept his composure to slot the ball through the keeper's legs. But Inigo Idiakez brought Derby level again and Reich scored their winner. </p> <p><strong> Brighton</strong>, the only other team without a point after two matches, also emphasised their resilience in coming from behind for a 1-1 draw at home to <strong> Coventry</strong>. Both goalkeepers were called into action during a lively opening 45 minutes in which Coventry's Gary McSheffrey had the best opportunities. The Sky Blues eventually got their noses in front through Stephen Hughes, but Adam Virgo equalised in the last minute. </p> <p>It was a mixed afternoon for the teams relegated from the Premiership, with <strong> Leicester</strong> falling 2-0 at <strong> Millwall</strong> and <strong> Wolves</strong> and <strong> Leeds</strong> battling out a goalless draw at Molineux. </p> <p>Leicester struggled to cope with Millwall's strong tackles and direct style of play, and it came as no surprise when Jody Morris put the home team ahead. Daniele Dichio added Millwall's other goal and another setback for Leicester was that Chris Makin was sent off. Leeds's Michael Duberry was also shown the red card. </p> <p>One of the most exciting matches was the one between <strong> Sunderland</strong> and <strong> Queens Park Rangers</strong>. QPR put their indifferent start to the season behind them as they took the lead after just 12 minutes. Their veteran striker Paul Furlong, who contributed 16 goals to Rangers' promotion push last season, picked the ball up just over the halfway line and beat three defenders before hitting a drive into the top corner of Thomas Myhre's goal. </p> <p>Sunderland got back on level terms after 33 minutes. A long ball from Julio Arca was misjudged by the Rangers defence, Marcus Stewart got in behind and showed neat control before slotting the ball inside Chris Day's far post. Martin Rowlands put Rangers in a winning position, but Stephen Caldwell brought Sunderland level again. </p> <p><strong> Crewe</strong> also had to settle for a 2-2 draw after twice being ahead against <strong> Forest</strong>. This was particularly difficult to take for Mark Rivers, who has been moved forward from his usual midfield role by Crewe's boss, Dario Gradi, and who proved the wisdom of that move by causing the opposition defence the most problems. Rivers opened the scoring after 21 minutes at a time when Forest were in the ascendancy. Forest refused to wilt after that setback and clawed themselves back into the game through Gareth Taylor. Rivers took advantage of uncertainty in the home defence to grab his second just one minute before the break, but Forest equalised through Marlon King. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Take a handful of enigmatic zillionaires, a sprinkling of lesser City mortals with a passion for gossip and the most glittering prize in the business of sport, and what do you get? Another week of feverish speculation about the future ownership of Manchester United. </p> <p>Once again, John Magnier and JP McManus, the Irish racing magnates, and Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer find themselves avoiding questions over their plans for Britain's biggest football club. Analysts and supporters alike have been trying to make sense of their ever-growing stakes for the best part of a year. But with the Square Mile awash with rumours that Glazer in particular may be ready to mount a formal takeover bid, is all about to be revealed? </p> <p>A report that Glazer was due to meet Magnier and McManus last Tuesday was denied, but neither side will rule out a future meeting. And news that Glazer is selling $700 million worth of property in America, perhaps as a precursor to buying out the Irish, has also dropped neatly into the rumour-mill. </p> <p>Yet neither Glazer nor the Irish have much reason to welcome speculation that can only force the share price up, making any genuine takeover more expensive and difficult. Unless, that is, the rumours flush out a Russian billionaire or some other hitherto-invisible third party with enough money to buy both of them out. </p> <p>If a bid is genuinely in the pipeline, there are few obvious signs of it at the usual City institutions. Seymour Pierce, the investment bank that advised Glazer on previous United share purchases, is not thought to be working on any new bid. Ditto, apparently, Commerzbank Securities, Glazer's broker in these matters, which would love to take part in such a high-profile deal. Mehmet Dalman, Commerzbank's London boss and a big United fan, declined to comment on last week's rumours. </p> <p>Supporters' organisations, who oppose any takeover, feel frustrated. 'These people seldom make any on-the-record statement about their intentions,' says Oliver Houston of Shareholders United, which represents most of the small shareholders who together own about 17 per cent of the club. 'Spin, speculation and shadowy deals make us even more suspicious about the motives of the predators circling Manchester United.' </p> <p>Magnier and McManus, in fairness, have for some time made clear that they are value investors, with no intention of mounting a takeover. Cubic Expression, their investment vehicle, has not increased its 28.9 per cent holding for months. Most observers believe that if these two exceedingly rich but intensely private men had wanted to take possession of such a public asset they would have done so long ago. </p> <p>On the other hand, they are not entirely passive investors, having kicked up a very public fuss about transfer dealings and corporate governance issues with the United board last season. And if they were just trying to make money they could have picked a better stock than Manchester United. </p> <p>It may be more profitable and better run than any other football club, but this year United's return on equity will be about 7 per cent, and most analysts agree that the company is overpriced at its current market value of about \u00a3630m. </p> <p>Cubic Expression acquired its shares when the price was lower, so Magnier and McManus are sitting on a paper gain worth tens of millions. Turning that into cash, how ever, would not be straightforward, given the market's likely reaction if the Irish began selling. </p> <p>Trying to discern Glazer's motives from the pattern of his share-trading is just as tricky. He has built his 19.2 per cent holding haphazardly, much of it at a price higher than today's. Neither he nor Cubic Expression are able to buy all or even most of each other's stakes without passing the 30 per cent threshold that obliges them to make an all-out bid for United. Both sides seem keen to avoid this hugely expensive option. </p> <p>In fact, it is tempting to conclude that both have inadvertently found themselves sitting on over-large investments they are unable to offload. The only way out of such a stalemate would be to sell to some as-yet unseen benefactor ready to spend hundreds of millions taking United private. </p> <p>For all the club's attractions as a trophy asset, however, white knights are thin on the ground. These days Russian oligarchs are wary of incurring the Kremlin's displeasure by expatriating too much of their wealth. </p> <p>American media conglomerates might be tempted, but one banker with knowledge of the situation discounts even this idea: 'Had there been a third party, he would have surfaced by now. It's absolutely dead now as far as interest is concerned.' </p> <p>Of course, it could be that Glazer genuinely wants control of the club. As owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team he has plenty of experience and there are certainly ways in which more money could be squeezed out of Manchester United. He could revamp its merchandising strategy, market its international TV rights more aggressively, or raise revenues in a stroke by hiking ticket prices. </p> <p>That would put Glazer on a collision course with supporters' groups, who played a key role in scuppering Rupert Murdoch's attempt to buy United six years ago and who control more than the 10 per cent of the company needed to prevent a compulsory share purchase. Cohabiting with a vocal and hostile minority shareholder would be irksome for Glazer, but he may have decided that he could never win over the fans anyway. </p> <p>Probably the more pertinent question is whether Glazer can easily afford to buy all or most of United. As well as the mooted disposal of 37 upmarket shopping centres owned by First Allied, his California-based real estate firm, he has an estimated personal fortune of $750m and numerous business assets that could be mortgaged. </p> <p>City observers believe that, at a pinch, he could raise the funds. It all seems like quite a lot of effort, though, for an American septuagenarian who has never even visited Old Trafford. But then football, as someone wisely said, is a funny old game.</p>",
  "<p><strong> SVEN-GORAN ERIKSSON </strong> has welcomed Michael Owen's move to Real Madrid, viewing it as a new challenge for the striker at a time when he might have been growing too comfortable with his surroundings at Liverpool. </p> <p>'From an England point of view, it doesn't matter where he plays. He was already at a big club in Liverpool,' Eriksson said, before naming the 24- year-old as one of five strikers in his squad to face Ukraine at St James' Park on Wednesday. </p> <p>'From his personal point of view it could be a very good move. He might need another challenge. He has been at Liverpool a long time and playing for Real Madrid is a huge challenge. Michael Owen is one of those players who responds to big challenges. In fact, I'm sure he is. He shows that in the big games.' </p> <p>The big challenge for Owen at the Bernab\u00e9u might just be to get in the side, though Eriksson doubts he has been bought as a substitute. 'I don't think he needs to change the way he plays very much. With players like Figo and Beckham around, he is sure to see the ball played into the box a lot.' </p> <p>Though happy to talk about Owen, Eriksson made it plain that he had no intention of discussing his private life. If Eriksson feels weakened or isolated by the recent 'Fariagate' scandal at the FA, he was determined not to show it. Eriksson says he still trusts his employers and insists he still has the support of everyone within Soho Square. </p> <p>'I will not quit. I love my job and I am going to stay,' he said. 'I am a little bit stubborn like that. I have no intention of leaving unless it is for football reasons. I will quit, maybe, if we fail to qualify for the next World Cup.' </p> <p>The first steps on that road will be taken in Austria and Poland at the start of next month, but for now Eriksson has the friendly against Ukraine to get through. As expected, Shaun Wright-Phillips was named in the 24-man squad and is expected to get a run on Wednesday, arguably six months too late. </p> <p>The squad contains three Newcastle players. Shola Ameobi had to withdraw from contention with a back injury, but England hope the presence of Nicky Butt, Jermaine Jenas and Kieron Dyer will boost sluggish ticket sales on Tyneside. For a variety of reasons, some of them out of their control, the FA have found this game a hard sell. 'I would not like to think England friendlies are no longer popular,' Eriksson said. 'And I am extremely sorry if it's my fault.' </p> <p>Glen Johnson, Chris Kirkland, Jermain Defoe, Matthew Upson and Alan Smith are the other players, along with Wright-Phillips, who failed to make the Euro 2004 squad but have been given a chance now. Aside from those unavailable through injury, or in the case of Paul Scholes's retirement, those who went to Portugal but miss out are Phil Neville, Joe Cole and Ian Walker. </p> <p> <strong> England squad to face Ukraine</strong> </p> <p>James (Man City), Robinson (Tottenham), Kirkland (Liverpool); G Neville (Man Utd), G Johnson (Chelsea), A Cole (Arsenal), Bridge (Chelsea); Terry (Chelsea), King (Tottenham), Carragher (Liverpool), Upson (Birmingham); Beckham (Real Madrid), Lampard (Chelsea), Gerrard (Liverpool), Dyer (Newcastle), Hargreaves (Bayern Munich), Butt (Newcastle), Wright-Phillips (Man City), Jenas (Newcastle); Owen (Real Madrid), Heskey (Birmingham), Vassell (Aston Villa), Defoe (Tottenham), Smith (Man Utd). </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Manchester United's powerful shareholders may seize control of the club without making a formal bid, according to City investment bankers. If successful, they plan to shake up the board where Roy Gardner, Cen trica's boss, is chairman and David Gill is chief executive. </p> <p>It is understood that the plot is being hatched by 19 per cent stakeholder Malcolm Glazer, the American football tycoon, who is looking for support from Cubic Expression, the investment vehicle of Irish racing millionaires J.P. McManus and John Mag nier. He may buy shares from them and other stakeholders to increase his holding. </p> <p>Glazer could exploit a little-known section within Clause 9 of Britain's takeover code to boost his stake to more than 30 per cent without being forced to launch a takeover - which normally applies in such circumstances. </p> <p>Under Takeover Panel rules, a shareholder with 30 per cent or more is spared the obligation of bidding if 50 per cent of the rest of the shareholders are not willing to accept the offer. 'Ideally, that is what Glazer wants,' says a City source. 'But it would need the agreement of the Irish, who control 29 per cent, and the fans who speak for 17 per cent. </p> <p>'In other words, you would need a formal shareholders' agreement. Otherwise he may yet be forced to table an offer for the whole company.' </p> <p>Last week it emerged that Glazer was selling $700m of property in the US, heightening speculation that he is preparing to acquire shares from the Irish, or build a war chest in case he has to bid. </p> <p>Observers say that Glazer and the Irish could find common cause because they are believed to want the board to do far more to boost revenues from the 40 million Man United fans outside Britain. </p> <p>A banker said: 'By exploiting the brand name in places such as the US and China, the shares could motor, and all shareholders would benefit.' </p> <p>Glazer and other shareholders would almost certainly insist that some of their associates join Gardner and Gill on the board in order to ensure that their commercial objectives were met. But United's fans may prove to be the biggest obstacles for Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football club in Florida, </p> <p>Oliver Houston of Shareholders United said: 'Spin and speculation make us even more suspicious about the motives of the predators circling Manchester United.'</p>",
  "<p>Mention the name Wayne Rooney to David Moyes and you can expect a bleak look. The Everton manager does not intend selling him yet and reckons there cannot possibly be any more questions to ask or words to expend on the subject, but even after being taken round the same block at least a thousand times, Moyes has retained his sense of humour. </p> <p>\"Of course I enjoyed his performances for England in the summer,\" he says. \"I didn't have mixed feelings at all, I was jumping for joy every time he did something good. As a Scotsman, that was the hardest bit.\" </p> <p>Fair enough. But ask Moyes the identity of the Everton captain this season and you get another stony stare. \"I'm not ready to announce that yet,\" he says. This hardly seems in the spirit of a media day three days before the new season, but it has not been the easiest of summers at Goodison Park. </p> <p>Welcome as news of \u00a320million of new investment is and with it the possibility of Bill Kenwright winning his boardroom battle with Paul Gregg to retain control of the club, it has come too late to affect today's game against Arsenal and left Moyes with only days in which to resurrect his rebuilding plans before the transfer deadline. Hence the prevarication. </p> <p>There are no certainties at Everton any more and even the complacent view that all three promoted teams will go straight back down is not shared by all supporters. Take the three new arrivals out of the equation and Everton are very much relegation favourites. And although their squads may be modest and their budgets small, what West Brom, Norwich and Crystal Palace have in common is a unity of purpose and a self-sufficient team spirit that Everton may not be able to muster. </p> <p>Not the Everton who picked up just one point from the last 15 on offer last season anyway, the team that subsided so limply once Premiership survival had been secured that they managed to lose 5-1 at Manchester City on the final day. Not the Everton who appear unable to release a player without him complaining about the Goodison regime in his first press conference at his new club. </p> <p>Moyes said at the end of last season that he did not want to start another campaign with the same savagely underfunded squad - \"We are in need of drastic change, I don't want to put the supporters through another season like this\" - and it remains to be seen whether he will see enough of the new money to make a difference. Everton have not just become rich overnight and Moyes may find it as hard to attract players as Kenwright found it difficult to convince investors. </p> <p>Duncan Ferguson is still collecting \u00a337,000 a week for a final season as the invisible man, while Trevor Birch came and went in a few short weeks, the man tipped for the job of sorting out the Football Association proving unable to reconcile any of the factions within Everton. The inevitable upshot has been disillusionment on almost every front. </p> <p>Mark O'Brien, author of a pungently honest yet endearingly optimistic account of Everton's travails last season ( What's Our Name? Everton! , Parrs Wood Press, \u00a38.95) admits that he would not care to keep a diary this time. \"Obviously we are not going to win any trophies and I am much more pessimistic than this time a year ago, but I don't think relegation is a foregone conclusion,\" he says. \"We've still got Rooney, we've still got Moyes. Maybe not forever, but those are still assets. People think Everton could not say no to a decent offer for Rooney and think we cannot afford to pay him \u00a350,000 a week either, but the club have got to bear in mind that Rooney could be the difference between survival and relegation.\" </p> <p>It is sad to hear Everton supporters talking in such a way so soon after the euphoria of Moyes's first full season, although the mood of resigned realism runs right through the club. \"We need troops,\" says former captain Kevin Campbell. \"That was half the problem last season, a lack of fit bodies. You see other clubs bringing in half a dozen new faces over summer and you can't help but envy them. Players want to see new signings. That's what livens you up and keeps everyone sharp.\" </p> <p>The point hardly needed putting to Moyes, whose plea for a summer overhaul has so far resulted in the arrival of Marcus Bent and Tim Cahill. Interest in Michael Carrick will be resumed as soon as Everton get their hands on upfront money to offer West Ham, although that midfield gain may yet be negated if the influential Thomas Gravesen moves on. </p> <p>\"The budget up to now has been a lot smaller than I had hoped and we have been making cuts all the time,\" Moyes says. \"I reckon I only have 18 or 19 usable first teamers left and though I know the board has worked hard to find money for more, the transfer deadline is working against us a bit. I don't want to buy people just to bulk out the squad, but I have to make sure we can get through to Christmas at a time when there isn't much money around.\" </p> <p>Moyes is not even supposed to be a wheeler-dealer type of manager. His forte is coaching, improving players through organisation and awareness, although he is less idealistic about that than he used to be. \"When you are backed into a corner, the only thing to do is come out fighting,\" he says. \"But you can't keep it up forever. Money does make a difference. Coaching and organisation can only take you so far and you tend to find the best coaches work with the best players.\" </p> <p>Few at Everton would argue, especially when Arsenal are in town. Certainly not O'Brien, who admires the hard line Moyes takes with first-team slackers. \"Things look grim on every front, but Everton won't go down,\" he insists. \"We might lose our first game, but there's no shame in losing to Arsenal. It's the result at Crystal Palace a week later I'm worried about.\"</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Eidur Gudjohnsen has become a member of the old guard at Chelsea. Having lasted four years, he is among an elite few whose memories stretch as far back as the days when Gianluca Vialli was manager and Ken Bates owned the Bridge. </p> <p>As Chelsea, in the first years of the twenty-first century, have transformed themselves from bankrupt to bankrolled, major players on the international stage, they have dispensed with dozens of Gudjohnsen's former team-mates. The great survivor, though, recently signed a new four-year, \u00a355,000-a-week contract. The new Chelsea manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has praised him like a favoured son, calling Gudjohnsen 'special' and 'intelligent', essentially indispensable. Is he, though? </p> <p>With Mateja Kezman and Didier Drogba joining the squad, what are the chances of the Icelandic forward lasting another four years? Kezman's statistics are enough to send even the most confident of strikers whimpering into a corner: 105 goals in 112 appearances for PSV Eindhoven. Gudjohnsen is happy to acknowledge the achievement. \"Wow! You have to admire that,\" he says. </p> <p>But he is not intimidated. \"Look at it this way, the first year I signed for Chelsea there was Tore Andre Flo, there was Zola, the best ever Chelsea player; Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink signed in the same week for \u00a315million, and then there was me, a young, talented boy coming from Bolton. I took that challenge. Last year it was me and Jimmy, and then Adrian [Mutu] and Hernan [Crespo] came in and I still ended up being first choice towards the end of the season. I might not always be in from the start, but I always seem to grind out my place in the team.\"</p> <p>Gudjohnsen started 'grinding out' his place from a remarkably young age. He was top scorer at his club, Valur Reykjavik, at 15, and signed for PSV at 16, where he famously partnered Ronaldo. Breaking into the first team during his second season at PSV, he made two appearances alongside the world's most famous forward, taking his place even, when Ronaldo was injured. Then, suddenly, it looked all over. In an Iceland youth international against Ireland, Gudjohnsen suffered a career-threatening injury, shattering his ankle. But, as he has shown at Chelsea, Gudjohnsen is a survivor.</p> <p> \"The doctor at PSV told me he thought I'd never play at a high level again. It was a very frustrating time, very difficult. I found it hard mentally and I could feel people around me starting to lose faith.\" A morose Gudjohnsen returned to Iceland and pondered his future. He was 19 years old. Having once been a hero in his native country, Gudjohnsen shakes his head at the memory of his homecoming. \"When I returned I wasn't the player people remembered. I was overweight, it didn't look like I would turn professional again.\" </p> <p>Oskar Thorvaldsson, sports editor for Iceland's daily newspaper Dagbladid Visir , recalls Gudjohnsen's early days and the impression he made on the public. \"He was like a prodigy. He played his first game in the league when he was 15 and he instantly became one of the best players. He became a celebrity that year, in 1994. He was the future of Icelandic football, no one had had such an influence on the league before.\" </p> <p>In that doleful year of his return in 1998, the Icelandic public would hardly have recognised him. </p> <p>Released from his contract at PSV, local club KR Reykjavik agreed to sign him. With the help of doctors and physiotherapists he embarked upon an excruciating and at times frightening journey. \"They said try to work through the pain barrier. I was in unbelievable pain. I was chewing painkillers, but gradually I just got through it. Like someone said it's either that or go and try to get a job. Well, I left school at 16...' he shrugs as if to say: \"What else was I going to do?\" </p> <p>\"That time taught me a lot about myself as a person. It was probably a blessing in disguise because you get to know yourself a lot better in difficult periods. I never stopped believing. Belief is a major factor in whatever you do. If you don't believe in yourself no one else will. I thought I'd just go for it and run with the pain, shoot every ball with pain. I started getting fitter and I played 10 or 12 games for Reykjavik. Then I signed for Bolton on a free.\"</p> <p>A single day of training on a pre-season tour of Ireland was all it took to convince the then Bolton manager, Colin Todd, to sign the young forward. Even Gudjohnsen's agent at the time, Peter Harrison, expressed his surprise, saying: \"I don't know what you did in training today but they want to sign you straight away.\" </p> <p>Todd describes his first impressions of Gudjohnsen: \"He didn't look like a star. But his natural talent shone through, his overall movement, his quality to bring people into the game and his ability to get into the box and score goals.\" Talent is one thing, but fitness is entirely another and it took Gudjohnsen a further seven months to break into the Bolton first team as a regular. Todd remembers it as a difficult time for the 20-year-old. </p> <p>\"I did stress to him that he'd need patience, that it would take time to get into the first team. He got a little bit disillusioned, started to lose his enthusiasm. There would be times where he was very depressed. He would sulk, he would put all the blame on the manager. I had to fine him in the end, I fine them quite a bit for going back over the weight. But once he got in the first team, he never looked back.\" </p> <p>Gudjohnsen's first major appearances came towards the end of his first season and immediately he made an impression. Scoring the equalising goal in two successive games earned his team two vital points in the race for the play-offs. It also earned Gudjohnsen a lot of attention in the national press. Signing Gudjohnsen proved a gamble that paid off for Bolton. Twenty-one goals and two seasons later he was sold to Chelsea for a tidy profit of \u00a35m, Tottenham and Newcastle also having shown a keen interest. Rumour has it that even Manchester United had been asking after him. </p> <p>Although clearly not their biggest signing that year, Gudjohnsen proved a shrewd buy for Chelsea, scoring 10 goals in 17 league starts in his first season. Most eye-catching, though, was his fast-developing goal-scoring relationship with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. The two forwards could not have appeared more different, Hasselbaink with his hulking shoulders and fiery eyes, the power in his strike as fearful as his swagger; and Gudjohnsen with his light-footed touch directing through-balls into the Dutchman's path. </p> <p>Gudjohnsen is visibly pleased at the memory. \"We had great chemistry,\" he says, pausing to laugh as though at a private joke. \"We just seemed to be laughing at the same things, silly or not. Ebony and ivory, we had a lot of names... fire and ice people used to call us. Jimmy's more the emotional type on the pitch, the fiery guy, he wants the ball all the time and he will shout and scream at everyone. I'd just say, \"Yeah, relax, I'll give you the ball, don't worry. We respected each other, we complemented each other. I felt at my best when I was providing goals for him.\" </p> <p>An air of nostalgia lurks in this last sentiment, a nod back to a different era. \"When I look back two or three seasons ago, I thought I was unstoppable. I felt like I could control any ball from any angle, see every through-ball, and that's to do with confidence. There was a period when I knew my name was going to be on the team sheet, that's something I'll work hard for again. When that continuity comes hopefully I'll reach the same level and beyond.\" Gudjohnsen and Hasselbaink scored more than 50 goals between them that second season and Gudjohnsen is openly disappointed about the disruption to their work. Although both players were recovering from minor injuries in the close season of 2001, Gudjohnsen feels strongly that Claudio Ranieri should have been more proactive in getting them back to full fitness. </p> <p>\"When you've got a partnership like that you've really got to try to do everything to get it going again. The manager could have done more to get us playing, with Franco [Zola] behind us maybe.\" There are lingering regrets over the Ranieri era, a period of unfulfilled potential as Gudjohnsen sees it. \"I thought four years under Ranieri was a bit of an indifferent time. We didn't reach, I thought, the potential of the team or the squad in those four years.\"</p> <p> The arrival of Mourinho clearly excites Gudjohnsen. \"You have to be impressed by him. This manager is just an out-and-out winner, if he can spread that winning mentality into the squad and into the team it could be our year.\" Having survived uncertain times at Chelsea it is clear just how vital this belief has been for Gudjohnsen. </p> <p>When other players around him were losing their heads and making public their feelings at being left on the bench, Gudjohnsen was able to keep cool and wait his turn. With 27 out of a total of 44 appearances for Chelsea last season having come in the latter half of the year, it was undoubtedly a ploy that paid off for him. </p> <p>Whatever the sceptics may think, Gudjohnsen is clear as to what his role will be in the new Chelsea. \"As long as I'm scoring or setting up goals I feel I'm doing my job. Both Didier [Drogba] and Kezza [Kezman] are out-and-out strikers and if I can be the one helping them to score I'll be glad to do that. I've still got a hell of a lot to offer to Chelsea. With a bit of luck and a lot of confidence I can really blossom.\" </p> <p>His progress will be watched by his family around him. \"My mother knows football and she'll have her opinions, whether I should have made this run or that run.\" And do they see eye to eye? He laughs. \"I don't usually tell her if I disagree.\" It is his father, though, with whom he shares perhaps the strongest bond. Arnar Gudjohnsen was a successful footballer before him, one of the best players in the Belgian league in the late 1980s. He, too, was an Iceland international and in one memorable game son came on as substitute for father. \"I've always thought my dad was a fantastic footballer, the best I've ever seen. He's helped me a lot. He's a great father, a great friend and he's now also my agent.\" The Icelandic people seem to regard Gudjohnsen junior as a hero. Even when it emerged that he had spent more than \u00a3400,000 playing blackjack and roulette in London's casinos during a five-month period, they stood by him. \"There were stories flying about that I had nothing left, that I was basically living on the street! Luckily I have never felt any animosity or negativity from the people [in Iceland], they are always amazing to me and that makes me feel very proud.\" </p> <p>Gudjohnsen will eventually return to Iceland. His roots are important to him and he has made sure that his two children are fluent in both English and Icelandic. \"We have traditional Icelandic meals at Christmas. If we have people visiting they'll bring something typically Icelandic, such as harfiskur . It's just dried fish that you eat with a bit of butter, it's amazing. It's a terrible smell, though.\" </p> <p>With that, Gudjohnsen suppresses a yawn. His team-mates are wandering back and forth in their Chelsea regulation flip-flops and with an embarrassed smile he leans in for confession: \"I'm usually sleeping by now.\" The new Chelsea season promises to be a wide-eyed rollercoaster ride of action.

  "<p>Djibril Ciss\u00e9 the post-Michael Owen era got off to a flying start with the first Premiership goal of the season, only to see Liverpool pegged back by a Tottenham side that improved immeasurably after the interval. </p> <p>Either Jacques Santini is a master of the half-time pep talk or Spurs needed those 15 minutes to introduce themselves to each other. Leeds attracted comment for fielding seven debutants in their opening game in the Championship last week, but at least they could claim exceptional circumstances. In addition to a new manager, Spurs had six new faces, among them 17-year-old Phil Ifil taking his place in defence alongside 34-year-old Nourredine Naybet. The latter had arrived on Friday and had time to fit in only one training session, so if Spurs played like strangers in the first half, they had every excuse. Of the back five, only Ledley King was there last season. </p> <p>Spurs played quite well in the first half, with Erik Edman getting forward well, Pedro Mendes and Sean Davis showing some clever touches and Johnnie Jackson holding position and possession on the left. The only problem with discovering a midfield where previously there was nothing was that Spurs forgot to link it with attack. Liverpool took about 10 minutes to work out that all the home side's fancy stuff was not leading anywhere, before taking a midfield grip themselves through Steven Gerrard and Dietmar Hamann and giving the Spurs back line plenty of problems. </p> <p>The good news for the composed but outgunned Ifil is that he will not have to mark Harry Kewell every week, while Naybet will be relieved to know he will not be required to spend the whole season putting out penalty- area fires in searing heat. Acting heroically as a screen for Paul Robinson, the Spanish veteran put his body in the way of shots from Milan Baros and Gerrard before his block from Kewell's low cross led to Liverpool's opener. </p> <p>Spurs were unable to clear Steve Finnan's corner, giving the winger another chance, and when Jamie Carragher won a header, Ciss\u00e9 pounced. It was far from the most spectacular goal the former Auxerre striker has scored, but Owen would have approved of the crispness of finish. </p> <p>Liverpool were just about worth the lead, too, having been denied what would have been a legitimate though harsh penalty when Gerrard hit the turf a little too enthusiastically when Ifil tugged his shirt. </p> <p>According to the managers, the game changed in the second half when Spurs began launching long balls from the back. Santini was happy with the transformation - 'In the first half we just defended, no play no risk' - Rafael Ben\u00edtez was not. Or rather the Liverpool manager was unhappy with his team's attempts to deal with the new tactic. </p> <p>'We began to lose possession in the second half,' he said. 'The long balls pushed us back and we needed to press better to claim the second balls. We paid a price for not taking more of our chances in the first half because it was very tiring in that heat.' </p> <p>Whatever, the result was that Jermain Defoe equalised 19 minutes from the end, finally finding the finish his promising close control and tight turning deserved, although not before Ben\u00edtez had withdrawn Ciss\u00e9, to be followed 15 minutes later by Baros. The manager blamed the heat, although for all Florent Sinama-Pongolle's promise, Ben\u00edtez will not win over post-Owen doubters if he makes a habit of hauling off his strikers. </p> <p>Watched by Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Defoe demonstrated the ability to spin past Sami Hyypia on several occasions without threatening Jerzy Dudek's goal. The shot with which he equalised was arguably Spurs' first on target. The only other candidate was a clearance off the line in the first half by John Arne Riise, although Jackson's shot was probably going wide. There was a suggestion of handball from Defoe as he controlled Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9's knockdown, but nothing wrong with a finish that left Dudek looking sheepishly at the near-post gap he thought he had covered. Defoe's bare-chested celebrations were cut short when Sinama-Pongolle reminded the referee of his obligation to book him. Happy new season. </p> <p>Spurs finished stronger, although Liverpool came closest to a second when only Robinson's sharp reactions prevented Carragher's header from a corner. </p> <p>The worry for both managers must be that too little has changed, not too much. For a mid-August fixture, this bore an uncanny resemblance to an end-of-season game. </p> <p> <strong> MAN OF THE MATCH</strong> </p> <p><strong> Erik Edman</strong> The Sweden full-back was among the most composed and impressive of the numerous players making their debuts at White Hart Lane, rarely putting a foot wrong in defence or attack for Tottenham and launching the pass - sorry, long ball - from which Jermain Defoe scored the equaliser. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Arsonists are being blamed for fires that destroyed a listed Art Deco arcade in central Belfast. <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland has confirmed that it has already interviewed several suspects over the attack at North Street Arcade. It is understood that their inquiries are focused on two individuals with paramilitary pasts. </p> <p>Traders who lost their businesses in the blaze last April have also demanded a public inquiry into the background and circumstances of the fire. </p> <p>More than 20 shops as well as several arts organisations were made homeless following the attack. </p> <p>The glass roof, which was listed as an historic artefact, was destroyed in the fires. It has since emerged that the protected roof was one of the key targets of the arsonists. </p> <p>A PSNI spokesman said: 'The forensic examination of the scene concluded at the end of April, a number of seats of fire were found. </p> <p>'Police are continuing to treat the fire as malicious and inquiries are continuing. At this stage it is thought that the fires were started at both the North Street and Donegall Street entrances. A number of people have been interviewed.'</p> <p>The Observer has also learnt that the cause of the fires at either end of the arcade was blast incendiaries of the type used by para militaries during the Troubles. One of those who lost his premises in the blaze was the so-called godfather of Ulster punk and discoverer of the Undertones, Terri Hooley. </p> <p>The founder of Good Vibrations Records has led the campaign to obtain the truth behind the cause of the blaze. </p> <p>'We definitely want a public inquiry into this fire as it not only made us homeless but destroyed a listed building,' he said. </p> <p>Hooley revealed that three days before the arson traders spotted a man measuring up the dimensions of the arcade on either entrance. </p> <p>'This was strange because the plans of the arcade containing the details of the building are easily available,' he said. </p> <p>He claimed that the PSNI had the names of the chief suspects but criticised the police for failing to update the traders over their investigation. </p> <p>'If this had happened to any historically listed building in any other city there would have been a public outcry. </p> <p>'But we have established a strong lobby and we are not going to go away and forget about this. There should be a public inquiry as to how and why this place was destroyed.' </p> <p>North Street Arcade, which is situated in the Cathedral Quarter area of downtown Belfast, was built in the Art Deco style in 1936 and was regarded a chic shopping mall that lifted the spirits of the passers-by and shoppers alike during the Depression.</p>",
  "The IRA leadership has held a top-level conference to quell internal dissent over Gerry Adams's remarks that the terrorist group may disband. <p>Senior IRA figures - including key Adams allies such as Bobby Storey and Sean 'Spike' Murray - met members of its South Armagh brigade in the border region 10 days ago. </p> <p>The meeting took place just over the frontier at a hotel in north Louth. It was convened in response to Adams's statement that the IRA needed to disband to prevent Unionists exploiting its existence as an excuse to avoid sharing power with republicans. </p> <p>The Sinn Fein president's comments during the West Belfast Festival were said to have sent shockwaves through the republican movement particularly in south Armagh. Adams said he envisaged the IRA going out of business as part of a 'process of sustainable change'. This was the first time he had baldly stated that the IRA disappear in order to boost the peace process. </p> <p>Whenever dissent is raised over the republican leadership's political initiatives Storey and his comrades are dispatched to potentially recalcitrant units to win them over. During the build up to the IRA ceasefire 10 years ago Storey played a leading role in persuading Provo units to back the military cessation. </p> <p>Among the Belfast IRA delegation at the meeting was Brendan 'Bik' McFarlane who was convicted in 1975 for a bomb and gun attack on the Bayardo Bar on Belfast's Shankill Road. McFarlane is one of Adams's most trusted supporters. </p> <p>Suspecting they were under security force surveillance, the leading Provos answered questions by passing written notes between them and their south Armagh colleagues. </p> <p>A senior Garda source said the Belfast IRA men were subjected to vigorous questioning by their south Armagh comrades. He added that the meeting broke up amicably without any indication of a split emerging. </p> <p>Significantly, the leading figure in the IRA's south Armagh brigade Thomas 'Slab' Murphy was not present at the meeting which took place in the hotel prior to lunch time. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a serious schism has emerged inside Sinn Fein in Antrim Town. An entire branch of the party has resigned in protest over a row on the Rathenraw estate in recent weeks. The argument with the Sinn Fein leadership in Belfast began following disagreements over what to do about a woman on the estate whose partner was arrested with half a million pounds' worth of ecstasy tablets. Locals backed by Antrim Sinn Fein representatives asked the woman to leave the Rathenraw but the republican leadership in Belfast ordered the local party branch to back her right to stay. Apart from resignations including a number of election candidates there have been allegations that a Belfast Sinn Fein member issued death threats to his former comrades on the Antrim estate.</p>",
  "In the darkness an hour before dawn the floodlights snapped on, shining into the tiled courtyard of the ancient Imam Ali shrine in the heart of the old city of Najaf. Silently, streams of militia fighters left their weapons and walked into the mosque, led by the call to prayer. <p>They washed their hands and faces, joked with friends, visited the wounded in the makeshift hospital and knelt to pray. There they chanted intonations to their leader, the rebel cleric Muqtada Sadr whose 10-day uprising has shaken the fragile grip of Iraq's new government. </p> <p>We left the courtyard where we had slept the night on a carpet under the open sky, and followed them back to the front lines. It was Friday morning, only hours before the militia agreed a truce with the US military and Iraqi forces to begin negotiating an end to the rebellion in the holy city. </p> <p>As they had every morning for a week, US tanks and Humvee armoured personnel carriers pushed towards the narrow alleys of the sprawling old city, controlled by the militia, in a test of strength. 'Ali be with you,' the fighters said as they passed one other. 'Ya Muqtada, Ya Mohammad, Ya Ali,' they chanted. </p> <p>'The Americans took a new position and we attacked. They didn't succeed,' said one stocky, bearded man carrying a Kalashnikov rifle. 'They tried to move forward to control a new position and then moved back. It happens every morning, but it is the first time it has happened here.' </p> <p>For at least an hour the two sides traded heavy machine-gun fire and the militia lobbed mortars towards the American tanks, several hundred metres east of the shrine. The militia cheered when a sniper reported a tank was on fire, although it seemed unlikely. Then the Americans fired back at the sniper's position atop an abandoned three-storey building. Moments later he was carried down, badly injured with his head in his hands. Two friends lifted him into the back of a pickup truck that raced to the hospital in the mosque. </p> <p>'We hit a tank with our mortar and fired our BKC [a Russian machine gun],' said Jalal Hamood, 22, who had been with the militia for four months and alongside the sniper in the building. 'The tank fired back and made huge holes in the roof and our friend was hurt.' Hamood, dressed in a T-shirt printed with the words 'Oh Hussein, Oh Martyr' was covered in dust. He spent several minutes cleaning the debris out of his machine gun with methylated spirits as the others smoked furiously. </p> <p>And so the fighting contin ued. Sadr's several hundred militiamen were outnumbered and heavily outgunned, yet yesterday they remained in control of the streets of the old city as the truce took hold. The US military appeared to have pulled back from the cordon it had set up at dawn last Thursday and Sadr celebrated victory even as the negotiations went on. </p> <p>A procession of thousands of his supporters drove down from his stronghold in the eastern slums of Sadr City in Baghdad yesterday into Najaf and to the Imam Ali shrine. Behind them came trucks of food and medicines, a gift to the Shia from the Sunni resistance stronghold of Falluja, north-west of Baghdad, and an astonishing sign of unity among disparate fighting groups who feel ever more emboldened to take on the Iraqi government. </p> <p>Yesterday, Sadr's men in other southern cities continued to fight against the US-led multi-national forces, cheered by the appearance of the cleric, one arm bandaged from a shrapnel wound, before crowds of militiamen in the shrine at midnight on Friday. </p> <p>Throughout the week the golden-domed shrine had been at the centre of the rebellion. It was here that Sadr probably spent his days and here that his young clerics controlled the fight through radios and mobiles. Fighters would check their weapons at the gate and walk in to collect plastic containers of water, or to have their wounds bandaged. Every few hours the mosque's loudspeakers exhort his men to battle. </p> <p>'You are defending Imam Ali, the prince of the faithful. Hit them and protect your shrine. Hit them and protect your holy city. Be patient and fight. Victory will be yours with the help of God,' they announced at one stage. An hour later, after midday prayers, it continued: 'Fighters return to your positions. The enemy is running away. Go to your places immediately.' </p> <p>In the end the sanctity of the shrine, one of the holiest sites in the Shia faith, is what gave Sadr his strength. It left the Iraqi government and the US reluctant to press on into the old city, however much the US military commanders wanted to. Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, admitted as much when he said the US was 'squeezing' Najaf to stop the fighting but then added: 'We do not wish to get involved with the mosque. It's a very holy place for all Shia.' </p> <p>Wresting control from more moderate clerics of the mosque and its vast annual revenue from pilgrims was itself a key victory for Sadr. </p> <p>The strength of this young cleric, the scion of a revered religious family, was his populist call to arms. For five days, fighters told us again and again they were fighting for their religion but then described at length how they struggled to find work, how they were frustrated that the welcome defeat of Saddam Hussein had brought such little improvement to their lives. We spent one morning with a group of men from the southern city of Amara, who had a position behind abandoned houses and hotels just short of the vast Valley of Peace cemetery to the north of the shrine that had become the key frontline. </p> <p>On one wall was written in chalk: 'Saddam the criminal.' One fighter, Abbas, injured three times, spoke of the hatred for Saddam. </p> <p>'He should be handed to the Iraqi people and cut into slices. He destroyed the whole nation,' he said. 'But still we are facing the same economic problems. There are other religious parties but they co-operate with the government and we don't believe in them.' </p> <p>Their attraction to Sadr was that he had held out against the United States and its Iraqi supporters in the new government. </p> <p>Another day, a second group of fighters, again from Amara, sat to rest in a basement and complained about the difficulty of finding jobs. Many had been farmers or conscripts in Saddam's army. All had been in Najaf for five months, since Sadr's first uprising last April. </p> <p>'Most of the people who are fighting are very poor. They don't even have the money to get to Najaf,' said Hassan al-Amari. 'Only those who are with the Iraqi exiles are getting jobs,' said Latif al-Khalisi, a man who escaped four death sentences under Saddam for suspected membership of the Da'awa, then the leading Shia opposition group. 'The people in the West don't think about the poor people who are living here in Iraq.' </p> <p>The men spoke boldly of their courage, but many were clearly scared by the fight. They spoke to their families by phone, playing down the risks they faced. 'I'm OK,' said one. 'There is no fighting around me. They gave me a rest. You can hear shooting? That is far away. Don't worry.' </p> <p>Although Sadr had thousands of supporters around him yesterday, his remains a movement of extremists unloved by the majority of the Iraqi population, however frustrated they are with the military occupation of the past year. </p> <p>As we walked back from the mosque, past the frontlines, Iraqis sat on their doorsteps watching. 'Why do you come here to see the misery in Najaf?' said one woman. 'May God take his revenge on the one who is responsible for this.' Another man ran to us shouting: 'Muqtada and his thugs are outlaws. They are criminals and they are not from Najaf.' </p> <p>Many of the houses, pilgrims hotels and shops had been destroyed by the fighting. Large roadside bombs, artillery shells with wires leading from them, still lay in place every few hundred metres along the main streets. </p> <p>In a large grocery shop, a few hundred yards from where the US military set up its cordon last Thursday and Friday, shop owner Raad Abdul Karim said Najaf was in the grip of 'a tragedy'. </p> <p>'There is no security, no basic rights, there is fighting between the Iraqi people. It is unnatural,' he said. 'Muqtada Sadr's militia has some good people and others who are bad. But we just want to live peacefully. After three wars we have had enough. We just want somebody who can bring peace and security.'</p>",
  "A quarter of a century ago, following a family tragedy, a rabbi from America wrote a book designed to help people in his situation. He called it When Bad Things Happen to Good People, and it sold millions. What Harold S Kushner sought to resolve was the old conundrum of why, if God is all-powerful and God is also good, he dumps upon the righteous. The conclusion was that God doesn't actually do these bad things himself, he simply doesn't interfere to stop them - because if he did get involved then we'd be less human. <p>Unfortunately, Kushner never got round to the self-help book that we all needed this week, the one entitled When Good Things Happen to Bad People, or how to deal with the unbearable spectacle of the wicked (or their families) prospering, when their victims (and us) don't. </p> <p>Just yesterday one newspaper revealed that Primrose Shipman, the wife of Britain's biggest serial killer, will - if she lives till she's 80 - have received half a million pounds in pension payments on behalf of her self-slaughtered husband. Norman Brennan of the Victims of Crime Trust told a reporter: 'It is absolutely staggering that (Shipman) has left his wife better off than any one of his family's victims. Who says crime doesn't pay? For Mrs Shipman it appears to have paid very well indeed.' </p> <p>Mr Brennan is, of course, over-stating his case. My guess is that Mrs Shipman would probably have preferred to have married a man who didn't turn out to be a mass murderer, even if it meant foregoing an early pension. But you know what he means; it don't seem fair. </p> <p>And it seemed even more unfair, earlier last week, when it was discovered that Iorworth Hoare, a convicted serial sex attacker, had won a third of a \u00a321 million national lottery jackpot. Hoare was staying at a bail hostel in Middlesbrough when he bought his ticket, on release from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire, where he is coming to the end of his sentence. </p> <p>Hoare was immediately punished for his good fortune by being banged up in a high security jail, supposedly in case he decided to use his money to abscond, but in reality because his win made the rest of us as mad as hell. It made the Home Secretary furious, it made the Culture Secretary spit. In Thursday's Sun David Blunkett wrote: 'We can't stop a prisoner or their family from buying a ticket, but we can look closely at making sure they don't benefit from a single penny while in prison.' </p> <p>Another Home Office minister hoped that Hoare would be taken to the cleaners by one of his victims in a civil compensation suit, though this is, in fact, most unlikely. A Home Office statement said it was 'clearly unpalatable' that Hoare should have won the lottery. </p> <p>But there is something about the scale, about the disproportionality of the outrage, that begs another explanation. This concentration on the one story, the suggestions of legislation to close a 'loophole' through which - given the odds - nothing will ever pass again, conveys a sense of almost psychic disturbance. Lotteries, we know (or we sort-of know) are precisely designed to be the most random events possible. To lament their winners is as sensible as standing next to a fruit machine complaining about who it pays out to. The word 'palatable' cannot really apply; a lottery is blind to knowledge, calculation and virtue. </p> <p>In the unromantic Hellenistic period between the death of Alexander and the supremacy of Rome, one of the most popular deities in the many, scattered city states of Greece, Italy and Asia Minor was Tykhe, the goddess of fortune. Often surnamed Automatia - a name implying that she arranged things according to her own whim, and not to mens' virtues - Tyche was depicted holding a ball (the wheel of fortune) representing the capacity of luck to go in any direction. </p> <p>But why, in that case, be good, if virtuous acts were in no way linked to reward? If, indeed, you could be brought low despite your goodness? Because, said the Greeks, if you acted well and honourably, then when Tykhe whimsically pulled the rug out from under you, you would have many friends on hand to grieve with you and offer consolation. One lesson they derived from this was that he who showed mercy and leniency to others, might more easily expect to be treated well when he needed mercy to be shown to him. </p> <p>The same general idea is to be found in the parable of the prodigal son. One brother takes his inheritance early, buggers off abroad, and 'there wasted his substance with riotous living'. When he returns, made contrite, not by conscience but by hunger, he gets given the best robe, a ring, new shoes and the fatted calf. No wonder his brother is cross about it. He's been good and worked hard and hasn't had so much as a 21st birthday party. But this being a parable and not real life, the aggrieved son is easily persuaded that it is terrific that his brother is back and that he should join in the feast. </p> <p>In fact the story of the prodigal son is psychologically intolerable. It's not just that the good son probably understands full well that, after a month or two of obedience and chastity, the bad son will be consorting with harlots again. It's also because he will believe the father's behaviour to be monstrously unfair. Ask anyone whose parent has made a will leaving the bulk of their assets to the 'poor' child, rather than dividing them equally. This is the reward for virtue, is it? A slap in the face. </p> <p>In fact anything which divides the parental legacy anything other than completely equally may drive us mad. Long before the parables of Jesus were written up, Genesis had the brothers of Joseph insane with jealousy because their father had given the boy the coat of many colours. Now, they may have been wrong to decide to slay Joseph and throw him in a pit, but they were right to conclude that the coat represented a greater love for him than their father had for them. </p> <p>So it's not the money as such; it's the love, or the lack of it - it's the need and its non-fulfilment. As young children, said Freud, we experience the pain of dependence, of parental neglect, or parental preference, of intense rivalry with our siblings. The arrival, for instance, of a baby brother or sister is, for a young child, what some have called a 'narcissistic catastrophe'. The way we deal with these terrible feelings of hatred and loss, these memories, is to repress them, to drive them underground and into the unconscious. Where they wait for some Hoare to revive them. </p> <p>And this is why analysts and self-help books almost invariably (as my psychoanalyst friend explained to me) begin by pointing out to their patients and readers that this is an unfair world. Everything is unequal. Love is unequal. At the most primary level, when we are infants our mothers have power and resources that we need to stay alive, while we have none at all. Inequality, a lack of justice, is built in, and you have to deal with it or go bonkers. </p> <p>This doesn't mean, of course, that you don't bother - once out of infancy - to try and create more just and more equal outcomes, where you can. That you don't try and treat people properly. But it might mean not getting our collective knickers into such a preposterous twist about something we cannot prevent, and that really doesn't matter. No-one commits rape because he believes that he might one day win the lottery.</p>",
  "The smiling face of former New York mayor Ed Koch beams down from posters all over the city. 'The Republicans are coming,' it says underneath. 'Make nice.' <p>Fat chance. New York is bracing for one of the biggest showdowns in its political history as the Republican national convention comes to town at the end of the month. Meeting the army of delegates, politicians and lobbyists will be a vast array of protest groups that intend to make the Republicans' Big Apple stay as unpleasant as possible. Trying to keep order on the streets will be 20,000 police, secret servicemen and National Guard units. A quiet week seems out of the question. </p> <p>Jamie Moran certainly hopes so. He is one of the main driving forces behind the protest movement which has sprung up since the Republicans announced they would gather in New York. He and others have been collecting information on all aspects of the convention. </p> <p>They run a 'snitch line' where people involved in the convention can leak details of events and where delegates have been staying. The protesters are widely believed to have infiltrated several people into working at the convention who will smuggle information out. Moran's plan is to send out teams of activists to disrupt as many events as possible. </p> <p>'It's all coming along well,' he told The Observer at a meeting of protest groups in a city church. Moran, 30, son of a local cop, has become a minor media star in New York, but he is far from alone in plotting to make the city a place the Republican party will be reluctant to return to. In all, more than 250,000 protesters from all over the US and the rest of the world are expected to converge on the city during the four-day event. </p> <p>Maps of where Republican events are being held have been distributed. They contain details of where delegates are staying, lobbyists' parties are being held and major corporate headquarters are located. Streets will be shut down, impromptu marches held, meetings disrupted and parties invaded. </p> <p>Sit-down demonstrations will block traffic, protesters will chain themselves together and delegates' hotels will be infiltrated. There will be organised protests and marches, with City Hall permits, that are expected to attract hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. </p> <p>John Flanigan and Tim Doody are two other protest co-ordinators aiming to make 31 August a day of direct action. They said they would shun the idea of applying for any form of permit. </p> <p>'We already have a permit. It is called the American constitution. The idea that I have to ask for permission to protest my own government is ridiculous,' Flanigan said. </p> <p>Sitting on the steps of St Mark's church in the East Village, the pair typified the anger felt by protesters that the Republicans are holding their convention in a city that prides itself on its liberalism. 'This has really shaken everyone out of their complacency. People are outraged,' said Doody. </p> <p>Polls support that reaction. A recent survey showed that 83 per cent of New Yorkers did not want the convention in their city. 'We all live here,' said Angela Coppola, an office worker who has joined the protest groups. 'We were the victims of 11 September and now they are coming to terrorise us with their asinine convention.' </p> <p>New York was chosen by the Republicans with an eye on associating the party with the terror attacks of 2001. But now it runs the risk of having the media coverage turn into pictures of street battles and mass arrests. However, that may not necessarily upset Republican strategists. TV footage of besieged delegates inside Madison Square Garden may boost George Bush's poll ratings in key, socially conservative Midwest states. </p> <p>New York police are preparing for the worst. Manhattan's District Attorney's office has said that it expects 1,000 arrests a day during the convention, three times the normal rate. Police will have 'non-lethal' weapons such as tasers (electric stun guns), plastic bullets and pepper spray. Any illegal protest is expected to be cracked down on immediately. </p> <p>At a press briefing last week, mayor Mike Bloomberg was firm about the police attitude to protesters without permits: 'If you disrupt traffic, if you behave in a way that is against the law, the NYPD will enforce the law. Period.' </p> <p>Huge preparations have been made to combat the threat of terrorism. New York, along with Washington and Newark, New Jersey, is likely to still be on a heightened state of terrorist alert. Checkpoints will be set up around the convention centre, helicopter flights over the city will be banned and New York-bound trains will be searched by anti-bomb units using sniffer dogs. </p> <p>The convention itself, featuring speakers such as Senator John McCain and Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California, will culminate in the prime-time acceptance speech of Bush himself. But by then it is possible that events on the streets will be all anyone is talking about.</p>",
  "On the way to drop off her 21-month-old son, Jude, at nursery on Friday morning, Sue Black stopped to buy a gift for the staff who looked after him. Like millions of working parents, the former operations director with Universal Pictures had watched a television documentary the previous evening with horror and heartache. It brought tears to her eyes when one nursery worker repeatedly reprimanded a child for scratching his eczema while another tormented a two-year-old with a biscuit. <p>Most mothers were left wracked with guilt, wondering whether similar abuses were happening to their children. But Black had no such anxieties. She felt only relief that she had trusted her instincts and moved her son to a nursery where, at the touch of a button, she could monitor his care online through a webcam. </p> <p>The Hove-based Cbabiesafe is believed to be the UK's first webcam nursery. At any time, parents can log on with their own password and check that their child is safe and happy. 'I just wasn't happy with the first nursery Jude was in. There was no energy in the place. I felt awful about leaving him there and after four weeks we decided to move him. At first I used the webcam a lot. Now I only use it occasionally, but it is great to know it is there,' Black said. </p> <p>Such peace of mind comes at a high price. A week at Cbabiesafe costs \u00a3250. But after the BBC's investigation, Nurseries Undercover, it is becoming increasingly apparent that high-quality childcare cannot be provided cheaply. </p> <p>The expos\u00e9 showed a worker at a nursery in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, grabbing a child by his shoulder and hurling him on to a mat. In west London, a reporter posing as a volunteer filmed a nursery worker asleep on duty and showed staff failing to empty potties before other children used them. At a third nursery, in Greater Manchester, the reporter was not asked for a CV. She found inadequate staffing levels and workers who shouted at children. One child, not yet two, was described as 'a whinger' and was left to cry for half an hour. </p> <p>The programme has reignited the debate about what constitutes proper childcare. It comes at an awkward time for both the Department for Education and Skills and Ofsted, the national schools inspectorate, which took over the inspection of nurseries last year. </p> <p>Earlier this summer, there was furious argument over research suggesting that children under two may be more likely to develop aggressive and antisocial behaviour if they are cared for in nurseries. This further fuelled parents' worries. </p> <p>Ministers are due to publish a strategy for the future of childcare in Britain in the autumn, a generation later than many other European countries, and are acutely aware that plans to expand pre-school places - which will allow more parents to work and prepare toddlers for school - depend heavily on persuading parents their children will be safe. </p> <p>Some childcare experts would like to see webcams in every nursery, but only five in England and one in Scotland have them. However, others say such tactics infringe children's human and privacy rights and point to the latest craze in the United States, where parents have hidden video cameras inside teddy bears to observe their nannies secretly. They favour a complete overhaul of the training, inspection and regulation of nurseries. </p> <p>Rosemary Murphy, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, worries that hackers could access pictures of children, but she does not believe the childcare system would benefit from further rules. 'More regulation does not lead to good practice.' </p> <p>Instead, Murphy wants higher levels of qualification for those in charge of nurseries. 'If you look at a primary school, you could have a head teacher who is in charge of seven or eight staff, whereas a manager of a nursery could be responsible for 20. I think we need to look towards a system where graduates are in charge of nurseries which, of course, requires paying them much more money.' </p> <p>In Sweden, Denmark and New Zealand, those working in nursery education are required to have a higher educational qualification, whereas in the UK managers are required only to have the equivalent of a diploma in nursery nursing and half of the workforce must have a level-two National Vocational Qualification.' </p> <p>Back in the Cbabiesafe nursery on Friday, parents had mixed views on the best way forward. All four mothers who were asked agreed that the webcam gave them more reassurance that their children were being well cared for. Staff said that they had no concerns about parents keeping a watchful eye on them. </p> <p>But Sharon Sutherland, whose 18-month-old daughter, Ava, has attended the nursery for almost a year, said it was not the deciding factor. 'Other things, such as the consistency and attitude of staff, are far more important. When it comes to giving your most treasured possession to someone, you have to have total faith in the place. That has nothing to do with qualifications or whether they have a webcam. It is all about the staff and, for this job, someone's either got it or they haven't.'</p>",
  "<p>Unions at British Airways are threatening to work together in a campaign of lightning strikes later this month that would throw summer holiday travel into chaos.</p> <p>The GMB union, whose 2,600 BA members at Heathrow, Gatwick and other airports last week voted to strike over pay, said that it would seek to combine with the Transport and General Workers' Union if its ballot of 8,000 members went the same way this week. </p> <p>The GMB chief negotiator, Allan Black, is meeting shop stewards tomorrow to decide whether, and on what basis, to continue discussions with BA and what action to take if talks prove fruitless. BA is keen to continue discussions, fearing a repeat of last summer's strikes at Heathrow, which disrupted holiday travel for 100,000 people and cost the airline \u00a340 million. </p> <p>The GMB has rejected a pay offer from BA totalling 8.5 per cent over three years. The sum would rise to 10.5 per cent if the increase was not pensionable. </p> <p>The GMB says baggage handlers earn \u00a314,000 a year, while check-in staff earn less. Black told The Observer that he had proposals to put to BA, and that he would be discussing them with shop stewards tomorrow. He added that, if the T&amp;G voted for strikes, he would discuss co-ordinating action. </p> <p>'Of course, we would act with the T&amp;G if they got a \"yes\" ballot. I would think these will be short-term disruptions, planned for more than once a week,' he said, adding that half-day stoppages caused as many problems as day-long action. 'If we do take action, August bank holiday weekend will be targeted,' he said. </p> <p>T&amp;G negotiator Brendan Gold was confident his BA members would vote to strike. He said: 'All the indications are we have had a high turnout.' This generally indicated a vote for action.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is facing a \u00a325 million claim for compensation from tribes in Papua New Guinea who claim the government has backed a project that destroyed their ancestral lands, poisoned their water and made them ill. </p> <p>Lawyers acting for indigenous communities of the south-east Asian island have written to Development Secretary Hilary Benn outlining their claim. They have detailed a catalogue of destruction allegedly caused by a 10,000-hectare oil palm plantation in Oro province, near their northern coast . </p> <p>The UK Department for International Development is the major shareholder in a company called Higaturu Oil Palms, the firm that runs the controversial plantation. It has put \u00a34m of British taxpayers' money into the company through the government-owned CDC Group, which invests aid money in projects it believes will benefit developing countries. </p> <p>The tribes claim Higaturu has used toxic chemicals to grow and process oil palms and that these have polluted the sole source of water for thousands of villages. Lawyers also claim the company has dug up ancestral graveyards and destroyed the sole habitat of the world's largest butterfly, Queen Alexandra's birdwing. </p> <p>The letter was sent to Benn by Damien Ase, executive director of Celcor, the Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights in Papua New Guinea. He has demanded the minister takes immediate action to halt the damage to the land and environment and 'fully compensate the local landowners'. </p> <p>Ase alleges that Higaturu illegally acquired the land from the tribes and caused damage by destroying rainforests and polluting rivers. The plantation began operating 26 years ago. </p> <p>Andrew Mamoko, chairman of the Ahora pressure group, which represents the local tribes, said: 'Now we are landless, and are just another lot of hopeless, lifeless people grieving over our land while others reap goodness out of it and enjoy it.' </p> <p>Oil from the palm trees provides a valuable harvest for developing countries, which export it for use as a vegetable oil in food or for cosmetics. The problem is that rainforest has to be cleared and chemicals used. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth, which is backing the claim, has collected testimony on videotape from tribespeople who have suffered. Theresa Stanley, who represents the women of the community, claims that children have been born with deformities and died as a result of the polluted waters. </p> <p>Chief Neville Ondopai of the Ahora Village said: 'All the people in these villages, they drink the water and they are dying. How can they exploit us so much?' </p> <p>Lawyers claim that toxic waste was dumped directly into the Ambogo river, which is used by thousands of villagers. </p> <p>CDC, which is wholly owned by the British government, has its funds managed by private equity group Actis. A spokesman for Actis said: 'We take these sorts of allegations very seriously and are committed to working with the management of Higaturu to ensure improvement in the environmental management of its palm oil plantations.' </p> <p>In a detailed statement, Actis rejected many of the claims of the tribes. It said: 'Higaturu has systems in place designed to ensure that its discharges into the river do not create health or environmental damage and we do not believe that Higaturu's activities are responsible for the health problems facing the local community.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "They appear, then, to have got it right, exuberantly so. With a last-minute burst of furious effort, fired by desperation and fuelled by lashings of swarthy moussaka, Athens builders finished the very last velodrome, home to the latter stages of something or other, plankton-throwing or Frisbee-dancing, just in time. Even the opening ceremony was deemed impressive: charming, thrilling, joyous; great sweeping hooded white um I don't know, giant bats or something - I mean I didn't watch it, of course, no one ever actually watches these things, except those rare good people possessed of the type of temperament and utter lack of imagination that will let them sit through the Edinburgh Tattoo without crying out for a flamethrower - but, anyway, it all seems to have gone off rather splendidly, apart of course from the wee problem with the drugs, which were presumably being taken to allow the individuals concerned to get through the opening ceremony. <p>And how disappointed are we? Going by the cackling xenophobic Schadenfreude of the last few months, very disappointed indeed. The Greeks were laughably lazy and comically incompetent, we were told, for months. Their transport was rubbish! Their planning was all over the place! There weren't enough staff, anywhere! They serve funny food! </p> <p>What's been infuriating about this is not simply the bias. True hypocrisy requires, along with a ribaldly unfair critique of the other side, a near-autistic blindness of the mind when it comes to one's own faults. </p> <p>I was, you see, reading most of these criticisms in London. Hot, broken London. I was in a woefully snotty gastropub in Primrose Hill - let's call it The Engineer, because that happens to be its name. They'd snottily let us come in and look at the breakfast menu for fully three minutes before snottily informing us that breakfast stopped at 11.30. The time was, then, 11.33. Passing an hour later, they were still empty: visited by fate, I like to think, although perhaps our nailbomb also had something to do with it. </p> <p>Later on, on the hottest day of the year, it took 90 minutes to travel from Highgate to town. Thames Water are digging up all the roads in north London, every one, all at the same time, and so buses are being routed via Hull. Sweating tears of frustration, I jumped off the stalled 214 just as the first shoots of weeds began to nudge their way through the floorboards and boarded a Tube at King's Cross: every bit as bad a mistake as you can imagine. In What A Carve-Up , author Jonathan Coe has a fine extended passage where his character faints on the Tube, the last straw being the smell of processed cheese from a burger being masticated eight inches from his face. I found myself yearning for such release. </p> <p>Obviously it didn't stop at my stop, owing to the security: a taxi was next, driven by a man who should be locked in a soft room playing with little cardboard geese. It had cost me \u00a316, in all, to acquire the kind of headache you could rap to. </p> <p>This is what we will manage, far better than Athens, if we get our Olympics. We will win awards for foul-ups. Despite John Prescott's pledge to shake up transport, it's unbelievably, unbearably worse, and the slide will continue. Service will continue to be rubbish. Our bid will be filthy with corporate pocket-stuffing: every aspect of the execution replete with blithering incompetence. We will excel in wrong-headedness: and smug Master Coe - the other one - is, happily, just the man for the job.</p>",
  "Like its owner, the Villa Certosa on Sardinia's Emerald Coast is extravagant, phoney and probably illegal. If they have the eyes to see it, the Blairs will catch the wretched state of Italy in microcosm when they begin their free holiday at Silvio Berlusconi's retreat tomorrow. If they are truly prescient, they will also glimpse their own political mortality hovering in the heat haze. <p>Berlusconi has laid on everything the dedicated freebie-taker could desire. Should the Blairs want a swim, there is an embarrassment of pools to choose from: six in all, and an artificial lake. Gardeners have been busily planting citrus and olive groves and a collection of 2,000 species of cacti for guests to enjoy. Workmen have just finished a fake ancient Greek theatre from whose marble seats the Blairs will hear Pavarotti sing. After the swims and the walks and the appreciation of the trills of the tenor, they can prepare for bed in the villa's bathrooms. According to the local newspaper, the windows are large so the visitor can enjoy the magnificent views, but 'with a simple release of a switch' the glass is tinted 'in order to guarantee the privacy principle'. </p> <p>Just so. Privacy is indeed essential for a man who is worth about four billion euros. I say 'about', but no one can be sure, not least the Italian tax authorities. </p> <p>Berlusconi has made honest Italians despair of their country. After the great effort of the early 1990s to sweep the Mafia and the corruption out of Italy, a battle which cost brave magistrates their lives, he has proved with two election victories that the Italians aren't as keen on clean politics as they claimed. </p> <p>To many of his critics what is disturbing about his governments is that they have included the remnants of Italy's fascist parties. But while it would be hilarious to hear the circumlocutions of the great human rights lawyer Cherie Booth as she defended her husband's association with what is quaintly called 'post-fascism', the fact that the descendants of the men in black leather are in office is beside the point. Fascism is in the past while Berlusconi offers a vision of a dystopian future. He has shown what you can achieve in a European democracy when you combine immense wealth, control of the media and political power. </p> <p>His Mediaset company has a virtual monopoly of Italian commercial television. He owns a sizeable chunk of the press and, as Prime Minister, is the de facto boss of state television. </p> <p>Thus what is scandalous in other countries isn't news in Italy. After there was a catastrophic power failure in September 2003, Berlusconi was able to commandeer all the television channels. He didn't feel obliged to mention that the lights had gone out. Instead he bashed the unions and exhorted viewers to support his government. </p> <p>The left calls him the new Mussolini while he poses as the Italian Thatcher. In truth, he's done next to nothing since he regained power in 2001 except defend his business interests. Anti-corruption magistrates have been scandalously vilified by his hacks. </p> <p>Berlusconi denounced them as 'mad' and wasted the time of Parliament to pass laws which made it impossible for corruption charges against him to proceed. As David Lane notes in Berlusconi's Shadow, to be published later this month, the besieged and battered judiciary is in no position to take on the Mafia, which is back in business and expanding its market. Such is the record of the Blairs' friend. </p> <p>When they arrive at the Villa Certosa's jetty they will see a Bond-villain entrance: a tunnel that goes through the cliff face to the villa. Local greens say the construction of the Dr No set was illegal building work on a protected coastline. Berlusconi says that the tunnelling was essential work to protect his guests; it was built in the interests of national security. </p> <p>But the villa isn't an Italian Chequers. You can't draw a line between the public interest and the private interest in Berlusconi's Italy. In the unlikely circumstances of your being invited for a short break, you are as likely to meet an executive from one of his companies as you are to meet Tony Blair, a corporate lawyer fighting corruption allegations as Vladimir Putin. If you are very lucky, you will bump into Rocco Buttiglione, a minister in Berlusconi government who last week was appointed European commissioner for justice. Never let it be said that the EU doesn't have a sense of humour. </p> <p>In a land where the Prime Minister can fight the judiciary to stop investigations into his business interests, the line between the public and the private has been rubbed out. </p> <p>At first, Tony Blair seemed to appreciate that there was something wrong in this, and was wary of Berlusconi. He joined with him in a common struggle to limit workers' rights, but whatever you think of the cause, he was just following the standard Foreign Office policy of seeking allies in Europe to counter-balance the power of the Franco-German axis. His body language at early meetings was stiff and correct. </p> <p>He's loosened-up now, and the men are friends. The war on terror explains the blossoming affection. But it won't do to say that whatever the crimes of Berlusconi and his post-fascists, they are nothing in comparison to the crimes of the actual theocratic fascists who haunt the new century. </p> <p>The Italian centre left who once translated 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime' and talked of following Blair's Third Way, now despise the man. It's not only the left. In Britain the conservative Economist declared that Berlusconi was unfit to govern Italy. </p> <p>As with the re-resurrection of the career of Peter Mandelson, the holiday with the Berlusconis is a sign that the lesson that Blair has learned from the Iraq crisis is that he can get away with anything. If respectable opinion on the left and the right is outraged, why should he care? It won't hurt him. He can flaunt his affection for Euro-trash without a flicker of fear because everyone in Westminster agrees the next election is in the bag. </p> <p>And why shouldn't it be? Unlike Berlusconi's Italy, Britain is living through one of the better periods in her history. The economy is booming, unemployment is down, crime is down, inflation is low, the children of the poor are being helped as never before and schools and hospitals are getting better. </p> <p>But the British electorate is a hypocritical beast. It says it despises focus-group politics and is then appalled when the Prime Minister ignores the polls and the demonstrators and invades Iraq. It says it wants strong government, but then says it hates Prime Ministers who get too big for their boots, and think they can swan off with every rogue. </p> <p>The consensus in Westminster may be that Blair will walk the next election, but it's a good rule that whenever there's a consensus it's usually wrong. Professional gamblers, being sensibly sceptical, have taken a cool look at their country and are putting their money on a dismal Labour performance. If you search for politicalbetting.com, you will see how advisers to spread betters are taking the conventional wisdom apart. </p> <p>'The \"experts\" are calling it wrong,' when they predict a three-figure Labour majority. They are applying 'the swings to the parties' vote shares in pre-election opinion polls on a uniform national basis' when it's far from clear the country will behave in a uniform manner next time. </p> <p>Complacent Blairites are taking no account of a potential collapse in tactical voting. Last time Labour won about 40 seats as a result of Liberal Democrat supporters voting tactically for Labour. Although the high-rollers predict that Labour supporters will happily vote Lib Dem to keep the Tories out, they doubt that Lib Dem supporters, and there will be a lot more Lib Dem supporters, will vote Labour. Because of Iraq, because of tuition fees, because of David Blunkett. </p> <p>Without tactical voting, the Tories will be able to come through the middle in many seats. The gamblers also note that the Tories are in slightly better shape than they were and that the collapse in Labour Party membership will make it harder to get the vote out. </p> <p>Put these together and, they say, there's only one conclusion: 'sell Labour'. </p> <p>I know quite a few of the Westminster pundits, and in the rare moments when they're not drunk or in the grip of an egotistical mania, they're a fine bunch of men and women. But I would trust a punter over a pundit any day. At least the gambler puts his money where his mouth is.</p>",
  "Gay couples wanting a child are set to get easier access to fertility treatment under a shake-up of the law. <p>The creation of 'civil partnerships' - which give committed homosexual couples similar legal rights to married partners - alongside shifting social attitudes have persuaded ministers the time is ripe for a rethink. </p> <p>In a memo to a Commons inquiry into regulation of fertility treatment, the Department of Health argues the current law was 'framed in terms of heterosexual couples' and changes should be considered 'to better recognise the wider range of people who seek and receive assisted reproduction treatment in the 21st century'. </p> <p>While some doctors already offer IVF to lesbian couples or single women in private clinics, others refuse, forcing women into homemade arrangements involving male friends and turkey basters. The law obliges private and NHS clinics to consider an unborn baby's potential welfare and 'need for a father' before allowing treatment, meaning women without male partners may have to show a child would have close male role models. </p> <p>Ministers will not consult the public on the review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, the 1990 law governing treatment, until next spring and the Department of Health insists it has taken no view on whether to scrap the stipulation for fathers. </p> <p>But a spokeswoman for the department said moves to let committed gay couples register their partnerships - opening the door to tax and pension benefits, and providing for 'divorces' and custody of any children - changed matters, adding: 'This is looking at the consequences the civil partnerships legislation has on the current legislation. (The Act) is obviously from 1990, and because of the changes that have happened since we are looking at the whole area.' </p> <p>New controls are also likely on fertility clinics selling sperm over the internet and surrogacy. </p> <p>Ministers are also studying possible developments, such as production of 'artificial sperm' for infertile men. Scientists have grown mouse sperm from embyronic stem cells: in theory, the technique could be used for humans. </p> <p>Gay rights groups say the requirement to consider the need for a father is interpreted in differing ways, with lesbians often facing more intensive cross-examination than straights. The stipulation has been condemned as an anachronism by Suzi Leather, chief executive of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. </p> <p>Campaigner Ben Summerskill, head of Stonewall, said: 'There is no evidence that this legislation ... has actually protected anyone from anything, and there is a range of US research which suggests that children who grow up in gay families are just as well balanced and developed as children who grow up in heterosexual families.' </p> <p>The debate over whether IVF children need a father is controversial, with the British Medical Association's ethics committee understood to be divided. The association is arguing that in the absence of evidence of harm, the need for a father should be 'subsumed' into a requirement to consider a child's welfare. </p> <p>Professor Alison Murdoch, chair of the British Fertility Society, said she personally favoured extending treatment for gay couples. </p> <p>'We have to stand back from it and say, what is the evidence that there is any harm to anybody from them having a child? Children need to be brought up in a loving, caring environment: it's the loving care that is important, not the sexuality of the parent,' she said. </p> <p>'We have been in a situation in the past where lesbian couples have been getting sperm from the gay community - they're unscreened, they're untested, there's no legal framework. </p> <p>'People who come to me and say \"can you help?\", one could argue that they are the people being responsible.' The British Association of Social Workers is also pushing for the clause stipulating the 'need for a father' to be replaced by 'need for a family', bringing fertility treatment in line with adoption. </p> <p>Religious groups are likely to be furious at such a change, perceived as an attack on traditional values.</p>",
  "British intelligence agencies have drawn up a list of around 100 Islamist activists they suspect are involved in terrorist activities in the UK, The Observer can reveal. <p>The security authorities are on high alert following a month of warnings and a series of arrests in Britain, the US and Pakistan. Most of those on the list are British citizens, mainly of Pakistani descent, although some are those of naturalised immigrants from the Middle East. </p> <p>Since 11 September 2001, intelligence agencies have focused their efforts on a perceived threat from within the UK, rather than from a group of 'al-Qaeda operatives' who infiltrate from outside. </p> <p>But sources who have viewed the list say that, although it includes some 'serious players', it is deeply flawed. They say many of the individuals are marginal figures or are not involved at all. The view will raise fears that poor intelligence could lead to operations that will damage community relations while serving no useful counter-terrorist purpose. </p> <p>'A lot of the names there are pretty historic,' said one person who has seen the list. 'Even if the people named are still involved, they are only acting in very minor support activities. Often they are now family men who had a bit of an adventure in their youth. They are decent citizens now.' </p> <p>Many of those on the list are Britons of Pakistani origin who fought for Islamist militant groups in Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan mountain state, several years ago and have since ceased their involvement with radical Islamist activism. Hundreds of British citizens are believed to have fought in Kashmir and then returned to the UK. Such activities were not illegal at the time. </p> <p>The list, comprising detailed dossiers on each man, which often include up-to-date surveillance pictures, is continually being updated. However, campaigners say this has not eliminated the innocent. </p> <p>Police privately admit that the 'bar' on intelligence is 'relatively low' but say that 'no chances can be taken'. One senior officer said: 'We are very aware of the community relations aspect of everything we do. It's a real priority. But you are continually trading it off against the potential security risk. </p> <p>'The last thing we want to do is anger people but we don't want to miss the chance to disrupt a terrorist attack either. We are very alive to this issue.' </p> <p>Critics say acting on poor intelligence risks will alienate large portions of the overwhelmingly law-abiding Muslim community in Britain and point to the relatively small number of people convicted for terrorist offences following high-profile arrests. </p> <p>The father of a British terror suspect facing extradition to the US last week accused Tony Blair of helping to create a climate of fear for Muslims. Ashfaq Ahmad, 69, whose son, Babar, was remanded in custody today after being arrested 11 days ago, told a protest of more than 200 Muslims outside the Home Office that his son was innocent. </p> <p>'I call on all decent people to make it clear to this government that enough is enough,' he told reporters. 'We want justice in Britain and a fair trial and not American injustice and a show trial.'</p>",
  "They were the first generation of girls to beat the boys in their school exams - and then outstrip them at university. Now they are storming the last bastions of male-dominated professions. For today's young women, it seems the future really is female. <p>Women now outnumber men in the most junior ranks of traditionally exclusive professions from law to medicine and the fast track of the civil service, which grooms the diplomats and senior Whitehall mandarins of the future. </p> <p>And the crop of female students now hitting the 'milk round' of university recruitment is so 'outstanding' that companies are struggling to find men to match them, according to Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) - who calls today for 'remedial action' to help the boys left trailing in their wake. </p> <p>'The world of work is changing and today having good interpersonal skills matters. I think women are better at that, and their emotional intelligence is probably better developed often than men's,' Gilleard said. 'In off-the-record conversations I have with graduate recruiters they often talk about the calibre of candidates: they say the women are so outstanding compared to the men.' </p> <p>With girls now outperforming boys at every level of the education curriculum from tests taken at seven to degree level, an Observer analysis suggests the effects are now beginning to be felt in the workplace, as the generation of girls who outstripped boys at A-level for the past four years begins to graduate. The findings will renew debate about the shifting balance of power between the sexes - and whether girls' greater academic success is simply due, as critics have argued, to the 'feminising' of the exam system or if it can be sustained in the world outside. </p> <p>By last December, women were for the first time in the majority of those qualifying as barristers; and in 2002-3, they made up 62.7 per cent of trainee solicitors, according to the Law Society. In the same year they outstripped men in the race for the 'fast track' civil service, comprising 52.1 per cent of those recommended for appointment, even though more men than women actually applied, say Cabinet Office figures. Girls also take 61 per cent of the fiercely-contested places at medical school: on current trends female doctors will outnumber male ones by 2012, prompting the 'feminising' of the profession highlighted last month by Professor Carol Black, president of the Royal College of Physicians. </p> <p>Only in accountancy is the trend reversed, with women making up 40 per cent of those entering for Institute of Chartered Accountancy's qualifying exams in 2002-3 - down from 43 per cent three years before. And while there are no official statistics for City recruitment, Gilleard warned that negative publicity from a string of sex discrimination cases exposing the brutally macho culture of some banks was likely to deter female high fliers. 'It's the damage it does to [an employer's] reputation even if you are found not guilty. It does influence how people perceive the sector.' </p> <p>The figures are bound to prompt questions over whether employers anxious to show they are enlightened are positively discriminating in favour of women. But with girls expected to put in another powerful performance in A-level and GCSE results to be released over the next fortnight, Gilleard said the current generation of young women deserved their success, and the failure of young men to match them needed to be tackled. </p> <p>'Employers and the government need to take some kind of remedial action. The government's just waking up to the fact that we have got lost generations of lads in schools. If we did reach a position where 80 per cent of doctors and 80 per cent of lawyers were women, there would be a case for the same kind of concern as there used to be when things were the other way round.' </p> <p>However, Jenny Watson, deputy chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission, cautioned against taking too rosy a view of young women's chances. While girls graduating this summer may land plum jobs, they will not necessarily get plum salaries. The Law Society found female solicitors' starting salaries were on average 7.9 per cent lower than male trainees'. Research this summer by the Universities of Warwick and West England found a pay gap of seven per cent between the sexes emerging seven years after graduation. </p> <p>And Watson warned the current intake of female professionals were likely to hit trouble when they reached childbearing age, slowing their rise up the ladder and potentially forcing some of them to drop out. 'Despite the increasing numbers of women entering the professions, it seems unlikely that we are going to see equal numbers of men and women reaching the most senior positions without a significant shift in the culture of Britain's workplaces,' she said. 'The sad fact is that a great number of women find their career grinds to a halt if they decide to have children.' </p> <p>Gilleard said the huge change in the number of women entering the law had been 'quite remarkable', and could force change. 'With over half of qualifying lawyers being women, what's the sector doing to ensure that women who take career breaks come back? There's going to be serious issues if they don't find solutions.' </p> <p>Recent AGR research has, however, shown one obstacle to female success: online applications appear to put women off. Gilleard said the tendency to list required skills or characteristics, inviting applicants to weed themselves out appeared to be dissuading more modest female candidates: 'The girls say, \"I don't think I'm that good\" and the boys say, \"I can do that and more besides\".' </p> <p>The figures also reflect the fact that more women than men are graduating from university: in 2002-3, they made up 56 per cent of first-degree graduates. Figures released last week by the Higher Education Statistics Agency showed however male graduates were more likely than women to be unemployed. </p> <p>In the US, experts estimate that within five years 61 per cent of college entrants will be female - prompting reports that some Ivy League universities are already manipulating their admissions procedures against women. </p> <p>Katherine Kelsey has known since she was 10 that she wanted a career in the law and, far from holding her back, she believes being female can be an advantage in what was once a heavily male-dominated profession. </p> <p>'My generation learned that women can do what men do,' says Kelsey, 24, who graduated from Oxford with a degree in jurisprudence before gaining a pupillage and finally being called to the Bar. </p> <p>'Future generations will learn that they can do what men do, but as women, rather than having to act like men. Certain strengths which are seen as feminine strengths - empathy, communication - are huge assets in criminal and family law.' </p> <p>The daughter of a legal secretary, Kelsey says that the flexibility and challenge of life in chambers appealed: 'Few professions offer that combination of the benefits of self-employment, with the structure and support of working for chambers. Your career is what you make it - if you need to work fewer days a week, you can.' </p> <p>The legal world remains divided by gender: while women tend to dominate criminal law, commercial law - often better paid - remains a male preserve. But while Kelsey doesn't think the idea of 'having it all' - a demanding job and a family - is particularly helpful, she points out that life involves choices for both men and women: 'You have to work out for yourself what you value and I sometimes pity men, as it is perhaps less accepted for them to choose the more family orientated route and work less - whereas women can do either.'</p> <p>Emmi Poleliakhoff, 24, was born to a Japanese mother and a half Russian father, and travelled a lot as a youngster, witnessing the end of communism. 'It made me interested in why some people are rich and others poor,' she says. </p> <p>At 18 Poteliakhoff left her north London state school and went to Cambridge University to study economics. She admits she was competitive with the boys during her A-levels, wanting to assert her ability as a woman. 'Economics involves maths and that is quite male dominated,' she says. </p> <p>She applied to the government economic service - the civil service fast track scheme for economists - and is now an assistant in the economics division of the Department for Health. 'When I arrived there were two women there,' she says. 'Eighteen months later there are six. Today half the assistants and a third of the advisors are women. </p> <p>'I really enjoy my work and have not hit any barriers as a woman but it would be interesting to see how men and women progress over the next few years.' </p> <p>Poteliakhoff wants to have a family and hopes this will not hamper her progression. She feels that the civil service is a family-friendly organisation. </p> <p>'They allow flexible hours and I know women who do a four-day week to cope. It is really positive. My cousin works in the city with three children and she needs a full-time nanny.'</p>",
  "The story is like the plot of a Coen brothers film: a couple frustrated by their inability to conceive snatch a three-week-old baby from a shopping centre. After widespread media coverage the child is found abandoned in a derelict house. When those charged appear in court, their greatest fear is not the law but the man mouthing threats in the public gallery, an alleged gangster whose child was kidnapped. <p>The events played out last week in Melbourne, a city which few outsiders associate with organised crime. But Mark and Cheryl McEachran had taken the child of Joe Barbaro, an alleged drug dealer with links to the city's organised crime scene. His cousin Pasquale Barbaro was a bodyguard whose murder at a junior sports training club last year woke Melbourne up to the reality of its new gang war. </p> <p>Melbourne cherishes its reputation as Australia's most genteel city. The broad boulevards of the town centre are lined with chic clothing shops, theatres and cafes. The contrast to its brasher rival Sydney is underlined by tourist adverts shot in black-and-white around the splendour of Australia's most exclusive hotel, the Windsor. </p> <p>Walking 400 yards round the corner from the Windsor brings you to the Melbourne Club, a 166-year-old institution for the Australian establishment. Its upstart rival the Athenaeum, a mere 130 years old, is just over the road. </p> <p>A mile north the city enters very different territory, a district long been ruled by tough guys with names like Alphonse Gangitano and Big Mick Gatto. </p> <p>The cafes and pizza restaurants of inner-city Carlton have formed the backdrop to a gang war which has claimed the lives of 27 people in Melbourne since 1998. With each killing, the links between Melbourne's exclusive establishment and its murky underworld seem to grow closer. </p> <p>But the glamour of the criminal life has always had an attraction in a city built on a 19th-century gold rush. 'The growth industry in Melbourne is selling dark sunglasses,' said John Silvester, a crime reporter on Melbourne's Age newspaper for more than 20 years. </p> <p>Graham 'the Munster' Kinniburgh, a former safecracker who rose to become a kingpin of the city's crime scene before he was shot dead outside his home last December, was well-known for his discreet connections to Melbourne's establishment. </p> <p>When his son married into one of the city's established families in 1994, the reception was at the Windsor. A few months before his death, his daughter married the son of a former attorney-general. Despite this outward respectability, the meetings Kinniburgh held in Carlton's cafes in the week before his murder read like a Rolodex of local undesirables. </p> <p>Most telling of all was the meeting with a detective from Melbourne's criminal investigation branch. In recent years 13 detectives from Victoria police's drug squad have been charged with corruption following a failed plan to catch the state's amphetamine dealers by becoming players in the market. </p> <p>A former Victoria police detective said such corruption was inevitable. 'Whether it's the community or the police, money corrupts and massive amounts of money corrupt massively,' he said. </p> <p>The launching of taskforce Ceja in an attempt by the police force to clean themselves up saw corruption turn from drugs and theft to outright threats against fellow officers. </p> <p>At the beginning of May a Ceja investigator opened his mail to find two police-issue bullets, etched with his and his wife's names. A fortnight later Terrence Hodson, a former speed dealer who was due to testify against two senior police officers in a corruption inquiry, was murdered with his wife just a quarter of a mile from the local police station. </p> <p>Less than two weeks later, an alleged underworld killer was charged with contempt of court when he refused to testify against four police officers on corruption charges, saying that he feared for his family's safety. </p> <p>'Over the years all sorts of internal police have had threats and it goes with the territory,' says a former detective. 'You know, in my world I lived with a lot of threats, and you feel somewhat comfortable when you get threats. It's when you don't get threats you should worry.' </p> <p>The couple awaiting trial for baby kidnapping are hoping that is true.</p>",
  "Ever since Mowgli teamed up with Bagheera, childminding has been linked with myth and magic. Mary Poppins descending from the heavens requires hardly more suspension of disbelief, though, than current social policy. In the most expansionist miracle since the loaves and fishes, the government is transforming daycare. <p>The Britain of 1997 was one of the worst providers in the developed world, relying chiefly on a patchy network of grandmas and homesick mothers' helps from rural France. Since then, more than a million nursery places have been created and 2,500 children's centres are promised by 2008. Childcare, a core issue for the third term, is now embossed on Labour's soul. </p> <p>Last week, the vision collided with BBC 1's Nurseries Undercover, showing treatment critics called 'cruel and shocking'. Toddlers were ordered to 'sit' by Crufts-style disciplinarians, a child was manhandled and narcoleptic staff took 'power naps'. Now working mothers are reported, probably wrongly, to be in panic, on the shaky grounds that nebulous worries about homicidal nannies, husband-snatching au pairs and five-in-one jabs have been supplanted by proof of boot camps for babies. </p> <p>Nothing exposes the illogic of the British psyche as much as the way we treat children. Smacking them is allowable, in ministers' eyes. On the other hand, fathers invited to parenting classes will allegedly be warned of the pernicious effects of chatting on mobile phones while playing with their offspring. The behaviour exposed by the BBC fell between these distant benchmarks. </p> <p>Though some incidents were indefensible, it seemed reassuring that a programme avid for scandal had to settle for such low-grade sins. The corporation may not even have believed its own sensationalist pre-publicity, since it did not bother to inform the regulator, Ofsted, about the alleged maltreatment until months later. What the programme did hint at was a pattern of ignorance and overwork, in which harassed carers offered no sign of understanding small children or even liking them. The worst incident, in which a little girl burned her hands on a radiator, reflected zero knowledge about emergency response. </p> <p>Until now, fractious arguments about daycare have turned on ideology. Research suggesting that under-twos spending long hours in nurseries may be slightly more aggressive has been seized on by those eager to keep mothers at home, while feminists cry backlash. </p> <p>Stripped of hysteria, the picture looks like this: a million children have been lifted out of poverty, partly because their mothers work. That is why Gordon Brown was so keen on childcare in the first place. Leon Feinstein's discovery of a 13 per cent gap in educational attainment at 22 months makes an iron case for poor and rich children being cared for together, and group care is indisputably good for over-threes. </p> <p>Equally, no one wants babies warehoused in round-the-clock nurseries, being guarded by people unfit to mind a cat. But given longer paid maternity leave, and more effort from fathers, it should be possible to prove that the best interests of women and their children are not incompatible. </p> <p>The remaining question is whether childcare is any good. Ministers have not properly confronted the quality issue, chiefly because they do not dare. Like locomotion and electric light in the 19th century, daycare has become the growth industry of its age, with around 180,000 new workers needed in the next three years to meet the government's targets. But whereas European applicants need a diploma or degree, many British nursery staff require little more than evidence that they are not convicted predators, plus a tolerance of long hours, minimal wages and life in a sector where leadership, support and funding have lagged way behind expansion. </p> <p>As the Daycare Trust and the National Day Nurseries Association point out, nurseries are not affordable, when parents pay up to \u00a3388 a week. But nor are they expensive. Getting your child cared for, at \u00a32.60 or so an hour, is one of the cheapest deals around. The dislocation lies in a state subsidy of 0.3 per cent of GDP for early years, against Sweden's 2 per cent. </p> <p>The low value placed on children, and the shortfalls in the care of the most vulnerable, had a starker illustration last week than soapless nursery washrooms. Adam Rickwood, aged 14 and found hanging in his room at a secure training centre in County Durham, became the youngest British child to die in custody. </p> <p>Newspaper reports tried to paint him as a sweet, sociable and clever boy, who loved camping and windsurfing, and no doubt, at some level, he was that ordinary. But he was also a troubled child driven, maybe partly by the death of three grandparents, to harm himself and to wound an older victim with a broken bottle. His mother, who faithfully made the 300-mile round trip to visit him for an hour, had asked that he be placed on suicide watch, but the depth of the cuts in Adam's neck convinced her he had been dead for some time before he was found. </p> <p>Back in 1994, Labour argued fiercely against Tory 'child jails', calling them 'retrograde and damaging' and advocating local authority secure units. But the prison service demanded, successfully, that it should have the lion's share of the juvenile 'business', promising better value and humane treatment. The payback has been delivered in dead children, of whom Adam is the latest in a relentless procession. </p> <p>Despite his youth, much of the media reserved an equal, or a greater, fury for substandard hand-washing by nursery staff. The two branches of care involved are very different, and yet they invite some comparison. While the fate of children like Adam is treated with indifference, people are urged to be obsessive about the welfare of normal children at scant risk. </p> <p>To an extent, that is natural. All working parents feel the drag of loss, combined with the powerlessness of never quite knowing what children, silent witnesses, endure or feel. That concern is fed by stories ranging from the case in which a babysitter was caught on webcam throwing a toddler around the room to strictures, often from journalists with expensive nannies, that daycare produces Kray brothers in miniature. </p> <p>The real worry is that a system that cannot even ensure top-class treatment for paying babies is never going to care adequately for children like Adam. </p> <p>Problems at some nurseries are not an argument for mothers staying at home, in accordance with the wishes of the Daily Mail and the Pope. Daycare can the best possible foundation for shaping sociable, humane, well-educated people, irrespective of their wealth and background. </p> <p>The danger comes only if a childcare revolution starts to produce human storage units plagued by fast staff turnover, bad training and low pay. Gordon Brown, on the verge of announcing his 10-year plan for affordable childcare for every family by 2015, has tackled quantity. Now he must offer to pay the very large price necessary to train and reward staff. </p> <p>That investment would be one signal that this is the century in which children of all ages and all shades of guilt and innocence cease to be seen as third-rate human beings. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Teenagers would be targeted by a major expansion of sex education enabling them to 'take control' of their intimate lives under startling new Tory plans to combat the increase in sexual diseases. The move marks a departure from years of right-wingers demanding that children be taught to abstain. <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary and a Tory moderniser, will underline the change of tack by visiting a clinic run by a charity for lesbians and gay people in Manchester this week. </p> <p>Dismissing calls for US-style abstinence education which encourages teenagers to pledge to remain virgins, Lansley said yesterday that a national network of school nurses - giving unbiased advice about sex - would be introduced if the Tories won power. He also backs moves to issue over-the-counter tests for chlamydia, one of the most common infections which can cause infertility. </p> <p>'I'm not talking about abstinence, I'm talking about something designed to empower young people to choose,' he told The Observer. 'It's feeling one has a greater sense of control over what one does with one's body, and being able to resist peer pressure or pressure from boyfriends.' </p> <p>Waiting times for appointments at sexual health clinics would be cut to 48 hours, after the Chief Medical Officer recently condemned 'unacceptably long' waiting times of up to two months in some areas for treatment. </p> <p>The plans may upset family values campaigners and more traditional Tories, who argue that both sex education and more readily available sexual health services only encourages teenagers. </p> <p>They will also irritate health ministers, planning to unveil their own crackdown on sexually transmitted infections in a White Paper on public health in the autumn. This too will include cutting waiting times for treatment, making tests more easily available, and refocusing sex education. </p> <p>However Lansley said the rise in infections demanded urgent action. Figures released last month showed chlamydia up by 9 per cent and syphilis up by 26 per cent between 2002 and 2003. </p> <p>Diagnoses of HIV have risen 150 per cent since 1996, and it is now the fastest growing serious condition in the UK. Lansley said the most successful modern safe sex campaign was the Tory anti-Aids drive in the late Eighties and early Nineties, considered shocking at the time, with images of tombstones and icebergs. Since then complacency had set in. </p> <p>'Safer sex messages have been inadequately targeted and the sexually active young population, who can't recall the Eighties campaigns, is tragically unaware of the risks of sexually transmitted infections. </p> <p>'Services have been lacking in priority and access to services has been poor. A former Conservative government faced up to this issue and succeeded. The next Conservative government will face up to this issue again.' </p> <p>Research has consistently shown that teenagers delay starting to have sex for longer and are less likely to get pregnant when they are taught not just the mechanics of contraception, but about self esteem and how relationships work. </p> <p>The Tories would also stage a review of the sexual health services to end the 'postcode lottery' of access to clinics if they won the next general election, and allow charities and voluntary organisations to run clinics and other services, with patients choosing where to go, Lansley said.</p>",
  "FROM THE hilltop grounds of St Mary's church in Bulwell, Nottingham, you can see all the way across to the cemetery where Marvyn Bradshaw is buried. The death of the 22-year-old victim of mistaken identity last August has so far led to the deaths of three others and many believe there are more to come. <p>Last Friday, the church was the venue for the funeral of Jamie Gunn, Marvyn's best friend, whose life fell to pieces after he saw his friend killed. Gunn, who had held Marvyn in his arms after he had been hit at point-blank range with a shotgun shell, never recovered from the shock. The 450 mourners heard that he had stopped eating and begun drinking heavily, a regime that weakened his immune system so much that he succumbed to pneumonia.</p> <p>'They can call it what they like,' said one mourner, 'but we all know Jamie died of a broken heart.'</p> <p>Last week's murder of Joan and John Stirland in a bungalow in Lincolnshire is believed to have been in revenge for Marvyn's death. Joan was the mother of Michael O'Brien, who was convicted of Marvyn's murder last month, but in Nottingham the case is just the latest in a long line of revenge shootings, which, according to Chief Superintendent Les Kominiak, amount to 'a pernicious form of urban terrorism calculated to deter victims from coming forward to testify in the courts'.</p> <p>Police have confirmed that Bradshaw had no criminal connections and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. His parents, Christine and Lyndon as well as his older brother Curtis have all been devastated by his death. A hard-working shop fitter he had been friends with Jamie Gunn since he was a toddler, having grown up with him on the notorious Bestwood estate. The pair were part of a group of close friends from the area who would meet most weekends at various pubs around the city.</p> <p>Jamie, the youngest of three brothers, worked as a pub bouncer. Although no one is willing to go into any details, Gunn's family is said to command a great deal of respect in and around the Bestwood estate. 'I did think about calling for there to be no revenge,' says Rev Christopher Gale, who gave Jamie's funeral service, 'but it's a difficult time and you have to be sensitive. You have to remember that people are grieving the loss of their 19-year-old son.'</p> <p>With years of urban decay and spiralling unemployment having created a generation hooked on heroin and crack cocaine, Nottingham is seen as prime territory for drugs gangs and as a result is the scene of regular turf wars. Jamaican Yardies and drug dealers from Birmingham, London and Liverpool have all clashed in the city. As a result there were more shooting incidents in Nottingham in 2002 than in all the seven previous years combined and the situation rapidly appears to be getting out of hand.</p> <p>Last month, nine members of a Nottingham drugs gang were jailed for murder after travelling to Sheffield to seek revenge on a gang that had robbed them of their mobile phones and gold chains. Their victim, father-of-seven Gerald Smith, had no connection to the robbery but happened to be in the doorway of the club where it had taken place when the gang fired their weapons.</p> <p>In June, a 21-year-old mother was shot in her living room three times as she sat holding her 13-month-old son. Police believe she was attacked in revenge after a former boyfriend lost a major drugs haul.</p> <p>Another revenge attack took place in May when 50-year-old Rastafarian Derek Senior was shot four times in the chest, abdomen and legs outside his Nottingham home by a gunman who escaped with an accomplice on a motorbike. A week earlier he had given evidence against a gang of men accused of viciously attacking him in a pub. The chief suspect, James Brodie, is also wanted for questioning over the murder of Nottingham jeweller Marian Bates, who was shot dead last year.</p> <p>Quite why Nottinghamshould have produced such a spate of violence remains a mystery.</p> <p>Sitting in the heart of the lowlands that once produced much of Britain's coal, the centre of the city is now almost entirely ringed by run down, sprawling, low-rise estates which were originally conceived as high-density housing for the local workforce. With little or no recreational facilities and declining employment, many areas of the city are spiralling into decline. Huge numbers of properties, many of them close to the city centre, are boarded up, burned out or simply falling down.</p> <p> The collapse of the mining industry in the north of the county has forced many workers back into the city and it is their increasingly disaffected children who are being drawn into Nottingham's drugs and guns culture. Many leave school convinced a career in crime is their only option for getting out of the ghetto and are all too eager to start as young as possible. In recent months children as young as 13 have been caught with guns.</p> <p>Turf wars have become increasingly common as loyalty to particular estates and areas of the city has grown. Many of the most serious clashes have grown from nothing more than one gang feeling they have lost 'face' because another has passed through their territory.</p> <p>THE CHAIN of events that led to the latest killings began in 2001, the year that Gary Salmon, a 32-year-old bodybuilder, was jailed for two years for beating up a man who owed drugs money to his friend O'Brien. Salmon pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm and the judge ordered that charges of kidnap and robbery remain on file</p> <p>Salmon and O'Brien shared a close bond and had previously been jailed for committing a robbery together. Both had a number of enemies, but it was Salmon who seemed destined for an early grave, having fallen out with members of a local drugs gang. On 1 August, four weeks before the killing of Bradshaw, Salmon was standing at the door of his house in Brooklyn Road when a van approached. An unknown gunman got out and fired at least three shots towards him.</p> <p>A FEW WEEKS later, O'Brien and Salmon were trying and failing to get into a number of after-hours clubs in the Nottingham area. At Obsessions nightclub O'Brien was turned away because he was wearing trainers and a tracksuit top. Forming his fingers into the shape of a gun he pointed at bouncer Lee English and told him that he could come back and sort him out.</p> <p>'He said he would do it his way,' English said later. 'He said he would use a gun and shoot to kill and that I would get it in the head or the chest.'</p> <p>The pair returned to O'Brien's rented home in Bulwell where they met O'Brien's 16-year-old girl friend and her 14-year-old friend. It was there, while drinking champagne and smoking cannabis, that Salmon heard that there was a lock-in in progress at the nearby Sporting Chance club.</p> <p>O'Brien tried to get inside, but a fight broke out with Jamie Gunn - said to be connected to the local underworld - and some of the club's bouncers. In the fracas that followed, O'Brien was hit in the head with an ashtray, leaving a deep facial cut. He and Salmon returned home, where it is alleged they changed into dark clothing, gloves and balaclavas and Salmon produced the gun, wrapped in a coat, and handed it to O'Brien.</p> <p>According to O'Brien's girlfriend, who knows him as JJ: 'He [O'Brien] pointed the gun at me. I said \"Don't do that\" and he said \"I'm not going to shoot ya\". He said, \"That's what I am going to do to him\".'</p> <p>The pair left the house and headed towards the car park of the Sporting Chance, where Jamie and two friends were being driven by Marvyn. He had just pulled out when Jamie, sitting in the back seat, saw two men in balaclavas approaching and ducked. A shot rang out and when he looked up Marvyn had been hit in the back of his head. He remained conscious until the police and paramedics arrived, but nothing could be done for him. Spattered with his friend's blood, Jamie held onto Marvyn until help arrived, watch ing him slip in and out of consciousness.</p> <p>According to O'Brien's girlfriend, the two men then returned home. 'They were out for about 15 minutes. When they came back they were panicking. JJ said, \"I shot him. He was a bad man. Watch this being in a newspaper tomorrow.\"'</p> <p>Salmon immediately went on the run and a week later O'Brien was arrested. Convinced that her son was innocent Joan Stirland, a children's cancer nurse, made no secret of her disgust for those who had 'set him up' as she toured the pubs and bingo halls of Nottingham. She ignored the threats and warnings that followed, but five days later two men on a motorbike were seen outside her house. Minutes later a volley of shots were fired through the front window. John was lying on the settee and Joan was standing when the first bullets hit. He dived over and dragged her to the ground.</p> <p>TERRIFIED, the Stirlands fled Nottingham next day, leaving all their belongings behind and moving into a police safe house. Just after Christmas, they settled in a rented holiday bungalow in Trusthorpe on the Lincolnshire coast, where they lived until they were murdered.</p> <p>Salmon was also being sought for revenge. The same day the Stirlands' home was attacked, an imitation grenade was thrown through the window of Salmon's house and his girlfriend's property was firebombed. The following day Kevin White, a close associate of Salmon and O'Brien, was shot and wounded by a pillion passenger on a passing motorcycle.</p> <p>In court, O'Brien's defence was that Salmon alone had been responsible for the killing. His defence team pointed out that O'Brien had never been convicted of an offence involving a firearm while Salmon had stashed a shotgun in his cupboard because of an ongoing dispute with members of the local underworld. Salmon had also drawn further suspicion by going on the run immediately after the shooting, whereas O'Brien had stayed in Notting ham.</p> <p>Found guilty of murder, O'Brien threw a cup of water at Bradshaw's relatives and screamed: 'I'm not bothered, I'm a bad boy. Your son looked like a doughnut with a big hole in his head. I don't care.' Judge Richard Pollard responded with the life sentence, adding the stipulation that O'Brien must serve a minimum of 24 years before parole could be considered. O'Brien turned his fury to the judge and barked back: 'I'll do that standing on my head.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, Salmon has remained at large despite the offer of a \u00a310,000 reward, an appeal on BBC1's Crimewatch and a major advertising campaign which saw his picture plastered on buses and trams throughout Nottingham. 'We don't need any more evidence on him,' says Detective Chief Inspector Phil Walker, the man in charge of the hunt, 'we just need to find him.'</p> <p>In Trusthorpe, the Stirlands tried to blend in as best they could. Joan, known for her sharp temper, soon became known at the local bingo club. A few days before she died, she was thrown out for using abusive language. To most of their neighbours, however, they were seen as a lovely couple who kept themselves to themselves.</p> <p>IF THE Stirlands hoped that the move to Trusthorpe would make them safe, they were very much mistaken. On 13 July, a few days after her son was convicted, Joan contacted Nottinghamshire police to say she had heard threats had been made against her and her family. Next day Nottinghamshire police told their colleagues in Lincolnshire. That was the last contact the couple had with Nottinghamshire police until their deaths on 8 August</p> <p>That day Joan called police officers in Nottinghamshire just before 2pm to say her neighbour had reported seeing a man hanging around the house the previous evening. She explained that this had not been reported to Lincolnshire police and emphasised she did not want the backgrounds of her and her husband revealed. 'She asked for a normal response to a prowler,' said a Lincolnshire police spokesman. But within half an hour of the call the couple had been shot dead.</p> <p>Detectives now believe the murder had been planned for some time. The getaway car used had been stolen as part of a burglary more than two weeks earlier. It was found burned out several miles from the murder scene.</p> <p>At least one of O'Brien's sisters and several members of the Stirland family are now under police guard.</p> <p>Four years ago, Nottinghamshire became the first UK police force to arm officers on routine patrol. The initially temporary measure, which has been reimposed in the city and introduced elsewhere in Britain, focused on the notorious St Ann's and Meadows areas of the city and followed 14 drug-related shootings in the space of a few months. Despite such radical innovations, the gang culture shows no sign of abating.</p>",
  "<p>It's been Media Memorial Week in America these past few days. Remember Watergate 30 years after Nixon's fall? Remember Woodward and Bernstein, the hammers of the Washington Post who supposedly brought him down? Here they came again, back on TV as relics of past glories: Bob Woodward more chiselled and cadaverous than Robert Redford, Carl Bernstein more chubby and grizzled than Dustin Hoffman. But are they - and were they - stars or bit players? </p> <p>That's a question tackled head-on by Professor Mark Feldstein of George Washington University in the latest American Journalism Review. Feldstein used to be an investigative reporter himself and he's consulted exhaustively with the experts, including the still bur geoning tribe of Watergate historians. </p> <p>Take the sociologist Michael Schudson (author of Watergate in American Memory ): 'A mythology of the press... developed into a significant national myth, a story that independently carries on a memory of Watergate even as details about what Nixon did or did not do fade away. This is a myth of David and Goliath, of powerless individuals overturning an institution of overwhelming might. The press, truth its only weapon, saves the day.' </p> <p>Take Stanley Kutler (author of The Wars of Watergate). 'As more documentary materials are released, the media's role... diminishes in scope and importance. Television and newspapers publicised the story and, perhaps, even encouraged more diligent investigation. But, as Watergate unfolded from 1972 to 1974, media revelations of crimes and political misdeeds repeated what was already known to properly constituted investigative authorities. In short, carefully timed leaks, not media investigations, provided the first news.' </p> <p>Take former Watergate prosecutor Seymour Glanzer: 'Woodward and Bernstein followed in our wake. The idea that they were this great investigative team was a bunch of baloney.' Glanzer be lieves that an official in the FBI's Washington field office leaked details of the Watergate probe to other reporters besides Woodward and Bernstein, but that only the Post published them early on because of its larger 'struggle with the White House'. </p> <p>Take David Greenberg, author of a new book Nixon's Shadow: 'It was unclear at first whether the FBI would pursue crimes beyond the break-in itself. If the Post hadn't kept Watergate alive, it's not certain that the bureau, or the Senate, would have kept digging. Woodward and Bernstein's work shaped the way Watergate unfolded.' </p> <p>Take any number of academics and contemporaries of Woodward and Bernstein, still arguing furiously away. Do the Post's tigerish twosome take all of the laurels? By no means. Other reporters - including the still indestructible Sy Hersh, scourge of Abu Ghraib - emerge just as influentially. But the Post's old editor, Ben Bradlee, certainly returns to take a bow. </p> <p>He published some 220 Watergate stories in the first six months of the affair, many of them on the front page, whilst others trod far more cautiously, going on catatonically. Stanley Kutler looks in detail at the 'almost nonexistent' media coverage that took place long after the break-in, and concludes that for months 'fewer than 15 of the more than 430 reporters in Washington worked exclusively on Watergate'. </p> <p>Did Woodward, Bernstein and Bradlee (in the words of Nixon's former aide, John Dean) 'do just enough to keep the story alive' by giving 'legitimacy to those [in the government] who were investigating the scandal?' That isn't Hollywood glory, but it's still a kind of triumph. </p> <p>Whatever you think, though, however you weigh the testimony, this wasn't the Redford-Hoffman movie legend made flesh. This was an utterly complex collection of FBI good guys, outraged public officials, dogged prosecutors and individual journalists banging at the doors of the White House. </p> <p>You may not read that too often. It doesn't fit the investigative script. It isn't what new generations of journalists have come to believe. But maybe that doesn't matter in the end - for, as Feldstein wryly concludes, 'Watergate's media mythology lingers... not because it is true, but because we want it to be true.' </p> <p><strong>Levin, a candid friend whose words rang out daily</strong></p> <p>One desperate cruelty of Alzheimer's is that not only its victims forget. The years of silence bring a deeper distancing. </p> <p>That may not always be fatal to reputations if, say, you're a politician: a decade of suffering surely added lustre to Ronald Reagan's stature because time drained away the bile of real politics. But daily journalists who stop writing are in a far different situation. The talent that made them ceases to speak, and so do they. A new audience knows little of their work. It is as though they had ceased to exist.</p> <p>Bernard Levin - who died last week - was more, much more, than the TV goad of an interviewer-cum-controversialist you glimpsed in the old clips. He was a wonderfully acid television critic for the Guardian , a scabrous political commentator for the Spectator , a thunderous presence in the Times . Yet I always relished Levin most for his middle years, the sixties, he spent on the Daily Mail - often writing a 600-or-so word column day after day.</p> <p>Daily columnists are a virtually extinct 21st-century breed. (The Mirror 's attempt to resuscitate Cassan dra dolefully shows us why; just one more voice lost in a cacophony.) But Levin - his prose constrained yet brutally eloquent, his range as wide as the news - showed what could be done, and what might be done again.</p> <p>The few books he wrote don't do him real justice. The columns fade inevitably. But, morning after morning, with a style that reminded you of Thomas Nash 400 years before and an unquenchable love of (and disgust for) life, he was a fascinating, fulminating force of nature - a candid friend who blew the cobwebs away.</p> <p><strong>Has the FT got Rupert foxed?</strong></p> <p>Would Rupert Murdoch like to own the Financial Times? David Yelland, who edited the Sun for the Foxy predator, thinks so - and few on Wall Street would disagree. Rupert would love a big business calling card (in just the same way that the brothers Barclay like the way the Telegraph puts them in the swim). But is Mr Murdoch actively pursuing the pink persuader, with real hopes of success - as Mr Yelland would also have us believe? There the yarn grows far mistier. </p> <p>To begin with, Marjorie Scardino - chief executive at Pearson - is a devout non-seller. The FT would go over her dead corporate body. And the paper's losses are coming down, from about \u00a332 million a year to \u00a320m. The bruising trek out of recession and back to profitability is under way. Why should the Pearson board throw in an historic towel just now?</p> <p>Then, however, the real difficulties begin. Some are practical. Before Ofcom, a merger or trade-off or straight sale of loss-making properties such as the Times or FT might have wriggled through regulatory nets. Ofcom and its attendant legislation makes that practically impossible. The 'public interest' requirements rule.</p> <p>Could Murdoch skirt around them by selling the Times to Dickie Desmond or some similar scion of society (as Yelland may further believe)? It's an unappealing, even humiliating, idea for a proprietor who never likes admitting defeat; but it is also hugely impractical in the tangled way of Wapping finances and Sunday Times relationships. It doesn't make any kind of sense.</p> <p>And there is one further nonsense that neither Rupert nor his former Sun king will necessarily twig. The FT, to its advertising cost, is a truly international paper (with full price British sales hovering ominously around 103,000 in July's ABC returns - as opposed to the Times's 450,000). That means it has to speak with an international voice - calm, analytical, pro-European, an alternative, liberal voice to the gruff barkings of the Wall Street Journal. Its liberalism isn't optional. It is necessary, defined by the market it serves.</p> <p>The Daily Financial Rupert for Frankfurt and Rome? Somehow that seems more puce than pink.</p> <p><strong>A little learning</strong></p> <p>Come to think of it, the FT and Murdoch conundrum might be solved another way. Peter Chernin, the CEO of News Corp and deputy supreme minder of the empire, has just let it be known that he's voting for Kerry this November. Kerry believes in education, he says - and so does News Corp. Final proof, if you like, that education is a wonderful thing.</p>",
  "Greeks were last night basking in worldwide praise for the spectacular opening ceremony which marked the Olympic Games's return to their historic home, but lamenting the poor crowds which cast a shadow over the event's first day. <p>Athenians voted with their wallets yesterday. Tens of thousands flocked to see the spectacular 120-mile men's cycle race whizz round round the city's landmarks like the Acropolis and Syntagma Square, which was free. But pitifully low numbers bought tickets for sports such as badminton, softball and shooting. </p> <p>Pundits around the world were ecstatic about Friday night's opening ceremony - 'Oh Olympia! That was gripping and absolutely beautiful' said the German newspaper Bild - which was attended by 60 heads of state. Floats depicted the various stages of Greek civilisation and the five Olympic rings were set alight in a temporary lake in the middle of the newly-built Olympic Stadium. </p> <p>Tony and Cherie Blair experienced the stifling heat which competitors and spectators alike are having to endure when they watched some of Britain's swimmers in action at the Aquatic Centre. Temperatures reached 37 degrees at the venue which has no roof over it after delays in construction led to that being scrapped. </p> <p>George Bush senior, the former American president, threw the ceremonial first pitch in the first softball match of the Games between Japan and Australia and made a speech to the US team before they took on Italy. </p> <p>Athoc, the Olympic organisers, admitted that only 2.8m of the 5.4m tickets for the Games have been sold. Games organisers are disappointed that many of the foreign visitors they expected to come have stayed away, and that has hurt ticket sales. The high cost of hotel rooms, delays in building the new Olympic venues and fears about a possible terrorist attack during the Games deterred many from travelling. Many Greeks find ticket prices too dear. </p> <p>But officials say that crowds will pick up when some of the more popular among the 28 Olympic sports reach the semi-final and final stage and that ticket sales for the athletics, which starts on Friday, have been positive. </p> <p>Between 5,000 to 10,000 UK citizens are understood to have bought tickets for the 17-day sporting extravaganza, but last-minute cuts in the cost of accommodation and flights seem to have not persuaded others to come. Despite discounting, a double room in central Athens is still around \u20ac250. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Athens blamed the dollar's weakness against the euro for the lack of visitors from the United States. 'That's a deterrent to Americans because it makes Greece very expensive. There are people staying at home because they can't afford to come here. Certainly price was one factor behind Americans not coming,' said the official.</p>",
  "<p>It was a routine briefing on board Air Force One en route to Iowa for another stop on George Bush's campaign trail. The White House official spokesman, Scott McClellan, described an 'alarming picture' of al-Qaeda threats - and how they related to the arrest in Pakistan of an alleged al-Qaeda operative supposedly plotting against America. </p> <p>McClellan insisted he could not discuss the arrests that day of 13 terror suspects in Britain. But not everyone was so discreet. Over the next few days, anonymous officials in the US and Pakistan obligingly joined up the dots, unleashing a stream of information about an alleged breakthrough against al-Qaeda connected with the raids. It was all faithfully reported in British newspapers - including claims that photographs of Chancellor Gordon Brown had been found in seized computer files and allegations that one of the Britons arrested, Abu al-Hindi, was a highly regarded al-Qaeda recruiting sergeant. The Daily Mail 's front page on the Saturday before last subsequently declared: 'Bin Laden's UK general captured.' </p> <p>Such headlines have opened a major new fault line in the strict rules governing pre-trial reporting - the provisions under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 that are supposedly the bedrock of Britons' right to a fair trial. </p> <p>The act says nothing should be published once proceedings are active - effectively post-arrest - that poses 'substantial risk' of serious prejudice to a trial. But the case of the 13 suspects - nine of whom are still, at the time of writing, being questioned - demonstrates that in an age of global threat, with counter-terrorism agencies staging raids in several countries simultaneously and anxious to trumpet successes, information is no longer easily controlled. </p> <p>The Bush administration, which regards terror crackdowns as an electoral trump card and is accustomed to American journalists' freedom to report what they like about defendants in the run-up to a trial, has proved hard to silence - despite fears it could unwittingly prejudice any attempted extradition of terror suspects to the US . One Whitehall source admits that the Americans 'don't seem to realise' how the British system works. </p> <p>The threat of foreign intervention wrecking British trials has certainly worried the Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith. He issued a warning note to editors two days after the arrests advising against using information 'not emanating from official UK sources' that might be 'striking and/or memorable' but potentially inadmissible in court - a clear hint at overseas intelligence material. </p> <p>However, there is little incentive for restraint in British newspapers, whose readers can easily read the stories by surfing American websites or watching CNN. While the fact that something is available online is not a defence to contempt of court for those reprinting it, the Attorney-General's spokeswoman admits that 'you could say if it was everywhere anyway, you are going to have a better argument against it'. </p> <p>And the defiant American response to British criticism - national security adviser Condoleezza Rice retorted it was 'unconscionable' not to warn Americans about terror threats - suggests an alternative way forward. What if, rather than trying to halt the torrent of information, Britain simply scrapped the restrictions and placed its faith in jurors' common sense and ability to discount what they read or hear before entering court? </p> <p>Dan Tench, a media partner at law firm Olswang, argues that contempt laws should at least be interpreted more liberally over issues of national security, where there are strong public interest grounds. If members of the public can understand the complexities of a criminal trial, then they should also be trusted to treat media coverage with scepticism. He adds: 'They can't be infinitely wise on one hand and completely moronic on the other. The suggestion that jurors can't put extraneous facts out of their minds is ridiculous.' </p> <p>Contempt rules should not be used to prevent the press reporting background information months or even years ahead of a trial, he believes. Almost any information about a defendant could technically be adjudged prejudicial by an unsympathetic judge. The fact that fewer than a fifth of those arrested on terrorist charges have so far been charged may encourage risk-taking. </p> <p>Tench argues lawyers 'might have more sympathy if government ministers didn't say things that could be prejudicial themselves'. Last year, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, was investigated for - and eventually cleared of - contempt of court over remarks he made about a suspect arrested in Gloucester last year; Goldsmith, embarrassingly, was forced to retract comments he made about an ongoing court case during a public lecture in 2003. </p> <p>The advent of the internet has also complicated the picture: the Law Commission pointed out recently that while publishing a defendant's past convictions constitutes contempt, curious jurors can now Google the name of defendants to check their past. Given the impossibility of sweeping the internet for potentially prejudicial information, the commission suggested judges could direct jurors to ignore online material if necessary. </p> <p>Most lawyers agree that enforcement of the Contempt of Court Act has been quietly relaxed in recent years. 'Things have become a lot looser, because editors and journalists are no longer jailed and fines are minimal, especially compared with libel payouts,' says Duncan Lamont, media partner at City law firm Charles Russell. One notable exception was the collapse of the trial of Leeds footballers Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer in April 2001 following the publication by the Sunday Mirror of an interview with the father of the victim while the jury was considering its verdict. He claimed that the attack was racially motivated: the judge abandoned the trial. Sunday Mirror editor Colin Myler resigned and the paper was subsequently fined \u00a375,000 for contempt. </p> <p>Lamont, however, argues 'all hell would break loose' if contempt laws were scrapped, citing lurid press coverage of the arrest in Spain of several Leicester City football players on charges of sexual assault - which were subsequently dropped - earlier this year. Tales of the players' alleged behaviour, and their accusers' personal lives, dominated the front pages for days - a situation Lamont claims would have made a fair trial impossible had the events happened in Britain. 'That proved we can't trust the media to be sensible. It was absolute pandemonium,' he says. </p> <p>And while the US system involves no bars on pre-trial reporting, it does require radical steps to shield juries from the media in high-profile cases: 'You have to stick juries in hotels at the taxpayer's expense and deprive them of TV.' </p> <p>Similarly, the media circus surrounding John Leslie after it was suggested he was the anonymous alleged date rapist mentioned in TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson's memoirs prompted calls from MPs for anonymity for rape suspects - more draconian than anything under the 1981 Act. Leslie's case never came to court owing to lack of evidence. </p> <p>Like rape cases, terrorism cases stimulate intense public interest: but they also provide more media temptation, because terrorist suspects can be interrogated without charge for longer than criminal suspects - extending the period between arrest and charge, when contempt restrictions are often taken more seriously. </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, veteran of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four trials, argues a fair trial is now almost impossible in terrorism cases: 'The powers in the act are very strong but the Attorney-General does nothing, and by doing nothing he encourages the limits to be pushed further and further.' Even where there is no direct prejudice to the case, Muslims are tried against a backdrop of Islamophobia linking religion and terrorism, she suggests. </p> <p>One compromise suggested by Barry Hugill of Liberty, the civil liberties pressure group, is that greater openness should require greater rigour from journalists publishing material about terror suspects based on virtually uncheckable, unattributable, intelligence briefings: 'There ought to be some context. We want transparency, and we want openness, but alongside that we have to have objectivity. I wouldn't object to reasoned articles explaining the basis on which American intelligence or British intelligence have acted, so long as it is in context and has a \"health warning\".' </p> <p>The government, however, is not minded for reform. Proposals rejected by the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, to extend contempt laws - banning the press from reporting all but minimal details from the minute a suspect is arrested - remain ominously under 'review', depending on media behaviour. </p> <p>And while the Attorney-General has dropped plans to issue formal guidance on reporting high-profile cases, last November's lecture, in which he condemned some coverage of the Soham murder trial as 'frankly unacceptable', left little doubt as to his views. </p> <p>The unanswered question, however, remains how far jurors themselves feel influenced by the media. Until now, it has been impossible to ask, since publication of the details of jury deliberations is banned - ironically, under the Contempt of Court Act. </p> <p>This autumn, the Lord Chancellor is expected to propose a relaxation of the law in order to allow academic research into juries. One such study, examining 41 cases in Australia between 1997 and 2000, found publicity may have influenced the verdict in only three. It concluded jurors simply couldn't recall press or television coverage of the cases beyond initial reports of the alleged offence. </p> <p>Similar studies here may just provide the first real understanding of how - if at all - the media influences jurors. The debate, it seems, is not over.</p>",
  "It might look like a Hollywood recreation of the American Gold Rush, but this time the stampeding prospectors will be film producers and investors hoping to mine rich seams of tax benefits before they run out. <p>Next month Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, is expected to allow British film-makers a brief opportunity to benefit from the old, favourable conditions before harsher rules take effect. </p> <p>All summer the film industry has been waiting for the chancellor to call 'Action!'. Now that an expert committee, including film-makers, bankers and distributors, has reported back to Film Minister Estelle Morris, producers believe Brown is poised to announce one final extension to provisions behind a boom in UK film investment over the past five years. </p> <p>During 2003, a peak year, more than \u00a31 billion was spent on making 177 films. If the Chancellor does allow the predicted extension - and this weekend a Treasury spokeswoman promised an announcement later this summer - the tax incentives are likely to survive until April 2006. They were due to expire on 1 July next year. </p> <p>If not a gold rush, the anticipated surge in production deals could be more akin to a disaster movie in which flood follows big freeze. For last February, the Inland Revenue effectively stalled the UK film industry for several weeks when it shut a tax loophole that was key to financing several big productions. </p> <p>This hit at least 40 films with British funding, including Johnny Depp vehicle, The Libertine, and Tulip Fever, starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law. Although Ruby Films' version of Deborah Moggach's novel lost about \u00a36 million, it was able to find new financing. </p> <p>Other films involved included Man to Man, The Truth About Love, The Constant Gardener and River King. Russ Smith, executive producer of The Libertine, predicted that Britain would become a no-go area for film-makers. </p> <p>The loophole, found in Section 48 of the Finance Act, was exploited by some investors who had little interest in making money from the eventual release of a film. Its provisions gave 100 per cent tax write-offs for producers of British films. The tax shelter allowed some to receive an immediate rebate of about twice their initial stake. </p> <p>'To be honest, it was a scam,' said Peter James of Movision, which is to release Al Pacino as Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. 'Some companies were offering investment opportunities for investors who merely had to show that there had been no profits made from the film in order to benefit.' </p> <p>Martin Churchill, a tax specialist, estimates that more than \u00a32.2 billion of income was sheltered in film partnership schemes in the previous tax year, a rise of about a third on the year before. Film partnerships had become methods for deferring tax, not for making money through British film. The tax relief was being targeted by investors who routinely pulled out before a film could possibly go into profit. </p> <p>In his Budget speech last March, Brown said a new tax credit system would be worth 20 per cent of the amount spent on British films that cost under \u00a315m to make. The committee of experts reporting back to Morris has mapped out an extension of Section 48 provision into the next tax year for those films that can start shooting by a certain date. </p> <p>If this move is confirmed by the Treasury, it will act as starting gun to a long list of new productions. This is no guarantee of the release of good films, for while the previous system produced Gosford Park, Girl with a Pearl Earring and Bend it Like Beckham, it was also responsible for the universally panned The Sex Lives of the Potato Men and Shoreditch. </p> <p>Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell has enlisted the Film Council to report to her on any new tax dodges that develop. 'The message is clear. There are two tax breaks, so don't go trying to make any more,' she has said. 'If you do, you risk losing all the money that investors have put up. The excellent work of hundreds of smaller producers is being ruined by a few rogues.' </p> <p>The Inland Revenue is also considering ways of using tax relief to improve UK film distribution. In addition, the government has reviewed the terms of co-production deals with other countries to stop producers inflating the budget spent in Britain to benefit from the tax shelter. </p> <p>It is tax breaks as much as the right location that now send a film company travelling around the world. New Zealand, Canada and Ireland all top the list for tax incentives. Britain was up there too before the Chancellor pulled the plug. Now Northern Ireland is emerging as a very strong competitor, poaching productions from the mainland.</p>",
  "To admirers and critics alike they are tyrants, bullies and control freaks, ruthless obsessives who stop at nothing in their quest for perfection. <p>Meet the new sports coaches, whose tactics - strict discipline, stinging criticism and training until you throw up - have made Britain's sportsmen and women serious Olympics contenders. Coaches are usually seen as red-faced football managers shouting expletives or PE teachers struggling to teach basic skills to bored youngsters. Britain's new breed could not be more different. They are experts in psychology, management, technology and coaxing athletes to give the performances of their lives. </p> <p>Bill Sweetenham, performance director of British Swimming, is typical: innovative, highly demanding and only interested in winning. Nicknamed 'Bill the Bully', the dictatorial Australian is renowned for not allowing his swimmers out after 9pm, banning them from watching television before big races and introducing Christmas Day training sessions. </p> <p>At the British swimming team's pre-Olympic preparation camp in Cyprus, he refused to let them have the air-conditioning on in their rooms during the day so they would get used to the heat in Athens. At a competition in Ireland last December, he got their driver to drop them off half a mile from the venue to walk the last stretch - at 6am - to build up their fitness. 'Bill is tough, but that's because the Olympics are the toughest sporting event,' says a colleague. 'Britain's swimmers have been rising to that challenge.' </p> <p>His methods have been paying off. At the last Olympics, Britain's swimmers won no medals and were dubbed the 'British Disco Team' for enjoying a hectic social life in Sydney while the races were still on. Then Sweetenham arrived and began shaking things up. Last year Britain won a record eight medals at the World Championships and stars such as Sarah Price, James Hickman and Melanie Marshall are set to challenge America and Australia's domination in the pool. </p> <p>Charles van Commenee, an abrasive Dutchman known as 'The Tyrant', is applying an equally intense regime in athletics. His fiery temper has earned him another nickname, 'The Volcano', coined by Denise Lewis, who won the heptathlon competition in Sydney. </p> <p>During that event, van Commenee, the combined events technical coach with UK Athletics, took the extraordinary step of criticising her tactics in the high jump and calling her 'a novice'. Lewis hated it, but responded by winning a gold medal. </p> <p>Kelly Sotherton, widely tipped to win a medal in this week's heptathlon, describes van Commenee as 'always brutal', but concedes 'that has probably made me a better athlete'. Last week the Dutchman used a piece of psychology - publicly writing off Sotherton's medal prospects despite her being ranked third in the world - to try to get the 27-year-old to prove him wrong. 'Mind games', sighed Sotherton. </p> <p>Similar characters are in charge in many of the sports where the 271 competitors in Team GB have some of their best chances of medals, such as rowing, sailing and diving. </p> <p>Rowing has Jurgen Grobler, a German famous for replacing team members' traditional full English breakfasts with prunes and, more recently, shocked Britain's rowers by discarding two he considered unlikely to help win the men's coxless four event in which Sir Steve Redgrave and his teammates triumphed in 2000. Senior rower James Cracknell, one of the pair who replaced the rejects, said the move was 'ruthless'. </p> <p>Redgrave, who won a gold medal at five successive Olympics and worked with Grobler for 10 years until he retired in 2000, disagrees, but knows what Cracknell meant: 'I wouldn't say Jurgen's ruthless; I'd say he's professional. His schedules are pretty tough.' </p> <p>Grobler's pre-Sydney regime was particularly punishing. 'He would push the rowers to hell and back so much that they would regularly get out of the boat at the end and be sick or almost pass out', says one sports administrator. </p> <p>'Athletes often have a love-hate relationship with their coach,' adds Redgrave. 'For instance, you might wonder, \"Why am I doing this training session?\". Jurgen changed my training programme, gave me more gym work and was a key part of my success. His methodical preparation made me a more consistent athlete.' </p> <p>Sue Campbell, chairman of UK Sport, which funds Britain's Olympic sports, admits that the new breed are 'some strong characters and personalities, fascinating guys whose methods aren't always appreciated by everyone'. That is because, 'they are absolutely uncompromising in their search for success. They have huge determination and the ability to make everyone and everything at least 1 per cent better - which can mean the difference between a gold medal and no medal. These are some of the best sports coaches in the world. We are lucky to have them.' </p> <p>She says that Britain's tradition of most coaches being volunteers has led to them being undervalued. 'In America, the coach is god and is seen as highly-skilled, and some are paid phenomenal salaries.' Despite hundreds of millions of pounds of Lottery money going into British sport, though, most of the new breed of coaches earn between \u00a335,000 and \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>Glasgow-born Stephen Park, Olympic team manager of Britain's sailors, is a rare home-grown coach. Paul Goodison, who is competing in sailing's Laser class, says: 'Stephen's intense, an obsessive character and ruthlessly focused on success. If something won't make a difference to going faster or sailing better, he's not interested.' </p> <p>Park has tried to ensure that the sailors have as few interruptions as possible during the Games by suggesting they stop using their mobile phones and instead use a specially programmed Blackberry personal communication device which only makes or takes calls to and from sailing team personnel. 'It's all about not getting distracted. If your Blackberry rings, you know it's important, but if your mobile rings, it could be your mate, your mum or a journalist.' </p> <p>Campbell says that, despite their images, the men some Olympic competitors privately call 'coaches from hell' are actually sensitive people who care about their athletes' welfare and have earned their trust and respect. 'Although athletes may resent the tough demands when someone like a Bill Sweetenham comes in, they know that if they want to be the best, they have to work hard and devote their lives to that.'</p> <p><b>My way or no way</b></p> <p><b> Name </b> Bill Sweetenham, 54 </p> <p><b> Job </b> Performance director, British Swimming </p> <p><b> Nationality </b> Australian </p> <p><b> Nickname </b> Bill the Bully </p> <p><b> Methods </b> Training on Christmas Day and birthdays.

  "<p>Is House of Fraser a target or a predator? Two years ago Tom 'Richest man in Scotland' Hunter wanted House of Fraser, with a view to an alliance with Allders. Two struggling department store groups with, as he saw it, a brighter future together. Then Minerva and Terry Green acquired Allders and Green's pal, John Coleman, lived to fight another day. </p> <p>Now House of Fraser has a different feel. There are analysts who share the management's view that this business is just too pricey to be a bargain. </p> <p>Coleman's team set out their stall around improving poor margins and systems and sorting out the Mohamed al-Fayed debt hangover. They have put three percentage points on to the margins; sales and profits are growing at the same rate as Next's and the expansion programme is solid. </p> <p>In terms of future revenue, the House of Fraser Storecard is interesting. The last time we spoke to HoF, it refused to comment on the deal with GE Capital, largely because the terms are awful. Since then the storecard landscape has opened up as a result of consumer pressure and a Competition Commission inquiry. </p> <p>GE Capital now has serious competition from high-street banks - good for House of Fraser, currently negotiating a renewal on different terms or with the right to take back its business in 2007 with two years' notice. If the management cannot improve the terms - they receive no cut of the profits - in the current climate, they ought to resign in shame. </p> <p>We understand that the HoF card business is expanding. Newly trained staff are selling to a finance-savvy customer (in the ABC1 group) at ease with debt. </p> <p>Add to this the changing face of the retail competition. Selfridges has gone private and its new owner, Galen Weston, has axed the expansion plan that was Vittorio Radice's big idea. More than Debenhams, Selfridges was building up to be quite a threat. So sighs of relief at HoF, where few dispute that the arrival and upgrades of Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and John Lewis in its key territories, Manchester and Birmingham, has hit the tills. </p> <p>On the downside, debt remains beefy. There is always a gap between promises and reality (though it is understood that trade is respectable, with summer sales moderate and most stores 'clean' and ready for autumn stock). Rentals are another issue, having rocketed due to leases expiring. One central London store's rent has risen eighteenfold. The company has treated this as an excep tional, but the money has to come from somewhere. </p> <p>Investors hope HoF will increase dividends as the financial baggage is cleared. It is still in the market for acquisitions, though it would be unlikely to grab at Allders, say, unless the price plummeted, because it would not want many of the sites. An alternative scenario is that Hunter, HoF's major shareholder, or Icelandic group Baugur, will decide they want to wrest control. Either way, House of Fraser is not a bad bet.</p> <p><strong> Billiton booms beyond China</strong></p> <p> While its former chief executive, Brian Gilbertson, heads for Russia with a reputed $50 million pay deal, mining and resources group BHP Billiton will give the City details of its own windfall. </p> <p>Formed by Gilbertson through merging BHP and Billiton in 2001, the group has responded to surging demand for commodities in China with production surges of its own across most of its products. Iron ore, copper, aluminium and diamond production have shown growth of at least 20 per cent over 2002 levels and analysts are expecting a 70 per cent hike in next week's year-end profits. </p> <p>But with growth in China expected to slow in the second half of the year, will the Anglo-Australian group continue to strike it big? The consensus is that it will. Mining watchers believe BHP will continue to run flat out, with demand for iron ore and coking coal likely to remain strong. Predictions are for volume increases into next year, along with strong prices. </p> <p>Most argue that mining stocks have fallen because of concerns that Chinese growth would falter. But although the need for commodities in the People's Republic may moderate, it will do so from such high levels that prices are likely to be supported for some time. As mining executives and sector analysts agree, if Chinese demand was not slowing, prices would be even higher. </p> <p>What distinguishes BHP from the rest of the sector is its oil exploration and production business, which contributed about 25 per cent of earnings at the half year. Output was disappointing, falling 15 per cent in June. However, the longer-term outlook is different. There was strong exploration data in the last quarter and three new projects received approval for development. </p> <p>Analysts believe that BHP has a strong spread of assets, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, and that there are prospects for growth over the next decade. Meanwhile, as spot prices continued to break records last week, oil futures markets pointed to crude prices staying on average over $30 a barrel for at least the next 10 years. </p> <p>BHP Billiton has had three years of profits growth. With commodity markets in general and crude oil in particular looking unlikely to fall back in the short term, there will probably be more to come.</p>",
  "They are the bane of an office couch potato's life: 'teambuilding' trips forcing unfit middle managers to yomp across moorland, build rafts or walk across hot coals to develop leadership skills. <p>But for anyone dreading a weekend on an army assault course, relief may be at hand. Management training is under threat from a 'compensation culture' where employees rush to sue for minor mishaps, which firms say has sent insurance premiums rocketing. </p> <p>Philip Maughan of Terra Nova Training, a small Perthshire-based company, said his insurance premium rose more than eightfold in a year from \u00a31,050 to \u00a38,600. Although he was eventually offered a more manageable \u00a35,500, insurers refused to cover him for outdoor activities. </p> <p>He has since found a cheaper policy, but admits that he has virtually given up on all but the mildest activities, encouraging clients to build things with 'planks and barrels on the hotel lawn' rather than abseiling down cliffs on army-style manoeuvres. </p> <p>'It's a more litigious culture and the customers don't want the yomping any more,' he said. 'The insurers said our risk assessment was extremely good, but it was something happening across the board and partly due to legislation under which insurers were required to pay the cost of any NHS fees for clients.' </p> <p>The Department of Health recently announced plans to recover from insurers the cost of NHS treatment for employees injured on the job. </p> <p>Maughan, who says he has heard of 400 per cent increases in premiums for similar activities and companies forced to operate without insurance as a result, said he missed the days when - working at a centre in the Lake District which ran its courses jointly with former SAS officers - clients spent 48 hours surviving in the wild in the name of 'teambuilding'. </p> <p>'One exercise involved participants carrying planks and barrels a couple of miles up a hill, building a raft, lowering it into a flooded quarry, abseiling down to it, donning diving equipment, diving to the bottom of the pool and hauling the raft back up the cliff face,' he recalled. </p> <p>Doubtful participants were told that the courses had to be tough 'because management's tough', Maughan said: 'Thinking back, it was completely over the top, but I had a wonderful time. You don't need such a huge experience, but I feel hamstrung these days. If participants are asked to go more than 18 inches off the ground, the companies start to get anxious.' </p> <p>A 'compensation culture' driven by fear of lawsuits has been blamed for everything from curbs on parents taking their children swimming unless there is at least one adult per child, to the banning of home-made cakes from a village fete in Wiltshire this month lest purchasers get food poisoning. </p> <p>However, tabloid myths may not reflect the reality, with the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers insisting that the overall number of compensation claims actually decreased by almost 10 per cent last year. </p> <p>But Charles Clarke, the Education Secretary, and Tessa Jowell, the Culture Secretary, have warned of the danger of school trips and children's sports being curtailed by a fear - even if misplaced - of lawsuits.</p>",
  "<p>At the bottom of Lyndhurst Road, a five-minute walk from Hampstead Heath in north London, is a building that was once a Victorian church but whose interior, stripped of altar and pews, now houses George Martin's Air Studios. On a dark November afternoon in 2003, a classical recording is going on, and black-clad violinists and oboists are padding down the pale-wood corridors. </p> <p>Sitting in the cafe, with his Palm Pilot and mobile, is Leon Bosch, a double-bassist. Leon's here because he's answered an ad placed by the Observer Magazine asking for people currently in therapy to participate in a six-month journalistic project. </p> <p>We were looking for people happy to open up about their experiences - why they need therapy, and whether it is helping - in the hope of demystifying a process which, though increasingly part of modern British culture, remains somehow curiously taboo. </p> <p>Bosch responded to our advert by email: 'Dear Sir, I am a 42-year-old South African-born British citizen and currently a professional classical musician. At age 15 I was a political prisoner in South Africa. Various developments over the years finally led me to seek psychotherapy, which I believe to be useful, in my case at least.' </p> <p>He would be interested to participate, he said. That November day, our first meeting, he sketches the story of his life. Growing up in Cape Town, the second child of four, he was arrested in 1976 for his part in a student uprising in his high school. He'd led a protest march to the parliament buildings in Cape Town: 1,000 students, joined along the way by hundreds of sympathetic workers, swelling to tens of thousands by the time they reached the city. The police were waiting for them in the centre of Cape Town, and attacked Bosch and the other protesters with 'batons, water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. </p> <p>Miraculously, I managed to escape. I hid in a telephone booth in the post office, my heart filled with terror and my eyes streaming from the tear gas.' He was arrested and kept in prison for a month. Torture was continuous, and alternated between the physical - being held underwater till he thought he was going to drown, being hit, having insects emptied over his head, being forced to play Russian roulette - and the mental, with threats to his family, to rape his sisters. </p> <p>As soon as he could - having managed to study double-bass at the University of Cape Town - he left South Africa. He's lived in England since 1982. These experiences, Bosch says, left him with a 'big issue with trust'. Even in his relationship with his wife Barbara he admits that he's 'always kept something back: she's always felt that there were parts of me she's never got to know'. And so it was in an attempt to resolve some of the difficulties - in particular, a rising sense of stress - that he went to his GP in September 2002 and sought help. Since then - at least when he's not abroad touring - he's seen a Jungian psychotherapist for once-weekly sessions. Will therapy, which among other things involves learning to let another person 'in', help him learn to trust?</p> <p>Sigmund Freud was once asked what he thought a normal person should be able to do well. He answered, 'Lieben und arbeiten', to love and to work. As the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson commented, '...when Freud said \"love\", he meant the expansiveness of generosity as well as genital love; when he said \"love and work\", he meant a general work productiveness which would not preoccupy the individual to the extent that his right or capacity to be a sexual and loving being would be lost.' </p> <p>And, to generalise, it's when one or both of these - the ability to work or love - are not working well that people hit a crisis. In times past, they might have sought help from their church. Now, it's more than likely to be a therapist. Therapy, from traditional psychoanalysis through psychotherapy to behaviour-based 'talking cures' such as cognitive behavioural therapy, is undergoing an extraordinary boom. </p> <p>The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) now has 22,000 members, up from 7,713 in 1991. Between 1992 and 1998, the percentage of GPs' surgeries offering counselling rose from 31 to 51 per cent. Yet the world of psychotherapy and counselling remains, to many, not only confusing, but also controversial. </p> <p>Frank Furedi, professor of sociology at the University of Kent, last year published a book entitled Therapy Culture: Cultivating Vulnerability in an Uncertain Age, in which he claimed that counsellors and therapists encourage 'over-pathologising', 'client helplessness and loss of autonomy'. Our society, he posited, 'has become increasingly influenced by the values of the therapeutic culture encouraging us to believe that we do not have the emotional resources to handle problems without professional guidance'. </p> <p>The profession has its flaws, not least a lack of regulation. In theory, it is possible for anyone - however minimal or non-existent their training - to set up as a psychotherapist or counsellor. But this, as Phillip Hodson from BACP explains, 'is not the fault of the profession. Only the government can introduce regulation across the board.' </p> <p>And even if you do find your way to a skilled, properly trained, caring professional, deep inner healing is not guaranteed. As Michael Jacobs points out in The Presenting Past, a well-thumbed manual for the trainee therapist, 'Therapists know, of course, that therapy does not always work, or that its results are not as profound and extensive as the client wishes ... it is just as much a struggle for them to understand the client as it is for the client to achieve self-knowledge.' </p> <p>Yet the need is growing. According to a study by the drugs company Organon Laboratories, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in December 2003, depression in adults costs the UK more than \u00a39bn a year, some \u00a38.1bn of which is in the loss of 109.7 million working days. By 2020, according to the World Heath Organisation, unipolar depression will account for the second-largest burden of disease. </p> <p>And all the while, GPs are prescribing an increasing number of antidepressants: 1998 saw 23.4 million prescriptions, double that of 1975. Even the young are not immune: in 1995, 46,000 British teenagers were handed pills; by 2003, this figure had risen to 140,000. Drugs, however, are only partially effective - BACP estimates that 30 per cent of people treated by drugs alone are likely to gain no benefit whatsoever - and they can also be dangerous. As reported in The Observer in June, a number of children have committed suicide while on the drug Seroxat. </p> <p>So if the drugs don't always work, how effective is therapy? One of the most common forms is workplace counselling, which can reduce rates of sickness and absence by as much as 50 per cent, according to a 2002 report by Professor John McLeod of the University of Abertay, Dundee, which studied more than 10,000 clients who used workplace counselling between 1954 and 2000. Another report in the BMJ in December 2000, summarising a separate study on the effects of short-term counselling in primary care, concluded that counselling was the most effective treatment for most depressions, compared to GP care and pills, while a 1996 Mori poll showed that 86 per cent of patients would rather see a counsellor than take tranquillisers or antidepressants. </p> <p>Therapy - following Carl Jung's dictum that it is 'downright immoral to shut one's eyes to the truth about oneself' - is, at its core, an attempt to understand ourselves better. But it is also an attempt to alleviate distress, and to restore a sense of fun and play to life. The starting point is Freud's idea that our experiences in early childhood exert a powerful influence on the rest of our lives, shaping our personalities and the way we relate to others as well as view ourselves. </p> <p>This theory has more recently been confirmed by the findings of neuroscience. As the psychologist Oliver James has pointed out, 'Human brains grow with ... explosive vigour during the first three years, never again repeated, so that the brain of a two-year-old actually has twice as many synapses as that of its mother. Because so much of our mental wiring is developing at such a young age, the effects are lasting and important.' </p> <p>This has core implications for the work of therapy, for the way we relate to others gets duly enacted in the 'transference' between the therapist and his or her client, with the latter often unwittingly finding themselves reacting to the therapist as if he or she were a figure from their early life: an overbearing mother, maybe, or a distant father. In the case of Bosch, for instance, it is highly likely that his issues with trust will be re-enacted between him and his therapist. </p> <p>That's the theory, anyway. The reality, as Susan Jacklyn is discovering, is that the process of uncovering what has long been hidden, dismantling the defences that one erected in childhood - often for a very good reason - can also be very painful. I'm sitting in a Leeds pizza restaurant with Jacklyn, 34, and she is talking with a kind of wounded gentleness, so softly I find myself bending closer to catch her words. </p> <p>This is our first meeting, and she's been in therapy for two-and-a-half years: once-weekly sessions with a therapist to whom she was first referred by her GP. Her peripatetic childhood - Hong Kong, Vancouver, South Africa, Australia - combined with parents who found it difficult to express their feelings, left her and her sister 'quite neurotic, paranoid and agoraphobic'. </p> <p>She has struggled with her confidence, and was 'actively discouraged from going to university'. Yet she did attend college in South Africa, where she studied microbiology, which in turn led to a job in a dolphinarium, which she loved. 'It was one of the best times in my life, rehabilitating stranded animals, monitoring their health, doing research and writing.' </p> <p>After four years, continuing the pattern of a lifetime, she moved, this time to Australia with her boyfriend. When the relationship ended, she came to England. She arrived in London with \u00a3300: 'I had to work hard to survive.' By the age of 27, 'ready to meet someone, and feeling desperate that I hadn't', she was referred to a cognitive behavioural therapist by her GP. This lasted eight months, and enabled her to start to express emotions - 'anger, fear, grief' - that she'd never aired before. 'Then I met Jim, to whom I'm now married, and I thought everything would be happy-ever-after. But Jim was scared of commitment and I was very needy.' </p> <p>Once again, she found herself in her GP's surgery, asking to be referred to a therapist. To begin with, she admits, she 'did not like [the therapist]. He told me to pull my socks up, and start taking responsibility. I just wanted sympathy.' Slowly, her trust grew. 'He was right. I was a victim, and wasn't making the most of my life.' </p> <p>For her, therapy has been at least in part 'a reparenting process. It's also provided a safe place to express feelings that I couldn't as a child, being in a safe place where I'm not judged.' Over the coming weeks, Jacklyn sends email updates in a lower case, stream of consciousness: 'i've been having some ups and downs lately,' she writes, 'which seem to be all or nothing, either everything is good or everything is bad.' </p> <p>Her therapist's response, she says, has been a combination of interpretation and gentle confrontation. 'he says i have a strong super ego from my strict perfectionist mother and i need to experience the messy feelings and tolerate the anxiety of everything not being precise and tidy.' During one session she hears a baby crying in the next room. </p> <p>She ignores the noise, only for her therapist to ask her, a little while later, why she hasn't commented on it. 'after a bit of probing i did manage to connect words to my feelings and told him that although i enjoyed hearing baby noises i was angry with him for not having the baby upstairs as i was jealous of my time and annoyed that the baby disturbed the peace.' </p> <p>Some while later she sends me another, calmer email: 'i'm finding it a lot easier to talk to my therapist lately. The penny has only just dropped that i'm not required to be polite at all times and this in fact is something i should work on - it's OK to communicate in a \"messy\" way sometimes. \"forbidden feelings\", eg. anger, anxiety, sexuality, were not allowed to be expressed when growing up. in the past i have turned these feelings in on myself and suffered for it. he says that being able to express them safely with him means i can experience them fluently as an adult rather than keep them expressed in my subconscious.' </p> <p>This point in therapy, writes the psychoanalyst Alice Miller in The Drama of Being a Child, is often pivotal: 'It greatly aids the success of therapeutic work when we become aware of our parents' destructive patterns at work within us. When the patient has emotionally worked through the history of her childhood and thus regained her sense of being alive, the goal of therapy has been reached. She will then be able to use the tools she has learnt whenever feelings of her past are triggered ... As time goes on, she will use them more and more effectively ... The \"map\" of her life will be available for her whenever she needs it.' </p> <p>Three months after our first meeting, Jacklyn leaves on a two-week visit to her parents in Australia. Preparing for the trip provokes a lot of anxiety. How will she relate to them now that she has 'changed', she wonders. She says she is now aware of bitterness towards them, but at the same time feels 'bad' about this, 'because I wasn't hit or screamed at and I know they were doing their best. But I spent 14 years trying to starve myself to death, so something must have been wrong.'</p> <p>Issues of food have also been a barometer of psychological health for Debbie Ferguson and Maggie Butcher. Despite a successful business career, a happy marriage and children, Ferguson was bulimic for more than 30 years before she sought help. At the age of 13, when her father left the UK to work in Sweden, she started overeating. 'I began to be sick due to eating too much and one day a light went on in my head that said, \"Maybe this is the way to lose weight.\" Before too long I could be sick just by thinking about it.' </p> <p>Bulimia, she says, became the way that she dealt with 'painful and stressful situations'. Now 49, she has been seeing a psychoanalytic therapist since July 2002. </p> <p>From the initial once-weekly sessions, she is now down to one a month and a fortnightly day-long group session. To begin with, she says, references to her subconscious left her cold: 'I didn't even know I had a subconscious.' Gradually, feelings that had been 'stuffed down' - in a pattern she recognises as similar to her overeating - began to surface. 'The therapy has been very painful, because you're bringing up things that have been buried for years.' </p> <p>For Butcher, 57, 'the weight of expectation' with which she felt burdened throughout childhood translated, in early adulthood, into an 'obsessive concern with my own body weight'. An only daughter, her father died when she was eight. She quickly became the model little girl, and perfect pupil. 'I was the child with my head always in a book, the little girl who lined up her dolls and taught them. I worked hard, passed my 11-plus and went to grammar school.' She studied English at King's College London, then taught for three years in a secondary school. </p> <p>Her subsequent career has been in academia. And then, one day in November 2000, she arrived at work exhausted. She could barely stand. She struggled home and 'never went back to work again'. The demands of the previous year - regular visits to her mother, who had been diagnosed with bone-marrow cancer; a new relationship; the belief that 'the activities of the college depended upon me' - had left her first with a sore throat that would not go away, and then with ME. </p> <p>For Butcher, the path of therapy - in her case, the relaxation technique known as autogenic therapy, a treatment available at the Royal Homoeopathic Hospital in London, and the psychotherapeutic development of AT known as autogenic neutralisation (AN) - has been partly a process of learning to be gentler with herself. AT, which she learnt on an eight-week course at the hospital, was devised in the 1920s and 1930s by Dr Johannes Schultz, a neuropsychiatrist, and later developed by Dr Wolfgang Luthe, a professor of psychophysiology at McGill University, Montreal. </p> <p>The process, which uses simple instructions to relax and warm areas of the body, is intended to bring about a state of deep relaxation, in which traumatic memories will sometimes surface. AN uses the state of relaxation brought about by AT, but is done, as with other therapy, in the presence of a trained therapist. Four weeks after we first meet, Butcher emails me to explain that she's 'decided to pull out of the project. </p> <p>As the therapy involves a great deal of writing up and further commentary I am finding that it takes all the limited energy I have.' I recall our first meeting, when she said that she was 'a person driven by \"oughts\" and \"shoulds\"', and wonder whether I have become for her just another person to be pleased. I reply that, while of course I'm disappointed at her decision, I understand. Maybe she could consider meeting up just once, at the end of the project? The relief in her next email - thanking me for 'such a generous response' - is, as the weeks turn into months, echoed by her progress in therapy. </p> <p>Slowly, she is 'learning to live with tasks incomplete or done differently to how I would have once done them'. She has begun painting and sculpture; she is starting to live more in the present. On one occasion, she had been railing against the restrictions placed upon her by her ME and her therapist, 'who had been encouraging me to see life as process, not necessarily progress, [who] sowed a small seed, suggesting perhaps ME might be something I had to live with. I was so angry. I was crying and banging my fists on the pillow in rage and frustration. I came out of the AT state and experienced, with her, such a real state of grace as can, in my [Christian] language, only be called sacramental.'</p> <p>One of the key ideas in psychoanalysis is that of the 'false self' and 'true self'. The paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott suggested that the false self is a fairly common occurrence: 'The defence is massive,' he wrote, 'and may carry with it considerable social success.' In real life, such a person might seem on the surface to be formidably successful - with all the material trinkets - but this show of achievement is really a defence against feelings of deep unworthiness, possibly fostered in childhood by punitive, neglectful or abusive parents. Winnicott believed that the false self develops to protect the true self from destruction by a mother who is unable to respond well enough to the infant's needs. </p> <p>Leo Woodward describes his 'confusing' childhood in just such a way, and over the past nine years he's seen both an individual and several group therapists to try to make peace with both its legacy and himself. After her first husband died, his mother moved in as his father's housekeeper. 'Then, a year after her first husband died, she got pregnant by my father and married him. I was the \"rescuer\", brought into the world to make this rather doomed project work. There was little real relationship between my parents, I think.' </p> <p>Though his childhood was 'a maelstrom of feelings', a lot of these he felt unable to express. At the age of 11, his parents separated and he was sent to Cheltenham College as a boarder. 'I loved it, because it was an escape from my family.' Yet his parents' divorce, combined with the 'maturational struggles of adolescence', was already hitting him hard. Later, his relationships with women were often unhappy: a broken love affair after he left school; a more recent relationship, nine years ago, when he felt 'used for sex by a woman who had promised to leave her fiance'. </p> <p>After qualifying as a barrister, his early working life, too, seemed like a rush for the unattainable. He pursued several careers at the same time - managing editor of a publishing company; working part-time for an environmental law consultancy; acting in theatre - which 'precluded me from being truly successful at any'. In 1995, in crisis, he heard about body-based psychotherapy, or 'bioenergetics', which starts from the theory that our experiences are stored in our bodies: unlike classical psychoanalysis, where there is no touch, the therapist may hold the patient, and breathing and posture are worked on. 'I thought I might get in touch with my feelings, but, catalysed by the failure of my relationship, my whole world started crumbling. I used to lie on the ground, sobbing a lot.' </p> <p>He has seen the therapist for eight years now and, finally, was due to finish at the end of July. He has also undertaken, and trained in, arts therapy and 'psychodrama', in which a person 'enacts personal issues rather than simply talking about them'. He has 'explored all the religions', and practises meditation and yoga. The result of all this searching? 'I've gone from someone who struggled to hold down a full-time job to having a successful career as an organisational consultant and coach, earning three times as much money. I'm working at board level with very high-profile organisations. And on the inside I feel like I inhabit my body rather than just move it around, and can like who I am for much of the time. And my relationships with parents, family and women have been transformed.'</p> <p>Six months have passed since I first met Jacklyn. We're sitting in a churchyard in the spring sunshine, and she seems lighter, less burdened. She smiles more. Being with her family in Australia, she says, was not as bad as she feared. 'Although I was away from my husband, I felt able to \"hold\" his love inside me, and not feel so insecure.' The biggest news, though, is that she is pregnant. And this, she admits, has helped her feel 'different as a person'. It created difficulties with her sister, however, who was jealous: she would like to start a family, but her husband does not want children. </p> <p>On returning home, however, Jacklyn learnt that her therapist is moving to Scotland. She's just beginning the process of assessing how much she has learnt, and what she will miss. 'I find it easier to tolerate my emotions now.' And, sure enough, in the past month, feeling bullied by her boss, she's changed job. Her relationship with her husband has improved as well. 'When we met we were both emotionally immature, but we now have a very loving, close relationship. Before, I was rather needy and he was afraid of commitment. I've stopped projecting all my shit on to him.' But the news that her therapist is moving continues to discomfort her. 'He has helped me change my life so much for the better: who is going to explain my emotions to me now?' </p> <p>A few days later I meet Leon Bosch in a pub in west London. He's with his wife Barbara, which in itself seems an important step, a trusting gesture. And when he talks he turns also to her, including her in the conversation. He's also, I notice, talking less rapidly. I remember the first email he sent me, in which he set out the 'subject matter' of his dreams in numbered points. He seems less controlled now. Somewhat unexpectedly, he's fairly ambivalent about therapy. Yes, he concedes, his 'relationship with the world is improving', but 'I went into therapy to deal with the effects of being a political prisoner, and I'm still no closer to doing that.' </p> <p>He's working on plans to change his career - big plans, working in 'international relations, statecraft'. But at the same time he realises that, when 'something painful arises, I'm less inclined to avoid it'. I ask Barbara, who's been sitting quietly, listening, if she's noticed any change in him. 'Yes,' she smiles. 'He's less of a perfectionist.' </p> <p>Maybe what's beginning here is what the psychoanalyst and author Adam Phillips describes as the 'need to create distance from... our childhood; or rather, what Freud refers to as infantile sexuality, which is alive in the adult as unconscious desire'. And it is this desire, this wanting, that 'puts one's life in danger. There is the danger of punishment for desiring the forbidden ... and there is the danger of unacknowledged dependence, and the potential for loss.' </p> <p>The narrative of neurosis, he says, works something like this: 'A person begins... in fear of losing his parents' love; and then, having internalised their authority, he ends up fearing (and courting) the loss of his love for himself.' The painful work of therapy, then, involves facing up to these deep inner conflicts. Woodward, for one, believes that 'therapy, and certainly the healing journey as a whole, can have a happy ending.' </p> <p>Citing Dante's Divine Comedy, he argues that 'the only way out is the way down: a descent into darkness, the long, slow climb up the mountain of self-knowledge to the vision of wholeness and [the] glimpse of \"that love which moves the sun and the other stars\".' Or maybe, more prosaically, the best therapy can do, by alerting us and hopefully reconciling ourselves to our inner demons, is to make us live more easily with ourselves. Keats, writing long before Freud, called it negative capability: 'When a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason'. </p> <p>If we can do this, maybe we will be able to acknowledge our own troublesome feelings without the need to offload difficult emotions on to others. Maybe we will learn to better tolerate ourselves, and tolerate what we previously found intolerable in others. But if we're going to enlist the help of a therapist in this process, where should we look? </p> <p>One of the few therapists to have undertaken a review of psychotherapy research is Professor Peter Fonagy, whose book What Works for Whom? A Critical Review of Psychotherapy Research, published in 1996, reviewed 50 years' research into different therapies. Among his conclusions were that acute anxiety-related problems may respond well to brief therapy, while deeper problems require longer treatment; and patients who have lost their trust because of past abusive relationships will generally be hard to treat. Phobias and panic attacks, he found, can often best be treated in cognitive behavioural sessions rather than with psychoanalytic therapy. </p> <p>The vital ingredient, though, is human: the commitment, empathy, professionalism and love of the therapist, just as the crucial factor for us all as small children was the degree to which our mothers could help us in our distress, enjoy feeding us and allow us to grow and play without too much fear, or neglect, or intrusion. Psychoanalyst John Bowlby, who formulated attachment theory - which suggests that the degree to which small infants feel 'securely attached' to their mothers crucially affects the way they engage with the world for the rest of their lives - believed that 'the human psyche, like human bones, is strongly inclined towards self-healing. The psychotherapist's job, like that of the orthopaedic surgeon, is to provide the conditions in which self-healing can take place.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Some participants' names have been changed.

  "<p> As guilty pleasures go, savagely violent Seventies revenge movies are hard to beat. While bleeding-heart liberals may scoff at the base nature of exploitation flicks which take literally the biblical dictum of an eye for eye, audiences have long relished the retributive violence of such popular pay-back shockers as Death Wish, Death Weekend, Straw Dogs or Deliverance. In each of these films, a mild-mannered antihero (or heroine) is driven to violent extremes by attacks on their homes, friends, family or selves, which bring out the animal within. Respectable critics, however, have not been impressed; Variety called Michael Winner's Death Wish a 'poisonous incitement to do-it-yourself law enforcement' and condemned Deliverance for 'wallowing in deadly beauty'. Meanwhile, the late film critic Pauline Kael famously labelled Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs 'a fascist work of art'.</p> <p>This month, the Edinburgh Film Festival plays host to the premiere of Dead Man's Shoes, a controversial Brit pic which revisits the visceral thrills of this disreputable genre. Unlike the postmodern revenge shocker Irr\u00e9versible, which director Gaspar No\u00e9 likened to 'Straw Dogs told backwards', Dead Man's Shoes plays its throwback narrative straight, with no ironic trappings to alleviate its unashamedly angry tone.</p> <p>'I'm not an angry man,' chrips director Shane Meadows, the affably bouncy British talent who scored a low-budget success with the acclaimed 24 7, and then cemented his reputation with the comedic offerings A Room for Romeo Brass and Once Upon a Time in the Midlands. 'I'm not violent and I've never enjoyed violence,' he explains. 'But at the end of the day, the characters who get killed in Dead Man's Shoes are based on people I want to kill. It's true and I'm not going to lie about it.'</p> <p>The characters in question are drug peddling hustlers who use and abuse a simple-minded young man in a faceless Midlands village and subsequently face the wrath of his brother, a returning soldier played with powerful conviction by actor-screenwriter Paddy Considine. 'Every small town has its secrets,' says Meadows, who lost a close friend to schizophrenia and suicide at the age of 17, and still bears resentment towards those who took advantage of him. 'It was one of those environments where anyone who showed any kind of weakness was preyed upon, and that's pretty much what happened to him. And it's the same all over the country.'</p> <p>In Dead Man's Shoes, Meadows vents his frustrations at a plethora of 'heinous crimes that haven't been paid for' in a thriller which attempts to transform the 'West Country western' sensibility of Straw Dogs into a 'Midlands Mad Max'. Armed with a gas mask, an axe and a can of spray paint, Considine methodically wreaks the type of havoc formerly doled out by the likes of Robert Ginty in The Exterminator. Using his military training to turn incongruously domestic settings into a bloody battlefield, he repaints a lavatory blood red, finds a novel use for a suitcase and even lends a psychotic twist to the simple act of putting the kettle on. 'The thing I remember about Death Wish,' says Meadows, 'was the fact that the Bronson character uses such low-tech weaponry, like coins in a sock. I don't know why, but we respond to those kind of things, and I have tried to do something similar with the violence in my own film.'</p> <p>Along with the Bronson classic, other significantly disreputable influences on Dead Man's Shoes include the Sly Stallone action film Rambo: First Blood, which provided the template of the returning soldier taking the law into his own hands, and Southern Comfort in which American National Guardsman discover their savage inner selves while lost in bayou country.</p> <p>'What attracted me to many of those films,' remembers Meadows, 'was that their central characters were almost like spokesmen for the dark recesses of our own minds. Me and Paddy had a conversation about road rage, which I admit I suffer from. I've been in a car where somebody's cut me up and I've seriously wanted to follow them, pull out an axe, cut their vehicle into pieces and say, \"Well, you'll never do that again, now will you?!\" What actually happens is that I smile, put my hand up and drive home with all these poisonous thoughts running around in my brain. But at least I admit to those thoughts.'</p> <p>Also lurking behind the harsh realism of Dead Man's Shoes is the spectre of Alan Clarke, the British dramatist responsible for such confrontational works as Made in Britain, in which Tim Roth played a skinhead thug, and Scum, the notoriously tough borstal drama which introduced Ray Winstone to the film world. Despite the inevitable comparisons with Ken Loach and Mike Leigh which seem to beset any British film-maker with a sense of social realism, it is the uncompromising Clarke to whom Meadows's work owes the greatest debt.</p> <p>'I had grown up on those very rough Play for Today-type dramas,' he agrees 'and I was always a huge fan of Clarke. When I saw Made in Britain, I was so impressed that I almost wanted to go and sniff glue just to find out how someone could appear so cool while doing something so disgusting. And I definitely had the edginess of Clarke's work in mind throughout the making of Dead Man's Shoes.'</p> <p>For such a nihilistic film, Dead Man's Shoes actually began life as a black comedy about a social worker who dressed as a superhero to avenge the wrongdoers of his town. 'Paddy grew up in Winshill in Burton on Trent, and he told me this story about a man going round in a ninja suit beating up drug addicts in the park. He had a mask on, but the thing was that he was really bad at fighting. The idea had us in tears, but it turns out that all the kids from around there became quite passionate about the idea of this ninja superhero coming all the way over from Japan just to protect the people of Winshill.' The more the pair worked on this idea, however, the more brutal it became, until all sense of comedy was overshadowed by a cloud of vengeance. 'We hit a wall,' admits Meadows, 'and so we decided to change direction, and do something we hadn't done before.'</p> <p>Coincidentally, this was the complete inverse of what had happened to Meadows's previous film, Once Upon a Time in the Midlands, which began life as a contemporary take upon the western myth of the 'Man with No Name' but somehow got sidetracked into romantic whimsical comedy packed with kooky country'n'western characters. As a result of script changes, Considine bowed out of Once Upon a Time (he went on to star in Jim Sheridan's Oscar-nominated In America) while Meadows ended up having a high-profile fall-out with his producer over the nature of the film.</p> <p>In Dead Man's Shoes, which was shot guerrilla-style on a tight budget with a compact crew, the pair finally got the chance to make a movie for themselves, returning to their roots to create something which would 'provoke a love it or hate it reaction'. 'I know there'll be some disapproval, but I've lived in the real world, and there are two kinds of law - the law of the land and human law. I can't bear the intellectualisation of these kinds of things. You can talk and talk, but when terrible things actually happen to someone close to you it's a very different story.'</p> <p>None of which is to suggest that Meadows is actively campaigning on behalf of vigilante violence. Like so many of its predecessors, Dead Man's Shoes paints its retribution as ultimately self-destructive, and ends on a note of tragic redemption. Meadows remains an opponent of the death penalty ('you wind up killing innocent people') and is no fan of the actions of vigilante farmer Tony Martin ('a bridge too far'), who is considered a hero by some sections of the British public. Yet he is adamant that the vengeful impulses portrayed in movies, from Death Wish to his own, are merely a reflection of the primal fantasies which haunt even the most civilised viewer.</p> <p>'As I said, I'm not the kind of person who's going to act on these impulses. But nor do I allow them to fester inside myself any more. I try and find a way of getting them out of my system. And film does that for me. But without film, without the catharsis that it offers, God knows what would have happened.'</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Dead Man's Shoes will be screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival on 20 August; it opens across the UK on 1 October</p> <p><strong>Blasts from the past</strong> </p> <p><strong>Straw Dogs (1971)</strong> Dustin Hoffman and Susan George escape to the West Country but endure harassment from the locals, before deciding to fight back.</p> <p> <strong>Death Wish (1974)</strong> Charles Bronson's mild-mannered New York architect turns into a ruthless vigilante after his wife is murdered.</p> <p><strong>First Blood (1982)</strong> An unstable Vietnam vet, played by Sylvester Stallone, gets a hostile welcome from local police while hitch-hiking across the country, so he turns the tables on them.</p> <p><strong>Falling Down (1993)</strong> Michael Douglas loses his cool in Los Angeles on a burning hot day after he gets stuck in a traffic jam.

  "<p> I have always been on the move like a Scandinavian nomad in an unknown tribe, doing serious writing wherever I happened to be. When I was very young, I remember once living clandestinely in an empty apartment in Stockholm. There were no lamps in the flat. The only light I could find was when I opened the oven. Fine by me. I used the oven as a table, put my typewriter there and had all the light I needed. </p> <p>Everything is possible. I still remember in 1992, writing The White Lioness in Maputo, east Africa. I lived in a small room where I was surrounded by other small rooms, and - I counted them - seven radios, playing loudly, but tuned into different music stations. It happened that I, maybe once a week, lost my temper and asked them if they at least not could choose one programme to listen to. Everyone was very understanding; they turned off the radios completely for 15 minutes and then it started all over again. </p> <p>I loved my neighbours. And I wrote the novel. So I think I can write almost anywhere. I can never excuse myself for failing in my work by blaming the room, wherever or whatever it may be. </p> <p>But perhaps this is not completely true. There is an exception to this rule. There is a sacred spot somewhere in the world. I spend time in this sacred spot and I must admit that I sometimes long to go there. On the other hand, I am always afraid to lose my independence. I can not fall in love too much with that little house. </p> <p>North of the island of Gotland, this very rare and magic island in the Baltic, some 35 minutes' flying time from Stockholm, there is another island, even smaller. Its name is F\u00e5r\u00f6 - meaning Sheep Island, and it is separated from Gotland by a firth where there is a ferry. This island has a magical landscape - it could be Ireland, the Hebrides or even the bush in north-eastern South Africa. All by itself on the eastern rocky beach is a small wooden cabin. It was originally built in the 1930s by a man who used to hunt during the winter season. Today, I can occasionally use it to live and work in. The cabin is situated some 30 metres from the sea. When the wind is strong, the salty waves almost reach the windows. </p> <p>In this cabin, there is a kind of emptiness that is strange, rather impossible to explain. When I enter, I have a feeling that someone has just left, even though the house may have been abandoned for months. I am not talking about 'ghosts'; it is more the feeling that this cabin is breathing. But what is really magical about this cabin is that the mostly fictional characters I write about seem to like the cabin as much as I do. In just a couple of days, they fill the room with their voices. They share my bed, my food and they walk with me on the beach. </p> <p>It took me some years to realise that this cabin is good when I have something really difficult to write. The house is a masterly servant. So I am happy that this cabin exists. And that I occasionally can use it. Among all the various rooms where I write, this little cabin is the centre that does not move, that is always there. </p> <p>By the way, the owner of the cabin is Ingmar Bergman, who happens to be my father-in-law. As far as I know, he has never done any writing there. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong> Henning Mankell's prize-winning Inspector Wallander thrillers consistently top European bestseller lists</p>",
  "<p> In the film Swimming Pool (2003), Charlotte Rampling plays an English crime writer who goes off to the south of France to work on a book. It is a good film for many reasons, but the scene I liked best was the writer's wordless and businesslike arrival at the house. Yes, she briskly checked out the view: trees, lawn, pool. Yes, she noted that there was a kitchen. But basically, from the moment she arrived, she cased the joint like a professional burglar, and I knew exactly why she was doing it. </p> <p>Narrowing her eyes, she selected an upstairs room, cleared a table of ornaments and dragged it to the window, sought and found an electric socket, drew a spaghetti of electric cables (with continental adapters) out of her hand luggage, placed her laptop on the table and opened it, stood back to admire the effect - and then, finally, exhaled for the first time. </p> <p>Watching her do this, I had mixed feelings. Part of me was quite taken aback: here was my arrival-at-holiday-home routine vividly enacted on screen - and, I have to say, it looked a bit peculiar and unpleasant. At the same time, I was simply relieved: good result with that electric socket, Charlotte! Both of us knew, you see, that things don't always work out that easily. </p> <p>Writing away from home is something I've done for about 10 years. When I worked as a television critic in the 1990s, I found that I couldn't write fiction at home, so I had the bright idea of renting a small place in Brighton for the purpose. It worked. For my second novel, I would decamp for a month at a time to the Isle of Wight with a carload of books and equipment. For my third novel, it was Dublin, which was less successful. I rented a flat near to Dublin Castle which seemed quite OK until I realised that, all day and all night, I could hear, very distinctly, an automatic garage door opening and closing. Du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du it went (up); then du-du-du-du-du-d u-du-du it went (down). Sometimes it would be halfway down (du-du-du-du-du), then reverse gears and go up again (du-du-du-du-du). </p> <p>As you can see, I became sensitised to this up-and-down activity, which I first assumed must be the knocking of pipes. I even phoned the owners to ask about the frightful du-du-du-du-du noise - but they disingenuously professed not to know what noise I was referring to. By the end of two weeks (I had booked for four), I was yelling at the unseen garage-users: 'Why can't you all come in and go out at the same time, you bastards?' At the end of three weeks, I went home. </p> <p>But my garage-door days are over, because I have found my ideal place, a Greek island in the Dodecanese. A bit obvious? Well, not to me. I was never a Greek-island kind of girl before and, in fact, my beloved Halki remains the only Greek island I know. A painting holiday first took me there in 2002 and I was struck immediately by two things: that it was the kind of place a woman could go by herself; and that it was laughably cheap and jolly compared with Dublin. </p> <p>I now spend up to 10 weeks a year in Halki, regard myself as a semi-resident, have many Halki-loving (and also Halki-dwelling) friends and get quite defensive when people refer to my visits as 'holiday'. The point is, I am very productive on my Greek island, perhaps because there are no media distractions. It's astonishing but true: during one four-week trip 18 months ago, I wrote two-and-a-half 30-minute radio drama scripts, plus a short story, a book review and an essay about the history of television. And I still came home with a tan. </p> <p>Halki is a 75-minute ferry-ride west from the nearest point on Rhodes - just too far to prevent day trippers from cluttering up the place. It has a harbour with tavernas, bars and small supermarkets, behind which a U-shaped town is ranged. Nice church; tall campanile; picturesque fishing boats on turquoise water; town hall clock permanently showing 25 past one; cocks crowing; cats sleeping; cerise bougainvillaea; bright stars at night. Pretty much your idea of a Greek island, really. </p> <p>It is not always dead quiet because of intermittent building work, but what I prize about Halki is that it has nothing to offer the sensation-seeker. There are no nightclubs, for a start; and the one small hotel stands empty for most of the year (it's run by the council), so all the tourists are in self-catering accommodation, mixed in with the Greeks. There is nowhere to hire a car or bike - and nowhere much to drive to, in any case. </p> <p>The one road on the island leads to a monastery, past an old ruined town with an old ruined castle above it. The only thrill is the earth-trembling arrival and departure of the large Athens-Rhodes ferries. Nearly all my snaps of Halki show the arrival or departure of the 'big boat', because I get so excited about it. My friends at home have stopped asking to look at them. </p> <p>My only concern about Halki is the way I can exist in this fabulous environment, sitting at my laptop, and not be inspired to write about it. Is it a terrible indictment? Because the thing is, when I'm in Halki, I don't write about Greek islands; I write ghost stories set in Cambridge or radio comedies set in the London hat business of the 1920s. Last year at about this time, I was mapping out a classic serial set in Highgate during the Second World War and sitting on my terrace making notes about the way Hampstead Heath was quarried in 1940 for sandbags. </p> <p>I wonder: is it good to be the kind of person who can sit at a window filled with the colours of the Aegean but still write a monologue set in the lingerie department of a big shop in Oxford Street? What does that say about the human brain? Oh well, ask Jonathan Miller; I don't know. </p> <p>Sometimes, of course, one fantasises about living in the sun permanently. Many writers have done it. All you need, apparently, is an old Panama hat, a Remington typewriter, a faithful companion-cum-servant who is willing to shop for exotic loaves and the ability to order strong drinks in the local lingo. I suspect, however, that my gender may be against the fulfilment of this Graham Greene idyll; besides, on Halki, I'd go nuts within a year. </p> <p>As it is, I must always make respite trips to the more cosmopolitan Rhodes during my stays in Halki so that I can - well, mainly so that I can buy a newspaper. Have you noticed how big things always happen when you're out of the country? I was in Halki when David Kelly died. My mum told me on the phone and I had no idea what to make of it. 'Why? How? But this is big !' I said, fruitlessly. I was in Halki, also, when I heard about the Madrid bombings and DBC Pierre winning the Booker prize. However, I was, for once, in the right place at the right time when Greece survived the first round of Euro 2004, so that was a definite consolation. </p> <p>I yearn for Halki and my chin always wobbles when I leave. I think the best aspect of it, for me, is the healthy indoors/outdoors ratio that the lifestyle there imposes. At home, I might work all day indoors and then stay indoors again in the evening. In Halki, this simply can't happen. I work indoors until one, then pack a beach bag and go for a swim, a sunbed snooze and an omelette at Nick's Taverna (possibly my favourite spot on earth). I come back again at about four, have a shower and another restorative lie-down, do a bit more work till about 7.30pm, then coat myself in mosquito repellent, put on a nice strappy frock and go out for dinner with my Halki mates. Sometimes I'm in, you see, but equally, sometimes I'm out. Oh, the glory of limited choice! </p> <p> And meanwhile, I do ask myself: would I rather be in the Aegean writing about Oxford Street or in Oxford Street writing about the Aegean? Well, just so long as that electric socket is in a convenient position, there is actually no contest. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong> Lynne Truss is the author of the worldwide bestseller Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves.

  "<p>It's every literary enthusiast's dream to stumble across a lost work by an author whose canon is thought to be complete, and this seems to have been a good season for such discoveries. As well as the Larkin poem discovered in the archives of Leicester University, an essay by Virginia Woolf has also been unearthed by one determined publisher. The essay was the sixth in a series Woolf wrote on aspects of life in London for Good Housekeeping magazine in 1931. </p> <p>For Emma Cahill, the discovery could not have been more timely. Last year, she set up an independent publishing company, Snowbooks, which had enjoyed a measure of success rare among new, small publishers with its first title, Robert Finn's Adept, thanks to an exclusive deal with the Waterstone's chain of bookshops. </p> <p>Many would-be small publishers possess literary idealism by the truckload but fail when it comes to the nuts and bolts of retail strategy. But Snowbooks's directors came from a corporate background and set out with a clear campaign to disprove the widely accepted truth that the big retail chains don't even bother to look at books published by small companies. </p> <p>But its breakthrough publication will be The London Scene, Woolf's collected pieces, which have been out of print since 1982 and, in particular, the 'lost' essay, 'Portrait of a Londoner'. Revived interest in Woolf since the success of Michael Cunningham's novel, The Hours, and the subsequent film, together with the excitement always generated by the idea of a new addition to the corpus of a major English writer, ought to ensure a degree of attention for Snowbooks that many larger publishers would spend a fortune to achieve. </p> <p>The company, which consists of three directors, one multitasking employee and a series of interns, is the result of a 10-year dream for Cahill. 'We've all worked in big corporations and loved the idea of starting a small, passionate company that would produce books we're proud of,' she said. </p> <p>'People told us so many times that it wouldn't work, that small companies can't get into the bookshops, but it has helped that we were able to approach the buyers at Waterstone's in their own language.' </p> <p>Despite the triumph of getting a big chain to stock its titles, Snowbooks remains a labour of love. Cahill, who works full-time and does not take a salary, and her co-directors both have day jobs. </p> <p>But its production standards are high. The London Scene is a beautifully illustrated, gift-book-sized hardback that marks the launch of the Signature Collection, a series of neglected or forgotten works by major authors. Next in line are pieces by EM Forster, Edgar Allan Poe and Jerome K Jerome, which are to be published in the spring. </p> <p>The Tindall Street Press has already shown how an independent publisher can compete with the mainstream in terms of literary prizes, and Snowbooks's modus operandi is now attracting international interest. It has been approached by agents offering books which already have mainstream publishers in the United States. In the current market, it's a brave move, but one that happily seems to be attracting support from unexpected quarters.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.snowbooks.com  \">www.snowbooks.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There is a disconcerting moment in Hawking, the BBC2 drama about the wheelchair-bound Cambridge physicist, when a large, gormless young man announces to a startled barmaid: 'I think in a number of dimensions. I can't get back quickly for words or beer.' Later, the same nitwit is seen spouting scientific cliches at a open-air tutorial and then ends the programme cavorting round a railway station with Hawking (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), using umbrellas as props to reveal the secrets of space and time.</p> <p>In this way, Sir Roger Penrose, a founder of modern cosmology, one of the nation's intellectual heavyweights, and a collaborator with Stephen Hawking on the science of black holes, is presented to the public - as a pompous blabbermouth who cannot even order a pint.</p> <p>The reality, it should be noted, is very different and it says a great deal for the man - impish, intense and utterly lacking in self-importance - that he refrains from striking me after I raise the subject of Hawking during our meeting in the Tsar Bar in London's Langham Hotel, where he also shows himself perfectly capable of ordering a drink. 'Yes, I am in the programme in the sense that an actor [Tom Ward] plays someone with my name,' says Penrose, whose latest book, The Road to Reality (Cape \u00a330, pp1,094), is published this month. 'The rest makes me cringe. I never said anything like that in a pub, I never spoke like that at a tutorial and the station scene with Hawking never happened.'</p> <p>Thus science is turned to fiction by TV producers who have no faith in its intrinsic fascination: scenes are manufactured and scientists made freaks or buffoons. Too bad if these are people who are interesting in their own right, a point perfectly exemplified by Penrose, whose mathematics inspired artist MC Escher, who has the distinction of suing a lavatory-paper maker over the misuse of scientific ideas, who has aroused the fury of evolutionary biologists for debunking their ideas about human consciousness, and whose latest book rivals Newton's Principia for its depth and ambition in its attempt to provide a complete account of the physical universe and its laws.</p> <p>It's an impressive list of achievements, a pedigree that is shared by the rest of the Penrose family. His father was an Oxford professor of genetics, his elder brother and only sister are academics, while Jonathan, the youngest Penrose, was British chess champion 10 times. A cerebral lot, though they are also highly artistic - Penrose's grandfather was a professional portrait painter and for family fun used to draw strange optical illusions on paper: winding staircases that neither ascended or descended, that sort of thing.</p> <p>After a chance meeting with Escher, the Dutch artist noted for his disconcerting, illusional artwork, Penrose sent him examples of his family's art, and these were adopted (and acknowledged) by the painter in some of his later work. Much of this involved interlocking grids of repeated figures - ducks and fish, for example - and Penrose later developed these ideas to create ways of covering surfaces with flat, geometric shapes that never repeat themselves: Penrose tiling, as it is now known.</p> <p>The mathematician would have forgotten his brainchild had his wife, Vanessa, not noticed the packet of Kleenex Quilted Toilet Tissues she had just bought in her local supermarket had a pattern that bore more than a passing resemblance to her husband's tiling. In fact, it had been appropriated by the company. Lawyers were called in. 'I should explain the loo-roll business except I cannot as there was an out-of-court settlement, a condition of which is that I am not allowed to talk about it,' says Penrose rather unhelpfully, though his smile suggests there was a happy outcome.</p> <p>In fact, Penrose made his name as an outstandingly brilliant mathematician, not from his topological work but from his forays into the esoteric land of quantum physics, working at Cambridge with Hawking on black holes, collapsed stars so dense even light cannot leave their surfaces. His was a reputation of quiet distinction until, a few years ago, he launched a furious attack on computer experts who were claiming their machines would become clever enough to develop minds. 'We will never make computers conscious,' he says, a point emphasised in his books, The Emperor's New Mind, and Shadows of the Mind. 'A computational device is incapable of developing a mind. We got consciousness not just by being clever.'</p> <p>These ideas went down badly with evolutionary biologists and philosophers like Daniel Dennett. To such researchers, the notion that humans are specially elevated because they suddenly came to possess consciousness stinks of godly intervention. 'Quite fallacious', 'wrong', 'invalid' and 'deeply flawed' ran the reviews. Penrose sighs. 'Yes, I got it in the neck. But these people were not listening to what I was saying. They were just shooting from the hip.'</p> <p>His consciousness books have led directly to The Road to Reality. 'Colleagues liked my equations but not the contentious stuff about the mind and urged me to write a straightforward book on physics. I thought it would be a simple scissors job but it didn't work out that way.'</p> <p>In the end, Penrose, who was 73 last week, produced a great, fat, black hole of a book that makes Bill Bryson's 600-page A Short History of Nearly Everything look like a theatre programme. It weighs more than 3lbs and its 1,094 pages are packed with equations and artwork - drawn freehand by Penrose - of Riemann surfaces, singularities and other mathematical oddities. It is a vast, formidable undertaking that covers the entire gamut of physics, from Greek astronomy to superstring theory.</p> <p>As one reviewer remarked: 'The book took Penrose eight years to complete, and it will take some readers just as long to understand him.' Certainly, the book has it all: calculus, quantum mechanics, relativity, the big bang, string theory and just about anything ever written that has a number in it. If you want to know what makes the universe tick, you will find it here. Not bad for a gormless lounge-bar poser.</p>",

It is easier said than done, but getting to the point of exchanging as soon as possible will also narrow the chances of being overtaken by another buyer.' </p> <p>Exclusivity agreements can help to avoid gazumping, but bear in mind they are not commonly used and will incur extra legal costs. </p> <p>These involve a contract stating that during a specified exclusivity period, typically 10 days, the seller will not enter into any agreement with anyone else. Another way to get further peace of mind might be to ask your estate agent or mortgage lender about the possibility of buying gazumping insur- ance. These policies pay out should you be gazumped again, but do check terms and conditions carefully before buying such a policy.</p>",
  "<p>The government is facing demands from multinational companies totalling up to \u00a320 billion after the High Court allowed yet another legal challenge to the Inland Revenue's corporate tax rules.</p> <p>More than 300 companies including BMW, Coca-Cola and Adidas have now filed legal actions in London, claiming that the British government has taxed them on their UK earnings in ways that break European law. </p> <p>Siemens, Monsanto, AstraZeneca and Carlsberg are also among the corporate giants who are taking on the Inland Revenue. </p> <p>If successful, their legal claims have the potential to derail Chancellor Gordon Brown's spending plans. </p> <p>The multinationals complain that, for much of the Nineties, their UK subsidiaries were forced to pay corporation tax to the Inland Revenue before they were able to transfer their UK profits to parent companies abroad. </p> <p>The European Court of Justice ruled in 2000 that this rule broke EU agreements and discriminated against non-UK corporations. The multinationals have since been engaged in a long-running legal battle to get their taxes back, and their final High Court showdown with the Inland Revenue is scheduled for next year. </p> <p>Earlier this month a judge gave the go-ahead for a related piece of litigation in which the BT pension fund, Shell pension fund and others are also claiming multimillion-pound rebates. </p> <p>The Inland Revenue has refused to disclose how much it would have to pay if it lost next year's vital test-case.</p> <p>But a number of companies are claiming more than \u00a350 million each, and experts believe that Whitehall could ultimately be faced with a bill of up to \u00a320bn.</p> <p>'Virtually every multinational company stands to benefit if the British government loses,' a leading tax accountant said.</p>",
  "<p>Am I alone in detecting a whiff of smugness in our cool British air? Talking to other business people in Britain, I sense an implicit swelling of pride in our goodish financial performance as old rivals like Germany struggle with high unemployment and a wheezing economy. </p> <p>Time to be careful, I suggest. Smugness is first cousin of hubris, which is always followed by ruin. </p> <p>Why am I so gloomy? Because I believe there is a fault line in our national psyche that could have fatal effects on our prosperity. That fault line is a very British belief that the world of ideas is peripheral to our commercial success, whereas I think it is central. </p> <p>Here's an example - when I saw a Sony Walkman for the first time in the Seventies, Britain's Rank Bush Murphy was a major force in home electronics. Since then Sony has embraced the world of ideas and prospered. Look at us, in contrast. </p> <p>Kenneth Grange, the great British product designer, told me once that he loved to work in Japan because they saw real commercial value in great design. It is not uncommon for a big Japanese corporation to have a design director on the main board. Now try imagining that here. </p> <p>A generation after the Walkman, the new must-have music product is the iPod - a brilliantly fresh design idea that has captured everyone's imagination. This breakthrough product has dramatically reversed the fortunes of Apple, which suddenly has something even Microsoft's Bill Gates hasn't got. The iPod is of course the work of a young British designer (Jonathan Ive), but he is working for an American company because it understands that great design can inspire commercial success. </p> <p>Deep in the darkest corners of the English preoccupation with class is a belief that designing and making things is blue-collar stuff, not white collar. We even show our disdain for manufactured products by calling them all 'widgets' as if to identify them correctly would take us too close to the coal face. Nice middle-class boys become accountants, lawyers or bankers. There's nothing wrong with the professions but a nation needs to do more than advise - it has to create, too. </p> <p>The irony is that we are world leaders in creating. British advertising agencies are as good as you can find. Ridley Scott, Alan Parker and Anthony Minghella are among the best film directors. The Pompidou centre in Paris was designed by British architect Richard Rogers (with Italy's Renzo Piano) and built by the British firm Ove Arup.</p> <p>Most ironic of all, the vehicle that revolutionised the way we think about the car was the Mini, a great British design. And who is making a fortune with the new version? Yes, that grand old British company, BMW.</p> <p>We have the creative talent, we have the design imagination, but we do not have the belief that such talent should be at the heart of a business. I ran a check on which areas the chief executives of the FTSE 100 companies came from and found that 26 per cent had been finance men or women and 29 per cent had been operational managers. How many had been marketing heads? A grand total of 6 per cent. </p> <p>If we really believe in the power of good ideas to excite the customer, then marketing would be a valued discipline that would lead to the top job. But it didn't in 94 per cent of the top 100 British companies. Before you say most marketing directors just aren't good enough for the top, isn't that the point? In a country where marketing is undervalued, no wonder it doesn't attract the best people. In our strange class culture, marketing is below the salt. </p> <p>It's a prejudice we breed early. Lots of people want to read media studies at university. It's the study of how mass communication works. Not a bad start for a life in business, you might think. but media studies is widely dismissed by the great and the good as not a 'proper' subject. Victorian novels good, modern films bad is the defining ethos. In the United States, 30 per cent of the workforce is employed in some kind of creative industry, whether it be film, TV, music or journalism and so on. I wonder if they sneer at media studies there? </p> <p>I started by asking if our smugness at the expense of, among others, the Germans was wise. I touched on the fate of the Mini, now in German hands. BMW also owns Rolls-Royce and Bentley is part of Volkswagen. Meanwhile, Ford of America has snapped up Jaguar and Land-Rover. Their cultures understand the value of a brand. </p> <p>Meanwhile, our great designers and creative thinkers are facing an ungracious reception at the tradesmen's entrance. Or they are getting out their passports to go to a place where they'll be welcome at the main gates? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roger Mavity is chairman of the marketing and public relations firm Citigate Dewe Rogerson.</p>",
  "<p>What next for ITV? If stock market rumours are to be believed, the broadcaster's long-suffering shareholders are in line for a lucrative payout. Chief executive Charles Allen is drawing up plans to return \u00a31.2 billion of cash, according to reports last week, although the City will have to wait until ITV has sold off 'non-core' assets until receiving the money. </p> <p>ITV denies there are any such plans afoot, describing it as an 'August story' with no basis in fact. </p> <p>But whatever the truth, the market is taking it seriously. ITV's shares had risen by 3.3 per cent to 101 3/4p by Friday's close, making it one of the highest climbers in the FTSE and reversing a recent slide prompted by poor July audience share figures (as low as 19.9 per cent). </p> <p>Few doubt that Allen is lining up for sale the fringe businesses, including its stakes in Premiership football clubs, although analysts estimate that he will be lucky to raise much more than \u00a3600m from the disposal. </p> <p>Crucially, however, this does buy Allen more time to prove he is the right man to guide ITV through a difficult post-merger period. </p> <p>Allen is the media world's great survivor, emerging Houdini-like from the shareholder rebellion that forced the resignation last year of ITV chairman-elect Michael Green. </p> <p>That was orchestrated by American fund manager Fidelity, but there is little chance of a repeat performance despite the lingering resentment felt by many investors over the ITV digital debacle, which cost the company \u00a31.2bn. </p> <p>For one thing, Fidelity fund manager Anthony Bolton is eager to shed his reputation as a corporate rabble-rouser. But there is also a feeling, even among critics who unfairly deride former accountant Allen as a 'numbers man', that he is the right chief executive to see the company through its consolidation. </p> <p>The company is on course to strip out nearly \u00a3100m of costs by next year, following last year's merger, despite initial industry scepticism about where the savings would come from. </p> <p>Combining Carlton and Granada's production divisions, head offices and sales forces has produced \u00a360m of cuts already. In addition to the \u00a3100m headline figure, more money will be saved now that Match of the Day has returned to the BBC. ITV paid \u00a360m for the rights to screen Premiership highlights but analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate the end of this 'ruinous' contract will save \u00a335m, even after the firm has reinvested some of the money in other programming. </p> <p>ITV is also hoping to shave \u00a310m a year from its news budget. But the biggest savings, of about \u00a375m, will come from renegotiating its licences, which are due for renewal next year, and lobbying to be released from its public service broadcasting requirements, which could save a further \u00a3250m. </p> <p>The company estimates that nearly a third of its weekly schedule is taken up by programmes designed to serve minority groups - including religious affairs, children's shows and regional news - that are not much loved by advertisers. Shedding the public service obligations would allow ITV to show more popular programmes at peak times, boosting viewing figures and advertising. </p> <p>Executives at ITV insist there is no question of Allen going anywhere until these complex negotiations are completed. The key question is whether he will stay on beyond that. To do so, he must pray for a prolonged advertising recovery. One respected media analyst said: 'It is hard to get too excited about ITV at the moment. Everything's consistent with their original strategy and we've seen one or two fringe divestments, but it's not the key driver of the ITV share price now. They need to see further evidence of [advertising] recovery through late summer, and it's still looking fairly patchy. The Olympics will help, but looking beyond the summer it's not looking quite so punchy.' </p> <p>There is an interesting sub-plot to the ITV saga which owes as much to thwarted ambitions and long-running feuds than it does to commercial considerations. Associates of former BBC director-general Greg Dyke have been waging a subtle but effective propaganda battle designed to undermine Allen in the hope that Dyke might eventually be asked to replace him. </p> <p>In 1993 Dyke, while the chief executive of LWT, lost a bitter battle to keep control of the company after Granada - where Allen was deputy at the time - mounted a hostile takeover bid. And Allen later took Dyke's job. </p> <p>Allen's supporters cannot hide their irritation at Dyke's sales pitch, but argue that his track record at the BBC, where he was as much eulogised as his predecessor John Birt was demonised, may soon be reappraised. They point to last week's decision by BBC chairman Sir Michael Grade - to call in accountants to review the corporation's 'financial controls' - as evidence that Dyke's star may be on the wane. </p> <p>'That is a pretty thinly veiled way of saying the Dyke era was about overspending and it was financially irresponsible,' claims one Allen supporter. </p> <p>But Dyke's friends refute this allegation, and point to the revitalisation of the BBC while he was in command. </p> <p>Like so much else at ITV, only time will which of the camps has got it right.</p>",
  "<p>Philip Mountford is the type of person you would want to hand your chaotic life, or kitchen, over to for intensive therapy. Just for long enough to restore order and realign the chakras, though, and not so long that he would want to start all over again. </p> <p>He talks fast and big as you would expect from a 39-year-old chief executive. He has turned the dowdy menswear loss-maker Moss Bros into a profitable, designer-brand led business. This week he and his young team will effectively relaunch Gee (that's Cecil Gee, to you old folk) with ranges and campaigns masterminded by style magazine FHM 's fashion director. </p> <p>'Everything I do is fast and furious,' Mountford says of his management style. 'I want instant results from everyone who works for me. My [mobile] telephone is always switched on. </p> <p>'I work 13-hour days from Monday to Friday. I arrive in the office at 6am and I go to the gym every day except Mondays when we have a trading meeting and I make myself available to do the sign-offs so the merchandisers can get on with buying. I go for a 10k run at 6pm and by 7.30pm I am back in the office to do another hour. When I am training for marathons I run the 17 miles from Clapham to Orpington where I live. </p> <p>'I try to keep weekends for my family. Everybody should have two lives: their work and their family. I do talk to my finance director on Saturday and Sunday mornings for about an hour but after that I switch off. This is the life of any CEO nowadays.' </p> <p>It makes exhausting reading but it is strangely inspirational. He is serious about the marathons, by the way. 'I ran for Blackheath Harriers, which at the time was one of the best middle-distance athletics club in the UK. I was,' he adds, tongue in cheek (possibly) 'going to be a world-class athlete.' </p> <p>Instead, at 21 he took a job at Daks Simpsons, moving on to rejuvenate the yachting brand Nautica before the job with Versace. For Mountford, the image of what he calls the 'corporate executive' is anathema. 'I want you to know that I ride a Vespa Piaggio into work,' he says. 'None of that stuffy car business.' </p> <p>He loves Italy: the country, the style, the approach to life and, of course, the red wine. A good job too, given his chosen career in high fashion. A few years back putting 'Moss Bros' and 'high fashion' in the same article would have raised legitimate guffaws and it is still a confusing proposition. Mountford acknowledges the problem. </p> <p>'When I left Versace two years ago to take the trading director job at Moss Bros my friends wanted to know why I wanted to go from a designer brand to a suit-hire business. Yes, hire is a part of what we do and we have 25 per cent of the market, but it is just 11.8 per cent of our turnover. We own brands. We are the biggest stockist for Armani, Burberry, Oswald Boateng, Hugo Boss and Duffer [of St George] in the UK.' </p> <p>He was managing director at Versace UK and Scandinavia. 'They had a Bond Street store and a load of contracts that I was employed to terminate. My role was to create a UK business for them as well as one in Scandinavia. It was the best three and a half years of my life. Working for a company of that magnitude and style with the power to grow a business was slightly surreal. I worked massively hard because I basically set things up from scratch. </p> <p>'But I missed mainstream retail. When you sell an icon brand into a store you do not control its destiny. I knew people could do better for the brand and I wanted to come into a business where I could make that happen.' </p> <p>He says what he learnt at Versace has informed the turnaround at Gee. 'My background made it easy to get the Gee bit right. We fixed that issue very, very quickly. Gee had missed a decade of brands and had not taken the portfolio forward. We have worked with Gary Kingsnorth from FHM and will launch a new campaign on Thursday. </p> <p>'We have completely new branding for the Cecil Gee stores and the first concept store will open at Lakeside [shopping centre, Essex] in the autumn. We'll do another three to four stores next year if it works.' </p> <p>Gee now has two customers in mind. The 25 to 45-year-old who is looking for 'tailoring' and the 16 to 30-year-old who wants casual. 'There will be two completely new labels. The branding is new, the store configuration is new, everything is new. I am particularly passionate about this business.' </p> <p>Gee is also branching out into a handful of designer labels for women, including an offshoot of Chloe, which will go into its shopping mall stores. The vast majority of shoppers in centres from Monday to Friday are female and we want to pull them into the shops,' explains Mountford. 'We know what our core business is and we are not going to divert from it. This is just a good bolt-on.' </p> <p>Energy and force of personality are well and good; but they alone will not persuade retail analysts to up their forecasts, as some did after the latest set of trading figures earlier this month. </p> <p>Although Mountford returns several times to the fact that the business was losing \u00a37 million a year when he arrived, reported \u00a31m profit for 2003 and recorded \u00a3500,000 profit for the first half of this year, he acknowledges that he 'took his eye off the ball' with Gee last winter. 'It was a tough time for everybody but we stopped looking for a couple of months. You cannot do that in fashion.' </p> <p>Analysts are now forecasting profits in the region of \u00a34.3m for 2004. On any measure that is quite a turnaround. </p> <p>'There has been a change in philosophy. We buy icon brands with the right selections and we concentrate on availability and getting new product in. We rotate stock faster. Where we used to buy only twice we now buy four or six times a year. It is putting pressure on the suppliers but this is how it has to be. Everybody in retail is having to raise their game. Everybody has to run faster to stand still.' </p> <p>Moss Bros has rebranded 'tired' parts of the portfolio as Moss, which amalgamates Savoy Taylors Guild, City Menswear, Blazer and Moss Bros. 'We have had to resculpt the product mix.' Sales rose by 9 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the first half of the year to 31 July. We have taken market share in the classic menswear market. We know that because overall the market is static but we have grown our share. We are taking from independents but also from chains such as Suits You and even from Marks &amp; Spencer.' </p> <p>Mountford is proud of his small team, which includes people with M&amp;S, Next, House of Fraser and Uniqlo on their CVs. His promotion last February raised eyebrows because it appeared to push out Adrian Wright just as Wright's rebuilding looked set to deliver results. 'I have got enormous regard for Adrian,' says Mountford. He tacitly explains the management change by pointing to Wright's 'property background' in contrast to his own 'retail background'. He started out at Simpsons and was on the board by the age of 28. </p> <p>'The dynamics have changed. One of the first things we did was cut out the level of directors below the board.' He says the culture is 'quick and nimble' with good lines of communication. 'If people want to do something they come to me and ask and I say yes or no. It has allowed us to be more effective.' </p> <p>Mountford has big plans for Moss Bros. He says the business is not big enough at 150 stores and plans to give the market more detail about expansion on 7 October. His biggest concern seems to be that other retailers might poach his team. 'Other people are starting to be interested. We have tied our people in with share options so it will be very good for them to stay.' </p> <p>Mountford himself bought 21,500 shares this month, widely held to be a vote of confidence in his own recovery performance. The question, however, is whether Moss Bros is set for an even bigger change. Shami Ahmed, the founder of Joe Bloggs jeans, was a long-term potential predator until he sold his stake to another retail entrepreneur, Kevin Stanford, last month. Stanford has remained resolutely silent about his 28 per cent holding, the majority of which is in contracts for difference (non-voting shares a little like derivatives). </p> <p>'I am not begging him to talk, contrary to reports,' says Mountford. 'I have shareholders who own 72 per cent to consider and this issue is not going to distract us from the business at all.' It is hard to imagine Mountford standing still for too long, though, even if nobody comes knocking for Moss Bros. 'I am 39 and I have a lot of working years ahead of me,' he says.
