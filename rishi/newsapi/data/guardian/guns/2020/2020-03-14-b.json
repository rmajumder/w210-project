  "<p>The NHS is to join forces with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the coronavirus crisis, as fears grow that publicly funded hospitals will soon be unable to cope with the number of patients suffering from the virus.</p> <p>News of the unprecedented partnership came as 245 scientists and mathematicians denounced the government plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading, saying acting now would save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</p> <p>The number of deaths in the UK rose on Saturday by 10 in just 24 hours, almost doubling the total from 11 to 21. The government\u2019s chief medical adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, said all were patients in \u201cat-risk\u201d groups.</p> <p>The number of confirmed cases in the UK reached 1,140 \u2013 up from 798 on Friday. But in a sign of how fast the virus can spread officials in Italy said its number of cases had jumped 20% to more than 21,000 since Friday. The death toll rose by 175.</p> <p>Around the world countries began to shut themselves off. Denmark and Lithuania said they would close their borders, Morocco cut flights from 25 countries, Norway closed its ports, Spain announced a national lockdown and France shut its cafes and restaurants, as well as most shops and cinemas from midnight on Saturday.</p> <p>After Donald Trump extended a ban on certain foreign nationals entering the US to include Britons, Boris Johnson called the president to explain the British government\u2019s stance, but he faced growing questions over whether he was doing enough to protect the public. The open letter <a href=\"http://maths.qmul.ac.uk/~vnicosia/UK_scientists_statement_on_coronavirus_measures.pdf\" title=\"\">from the academics</a> said the UK was seeing infections grow at the same rate as in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, which meant Britain\u2019s infected would \u201cbe in the order of thousands within a few days\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnder unconstrained growth, this outbreak will affect millions of people in the next few weeks,\u201d the letter states, adding the NHS would be \u201cat serious risk\u201d of not being able to cope.</p> <p>\u201cGoing for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 at this point does not seem a viable option, as this will put the NHS at an even stronger level of stress, risking many more lives than necessary. By putting in place social distancing measures now, the growth can be slowed down dramatically, and thousands of lives can be spared. We consider the social distancing measures taken as of today as insufficient.\u201d</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesman responded: \u201cHerd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic.\u201d He said every measure was \u201cbased on the best scientific evidence\u201d. \u201cOur awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Whitty defended the government\u2019s approach: \u201cI understand this increase in the number of deaths will be a cause for concern. The public should know every measure we are taking is seeking to save lives and protect the most vulnerable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5b40ff3bf44983bc3053b74e262bd6c2d60fa11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5b40ff3bf44983bc3053b74e262bd6c2d60fa11/0_158_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty; Boris Johnson; and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance attend a news conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty; Boris Johnson; and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance attend a news conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said countries were working together to ease the crisis: \u201cWe are dealing with a very fast-moving epidemic with emerging data from many disciplines and many complex decisions. We will publish our models and welcome input from the scientific community.</p> <p>\u201cScientists across the world are helping each other, governments and society to deal with this emergency.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday night the government said it was in talks with manufacturers to increase the supply of ventilators, which will be needed to treat patients with the most severe symptoms of Covid-19. NHS England will this week issue new guidance to hospitals and clinical commissioning groups on working with the private sector to carry out more non-urgent operations on NHS patients to free up beds.</p> <p>\u201cWe need all parts of the health sector to step up and play their part given what\u2019s coming our way,\u201d said one senior NHS official. \u201cThey have the things we\u2019re going to need: space on wards, beds and people.\u201d</p> <p>NHS bosses expect the cost of expanding the independent sector\u2019s role to be met from the government\u2019s \u00a35bn Covid-19 response fund, announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in his first budget last week.</p> <p>Spire Healthcare, which runs 39 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales, has offered to help the NHS. However, a spokesman said \u201cthe exact nature, extent and the timing of this support is yet to be determined\u201d.</p> <p>This week the government will launch a massive public information campaign, with advertisements on television, radio and press featuring Whitty. A key message will be that anyone with a continual cough, however mild, or a temperature, should self-isolate for seven days. </p> <p>Scientists, the World Health Organization (WHO) and opposition politicians have all questioned the government\u2019s decision to limit testing to patients who have been admitted to hospital. There were also growing calls for clarity on whether schools will have to close and for how long.</p> <p>In a warning of how dramatic and lasting the impact of school shutdowns could be, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, told parents to prepare for schools to shut for \u201cat least 16 weeks\u201d.</p> <p>A petition calling for schools and colleges in the UK to be shut had gathered more than half a million signatures ,on Saturday, while the National Education Union \u2013 the biggest teaching union \u2013 wrote to the prime minister asking for details on why schools in the UK were being kept open while they had been shut elsewhere.</p> <p>The WHO raised concerns over the government\u2019s strategy to develop \u201cherd immunity\u201d \u2013 where a large proportion of the population catch, recover and therefore develop immunity from the virus. Margaret Harris, of WHO, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about the science of this virus, it hasn\u2019t been in our population for long enough to know what it does in immunological terms. Every virus functions differently in your body and stimulates a different immunological profile.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, told the <em>Observer </em> on Saturdaythat public confidence in the government was fragile. \u201cDelaying the spread of this virus has to be a priority so as not to overwhelm our overstretched NHS. But people are increasingly questioning if the UK is following international best practice.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are we no longer testing those with symptoms who are advised to stay at home when the WHO recommends continued testing, for example?\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the prime minister urging him to allow mortgage payment holidays and rent deferrals, and demanded sight of emergency legislation that would give the government powers to detain virus victims, keep schools open and allow people to keep their jobs while volunteering for the NHS.</p> <p>But other health experts backed the government. \u201cThe UK approach is driven by evidence that is appropriate for the local context,\u201d said Michael Head, senior research fellow at Southampton University. \u201cWhat other countries are doing with their populations, with subtle or markedly different cultural and social expectations and habits, does not mean the UK is doing the wrong thing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When did it become real for you? Perhaps it was when the first grisly footage started emerging from Wuhan, of deserted and dystopian streets, of a human catastrophe beyond understanding. Perhaps it was when an entire airline went bust, when plans and schemes were thrown into disarray. Perhaps it was when the Italian government decided in effect to put an entire nation of 60 million people under house arrest or when every school in Ireland shut down.</p> <p>Or perhaps it was when they called off Fulham v Brentford on Friday night. If so, there\u2019s no need to feel ashamed or abashed about it: for so many of us, sport isn\u2019t simply a way of passing the time but a way of marking it. It offers a liturgy, a structure on which to measure the passing days and seasons. Tuesday and Wednesday: Champions League. Thursday: Premier League darts. Friday night: Super League rugby. And then the entire weekend, from the Saturday lunchtime kick-off to the PGA golf on Sunday night: hours and hours of it, all stretched out before us like a delicious picnic. In frightening times, virus or no virus, these are the rituals that offer the veneer of normality, a background noise as reassuring and immutable as the ticking of the clock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/west-ham-karren-brady-calls-for-premier-league-cancellation-coronavirus\">Karren Brady calls for Premier League to be made \u2018null and void\u2019 over coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so, as the enormous industrial complex of global sport clanks to a terrifying halt, it is only natural to feel shocked, concussed, perhaps even a touch bereft. Things move pretty fast in the corona-verse: in the space of a fortnight we\u2019ve gone from ironic elbow-bumps in the pub to the postponement of virtually the entire sporting schedule, Euro 2020 potentially becoming Euro 2021, Mikel Arteta in quarantine. Every day, every hour seems to bring more jolts to a system that on some level we all took for granted.</p> <p>All four English professional football divisions, the top two FA women\u2019s divisions, the big five European leagues, the Champions League and Europa League: off for now. England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka, the Masters, the Giro d\u2019Italia, the London Marathon: all postponed. Tennis and Formula One simply not happening. This is, in short, the most seismic disruption to the sporting calendar since the second world war, with the possibility that an obliterated spring is simply the prelude to an annihilated summer and a torched autumn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The absence of sport offers a microcosm of the atomisation we can expect in the housebound weeks ahead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first point to make is that on plenty of levels none of this matters. Liverpool being denied the Premier League title on a technicality; the Six Nations being voided; the Olympics being called off \u2013 all of this pales against the human toll: the fear, the loneliness, the deprivation, the thousands and perhaps even millions being wheeled into hospitals for the last time. In a way this has been the first and most important sporting consequence of the pandemic: that for all the time and money and hope and anger we invest in this business of balls and implements, all of it is ultimately expendable.</p> <p>The second point to make is that clearly, to some people, it does matter a bit. One only had to read the responses of fantasy football managers to the news from the official Premier League account that Manchester City v Arsenal had been postponed on public safety grounds. \u201cAbsolute farce of a decision on your part,\u201d fumed one. \u201cComplete bullshit, just another example of how this game is complete luck,\u201d observed another. \u201cYour game\u2019s rigged, fuck off,\u201d said a user called Fents, which raised the salient issue of just how \u2013 and never mind the why for a moment \u2013 Fents reckons the Premier League confected a deadly virus outbreak that would sweep the UK just in time to deny him his rightful Aubameyang triple-captain points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f475adc0907b022a5fa8b2f4b118bf1b8de7078\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f475adc0907b022a5fa8b2f4b118bf1b8de7078/0_81_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Principality Stadium stayed shut on Saturday, with Wales\u2019 Six Nations clash with Scotland postponed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Principality Stadium stayed shut on Saturday, with Wales\u2019 Six Nations clash with Scotland postponed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malcolm Mackenzie/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It can be seen, too, in the toxic, self-interested shrillness with which some fans have greeted the havoc of a truncated season. Would Leeds or Coventry still be promoted? Would it be fair for Aston Villa to be relegated in 19th place with a game in hand? Would you be prepared to risk the deaths of strangers in order to guarantee that your club would win the league? I don\u2019t know how many fans would answer yes to that last question, but the last few days on social media have demonstrated that it is certainly higher than zero.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, this is the flip side to all the feelgood stories we tell ourselves in this job: if we are genuine about the power of sport to inspire, to edify, to spread happiness and bring people together, then we need to be honest about the consequences of its absence. This is about more than simply having nothing to watch on TV on a Saturday; although, if this is the sort of thing that gives your life meaning and shape, then who are we to judge? Rather, the absence of sport offers a microcosm of the wider atomisation that we can expect over these housebound weeks and months: a slow and gradual retreat from the shared spaces and shared consciousness that live events provide, away from the public and into the private.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/nigel-pearson-watford-liverpool-premier-league-coronavirus-interview-donald-mcrae\">Nigel Pearson: \u2018It's the right decision to stop playing, even if it was made under duress'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The broadcasters will still have airtime to fill, of course. Your favourite Sunday newspaper will still have column inches to populate. And in the meantime the hot coals of the internet will continue to rage as if nothing had happened. Sport\u2019s dark web \u2013 all that coiled tension and angst, all those interminable arguments about Goats and frauds and \u201ccredit\u201d, all those WhatsApp threads set up purely to bitch about people on other WhatsApp threads \u2013 this shall endure, even in the absence of any actual sport over which to fulminate.</p> <p>Perhaps, during these long weeks ahead, we could all use a little patience. Perhaps even a little humility, especially in the face of unfolding human tragedy. Perhaps we will succumb to the charms of a new obsession: live games of Fifa on YouTube, Bolivian nose wrestling on Eurosport 2, or perhaps one of the few sports \u2013 speedway, horse racing, non-league football \u2013 that at the time of writing has decided to plough on regardless.</p> <p>And then one day it will all be over. Athletes will emerge from their hibernation and return to training. Fixtures will be rescheduled. Stadiums will open for business. Little by little the galaxy of sport will blink back into life and it will feel like a benediction and an irrelevance all at once: a reminder that of all the things that don\u2019t matter sport matters most of all.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>US extends European travel ban to UK and Ireland</strong></h2> <p>Vice-president Mike Pence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-unemployment-testing\">confirmed</a> that travel from the UK and Ireland will be suspended from midnight Monday (eastern standard time) in order to contain the outbreak.

The government is seen, overall, as having handled the crisis well. The findings come as the coronavirus death toll in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-death-toll-in-uk-doubles-in-just-24-hours\">UK doubled in 24 hours to 21</a> \u2013 and the total number of people to test positive for the virus rose to 1,140.</p> <h2><strong>All flights to and from Yemen suspended for two weeks</strong></h2> <p>Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government and Houthi rebels have both said they will be suspending flights to and from airports under their respective control. Prime minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed said all flights to and from government controlled airports would be suspended for a fortnight from 18 March. The suspension exempts flights for humanitarian purposes. Houthi rebels in control of northern Yemen have said all passenger flights to and from the capital Sana\u2019a will be suspended for two weeks. Five years of war have already decimated the nation\u2019s healthcare infrastructure.</p> <h2><strong>Syria has shut schools and cancelled events, but still insists it has no cases</strong></h2> <p>The conflict-affected nation has also reduced public sector hours to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Health Ministry said the steps were \u201cpreventative\u201d and \u201cprecautionary\u201d and intended to raise the health sector\u2019s readiness to control the virus should it emerge, and says there have been no cases in the country.</p> <h2>France to close most shops, cafes, restaurants and cinemas</h2> <p>France will shut down cafes, shops, restaurants and cinemas to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, prime minister \u00c9duoard Philippe has announced. Philippe said public transport will be kept open but asked citizens to limit their use, Reuters<strong> </strong>news agency reported. The closures will come into effect at midnight on Saturday.

  "<p>The UK faces having to wait longer and pay more to acquire a coronavirus vaccine because it has left the EU, health experts and international legal experts warn today.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/why-brexit-will-delay-uk-getting-vaccine-and-cost-more\" title=\"\">article published today</a> on the Guardian website, the academics and lawyers say Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to \u201cgo it alone\u201d, free of EU regulation, after Brexit means the UK will probably have to join other non-EU countries in a queue to acquire the vaccine after EU member states have had it, and on less-favourable terms.</p> <p>The authors include Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and legal academics Anniek de Ruijter of Amsterdam Law School and Mark Flear of Queens University, Belfast.</p> <p>The UK will leave the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the body responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines, at the end of the transition period on 30 December. This means it will no longer be part of the EU\u2019s regulatory regime, which allows for \u201caccelerated assessment\u201d of products developed by drugs companies during a pandemic.</p> <p>The UK has already withdrawn from the EU\u2019s emergency bulk-buying mechanism for vaccines and medicines, under which member states strike collective agreements with pharmaceutical companies, which speeds up their access to the latest products during a crisis.</p> <p>The academics write: \u201cFor all these reasons ... the UK is likely to have to join the queue for access with other countries outside the EU, and to pay more than it would otherwise as an EU member state.</p> <p>\u201cLooking further ahead, this problem will not be limited to emergencies and the UK can expect slower and more limited access to medicines, especially those for rare conditions or those used to treat children, where the market is small.\u201d</p> <p>They argue that the UK could still avoid the worst by agreeing to align fully with the EMA\u2019s regulations from outside the EU. But they say Johnson has so far indicated that his team have no intention of doing so and do not want to operate as \u201crule takers\u201d.</p> <p>While it appears the UK government wants to press ahead with its own regulatory system and rapid market authorisation system for emergencies, the experts say this will be all but impossible to put in place in time for a new Covid-19 vaccine, which is expected in about a year.</p> <p>Even then the view in medical circles is that pharmaceutical companies are likely to look first to the EU for regulatory approval and an agreement on sale, given the scale of the market they would be selling into.</p> <p>Olivier Wouters of the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: \u201cAfter the Brexit transition period, the UK will no longer be part of the EMA and will therefore have to make its own regulatory decisions, unless ongoing EU-UK trade negotiations result in the UK aligning itself with European rules.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK could, in theory, choose to recognise any approval decision made by the EMA to prevent delays, but this seems at odds with the UK government\u2019s pledge to \u2018take back control\u2019. If the UK authorities instead choose to set up a separate review and approval process for medicines and vaccines, then it might delay access to a new coronavirus therapy.</p> <p>\u201cThe country could experience disruptions as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the country\u2019s counterpart to the EMA, works to fill the gap left by the departure of the EMA.</p> <p>\u201cVaccine makers and drug companies may decide to first seek approval from the EMA, which represents some 500 million patients, before seeking approval from the UK MHRA, which covers a smaller patient pool.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the prospect of the UK having to pay higher prices for a vaccine, he said: \u201cIf a coronavirus vaccine is developed, EU countries may choose to band together to jointly procure the vaccine. This would give EU countries more bargaining power against a vaccine maker to try to secure a lower price. If the UK were excluded from such a joint procurement scheme, it\u2019s possible that the UK would end up paying a higher price than the EU for the same vaccine.\u201d</p> <p>EMA was based in London until January last year, when Brexit saw it relocate to Amsterdam.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK and our friends and partners across Europe are part of a concerted international effort to combat the threat of COVID-19. We are confident that our current close working relationships will continue as we ready ourselves for all eventualities. We\u2019re fully supporting the UK\u2019s world-leading, disease research sector to play a key role in the global effort, with \u00a340 million of new funding for rapid research into the virus.\u201d</p>",

While not all of these are a result of domestic abuse situations, most are, and it\u2019s shocking. Why isn\u2019t the child homicide stat commonly known? Because even in these enlightened times, we still can\u2019t see children as individuals. In the public mind, children are subsidiaries of their parents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/08/patriarchy-and-power-how-gender-inequality-underpins-abusive-behaviour\">Patriarchy and power: how socialisation underpins abusive behaviour | Jess Hill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the voluminous research on children\u2019s development, we still can\u2019t seem to conceive that kids experiencing domestic abuse have unique wants and needs that not only differ from their parents but from their siblings, too. One child may be acutely aware of the abuse, and may take on the role of family protector. Their sibling may refuse to acknowledge it at all, even when physical violence occurs right in front of them. Another sibling may identify strongly with the abusive parent and start imitating their behaviours. This is a particularly tragic scenario that we see play out so often: the victim parent leaves the abusive parent, only to have their child replace the perpetrator as the violent oppressor in the family. Truly one of the saddest places I\u2019ve ever visited was a room in the children\u2019s court at Parramatta where parents were applying for intervention orders against their own children.</p> <h2><strong>What about kids that grow up with coercive control?</strong></h2> <p>The critical thing for people (and particularly our justice system) to understand is that children don\u2019t just witness incidents of domestic abuse. Their development is shaped by the abusive dynamic. That\u2019s why exposure to domestic abuse is increasingly being recognised as child abuse. Critically, there doesn\u2019t need to be any physical violence present for kids to be deeply affected. We now understand, thanks to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/car.2422\">recent research</a> from Dr Emma Katz in the UK, that children are harmed by coercive control in similar ways to their victim parent: they may be isolated from extended family, forced to obey trivial demands, degraded and threatened.</p> <p>Just as it is for their victim parent, it can be the little things that are the most frightening: one teenage girl told me that one of the worst things her father did was make this particular creepy smile. These are the kinds of things that haunt children, the signals that remind them that danger is ever-present and the threat is something they must continually manage. Their perspective, like that of their victim parent, is being virtually colonised by the perpetrator parent. They have to develop ways to resist that, to hold on to their own sense of self, and to develop independence and competence. Coercive control is as much a trap for children as it is for their victim parent.</p> <h2><strong>What are some of the long-term psychological impacts for children?</strong></h2> <p>The answer to this question, like all of these, could fill a book! But to tackle just one aspect of this, let\u2019s talk about complex trauma. Children who grow up with prolonged abuse may develop what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.blueknot.org.au/Resources/Information/Understanding-abuse-and-trauma/What-is-complex-trauma\">complex trauma</a>\u201d, or C-PTSD. As Dr Bessel can der Kolk describes it, kids with complex trauma \u201cdevelop a view of the world that incorporates their betrayal and hurt. They anticipate and expect the trauma to recur and respond with hyperactivity, aggression, defeat or freeze responses to minor stresses.\u201d This conditioning can start in infancy. Babies are not oblivious to abuse; they are acutely aware of their surroundings \u2013 particularly the emotional state of their primary caregiver.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think people fully understand how dangerous the family law system can be for children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Children (and later, adults) with complex trauma can harbour deep distrust for others, or may find that their \u201ctrust\u201d is commonly betrayed, which can lead to major problems with intimacy and friendship. Other common symptoms of complex trauma include suicidal thoughts, feelings of detachment from one\u2019s own body and mind, shame and guilt, the feeling of being like an alien, helplessness and hopelessness, self-harm and substance abuse. The thing is, their view of the world is not disordered \u2013 it is a product of the incredible strategies they developed (like dissociation, for example) to physically and psychologically survive their childhood. These strategies may have worked for them in the abusive environment, but they are maladaptive to life outside of that environment. The problem is, many in the psychiatric world don\u2019t acknowledge complex trauma, and thus misdiagnose children and adults with bipolar disorder, ADD, borderline personality disorder or oppositional defiant disorder.</p> <h2>Why is family law reform such a priority when it comes to protecting children?</h2> <p>I don\u2019t think people fully understand how dangerous the family law system can be for children.</p> <p>In previous centuries, judges could order an abused woman to return to her husband. The idea that a court would make such an order seems unthinkable now \u2013 but that is exactly what the family law system still does to children. Even when kids openly disclose abuse \u2013 and have their testimony corroborated by police, social workers, teachers and doctors \u2013 a family law judge may still order them to see or live part-time with their abusive parent. Worse still, they may even be ordered into the full-time custody of a parent they have openly pleaded to be protected from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6966615924ad0759eef93543d8203fa22e2ce374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6966615924ad0759eef93543d8203fa22e2ce374/0_0_4788_3293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of Hannah Clarke and her three children on display at their funeral in Brisbane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photos of Hannah Clarke and her three children on display at their funeral in Brisbane on 9 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once a family law order is made, it is virtually impossible for children to resist. If they run away, their custodial parent can apply for a recovery order, and the court can then order federal police to track them down and return them to their custodial parent. One teenager I interviewed, \u201cCarly\u201d, was pursued by federal police when she ran away from her father, who was controlling and intimidating towards her and had been violent to her mother and brother. She had to threaten suicide before the police would relent, on the proviso she was taken to hospital. After she was released she stayed for four months in a refuge, where despite asking for schoolwork, she received no schooling. Eventually, she was allowed to return to her mother \u2013 but only because the court decided she was old enough to make her own decision.</p> <p>Another teenager, \u201cAlex\u201d, also became suicidal after years of routine physical abuse from his father, whose sole custody he was ordered into when he was a toddler, after the mother\u2019s allegations against the father were disbelieved by the court. Alex ran away to his mother, with whom he was allowed only limited contact. When the family court requested he see another family report writer (to assess his claims and his mental state for the court), that writer concluded he didn\u2019t really want to die and that his threats were \u201cstress related\u201d. They recommended he be returned to his father, that contact be cut off with the mother, and that if he ran away again to his mother, she should be incarcerated. After he was ordered by the court to return to his father, Alex had to run away to police three times before he was taken seriously. Alex fought hard to be returned to his mother when he was 14. Now as a young adult he\u2019s been diagnosed with PTSD; he can\u2019t work, he can\u2019t study. He\u2019s now on the disability support pension.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They plead with their protective parent not to hand them over. They hide under the bed at handover time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The threat to children is not just anecdotal. The Australian Law Reform Commission review found that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/safety-must-come-first-in-family-law-legal-groups-reject-merger-plan-20191110-p5395q.html\">one in five parents reported safety concerns</a> for their children and/or themselves as a result of court-ordered contact with the other parent.</p> <p>When family law orders are made, children are ordered to comply \u2013 even when they are openly terrified. So they kick and scream at handovers. They plead with their protective parent not to hand them over. They hide under the bed at handover time. They call police. They self-harm. They may even be prevented by the court from accessing medical care and counselling. This is how weird \u2013 and destructive \u2013 parts of the family law system has become.</p> <p>Protective parents spend several years \u2013 and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2013 trying to protect them. Sometimes it\u2019s to no avail \u2013 they watch helplessly as their children develop medical conditions and regress into traumatised states, with no power to intervene. When an abused parent leaves, they do so to protect themselves and their children. But in the end, because the family law system is so dangerously inconsistent, they can\u2019t guarantee that they will be able to protect their children. That\u2019s why so many abused parents stay long past the time they would like to have left.</p> <h2><strong>Why are children being ordered into the care of abusive parents?</strong></h2> <p>So much of this comes back to the pro-contact ideology of the court. The Family Law Act states that when the court is considering how to allocate parenting, they must apply the presumption that the best interests of the child are served by both parents having equal-shared parental responsibility. That might be the case for regular families, but in the family law system, the vast majority of families are <em>not </em>regular. Up to 85% of families going through the family law system report histories of family violence, including emotional abuse, and half report physical violence. Despite this, only 3% of cases result in no contact with one parent, and around 79% end up with orders to share parental responsibility. But how can you share parental responsibility with an abusive parent?</p> <p>This presumption of equal-shared parental responsibility is, in theory, not supposed to apply where the child\u2019s safety is at risk. But in reality, we see allegations (and even proven histories) of domestic/child abuse being minimised, dismissed and disbelieved. They are seen as inconvenient, a barrier to making orders for shared parenting.</p> <p>I have to add here that within the family law system, there <em>are </em>judges that prioritise child safety, and family report writers who provided nuanced assessments of families. If you\u2019re leaving domestic abuse and entering the family law court, you may be lucky enough to get a judge and a report writer who believe you, and act to protect your children. But for too many families, that is not the case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62aa827e4ac14fd23bc104127346a32dba9271ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62aa827e4ac14fd23bc104127346a32dba9271ba/0_34_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian author Jess Hill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jess Hill, the author of See What You Made Me Do.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yaya Stempler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The standard operating procedure in so many of these cases can beggar belief. It is truly bizarre, for example, to see judges reject evidence from counsellors and doctors that corroborates the disclosure of a child or the testimony of their parents. Parents who apply for a no-contact order \u2013 even when they can prove a history of domestic abuse \u2013 are routinely warned by their own lawyers that unless they allow some contact, they may lose custody altogether. As Zita Adut Deng Ngor, CEO of Women\u2019s Legal Services South Australia, says: \u201cIt is always a delicate balancing act in terms of how far you push the issue of domestic and family violence. It can actually harm your client, if you push too hard with the wrong judicial officer.\u201d<em> </em>What does that say about how the system responds to the parenting risks associated with domestic abuse?</p> <h2><strong>What would be the most effective result of the family law inquiry to ensure the safety of children?</strong></h2> <p>Honestly, I don\u2019t know what it would take to reform the family law system. Policy changes alone won\u2019t fix it \u2013 this is a cultural problem that is throughout the family law system. Even if the government follows the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendation to revoke the presumption of shared parental responsibility, that in itself won\u2019t change the minds of experts and judges who routinely minimise the impact of domestic abuse and disbelieve victims and their children. The Gillard government made significant changes to the Family Law Act in an attempt to reprioritise children\u2019s safety, but we keep seeing the same old stories repeating. Child makes disclosure, child is disbelieved, protective parent fights to limit the abusive parent\u2019s access, and they either end up losing custody altogether or being coerced to agree to shared parenting arrangements that are unsafe for them and their children.</p> <p>Ultimately, it may be that the recommendation from the law reform commission \u2013 to abolish the federal family law courts and replace it with specialist state-based family courts, which would be better connected with state-based child protection agencies \u2013 is the only way to truly change the culture of family law in this country.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit <a href=\"https://www.1800respect.org.au/\">1800RESPECT.org.au</a>.

  "<h2>What is a pandemic?</h2> \n<p>Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of a disease, but is instead associated with concerns over its geographic spread. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations.</p> \n<h2>How does the WHO decide whether to call it a pandemic?</h2> \n<p>Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in a foreign country and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the \u201cindex case\u201d, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community.</p> \n<p>Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that.</p> \n<p>An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community.</p> \n<h2>When is a pandemic declared?</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met. For example, the Sars coronavirus, identified in 2003, was not declared a pandemic by the WHO despite affecting 26 countries. However, its spread was contained quickly, and only a handful of nations were significantly affected, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada.</p> \n<p>If declaring a pandemic triggers global panic, this can defeat the purpose of trying to raise awareness. Much <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-1754.2010.01912.x\">has been written</a> about whether <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/article/MED/21734768\">the declaration of H1N1</a>, colloquially known as \u201cswine flu\u201d, as a pandemic in 2009, caused unnecessary panic, overwhelming emergency departments and causing governments to overspend on antiviral medications. Coronavirus symptoms are generally mild and most people recover within six days.</p> \n<h2>Now the WHO has declared Covid-19 a pandemic, what will it mean for the way the outbreak is treated and prepared for?</h2> \n<p>The WHO has stressed that using the word \u201cpandemic\u201d does not signal a change in its advice. It is still urging countries to \u201cdetect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise their people\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dr Nathalie MacDermott, National Institute for Health Research academic clinical lecturer King\u2019s College London, says: \u201cThe change of term does not alter anything practically as the world has been advised for the last few weeks to prepare for a potential pandemic, which has hopefully been taken seriously by all countries.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe use of this term however highlights the importance of countries throughout the world working cooperatively and openly with one another and coming together as a united front in our efforts to bring this situation under control.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s dramatic announcement this week that the US would restrict most travel from Europe caused chaos and confusion at airports, shocked the stock market and took lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic by surprise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">Why has coronavirus testing in the US been such a disaster?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What it didn\u2019t do, according to experts, was help abate the spread of coronavirus in the US.</p> <p>Although epidemiologists are still learning which strategies work best to contain the spread of coronavirus, preliminary research on Covid-19, as well as studies on the spread of other infectious diseases, suggest that travel restrictions, if implemented early, can slightly slow outbreaks.</p> <p>However, public health experts say that once a disease has begun circulating within a community, banning outsiders is mostly futile.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, travel bans sound good,\u201d said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cBut we\u2019re way past the point where simply restricting travel is a reasonable response.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, the US restrictions \u2013 which initially applied to EU nations and which have now been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-unemployment-testing\">extended to the UK and Ireland</a> \u2013 ban most foreign nationals from entering the US but do not bar American citizens, permanent residents or many of their family members.</p> <p>That \u2013 is a \u201cprofoundly strange\u201d policy in the face of a global pandemic, Hanage said.</p> <p>\u201cAn Italian who\u2019s living in Italy, and a French person who\u2019s living in Italy \u2013 and an American \u2013 could all be just as likely to carry the virus,\u201d noted Danielle Ompad, an epidemiologist at New York University. \u201cThe ban that Trump announced, it\u2019s focused a little more on nationality and not exposure.\u201d</p> <p>Strict travel restrictions could theoretically delay the spread of disease, if not reduce the number of people who become infected, allowing hospitals and other healthcare facilities to better tend to patients, Ompad said. But evidence suggests that the restrictions only work if used strategically, in conjunction with other containment measures.</p> <p>But \u201cour response to this pandemic has been late, and our response has been inconsistent,\u201d Ompad said. Notably, the US isn\u2019t able to test most people who enter the country, let alone those living within its borders due to ongoing shortages of test kits. Although the administration announced plans to screen many passengers arriving at American airports, some infected patients show no signs of illness, so checking symptoms won\u2019t stop citizens or visitors from passing on the infection.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure a travel ban is the best use of resources right now,\u201d Ompad said. \u201cRegardless of travel restrictions, the number of cases is going to increase, probably dramatically, in the next week or two.\u201d</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">reported</a> more than 1,500 cases in the US as of Friday evening. But Congress\u2019 in-house physician reportedly told staffers to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/congressional-physician-predicts-75-150-million-us-coronavirus-cases-fec69e77-1515-4fbc-8340-c53b65c22c53.html\">eventually expect</a> 70m to 150m.</p> <p>Both Italy and China have adopted stringent travel restrictions, but to little avail, multiple epidemiologists pointed out. Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China, but it remains amongst the worst affected.</p> <p>In China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/05/science.aba9757/tab-figures-data\">published</a> in Science.</p> <p>Researchers used computer simulations to capture the impact of restricting movement, found that the ban delayed the progression of the outbreak in China by only three to five days. The coronavirus had already made its way to other major Chinese cities by the time the restrictions were put in place.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the travel ban there certainly didn\u2019t stop the spread of disease from China to all over the planet,\u201d said Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, Gainesville and a co-author of the study.</p> <p>Longini\u2019s team is the process of calculating the effect of the US\u2019s travel restrictions. \u201cBut we think we already know what the results will be,\u201d he said.</p> <p>From a historical perspective, there\u2019s little evidence that travel restrictions have been effective in stemming previous epidemics.</p> <p>\u201cIn ancient Rome when they would have epidemics just burning through the city, they would often lock the gates to not allow anybody else to come in,\u201d said John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cBut the problem was it was already inside and spreading in the city.\u201d</p> <p>Gates and walls didn\u2019t spare the Romans from a plague, and locked borders don\u2019t seem to have helped much since. Closed borders during the Spanish flu <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181023-the-places-that-escaped-the-spanish-flu\">outbreak</a> in 1918 and 1919, did protect some areas, but also blocked supplies from reaching others.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.wmpllc.org/ojs/index.php/jem/article/view/2688\">study</a> published last month in the Journal of Emergency Management<em>, </em>researchers attempted to review the effectiveness of travel bans in decreasing the spread of Ebola, Sars, Mers and the Zika virus \u2013 and found that they were only effective in the short term.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, modes and routes of transmission are different for different diseases,\u201d said Nicole Errett, an expert on public health emergency preparedness at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health who led the study. \u201cBut there\u2019s just not a lot of evidence that travel bans will eliminate risk of disease.\u201d</p> <p>If at best a travel ban may be futile, at worst - it could be harmful. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea the problem is out there, not here,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea that somehow, we might dodge this.\u201d</p> <p>Travel bans can and have cause huge disruptions to people\u2019s personal and family lives, and they also fuel racism. There are economic consequences, too, affecting not only those who work for airlines and airports but also those who depend on travel for their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cTravel bans are generally more unhelpful than helpful, and there are so many more important things that could be being done,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cAnd yet, instead we\u2019re talking about this. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p> <p><em>Susie Cagle contributed reporting</em></p>",
  "<p>For more than three-quarters of a century, the story of Lidice has stood as haunting testimony of Czech suffering and victimhood at the hands of cruel Nazi occupiers.</p> <p>The village, 16 miles from Prague, was razed to the ground, its adult male population murdered and its women and children transported to concentration camps \u2013 where the majority died \u2013 after Adolf Hitler singled it out in retribution for the assassination in 1942 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/heroes-memorials-demanded-for-czech-assassins-of-holocaust-chief-reinhard-heydrich\" title=\"\">Reinhard Heydrich</a>, deputy leader of the SS, by British-trained Czech and Slovak resistance fighters.</p> <p>Now a political row has erupted over the atrocity after information emerged that a Jewish woman who had been secretly living there during the war was arrested \u2013 allegedly after being denounced by a neighbour \u2013 shortly before it was targeted for reprisal.

She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe\u2019re buddying up people so those who already know elderly people or people who are at more higher risk, if they already know them then we\u2019re pairing them up.

Other people have offered to drive if they need to.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Brighton the community spirit is also thriving as locals rally round to help the vulnerable. A Covid-19 mutual aid group on Facebook is connecting people who need help with food shopping, picking up prescriptions or even dog-walking. Within 24 hours of it being set up on Friday, the group swelled to more than 600 members who have already set about distributing flyers offering help.</p> <p>Sussex University lecturer Dr Andrea Brock, 33, who came up with the idea with her friend, said: \u201cIt can be incredibly isolating to be in your house for weeks. We are used to this idea that asking for help is a bad thing and that is not something we are encouraged to do.</p> <p>\u201cSo we are setting up this group so people can ask for help and they can ask for support.

A local GP has agreed to pass on the group\u2019s contact details to vulnerable people who have to self-isolate. \u201cThe aim is to ensure that the surgery doesn\u2019t get blocked up with people who don\u2019t know how they are going to get their medicine or have run out of food or just need to talk to someone to get some reassurance,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe idea is that we shoulder that as a community.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The aim is to ensure that the surgery doesn\u2019t get blocked up with people</p> <footer> <cite>Madeleine Moon</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many care homes across the UK are meanwhile going far beyond the official advice that healthy older people do not need to self-isolate yet.

  "<p>Early on Saturday morning the news broke that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/newborn-baby-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-london\" title=\"\">newborn baby had tested positive for coronavirus</a> in a London hospital. The child is thought to be the youngest affected by the disease in the UK.</p> <p>The child\u2019s mother had been admitted to hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia. Tests \u2013 at North Middlesex hospital, in Edmonton \u2013 revealed she had the coronavirus. Then, minutes after she gave birth, her baby was given a test which was also positive for Covid-19. It is not known whether the child contracted the disease in the womb or was infected during birth.</p> <p>The case is striking because generally Covid-19 has had very little impact on children or young adults. The <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51\" title=\"\">Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said its analysis, released on 11 February, </a>of just under 45,000 cases revealed that less than 1% were under nine years old, while those aged between 10 and 19 accounted for just over 1%. By contrast, those aged between 50 and 59 made up almost 25% of the cases while those between 60 and 69 made up 19%.</p> <p>\u201cThe information suggests that children are less likely to be infected than adults and that is a bit of a puzzle,\u201d says Professor Jimmy Whitworth, of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p> <p>One suggestion put forward by researchers is that children have upper-respiratory tract illnesses most of the time. \u201cIt may be that they are simply not reporting themselves as feeling ill,\u201d adds Whitworth. \u201cSo they are not getting tested. It could be just a sampling issue.\u201d</p> <p>Alternatively, it is possible that other human coronaviruses \u2013 which are known to cause minor colds \u2013 may be circulating in schools and playgrounds and these could providing a degree of cross protection against Covid-19. \u201cOr it could be something to do with social mixing,\u201d says Whitworth. \u201cWe know children interact mostly with other children and adults mostly interact with adults. It is not as though the whole of society mixes randomly. So those differential mixing patterns might explain part of it.\u201d</p> <p>The low numbers of Covid-19 infections among children is not the only mystery. It has been known to science for only a few months and many of its features continue to puzzle experts. One of these concerns hypertension \u2013 high blood pressure. Studies of Chinese cases suggest that adults with high blood pressure are more at risk of dying from coronavirus than others.</p> <p>Again scientists find it difficult to find simple explanations. \u201cIt may be such individuals have other conditions that have not been recognised,\u201d says Tom Wingfield, a clinician at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cWe know that people with hypertension are more likely to be diabetic and have impaired kidneys, for example. That could be a factor but the honest answer is that we just do not know at present.\u201d</p> <p>Other puzzles about the impact of Covid-19 have simpler explanations, however. For example, there is its tendency to kill men more often than women. The infection is fatal for 4.7% of men, but just 2.8 % of women, even though the gender balance for those testing positive is roughly 50:50.</p> <p>Most experts say this is explained by the fact that in China smoking is primarily a male prerogative and this has weakened men\u2019s respiratory systems and made them more vulnerable to Covid-19.</p>",

But as I make my way uptown, coronavirus\u2019s impact on small businesses becomes clear.</p> <p>At Thai Street Food, a food truck outside Trinity Church, co-owner Sony Ramirez, 35, from Queens, says business has dropped by 50% because many offices have closed. The truck\u2019s one waiting customer chimes in: \u201cNormally I see a line here. Today I\u2019m the only one.\u201d</p> <p>Ramirez adds: \u201cI\u2019m worried because I have to work. I need to take care of many people.\u201d</p> <p>Further up, there\u2019s a line of food trucks. It\u2019s 12.30pm but none have more than one customer. Sayed Sadat, 52, who works at a bagel and lunch truck, is packing away after a deathly quiet morning. A huge bin of uneaten bagels stands next to the truck.</p> <p>\u201cI came at 4.30am and nobody [came] until 6am. Business is no good. No business at all.\u201d</p> <p>Disaster also looms for the souvenir sellers. On a corner near Fulton Street, where shoals of tourists usually pass on the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, Tiger Diop, wearing a feathered \u201chappy new year\u201d headband, sits, his merchandise unbought.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make a living,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s suffering now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69/0_58_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By city hall, a small group of climate protesters stand with a big \u201cFridays for Future\u201d flag. The street is so quiet that birdsong is audible from the gardens.</p> <p>As I reach the Tribeca neighbourhood, the sun comes out. It seems to bring more pedestrians. But John, 55, a souvenir seller dressed in a white surgical mask and a New York police department cap, says the street is considerably quieter than usual. He has started selling latex gloves and alcohol disinfectant but he says it\u2019s hand sanitizer people want \u2013 a commodity impossible to track down. A nearby convenience store has a sign in the window: \u201cMasks sold here.\u201d</p> <p>In Soho, Steff Bradley, 23, a graphic designer, and student Wilson Chiu, 25, are on their way to the bank. Bradley is wearing a mask. She says she felt short of breath this morning and is so anxious about coronavirus that she \u201chad a panic attack over a runny nose\u201d. As we speak, she reprimands Chiu, who says he is not concerned about the virus, for touching his face.</p> <p>I veer off Broadway for Chinatown, where Kong Wah Bakery\u2019s manager, Sam Chung, says business is down by 50% and staff are working half-days.</p> <p>Near New York University, which recently moved all classes online, I speak to a group of computer science students who agree the area has \u201cdefinitely got a different vibe\u201d.</p> <p>In Washington Square it becomes clear that just about everybody is talking about one thing: coronavirus. Disrupted travel arrangements, whether or not to go to a party, cleaning techniques, how much food they\u2019ve got stocked up.</p> <p>In Union Square, everything seems reassuringly normal \u2013 people are playing chess at tables, there\u2019s music, the farmers\u2019 market is on. But things take an apocalyptic turn when I spot a man in a full respirator mask and eye shield inspecting potatoes at a vegetable stand. The man, who doesn\u2019t want to be named, says he is in his 70s and on medication and fears for his health.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not normal times,\u201d he says, in muffled tones.</p> <p>At Madison Square Park it looks like everybody working from home has taken the opportunity to take their pet to the dog area and enjoy the sun.

Finally, a man walking into Walgreens agrees, elbow bumping Lady Liberty as Elmo takes a photo, before ambling back in to do his shopping. A solitary man dances to the soundtrack of his AirPods.</p> <p>On the steps, usually packed with tourists, there is plenty of breathing room. British tourists, Dan Hase, 33, and Claire Hase, 30, from Newcastle, are visiting New York for the first time. They are understandably disappointed. After arriving on Wednesday night, they went to see The Lion King only to find all Broadway performances had been cancelled and many of the attractions on the three-day pass they bought are closed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a letdown,\u201d says Dan.</p> <p>It is at West 44th street, where lots of theatres \u2013 including St James\u2019s, currently home to the Frozen musical, and the Shubert, showing To Kill A Mockingbird \u2013 that I find the most haunting scene of the day.</p> <p>The road is usually full of people queuing to get in, gathering during intervals, taxis dropping people off, red ropes for premieres. Now, it is almost completely empty.</p> <p>A few people are in the box offices, optimistically booking tickets for brighter times. But on the street it\u2019s so quiet that all I can hear is a plastic food container \u2013 New York tumbleweed \u2013 blowing down the street.</p>",

  "<p><strong>What is the best way to strengthen the immune system?</strong></p> <p>The answer to this question is straightforward: the normal approach to healthy living. Have a balanced diet, try to get as much sleep as you can, exercise, don\u2019t overwork. If you smoke, try to give up and reduce your intake of alcohol and other drugs.</p> <p><strong>Are alcohol-based antibacterial gels useful?</strong></p> <p>Washing your hands regularly with soap and water or alcohol-based gels, whether they say \u201cantibacterial\u201d on them or not, is the best way to prevent Covid-19. They also have the other advantage of helping to stop you pick up other infections that could weaken your immune system and so make you more susceptible to Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>What underlying conditions pose the biggest risk if you contract the virus? </strong></p> <p>The first thing to note is that most of the data we have about Covid-19 is from China. These indicate that heart disease, followed by diabetes, hypertension \u2013 high blood pressure \u2013 chronic lung disease and finally some cancers were the main risk factors.</p> <p>The more of these conditions you have, the greater the likelihood of severe disease that you face. Certainly, people with these conditions or older people should keep taking their usual prescribed medicines, be extra vigilant, including in handwashing, and should consider what is called social distancing, which means avoiding crowds or in some cases visitors.</p> <p><strong>How long does the disease survive in the air and on surfaces?</strong></p> <p>The coronavirus can persist in the air for a few hours and on some surfaces for quite lengthy periods \u2013 on cardboard for a day, on plastic two or three days. Disinfectants such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite work really well and will get rid of the virus. So regardless of how long they persist on household surfaces, as long as we keep those surfaces clean we will control the virus.</p> <p><strong>How do hospitals treat people admitted with coronavirus?</strong></p> <p>If people are not that unwell we might give fluids or oxygen, for example. And if someone had a pneumonia infection on top of Covid-19, they\u2019d be given antibiotics. We might also use the antiviral Tamiflu \u2013 not to tackle the coronavirus but to treat flu a patient might additionally have picked up. We may also consider painkillers and anti-cough medicine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-campaign-launched-offering-help-to-those-self-isolating\">Coronavirus: campaign launched offering help to those self-isolating</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the few who become more seriously ill, we would consider mechanical ventilation, in which a tube is passed down the airway to help patient breathe. I can\u2019t stress enough though, regardless of how sick a patient is, the importance of good nursing care, compassion, and empathy in supporting and caring for people with Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>What do you think the death rate from coronavirus will be?</strong></p> <p>It will vary from country to country. In the UK, I think a figure of 1% is probably going to be correct but we will have to wait until the epidemic is over. What is clear is that the death rate in younger people and those without any other illnesses looks to be very low.</p> <p><strong>What kind of immunity </strong><strong>will a person </strong><strong>have once they have been infected?</strong></p> <p>Other coronaviruses such as Mers and Sars have shown you get some immunity once you have been infected. Just how much or how long it will last we do not know. We will gather that data as events develop. I have seen no good data to suggest a person can get Covid-19 twice.</p> <p><strong>Is it realistic to hope for a vaccine for Covid-19 this year?</strong></p> <p>I doubt a vaccine will be available in the UK in time to prevent the curve of cases going up. However if it becomes a seasonal illness then developing a vaccine will be crucial \u2013 and adapting that vaccine to new coronavirus strains will also be extremely valuable. </p>",
  "<p>More than 100 MPs are urging the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to provide stronger assurances that social care workers forced to drop shifts because of the coronavirus pandemic will receive adequate sick pay.</p> <p>NHS England issued guidance advising trusts to give full sick pay to staff who have to self-isolate because of the disease, but there is growing concern nearly 400,000 carers on zero-hours contracts may miss out.</p> <p>There are fears that carers, <a href=\"https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/national-information/The-state-of-the-adult-social-care-sector-and-workforce-in-England.aspx\">who earn little more than \u00a38 an hour on average in the private sector</a>, may turn up for work when they are unwell to avoid losing pay because of illness or self-isolation.</p> <p>Statutory sick pay (SSP), worth \u00a394.25 a week, kicks in after workers have been off for four consecutive days. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-delivers-budget-2020\">Though the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced in the </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-delivers-budget-2020\">budget on Wednesday </a>that SSP would be extended to start on day one, an open letter signed by more than 100 MPs says many carers working irregular hours will be unable to prove they earn above the threshold of \u00a3118 a week to qualify for the payment. Meanwhile, the letter highlights, those who do receive SSP while self-isolating will take home far less than they would in a normal week meaning it will cause \u201csignificant financial hardship for them and their families\u201d.</p> <p>The care sector has notoriously perilous pay instability, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/23/british-care-company-fines-workers-50-for-calling-in-sick\">Guardian investigation previously exposing how a major UK firm fined workers \u00a350 if they phoned in sick</a>.</p> <p>The letter welcomes NHS England advising trusts to: \u201cEnsure that any member of staff, including bank staff and subcontractors, who has to be physically present at an NHS facility to carry out their duties, receives full pay for any period in which they are required to self-isolate as a result of public health advice.\u201d</p> <p>The MPs call on the guidance to be extended to all care workers to \u201censure care workers will not face financial detriment if they contract Covid-19, but it will help to delay the virus from spreading within care homes and amongst vulnerable people, potentially saving lives.\u201d</p> <p>Labour MP Helen Hayes who organised the letter \u2013 also signed by the shadow minister for health and social care Barbara Keeley \u2013 said: \u201cSocial care staff work incredibly hard all year round to support older people and working-age adults who have care needs. Many of those who receive care will also be in high-risk categories for coronavirus, and it is vital that social care staff are given the advice and support to enable them to continue to work while minimising the risk of infection both to themselves and the vulnerable people in their care.</p> <p>\u201cCurrently, care workers on zero-hours contracts are not being granted the same access to sick pay as NHS bank staff and subcontractors. NHS trusts have been advised to pay all staff in full in order to ensure that they self-isolate when necessary. Social care workers who are advised to self-isolate face the difficult choice of financial hardship or continuing to work and risk passing on the coronavirus to their patients. The government must urgently address this and provide the funding to prevent a public health emergency in the social care sector.\u201d</p> <p>A Government spokesman said: \u201cJust yesterday we published new guidance for the social care sector to make sure older people and those with pre-existing conditions and care needs are supported.</p> <p>\u201cAs part of the government\u2019s emergency legislation measures, Statutory Sick Pay will be available from day one for those affected by coronavirus. Anyone on zero-hour contracts who may not be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay will be able to claim Universal Credit or New Style Employment and Support Allowance, dependent on their circumstances.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers and campaigners have called for hundreds immigration centres detainees to be released because of fears they will contract coronavirus while locked up.</p> \n<p>The call is outlined in a letter from 10 organisations that advocate for migrants and human rights.

Its advice to prisons says inmates who have had contact with a known coronavirus patient should be isolated in single accommodation. Prison staff will be offered bonuses to cover shortages.</p> \n<p>The BBC says it understands the government\u2019s plans involve communicating regularly with inmates, making sure they can contact their families and providing books and magazines to those in isolation to alleviate boredom.

  "<p>Hmm, what if Downton Abbey, but <em>again</em>?<strong> </strong>I know you were wondering about it, and I was wondering too, and clearly so were ITV execs, who have commissioned one of Julian Fellowes\u2019s books \u2013 about the intersection of high society and low, set against the distant, foggy, soft threat of war \u2013 and basically it is Downton Abbey, but again, only this time it is called Belgravia.</p> <p>The thing is, I don\u2019t particularly see anything wrong with making another jelly from the Downton mould, because the first did such a good job of pleasing the party. If you are a Downton head, do these scenes from <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week12/belgravia\">Belgravia</a> (Sunday, 9pm, ITV) not all sound delicious? A young servant girl struggles to step in pace while calling her young mistress \u201cMiss!\u201d; a patriarch of low birth sternly corrects a young soldier who addresses him by a slightly incorrect title; mother frets about the party; a gruff older butler keeps a hot-headed young servant boy in check by saying something like: \u201cMaster\u2019s always been very fine to me, very fine indeed\u201d; someone dies of an illness that could easily be treated with paracetamol; after a tense dinner, someone pours port out of a slender crystal decanter; a room full of women in fine silk gloves titter when someone mildly poorer than them walks in. You get the idea.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ESOWpvhSiw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4ESOWpvhSiw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s not for me, but Belgravia is a perfect fit for ITV\u2019s hallowed \u201cteatime period hour-long, where a lot of the drama comes from people whispering about manners\u201d, and for that reason it will almost certainly go gangbusters like the genre-maker that came before it. More choice cuts: every man on screen has a set of mutton chops; the entire battle of Waterloo is skimmed over by an ad break; after a \u201c26 Years Later\u201d interstitial, Tamsin Greig doesn\u2019t age a single day; a matriarch who is widely considered to be rude and intimidating is, with a sly smile, nice for no reason to one of our main characters. The core storyline at the centre of Belgravia is about love across the class divide, and servants having banter over a lowly beef stew, and women in complex petticoats sitting down extremely carefully before being rude to each other.</p> <p>Maybe I just don\u2019t get it. Maybe I don\u2019t understand the thrill of slow-moving costume dramas where The Lady of the House\u2019s main problem is whether or not to go to a ball. I don\u2019t want to get political \u2013 there is no reason to compare the indulgence of dipping into an hour of Victorian high society with current poverty rates today, as if enjoying a low jeopardy drama is akin to voting through austerity \u2013 but I do find it hard to care for any character in any period piece where the house employs someone to wordlessly stoke a fireplace.</p> <p>For my money, Belgravia does the job, but not wildly well: there are absolutely zero standout performances, there is no zip to the scripted tete-a-tetes. The story has the ambition of a multi-generational, flashback-led country house drama with a core secret, but ultimately falls short, so it ends up just as a series of old women being a bit of a bitch to Tamsin Greig. But, you know, if you have a Downton-shaped hole in your life, Belgravia is here to fill it. If not, then ... I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t watch it, I guess?</p>",
  "<h2>Lily Kuo, Beijing bureau chief</h2> <p>I have overseen our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in China, from when there were just a few cases of \u201cunknown pneumonia\u201d in Wuhan in December to the lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in late January, and most recently as Beijing has begun to declare victory over the virus, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000here.</p> <p>We have focused on big-picture questions of how this crisis has dented the Chinese government\u2019s image in the eyes of its people as well as its impact on an individual level, the human cost of the outbreak as seen through the many families who lost loved ones. We also reported on what it felt like to be in this surreal state of limbo as the country ground to a halt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/guardian-challenges-covering-coronavirus-live-blog-paper\">How the Guardian is facing the challenges of covering coronavirus | Elisabeth Ribbans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have also tried to convey through our coverage the resilience, thoughtfulness and creativity of Chinese citizens. This ranges from doctors risking their careers to speak up about cover ups in the initial stages of the outbreak to internet users outwitting censors to preserve removed information, and citizen journalists who have gone missing after trying to report from on the ground in Wuhan.</p> <p>It has been one of the most complicated, difficult and important stories I have covered. At times I worried that the voices of the people most affected were being drowned out by the news. Other times I worry about the risks to those people when we tell their stories. We are constantly weighing how to show the human side of this crisis without endangering people.</p> <p>Even as the outbreak appears to be levelling off, the toll this has taken on the country is staggering. It may still be a long time before we can fully appreciate the impact this has had on China.</p> <h2><br>Sarah Boseley, health editor</h2> <p>Fear of the coronavirus is almost as great a threat as Covid-19 itself, the disease it causes. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has talked of combating the \u201cinfodemic\u201d alongside the epidemic. The public panic is such that social media is alight with speculation, while newspaper websites run stories with sensational headlines because they attract unprecedented traffic.</p> <p>A fundamental part of my job over the last couple of months has been to sift the emerging information to discard rumour, mistakes, gossip and error. As well as writing my own stories, I am quite often asked to cast an eye over others, to make sure we are not just accurate, but calm and non-sensational. I have made three <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/04/how-to-slow-the-spread-of-coronavirus-video-explainer?CMP=share_btn_tw\">video explainers</a> and written others that have taken off in an unprecedented manner, because we try to be factual and non-scary.</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy, because there is contradictory information even from the experts. Tedros recently talked of a death rate of 3.4%. Britain\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, some days later, gave evidence to MPs that it was 1% and, in his opinion, will probably prove to be lower. Both are probably correct. Tedros was counting only the officially recorded cases of those who became sick from Chinese hospitals. Whitty took into account the far larger numbers of people we know exist but can only estimate, because they have only mild illness and don\u2019t seek treatment.</p> <p>I listen to experts like these and other scientists from leading institutes such as the Wellcome Trust and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It\u2019s also fantastically helpful that the Chinese scientists and others elsewhere are publishing papers online with immediate and public access. There is unprecedented transparency in this epidemic \u2013 although it does mean the conclusions are tentative, so we need to be careful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64df488e09dfe0ec13f93bb2aa7a3405faba87b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64df488e09dfe0ec13f93bb2aa7a3405faba87b0/0_241_3267_1959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Xi of China speaking by videolink to a hospital in Wuhan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Xi of China speaking by videolink to a hospital in Wuhan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xie Huanchi/Xinhua/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ian Sample, science editor</h2> <p>There\u2019s a Journalism School rule that\u2019s driven into the brains of all who go down that path: check, check and check again. It\u2019s important whatever the story, whatever the subject, but never more so than in an unfolding public health crisis, and coronavirus is certainly that.</p> <p>The higher stakes do change how you work. You over-check \u2013 both what you write and how it is edited down the line \u2013 because the consequences of screwing up are potentially far more serious. If you get the mass of an electron wrong, readers will swiftly let you know, and some may suggest you leave your post, but the sky won\u2019t fall in. Misinterpret a scientific paper about how coronavirus spreads and you have more to worry about than angry emails and a battering on Twitter. What is that death rate figure that scientist said? Is it the number of people who have died among the reported cases? Or is it the infection-fatality rate, the chances that an infected person will die? The difference matters.</p> <p>Interviews are less breezy these days, more laborious. You are constantly checking whether a simple phrase has a technical definition you\u2019re unaware of, or whether you have the right source and context for a number recalled over the phone. We always need good scientists to talk to us; this job is impossible without their expertise and opinions. But it is doubly important in covering the coronavirus outbreak, because it is the scientists and medical specialists who can best chart a way through this. Even if they don\u2019t always agree.</p> <h2><br>Lorenzo Tondo, Italy correspondent</h2> <p>At 9:46pm on 9 March, 2020, my life as a reporter, husband, father, brother and son radically changed. Just as Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced the entire country would be placed under lockdown in an attempt to stop the coronavirus, for the first time in my career I wasn\u2019t simply covering a crisis, I was living it alongside my family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Readers have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not have been aware of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a reporter, while my hands pecked at the keyboard, I felt the huge responsibility to inform readers in search of balanced news. On one hand I sensed the necessity to express the crude realities of the outbreak, of the thousands infected and hundreds dead; on the other, the need to explain, factually, that it was possible to stop the virus. It was a thin line between the need to inform and the obligation not to cause alarm.</p> <p>But the biggest responsibility, the most challenging task, was the emergency I found myself in as a father. It wasn\u2019t easy to explain the coronavirus outbreak to my six-year-old son, Leoluca, who won\u2019t be able to attend school or leave the house except in extreme cases. Once again I found myself having to explain the seriousness of the situation while remaining level-headed. I reminded my son of his idol, Spider-Man, and what his Uncle Ben said to him: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d \u201cYeah, dad. I know,\u201d he answered. \u201cI don\u2019t have to jump around skyscrapers. All I have to do is stay home and wash my hands well.\u201d God bless him. It was easier than I thought.</p> <h2>Angela Giuffrida, Rome correspondent</h2> <p>It seems as if a lifetime has passed since that Saturday morning in January, when I was listening to an Irish resident in Wuhan speaking to LBC as news of the coronavirus outbreak in China emerged. He was describing life under quarantine, and how you only left your home to buy essentials \u201csuch as toilet roll\u201d. The situation seemed frightening, but very remote.</p> <p>As events unfolded, I followed the coverage of my colleague, Lily Kuo, in Beijing, all the while wondering how challenging it must have been for her to report the story in China while trying to keep healthy. But again, I never anticipated being in her shoes. Within a few short weeks, I have gone from writing about Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, which was initially confined to 11 northern towns, to living it.</p> <p>Reporting on this story has been among the most challenging of my career, not least because there are still so many unknowns about coronavirus. There is a huge sense of responsibility to tell the story correctly, but with not even the experts agreeing with each other, it has been a challenge to explain at times.</p> <p>We are fortunate that Italy has been transparent with data and swift in its actions. The government took coronavirus seriously from the beginning. Every day, the chief of the civil protection authority gives journalists a regional breakdown of new cases, deaths, those recovered and hospitalised. I also have a couple of trusted scientists to call for verifications as well as a team of colleagues at Rome\u2019s foreign press association, who have been invaluable in sharing their knowledge and experiences.</p> <h2><br>Ben Quinn, reporter</h2> <p>This has been one of the fastest-moving stories for as long as I can remember as a live blogger, demanding an unusual blend of international, political and science reporting as well as crowdsourcing and data analysis.</p> <p>In a story that\u2019s truly global, the Guardian\u2019s international network also really feels like it has come into its own, with our Australian office handing over to London and copy constantly coming in from reporters everywhere.</p> <p>But the very nature of the crisis has presented particular challenges too, such as in finding the right balance between covering the global picture and then knowing when and how much to drill down into localised and personal stories, while keeping them relevant to readers in a different part of the world.</p> <p>Given that our blog has really been global-facing by default, we\u2019ve also tried to take care, for example, to frame and explain specific British developments in a way that are coherent to readers elsewhere while also ensuring that readers in the UK get the depth of detail they expect.</p> <p>Readers themselves have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not otherwise have been aware of, or providing eyewitness accounts.</p> <p>Verification is obviously essential, and we\u2019re grateful to those who\u2019ve helped make this as easy as possible. That has involved, for example, something as simple as providing photos of boarding passes to help indicate that someone really is at an airport in Milan and can speak from experience about the impact of the Italian lockdown.</p> <p>Above all, as people find themselves with an unprecedented choice of information sources, we\u2019re still trying to make sure that we remain a calm and trustworthy source for the facts they need.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Back in 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/steven-appleby\" title=\"\">Steven Appleby </a>inadvertently outed himself in a comic strip about a cross-dressing superhero saving fashion victims from pinstripes and overalls. The strip, published in the Guardian, brought \u201cDragman\u201d swooping down to earth in a mauve ballgown and yellow wig. Although Appleby had been out for several years to his close friends and family, he realises now that the new character embodied an urge to go further. \u201cI\u2019d had enough of leading a double life. Cross-dressing in secret once or twice a week felt dishonest and stifling,\u201d recalls the 64-year-old artist. \u201cI\u2019d learned to be comfortable with being a transvestite and now I was desperate to live as one.\u201d</p> <p>Eighteen years later,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\">Dragman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\"> </a>is back as the star of his own book. His adventures take him from the tip of the Shard to a fetish club deep beneath London\u2019s railway arches, on the trail of a serial killer who specialises in murdering transvestites. But before he can solve the crimes he has first to overcome the enmity of a superhero community that is not only transphobic but has banned any rescue that is not strictly covered by insurance. By instinctively saving a young girl as she plummets off a rooftop, Dragman has outlawed himself.</p> <p>Appleby created the book at his studio on a busy south London street, where he opens the door to a colourful gathering. His wife, Nicola Sherring \u2013 to whom he remains married though they separated many years ago \u201cas a biblical couple\u201d \u2013 is sharing a sandwich with Charlie, a scarlet cockatoo, who sits on her shoulder, watched jealously by Una, an accident-prone one-eyed pug (named from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/31/edward-gorey-book-jacket-design-contribution-unique-era-publishing\" title=\"\">Edward Gorey</a>\u2019s <em>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</em> \u2013 \u201cU is for Una who slipped down a drain\u201d). Sherring is responsible for colouring the book while Charlie plays a bit part in it, swooping around a conservatory. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t meant to be in it at all, but Nicola sneaked him in, says Appleby, \u201cso I had to redraw a whole spread.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship between fiction and autobiography is seldom as delicately nuanced as it is in Appleby\u2019s protagonists. Like Dragman\u2019s alter ego August, he discovered his transvestism after trying on a woman\u2019s stocking that he found down the back of a sofa at the age of 19. Like August\u2019s long-suffering wife Mary, Sherring was a carpenter when the couple met. \u201cShe came to make bookshelves for my flat and we just got on so well that I kept finding more jobs for her to do, and then we fell in love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbda27177f71edb4184bafd52651c734e6f248c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbda27177f71edb4184bafd52651c734e6f248c1/817_1075_1168_816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dragman to the rescue \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dragman to the rescue \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mmckay/Steven Appleby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While August keeps his secret locked up in boxes in the attic, Appleby was honest with Sherring from the start \u2013 even though he admits that their marriage involved a certain amount of denial. \u201cI assumed my other issues would fade into the background or even go away, because I certainly hadn\u2019t fallen in love ever before. And so I thought, wow this is amazing, maybe it\u2019s the antidote.\u201d</p> <p>Sherring already had two sons and they had two more together. When their younger boys were nearring the end of primary school, Appleby felt he had to tell them. \u201cI was feeling increasingly itchy about it \u2013 not depressed, but just kind of incomplete,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be a joined-up person and I also didn\u2019t want to have this secret from the family and particularly from my boys.\u201d With a couple of friends, he and Sherring went off to a wig shop. \u201cI wanted something short, so people wouldn\u2019t notice a change, but then I put on this style (he pats his trademark black bob), and all of them said, \u2018that\u2019s the one\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Back home, his sons \u201cdidn\u2019t bat an eyelid. They were probably watching TV or playing computer games.\u201d On a car journey to their Northumberland holiday cottage a while later, a school friend started moaning about how embarrassing her parents were. \u201cI said to them \u2018What must I be like?\u2019 And they replied \u2018Oh no, Dad, you\u2019re not embarrassing at all. You don\u2019t wear lace dresses to school like you do at night.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The cottage, which used to belong to Appleby\u2019s mother, provides a link to his childhood, which was spent in a leaky old vicarage near the Scottish border. He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the oldest of four children. His mother was Canadian and his father worked for his family\u2019s quarrying firm, which was slowly going bust. After a local Church of England primary school, where he won prizes for plasticine modelling, he boarded at a Quaker school from the age of 11. \u201cI loathed it to begin with, but in the end I wouldn\u2019t wish it away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that mixed thing, because I have huge respect for the Quakers and I still have friends from school.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"590cb3fa8387be9571534b4095e6fb07a53bd629\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590cb3fa8387be9571534b4095e6fb07a53bd629/35_26_2154_3009/716.jpg\" alt=\"Appleby was tutored by Quentin Blake: \u2018He taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality\u2019\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appleby was tutored by Quentin Blake: \u2018He taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mmckay/Steven Appleby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He hung out in the art room and got involved in a band, going on to do art and design at Manchester Polytechnic, \u201cmainly because I found art fun, and because my academic subjects weren\u2019t brilliant\u201d. The experience delivered an existential shock. \u201cSuddenly I found lots of people could draw much better than me.\u201d He dropped out for a while to join a band, before returning to do graphic design at Newcastle Polytechnic, followed by illustration at the Royal College of Art, where he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/29/inside-the-magical-world-of-quentin-blake\" title=\"\">tutored by Quentin Blake</a>. \u201cHe taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality. You can draw a car really badly, as long as it has the spirit of a car.\u201d He flips the book open on a sweetly wonky green Mini, in which Dragman tootles around when he is being August.</p> <p>This revelation didn\u2019t entirely cure his sense of inadequacy, and he took a job at a design firm, Assorted iMaGes, founded by a college friend,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2017/oct/20/buzzcocks-orgasm-addict-sleeve-revisted-punk\" title=\"\"> Malcolm Garrett</a>. Together they ran high-profile campaigns for bands such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/12/how-buzzcocks-invented-indie-with-help-from-the-sex-pistols-a-renault-and-the-quo\" title=\"\">Buzzcocks</a> and Duran Duran. \u201cMalcolm would design the album covers and I\u2019d do the other things like playing cards or bubblegum cards. It was fun, but after a few years I got frustrated, because you\u2019re doing it for other people.\u201d</p> <p>One of the first characters he created was Captain Star, an obsolete astronaut stranded on a distant planet with an outsized ego, who was invented for a strip in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/07/farewell-to-nme-rocknroll-riot-that-petered-into-silence\" title=\"\">New Musical Express</a> and went on to become the star of a TV animation series voiced by Richard E Grant and Adrian Edmondson. Commissions from Punch, the Guardian and the Times followed. He collected his work into a series of books that make him appear to be a self-help guru: <em>Normal Sex</em> was followed by <em>Men: The Truth</em> and <em>The Truth About Love</em>. His Loomus cartoons about a small boy and his dysfunctional parents, which ran for 11 years in the Guardian Family section, were published as <em>Steven Appleby\u2019s Guide to Life</em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s all a question of curation, he says. \u201cSo for <em>Normal Sex</em>, I collected everything I\u2019d ever done about sex and divided it into sections.\u201d Published in black and white in 1993, its opening pages are a characteristic mix of awkward truths and absurdist humour: \u201cSome individuals are attracted only to themselves. Other confused people believe they may belong to a hitherto undiscovered sex. Of course creepie-crawlies have sexual worries too. Worms have trouble deciding which end is which \u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Dragman</em> is his first venture into sustained narrative, and it has already been optioned for a live action TV adaptation. In some ways, he says, it\u2019s a strange choice of subject because \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about superheroes at all, but I loved the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/09/batman-box-set-review-60s-cult-classic\" title=\"\">Batman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/09/batman-box-set-review-60s-cult-classic\" title=\"\"> series</a> that I watched in the 1960s and, looking back, I probably wanted to be Catwoman.\u201d He read the Dandy and the Beano alongside his sister\u2019s comics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/aug/21/postgraduate.highereducation\" title=\"\">Bunty</a> and Diana. \u201cI did move on to superhero comics a bit, but not all that much. Then I got into science fiction. I loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/27/philip-k-dick-best-novels-blade-runner-minority-report\" title=\"\">Philip K Dick</a>, particularly, because nothing in his books was ever quite what it appeared to be, and that seemed to be reality to me. Maybe it reflected the secret life that I had.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The relationship between fiction and autobiography is seldom as delicately nuanced as it is in Appleby\u2019s protagonists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which brings us back to the question of gender. Unlike <em>Dragman</em>, Appleby doesn\u2019t have a transvestite alias, though he lives full-time in woman\u2019s clothes. He briefly investigated gender reassignment but decided against it, citing his encounter with \u201cColin the mouse man\u201d \u2013 a pest-controller \u2013 as an example of both the challenges and rewards. \u201cColin arrived at the door and I opened it and said, \u2018Hi. I\u2019m Stephen. I changed my image a few years ago,\u2019 and he laughed, and we had this whole conversation. On his second visit he brought me a couple of leopard print screwdrivers, with little fluffy bits, and said \u2018I was given these for Christmas. I thought you might like them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He now lives partly in his studio and partly back at the family home with Sherring and her partner, a son and his girlfriend, a nephew, and, of course, Charlie and Una. Friendship is important to him, cropping up time and again in his professional life. When he wanted to try out the ideas in <em>Dragman</em>, it was to a member of his old school band that he turned.</p> <p>The book is full of Appleby\u2019s unique brand of punning fun. If it has a message, it\u2019s that it pays to be honest, and capitalism isn\u2019t honest: it steals souls. Its warning is knitted into a plot that is indebted to hard-boiled detective fiction and soap opera, as well as to his own experience of the cross-dressing scene.</p> <p>\u201cI would know people as Deirdre or Susan and have no idea what their male name is, or whether they\u2019re a plumber or a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel so lucky that the world allows me to be myself. \u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dragman</em> is published by Vintage (RRP \u00a318.99).

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn\u2019t even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">failing</a>\u201d testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening.</p> \n<p>Trump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/presentation-us-hospitals-preparing-for-millions-of-hospitalizations-2020-3?international=true&amp;r=US\">running into the millions</a> and only about 45,000 ICU beds <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">available</a> in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-donald-trump-presidency-sick-joke\">The sick joke of Donald Trump's presidency isn't funny any more | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Trump and his allies can no longer lie or deny, we can expect them to move on to the next phase of their crisis management playbook: attacking their enemies. It is already clear that they intend to interpret the virus not primarily as an existential threat to millions of Americans, but as an existential threat to their own political power. With the markets tumbling and Trump\u2019s re-election suddenly in doubt, it is only a matter of time before the right goes on the offensive. When they do, it won\u2019t be the virus in their sights, but the familiar foes: journalists, experts, blue states, immigrants and people of color.</p> \n<p>At this point, the coronavirus pandemic will intersect with Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses in truly frightening ways. With parts of the country experiencing levels of privation and death rarely seen in peacetime, Trump will feel justified in invoking emergency powers. In a declared state of emergency, the president has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/\">extraordinary powers</a>, including the ability to freeze an American\u2019s finances and deprive them of the ability to legally work, to control digital communications, and to deploy the military domestically. Aside from these enumerated items, Trump has repeatedly shown that he anyway believes that there are no legal or constitutional limits on presidential authority.</p> \n<p>Most worrying of all are the implications for immigrant communities and people of color. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he has a racialized view of who is a \u201ctrue\u201d American, from denying Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship to telling congresswomen of color born in the US to \u201cgo back\u201d to where \u201cthey came\u201d from. It would be extraordinary if this doesn\u2019t at the very least color his decisions on where to send federal aid and how to deploy his emergency powers. There is also a disturbing likelihood that Trump will attempt to stoke racism in order to rally his base and present the coronavirus as an alien plot against (white) America.</p> \n<p>Already the right has shown a tendency to lash out at foreigners in its response to the virus, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan\">insisting on labeling it</a> \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d to carrying out border closures while doing little to stop transmission within the United States. In a bizarre statement, Senator Tom Cotton even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hold-accountable-those-who-inflicted-it-on-the-world-tom-cotton-demands-punishment-for-coronavirus-outbreak\">threatened</a> to \u201chold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\u201d. Once the virus is undeniably established in America, it is all too likely that this animus and psychological need for scapegoats will be directed at those the right considers alien interlopers at home. The results \u2013 both from the misuse of state power, and from privately \u2013 inflicted terrorism and violence \u2013 could be profound.</p> \n<p>It is also time to start worrying about the 2020 election. If the economy has crashed, there are countless dead, and Trump is badly trailing in the polls, it is almost inevitable that he will attempt to cast doubt on the wisdom and legitimacy of holding a November election. He would not have to do anything so drastic as to attempt to call off the election \u2013 instead, he could call for his supporters to boycott it, then simply refuse to acknowledge the result. If the Republican party faces an electoral wipeout, its craven behavior over the last few years can give us no confidence that the party would defend the democratic process and eject Trump from the White House.</p> \n<p>In short, nothing in Trump\u2019s record \u2013 or that of his ardent base, whose political support is all he cares about \u2013 can lead us to believe that he will use his power to protect and serve all Americans equally in a time of unprecedented crisis. He might look like a deer in the headlights right now, but soon enough he will snap back to the unreality he lives in and deploy the only political trick he knows: rallying his base, abusing his power, trashing his foes. Many Americans will have to deal with the reality of a president who is not only incompetent to defend them but doesn\u2019t even regard them as legitimate Americans worthy of protection. This epidemiological crisis is also a political one. We should prepare to defend against both.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University</p></li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>The family of Jill Saward, the Ealing rape victim who became a leading figure in the fight against sexual violence, has donated thousands of pounds to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/24/womens-rights-group-sues-cps-over-failure-to-pursue-rape-cases\">a legal challenge against the Crown Prosecution Service</a>.</p> <p>Saward\u2019s family have donated \u00a310,000 to a <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/justice-after-rape/\">crowd justice campaign</a> to fund a legal challenge brought by the <a href=\"https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/\">End Violence against Women\u2019s Coalition</a> (Evaw), which accuses the CPS of covertly changing its policy and practice on prosecuting rape, and becoming more risk-averse.</p> <p>Gavin Drake, Saward\u2019s widower, said the family were unanimous in their support for the challenge. \u201cAs soon as I read about the case, I knew that this was something that Jill would be supporting if she was still alive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The CPS has stated its intention to pursue tens of thousands of pounds in legal costs if a judicial review, where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision taken by a public body, is not granted on Tuesday at the Royal Courts of Justice, according to legal documents seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, argued that Evaw\u2019s proposed proceedings \u201care not public interest proceedings\u201d \u2013 which, if accepted by the judge, may mean costs would not be capped, according to lawyers from the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, which is representing Evaw.</p> <p>The women\u2019s groups argue that this money would come in large part from victims of rape who feel they have been failed by the CPS, and have given small donations.</p> <p>By mid-afternoon on Friday the fund had raised \u00a348,000 towards the legal challenge, but campaigners fear that costs could amount to at least \u00a370,000 if they are not capped at the permission hearing on Tuesday.</p> <p>The campaign has received an increase in donations in recent days, many of them for \u00a310 or \u00a320 and nearly all with messages of support. One donor wrote: \u201cHaving been through the system myself and being failed on every level I so wish you every success.\u201d Under the anonymous donation of \u00a310, someone simply wrote: \u201cI never got justice.\u201d</p> <p>The Saward family pledge comes from donations following the campaigner\u2019s sudden death in January 2017, aged 51. Saward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/09/jill-saward-obituary\">was raped in her home</a>, the Ealing Vicarage, in March 1986 by a gang of burglars when she was 21.</p> <p>Outcry over her picture being published in the Sun newspaper, and the fact that the defendant who did not take part in the rape received a substantially longer jail sentence for burglary than the two convicted of rape, led to a change in the law, which gave rape victims anonymity and allowed prosecutors to appeal for longer sentences.</p> <p>\u201cJill\u2019s treatment was in no way unique,\u201d said Drake. \u201cBut the publicity the case received shone a light on the way victims and survivors of sexual assault were treated by the criminal justice system.\u201d</p> <p>He said while laws had been changed as a result of her case and campaigning work, the criminal justice system had gone backwards in recent years. He pointed to police and CPS figures that revealed in 2019 there were close to 60,000 reports of rape, but fewer than 1,800 charges and fewer than 1,000 convictions. The CPS has previously denied taking a more \u201crisk-averse approach\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis situation has to change, and the CPS must be held to account for the appalling conviction rate,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the funds being raised are not needed \u2013 because the case progresses and is awarded cost protection \u2013 all money will go to a rape justice legal fighting fund,\u201d said Sarah Green, the chief executive of Evaw.</p> <p>\u201cWe are deeply honoured to receive this money, collected in Jill\u2019s name and connected to her life\u2019s work of trying to make things better and more just for rape survivors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope she would be proud of the way we are all continuing her work.\u201d</p> <p>The CPS said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a gun going off, and once that\u2019s happened there\u2019s no going back.\u201d This is how Guardian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemerobertson\" title=\"\">Graeme Robertson</a> describes the onset of alopecia. Robertson developed it 17 years ago. He was 23 and covering the Iraq war, during which he witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/23/iraq.unitednations\" title=\"\">the 2003 bombing </a>of the UN building in Baghdad that killed 22 people. \u201cI was having lunch opposite, then there were bodies everywhere,\u201d he recalls. A few days later, \u201cI was in the shower, when I got out, I shaved, and a 50p-size clump came off my beard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8d838ff013f1f9b15770fef6373b7a292a16c5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d838ff013f1f9b15770fef6373b7a292a16c5e/68_0_634_792/400.jpg\" alt=\"Graeme Robertson\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graeme Robertson: \u2018I wanted to help people who were going through it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the start of a dramatic physical transformation. Before his hair loss, Robertson had a thick beard and a body covered in dark hair. It took time for him to accept that he had alopecia. An umbrella term for hair loss or balding, it is commonly caused by an autoimmune condition that attacks the hair follicles (those with it often cite stress as a trigger). In around 20% of cases, there is a family history \u2013 and there is no cure. For Robertson, one of the hardest aspects was the growing disconnect between his appearance and his internal sense of masculinity: \u201cOne girl whom I went out with said it was like kissing a doll, because I\u2019ve not got any stubble. She said, \u2018If I close my eyes, it\u2019s like I\u2019m kissing a girl.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He entered a middle phase, where he had half a moustache, half a head of hair, half a beard, which he got around by shaving daily. However, the psychological impact of losing his eyebrows and eyelashes was significant. \u201cWhen you lose eyelashes and start getting sore eyes, you lose everything. You either have to accept that there\u2019s something different about you, or go the opposite way and drive yourself insane about how you look or feel.\u201d</p> <p>Having come to terms with his hair loss, Robertson has started documenting the experiences of others. \u201cWhen it was happening, I didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to help people who were going through it. It started as a side project then turned into something in-depth, and I saw how many people were struggling.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Poppy Aithwaite</strong><br>18, waitress/barmaid, Teesside</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a3c6ec48ead740a89ae3d749ddb0858a1b700c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a3c6ec48ead740a89ae3d749ddb0858a1b700c2/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poppy Aithwaite for Alopecia UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was eight months old when I developed alopecia and had no hair until I was about three. Then, from the age of three to 13, I had tiny bald patches behind my ears. I used to think it was the worst thing ever. At 13, it all fell out really quickly. I ended up with nothing. I think it was the stress of going to secondary school that triggered it. And being a teenager; your hormones are changing, too.</p> <p>At school I didn\u2019t want to be different, so I tried to hide it. Wearing a wig was horrendous. I was constantly scared: what if someone pulls it? What if someone thinks it\u2019s funny? I\u2019d get comments such as, \u201cShe\u2019s more bald than my dad.\u201d At the time, I couldn\u2019t talk about it. I just sobbed. It got to the point where I wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. I wouldn\u2019t eat, I wouldn\u2019t open my blinds. I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once, the place where I was working was boiling. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I dropped out of school when I was 15. I was a mess and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. My mam\u2019s a hairdresser, so I started working with her, and at first I loved being able to do all these different things with everybody\u2019s hair, but over time it got harder. I switched to working in bars and restaurants instead, and started seeing a reiki healer. It sounds too good to be true, but she got rid of all my pain. Since then my confidence has just grown.</p> <p>One summer, the place where I was working was boiling and rammed. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid. I feel as if I just woke up one day and something had clicked. I\u2019ve heard all the names that anyone\u2019s going to call me by now. If they see me as \u201cthat baldy lass\u201d, so what?</p> <p>Instagram helped, too. There are many different types of hair loss, whether that be patches or total baldness. There\u2019s everything there for people to see. I model for a wig company, and at first I was scared about the pictures being posted. Then I thought, why am I bothered? I want them to see how happy I am. I don\u2019t want to be that depressed person who loses their hair, I want to be that young girl who inspires people to be who they are.</p> <p>Having alopecia and being in relationships has never been a problem. I\u2019m gay and it\u2019s easier being with a girl. Girls are more understanding. I\u2019ve got a drawer full of wigs. One day I\u2019ve got brown hair, the next I\u2019ve got pink. When I first lost my hair, I felt as if my identity had been ripped away. Now I can be who I want to be.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Michael Taylor</strong><br>27, tech worker, Berlin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07d351958d43a4f3b2ad705d5cc62049198ae9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d351958d43a4f3b2ad705d5cc62049198ae9c9/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I used to have a very luscious beard and my alopecia began with a fingerprint-sized hole on my chin. I actually found it endearing. I would walk around work and say: \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d Shortly afterwards, I moved to Berlin for a promotion, and within six months I needed to shave completely. Then I got a patch around the crown of my head. I went to the barber and it was a really uncomfortable experience. He showed me the back of my head in the mirror and there were many patches forming. I realised that this was going to change my life permanently.</p> <p>When I came back to London for my Christmas break, I went to the local barbershop with one of my best friends, and got my head shaved. I remember seeing a mole on the back of my head for the first time, which was interesting. Then I walked out, feeling very cold and a little bit shaken.</p> <p>I think I had a genetic predisposition to alopecia, because there are autoimmune diseases in my family. But I also had a really traumatic year while I was losing my hair. I was adjusting to living in a new country; my long-term relationship fell apart; I lost my dog. Suddenly I was single, without any friends. I was withdrawn for a while. I was mourning, essentially. And then I was dealing with this hair loss.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a while I tried very hard to reverse it naturally. For three months I gave up all of the good stuff in life: cigarettes, alcohol, sugar \u2013 even lots of vegetables that are considered inflammatory. I tried yoga and meditation.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve come out the other side and realised my own peace of mind is more important than sacrificing many things in the hope that I will get some regrowth. I have no way of knowing when or if I will get any, and I am OK with that, at least for now.</p> <p>I had a relatively weak hairline prior to that, so I don\u2019t miss the hair on my head very much. But I miss my beard and my facial hair. I can\u2019t lie about that. When you lose your eyebrows, it tips over into a space where people think that you are sick.</p> <p>But you have to see the funny side. I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps you get through the door. Online dating is a lot more difficult, because it is a purely visual medium. The best chance of meeting somebody is just being out and living life.</p> <p>Paradoxically, I am probably less self-conscious now. I think back to how I was, clinging on to that rubbish hairline. Now, I just find that hilarious.

I had an itchy patch at the back that I kept scratching. I thought it was normal postpartum hair loss. I was in denial. I kept thinking: it\u2019s fine, it will grow back. Then one morning when I started to brush my hair, it was coming out in clumps. Four weeks later, I thought, sod it, it\u2019s got to come off. So, I shaved it all off and raised more than \u00a32,000 for <a href=\"https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/\" title=\"\">Teenage Cancer Trust</a>.</p> <p>When I found out that it wasn\u2019t going to grow back, it was a blow. Your hair is a part of your personality. I was always known for my really long, dark hair and I used to wear a huge bun at work. When I went back after maternity leave, I hadn\u2019t told anyone and they said: \u201cOh my God, are you OK? Are you ill?\u201d I just didn\u2019t want to wear a wig. I thought I would embrace this and be me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy.

But I kept telling myself it was just a look. Some women choose to shave their heads. Losing my brows and lashes affected me more, because no one would choose to shave off their eyebrows and have no eyelashes. I would take those back in an instant over my head hair.</p> <p>Alopecia is a strange condition that nobody knows much about. It doesn\u2019t cause physical pain and it\u2019s not life-threatening, but people don\u2019t realise the mental impact. One of my biggest fears was that my husband would not find me attractive any more. It must be hard to be with someone who looks completely different from when you met them. He\u2019s been amazing, but when it came to having sex I felt really unattractive. I just didn\u2019t feel very womanly.</p> <p>I still get that sometimes, but I\u2019ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy. You just have to learn to trick your mind, to tell yourself that. I wear bigger earrings to compensate for the lack of hair. And I can still wear my uniform, put my red lipstick on and be \u201cthe different one\u201d at work. People used to say: \u201cOh, Rima with the hair.\u201d Now I\u2019m known for being the only bald female crew member out of 4,000.</p> <p>When you lose your hair, it\u2019s like losing your identity, really, and you have to get to know a whole new self. It does teach you who you are. Alopecia doesn\u2019t define my life, but it has made me realise what is important: my husband, my children, my confidence.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Laura Buckeridge </strong><br>actor,<strong> </strong>London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f603d674aaa6e77d619fb6a7937feb6e78837685\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f603d674aaa6e77d619fb6a7937feb6e78837685/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Buckeridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I started losing my hair during my GCSEs, with a 2p-piece-sized patch on the back of my head.

It\u2019s the nearest thing to prostitution.\u201d We were a very religious family, and I made the connection that, because my hair was falling out, God must be punishing me.

I shaved my head occasionally, and for my wedding, I was fine in front of hundreds of people in a big white dress, with a bald head and an ornate crown. I asked my husband: \u201cHow was I so strong then?\u201d and he said: \u201cYou just loved being different.\u201d But you can be a confident person and then something happens, and you think, I can\u2019t face it today. In the end, losing my hair took away my career. The whole thing about acting is your image.

I\u2019d moved into a new area and the last thing I wanted was to stand out. At the playgroups, I was often the only black woman there. My husband is a white, middle-class man who is Oxford-educated, and I didn\u2019t want to have an impact on his career. I was playing the dutiful wife. It feels silly to say that alopecia robs you of your identity, but you just don\u2019t recognise yourself. When I put the wig on, I thought, oh, I remember her.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t tell anyone my hair wasn\u2019t real for years. I was clutching on to my hair on windy days, smiling when people said: \u201cYou\u2019ve changed your hair!\u201d thinking, really? You don\u2019t know?

And whenever there is another bald black woman, they tend to come up and we have a lovely chat.</p> <p>You have to be strong, because people stare. You think: why are they staring? Oh yes, I\u2019m black. And bald. I forgot. I do a lot of work in schools and there\u2019s no better education than seeing a black woman who can speak in public, who is bald, and it is normal. I hope that I empower people. I look good without a wig. I\u2019m happy.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Alice Peck </strong><br>29, works for the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award programme, Bristol</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d5608f4622715f7c0ff6698f38327aba1a5f610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d5608f4622715f7c0ff6698f38327aba1a5f610/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Peck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My alopecia started more than three years ago. I was working in a job with some very burned-out co-workers, and I was badly bullied. I was young, idealistic and hopeful about where I wanted my life to go, so I wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of experience. I began to notice little patches, and at the time I thought it was nothing. I thought it was stress-related and that it would go away.</p> <p>In the subsequent two years, those patches became bigger, then I got some regrowth and it fell out again. The uncertainty was difficult. I was very paranoid. I was obsessed with this idea that everyone was staring at me. Every day I\u2019d cover my hair over the bald patches, and pencil in eyebrows.</p> <p>By this time I was working in refugee camps in Larissa in northern Greece, and it was very difficult to acknowledge my own struggle. I was waking up with a pillow full of hair, then doing stressful humanitarian work. There was shame that I was even struggling, then the shame of looking so different, and feeling so weird and alone. I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it because the situations we were facing were so much bigger than mine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate. Trying to 'own' my baldness is the way I cope with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I left Greece after realising that my health was really being affected by the stress. I went back to my parent\u2019s house for the first time in 10 years and lived there. By then, my hair was falling out in clumps and I decided to shave it off. Since doing that, it hasn\u2019t always been easy, but I feel much more in control. I took charge of it rather and being a victim.</p> <p>I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate. Trying to \u201cown\u201d my baldness is the way I cope with it. I wear more makeup now than I did before and I wear more statement earrings. Seeing other women with buzzed heads or who rock their baldness is empowering. I date men and women, and I think with women it\u2019s much more acceptable to look different. With men, there seems to be a more shallow idea of what women should look like, or so I think.</p> <p>I had eating disorders in my 20s, so I\u2019ve never really felt so comfortable in my body. Alopecia has forced me to confront my own image so, in a way, I\u2019m grateful for it. The only hair I didn\u2019t lose was my armpit hair, which is quite funny. Now I\u2019m very proud of it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Elena McGowan</strong><br>52, volunteer and stay-at-home mum, Jersey<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"94353970471671d3ae95792eb2235332b5c29d42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94353970471671d3ae95792eb2235332b5c29d42/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elena McGowan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My hair first fell out when I was 30, and it made me really miserable. I tried a couple of medical routes and quickly realised nothing could be done. I felt awful. I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone about it and nobody saw me without hair, even my husband. I hid it away. I thought I looked like an alien.</p> <p>I had a job in a customer-facing role in a bank, so I had to literally put on my wig and put on a face and be the person that people were expecting to see. The first day I went in with my wig, this guy came in and said: \u201cOh Elena, what have you done to your hair?\u201d I burst into floods of tears, ran to the loo and was there for about half an hour, trying to compose myself. Also, when you\u2019ve got a bit of hair, you don\u2019t have control of where your wig is. I was always worrying about whether it was straight or not. It puts you in a state of heightened anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet didn\u2019t exist when I had it first time, but when I Googled it this time I was amazed.

I couldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror for a long time, because I didn\u2019t recognise myself. Then my hair started to grow back and I was able to ditch the wigs, until about three years ago when it started to thin again. For a couple of weeks I was in utter despair. I thought, I can\u2019t face going through this again: it\u2019s so unfair. Just go away. Leave me alone.</p> <p>By then I was a mum. So I thought, actually, no. Hair is important, but there\u2019s more to life. And I shaved my head.</p> <p>The internet didn\u2019t exist when I had alopecia the first time, but when I Googled it this time I was amazed. There\u2019s so much stuff. I started a support group in Jersey and it\u2019s had an amazingly positive impact on my life. It\u2019s lovely to be able to help people get out of the place of despair where everybody starts, to a place of acceptance and happiness. Now, putting my hair on is the last thing I\u2019ll do before I walk out of the door, and quite often I don\u2019t notice whether I have it on or not. I keep my wig in the kitchen on a champagne bottle. Why not?</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful I\u2019ve got alopecia. Beauty is not all about the outside. And being able to teach that to my daughter, who\u2019s growing up in a complicated world, is a gift.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Ranjit Senghera-Marwaha</strong><br>49, NHS<strong> </strong><strong>manager, Bromsgrove</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6343ab2b4a5424f6de6a474d46c2ad124179532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6343ab2b4a5424f6de6a474d46c2ad124179532/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ranjit Senghera-Marwaha for Alopecia UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re an Asian woman growing up, your mum will always make you plait your hair. In the 1970s it was two plaits with a centre parting, and my parting started getting wider. I thought it was linked to eczema, so I modified my hairstyle to accommodate it. Then in my 20s, the doctor said: \u201cIt\u2019s alopecia. There\u2019s no cure for it, it\u2019s to do with your immune system.\u201d </p> <p>Losing my husband at a younger age was probably the biggest trigger, but it didn\u2019t affect me until about two years afterwards. At one point my mum and sister were poorly; I was busy looking after them and my hair came back for two years. Then as soon as they got better, it started to fall out again. I was at my baldest in 2017. I couldn\u2019t look in the mirror, because it just wasn\u2019t me. After my eyelashes fell out, my eyes were swollen all the time, and I was getting allergic reactions. It\u2019s a constant battle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes at work, I have to go to the toilet, take it off, hang it up, calm my head down, then put it all back on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wearing a wig is like wearing a tight swimming cap. I can\u2019t wait to get it off. Sometimes at work, I have to go to the toilet, take it off, hang it up, calm my head down, then put it all back on. And wigs stop you from doing certain things. It was hard to date. I used to sabotage relationships, purely because I\u2019d be thinking, how the hell do I explain? He\u2019ll go to kiss me and the wig will come off. The first time I was with my current partner and my scarf came off, I couldn\u2019t stop crying because I just didn\u2019t want him to see the real me. I felt embarrassed. I felt ugly. But on the other hand, I wanted somebody to give me a chance to show that this doesn\u2019t define me.</p> <p>I wear my wig because I don\u2019t want people looking at me and making judgments. People see guys with bald heads and think it\u2019s part of the ageing process, or he\u2019s decided to shave his head and, actually, he looks quite sexy. They won\u2019t necessarily see the same in a woman. They think: what\u2019s happened to her?</p> <p>I\u2019d like my hair to grow back, because it\u2019s part of my identity, and I wouldn\u2019t have to wear wigs any more. And nothing beats feeling the breeze through your hair. I miss that. People say: \u201cIt\u2019s only hair!\u201d and I\u2019m like: really?

I was quite self-conscious about being different, but my school allowed me to wear a baseball cap. I was picked on, but not a lot. I was probably lucky; the friends I had weren\u2019t bullies. They were quite encouraging. I put up with wearing a cap for a few years, but after a while, I just got fed up with it. My friends would say: \u201cOh, you\u2019re not wearing your hat today,\u201d but I didn\u2019t think twice. I was confident in myself, even with a bald patch.</p> <p>When I hit 20, it all fell out within two weeks and stayed the same for eight years. At that age, I thought, what the heck, who cares? I\u2019ll just shave it off. At least then, when I woke up in the morning, I wouldn\u2019t find clumps of hair on my pillow. At first my scalp was quite pale but after a couple of weeks in the sun it evened out, so it just looked normal after that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not having eyelashes, if you walk past a building site, dust gets in your eyes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it does impact your life. Not having eyelashes, if you walk past a building site, dust gets in your eyes. My scalp is quite sensitive and if anything like a woolly hat touches it, it gets really itchy. So it gets cold in winter. I have tried dating apps and had no luck on that. People judge on appearances and it\u2019s not until they meet me that they see that I am quite a lively sort of person.</p> <p>When I meet new people I say: \u201cMy name\u2019s Ray, or you can call me the bald Chinese guy.\u201d I think I am the only bald Chinese guy in Leicester. Rather than having people say that to me, I\u2019m saying it first. I\u2019m quite a relaxed, chilled person, and if you have questions about my baldness, don\u2019t be afraid: ask.</p> <p>People do sometimes. Once, in the supermarket, the security guard asked, \u201cHow do you always get your head so smooth? What do you use?\u201d which was quite funny. Alopecia has saved me money on haircuts, buying razor blades to shave my face, buying loads of shampoo. On that side, I think it is brilliant.</p> <p>People stare at me sometimes, but I don\u2019t judge them for it. I don\u2019t really care what they think. They don\u2019t know the story. If they want to take the mick out of me, then that\u2019s their problem. I feel comfortable with my own identity.</p> <p>Before this project I thought I was quite alone in this. Now I\u2019ve found out that there is a community out there, I\u2019d like to help other people with alopecia. If young kids can see adults with alopecia being secure about themselves, that will help them feel more comfortable with themselves, too.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Laura McDermott and Joanna York.</em></p> <p>\u2022 Alopecia UK, which supports people with hair loss, can be reached at <a href=\"http://alopecia.org.uk\" title=\"Alopecia UK\">alopecia.org.uk</a></p> <p>If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

  "<p>Back in the 1990s, Rudy Howell, then in his mid-50s, took over his father-in-law\u2019s poultry contract business in North Carolina. He and his wife hoped it would provide a decent income they could combine with their small pensions to fund a comfortable retirement.</p> <p>Instead, Howell, now 70, finds himself working long hours, deep in debt and earning less than $40,000 (\u00a330,654) in 2019 \u2013 well below the average US wage. He spoke to the Guardian about his situation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I do, I can\u2019t get above water. I do the same thing every time and the payout per flock can vary by as much as $8,000.

He is contracted exclusively to Perdue Farms, one of the largest poultry companies in the US. The company, which produces a number of other agricultural products and services, generates more than $6bn a year in revenue.</p> <p>Over the past half century poultry farming in the US has become increasingly consolidated among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/03/is-the-us-chicken-industry-cheating-its-farmers\">a handful of companies</a>. Tyson Foods, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Sanderson Farms, Koch Foods and Perdue control about 60% of the US chicken market. The companies <a href=\"https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/industry-issues/vertical-integration/\">own and operate</a> all the means of production, including the feed mills, slaughterhouses, trucking lines and even the hatcheries that develop the best strains of chickens.<br><br>In the 1960s, poultry companies <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/447911/ugly-economics-chicken\">experimented</a> with owning and operating chicken farms, but realised it was the least profitable, highest risk part of the supply chain. Instead they moved to the current system, persuading independent contracted farmers to take on this responsibility instead, and the system has reaped rich profits for those at the top. From 1981 to 2018, farm sales of chickens increased from <a href=\"https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT84800258/PDF\">$4.5bn </a> to <a href=\"https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/plva0519.pdf\">$31.7bn</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/03/is-the-us-chicken-industry-cheating-its-farmers\">Is the US chicken industry cheating its farmers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But contracts typically hand a remarkable amount of control to the parent company. In this case, Perdue maintains ownership of the birds, and the contract stipulates that farmers can only use feed, medication, vaccinations and other supplies provided by or arranged by Perdue. The contract also grants Perdue the authority to determine the breed of chickens produced, the numbers in each flock, the time allowed for processing each flock, and placement for future flocks.</p> <p>Howell and his fellow poultry farmers are so far from independent that in March 2018 the small business administration office of the Inspector General issued a <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/oig/SBA-OIG-Report-18-13.pdf\">report</a> stating that most poultry farmers do not qualify as independent businesses eligible for loans from the agency because integrators exert so much control over them. \u201cThis control overcame practically all of a grower\u2019s ability to operate their business independent of integrator mandates,\u201d it concluded.</p> <p>\u201cThey [Perdue] call themselves a family farm, but they\u2019re a corporate farm.

  "<p>In 2014, Giles Nicholson was battling the growing year from hell. A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The machinery] wouldn\u2019t go through it,\u201d says Nicholson, recalling the overspilling verges.</p> \n<p>But the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and biodiversity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. Butterflies and other invertebrates have returned in their droves.</p> \n<p>The reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for biodiversity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council\u2019s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council\u2019s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2ef1e72beb40802c13a94f5c6b4f78b0274875\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2ef1e72beb40802c13a94f5c6b4f78b0274875/0_0_4961_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing. Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The process is simple: cut infrequently, ideally, just twice a year in spring and then late summer once plants have bloomed and seeded; remove the clippings to gradually reduce the fertility of the soil and prevent a buildup of mulch; repeat, wait, and enjoy the resurgent wildlife and flowers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will not fail,\u201d says Sterling, who, as programme manager for charity <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/\">Butterfly Conservation\u2019s</a> building sites for butterflies project, has taken his roadside revolution around the country to any local authority that will listen. \u201cAs fertility declines in a soil, biodiversity increases. At first that seems a little counterintuitive because you imagine the more you pour into a soil, the more plants that can grow. That\u2019s not how it works in the natural system. In more fertile systems, a few species dominate and they swamp and smother everything else.\u201d<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"922cbc95404f5735b0f32fd3534c1fb9df0eed9b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/922cbc95404f5735b0f32fd3534c1fb9df0eed9b/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Wildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects. Photograph: Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Grass cuttings are almost always left where they fall along the thousands of miles of road verges that are maintained by law in the UK. Over time, the resulting mulch increases the fertility of the soil, meaning the grass grows with increasing vigour and needs to be cut more frequently. The cut and collect method breaks the cycle.</p> \n<p>The before and after photos of otherwise ordinary roadsides across Dorset show the dramatic effects of Nicholson and Sterling\u2019s maintenance regime, as suffocated seed banks have been allowed to spring back into life. Yarrow and yellow flashes of lady\u2019s bedstraw punctuate roadsides and roundabouts throughout summer. Magenta pyramidal orchids linger outside a branch of Tesco.</p> \n<p>The cost savings of managing roadsides this way are equally stunning for the council\u2019s accounting department. The annual budget for highway verge management dropped from nearly \u00a31m to \u00a3650k in five years under the cut and collect, low fertility approach. London boroughs, councils from across the country and European governments are paying attention.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor the last 40 years we\u2019ve been doing entirely the wrong thing,\u201d says Sterling, impatient with the possibilities for roadsides across the UK and beyond.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"52e275535201427db0f722900788c892e8ed8c1a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e275535201427db0f722900788c892e8ed8c1a/0_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Managing road verges with the \u2018cut and collect\u2019 method can save money for councils.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Managing road verges with the \u2018cut and collect\u2019 method can save money for councils.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: B Wilkinson/Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Wildlife corridors</h2> \n<p>Wildflower meadows, ancient British ecosystems that are crucial for wildlife, thrived for centuries with the help of traditional farming methods and livestock husbandry, but have largely vanished in the post-war era.

  "<p>There is a revealing moment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/isabelhardman\" title=\"\">Isabel Hardman</a>\u2019s book where the author, a political journalist who lives with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\" title=\"\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, joins a forest therapy session. The therapist encourages her to \u201cconnect\u201d with herself and \u201cexperience nature better\u201d. Hardman wanders through the wood and finds a small hornbeam, which is twisting up towards the light, struggling to make its way in the shade of a mature oak. She is attracted to its shape, admires its bark, and draws parallels with her own life: how long it takes to heal and grow, how the scars we gather can still be beautiful \u201clike the zig-zagging trunk of this young tree\u201d. She reaches up and snaps one of its twigs: the tree is dead.</p> <p>\u201cServes me right for being so dreadfully whimsical,\u201d Hardman writes. \u201cThere seemed to be no neat life lesson here, nothing you\u2019d want to write on a fridge magnet or share on social media. I\u2019d come here hoping to connect with myself, and instead I\u2019d been drawn to a tree that was secretly dead.\u201d</p> <p>It is a valuable lesson in Hardman\u2019s <em>The Natural Health Service</em>, a practical and self-aware account of the relief from mental illness to be found outside. Hardman, and the many people she meets, identify respite, recovery and resilience in walking, running, cold-water swimming, gardening, \u201cforest bathing\u201d, birdwatching, botanising, horse riding and caring for pets. The common denominator is what Hardman calls \u201cthe great outdoors\u201d, that plangent, hearty Victorian-sounding cliche. But as she shows, other species and their ecosystems can be rebellious medics. At times, the \u201cnatural\u201d world resembles the magic mirror that undercuts Snow White\u2019s stepmother: rather than reflecting back ourselves, it is alive with its own agency, a challenge to our narcissism.</p> <p><em>The Natural Health Service</em> is one of a rapidly growing forest of new books that examine cures found in nature. This winter alone has brought the publication of <em>The Wild Remedy</em> by Emma Mitchell; <em>Losing Eden</em> by Lucy Jones; <em>Rootbound</em> by Alice Vincent; and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/wintering-how-i-learned-to-flourish-when-life-became-frozen-katherine-may-memoir-review\" title=\"\">Wintering</a></em> by Katherine May. One of last year\u2019s unexpectedly prominent books \u2013 unexpected because it was rejected by publishers and crowdfunded via Unbound \u2013 was <em>Bird Therapy</em> by Joe Harkness. Just as trend is followed by takedown, so this spring sees a potential debunking in the form of <em>Natural</em><em>: The Seductive Myth of Nature\u2019s Goodness</em> by American philosopher Alan Levinovitz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007/0_779_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Isabel Hardman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Isabel Hardman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea that human health can be salved by \u201cnature\u201d has been around for as long as we have regarded ourselves as a species apart from other living things. It truly arrived in Britain with the Romantics, for whom prosperity enabled a more reflective and worshipful relationship with the landscape that others had to toil in for a living. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\" title=\"\">Keats</a> and Byron loved swimming; sea-bathing was an upper-class health fad that inspired the first seaside resorts. The popularisation of nature\u2019s healing power peaked after the industrial revolution, when later Victorians were beset by fears of the all-conquering machine. Fresh air, exercise and healthful hobbies, from collecting butterflies to finding fossils, were prescribed in much the same way as GPs today are experimenting with \u201cprescribing nature\u201d to patients. Hardman reminds us of the prescience of Octavia Hill, the social reformer and co-founder of the National Trust in 1895, who campaigned to save urban land for city parks. London commons that could make developers fortunes had greater value as outdoor space, Hill argued: \u201cTo my mind they are even now worth very much; but they will be more and more valuable every year \u2013 valuable in the deepest sense of the word; health-giving, joy-inspiring, peace-bringing.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Losing Eden</em>, Jones shows that, ahead of today\u2019s scientists, even Florence Nightingale was aware of how green space and plants can assist recovery from physical illness. In 1859, Nightingale wrote that when she had been ill, her recovery quickened after she received \u201ca nosegay of wild flowers\u201d. The nurse noticed in her patients that there was \u201cmost acute suffering when [the] patient can\u2019t see out of the window\u201d; Jones and Hardman both cite a more modern scientific study by Roger Ulrich who examined the records of 46 patients recovering from gall bladder surgery between 1972 and 1981. Some patients were randomly assigned a hospital bed with a view of deciduous trees; others a view of a brick wall. Those with a view of trees had shorter post-operative stays, took fewer painkillers and had fewer minor complications. And yet 40 years on, hospitals are run as \u201csterile\u201d environments without plants, as Levinovitz notes in <em>Natural</em>: \u201cAn entirely unsuperstitious take on natural healing would recognise the importance of being around life \u2013 of facilitating hospital garden walks, say \u2013 instead of systematically excluding it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03f24d9ea256a1079b11ec9d430ab7447750f0f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03f24d9ea256a1079b11ec9d430ab7447750f0f7/0_188_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Out of the woods \u2026 green spaces have been proven to speed up recovery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of the woods \u2026 green spaces have been proven to speed up recovery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Travelpix Ltd/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the climate and extinction crisis quickens, so there is a rush for a literary cure. In Britain it began with Richard Mabey\u2019s <em>Nature Cure</em> in 2005. In many of the most popular recent examples of nature writing, other species and wild places have played a healing role \u2013 for bereavement in Helen Macdonald\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\" title=\"\">H </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\" title=\"\">Is for Hawk</a></em>, and alcoholism in Amy Liptrot\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/the-outrun-amy-liptrot-review-by-will-self\" title=\"\">The Outrun</a>. Nature Cure</em> (briefly) details Mabey\u2019s mental breakdown after completing his magnum opus, <em>Flora Britannica</em>, and the succour he found by forgoing his childhood home in the Chilterns for the bleaker plains of south Norfolk. When I ask Mabey if he regrets being midwife to the nature cure subgenre, an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d spills forth. \u201cI feel slightly guilty about the title, which was my idea and it was very euphonious, but I quite soon began getting letters from people saying they loved the book but that it was not much to do with nature curing me. If a pedantic scholar counted the paragraphs that were to do with the illness, it probably amounts to about six pages,\u201d he says. \u201cReally it\u2019s a book about encountering and adapting to a quite new landscape, which you could say was a post-cure experience.\u201d Mabey had to reach a certain stage of recovery to write <em>Nature Cure</em>. As he, Hardman and other nature cure writers emphasise, they can be too ill to leave the house to imbibe the healing wild, and too ill to write, too.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful when it occurs; people in distress find that encounters with the natural world do restore them,\u201d says Mabey. But two things concern him about the concept of a nature cure. \u201cI\u2019m worried that it\u2019s become mooted as a kind of panacea \u2013 green Prozac. And if there\u2019s anything wrong you just go out and look at the pretty flowers and you\u2019re going to be marvellous. That\u2019s a tall order if the natural world is in a state of crisis with the insect apocalypse and British songbirds collapsing all around us. There is also a danger that therapeutic nature becomes another way in which nature is reduced to service provider. The foregrounding of us being the centre of attention, the central agents of change and growth, all form part of a mindset that I think is obsolete. We need to rethink where we stand in relation to all these other organisms and what the transactions are between us, and stop saying they are all for our benefit, even though most of them probably are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b42a613ba2cf7096152929439691c06710560621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b42a613ba2cf7096152929439691c06710560621/0_1252_3338_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Mabey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Richard Mabey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Si Barber/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an insightful <a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5542/in-search-of-the-nature-cure\" title=\"\">essay on nature cures</a>, Richard Smyth quotes the poet Polly Atkin, who is diagnosed with chronic illnesses Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, a metabolic disorder that leads to a toxic accumulation of iron in the body. Like Mabey, Atkin has misgivings about this literary blossoming. \u201cThere is very little published work that points out how problematic it is \u2013 largely because the people who understand the problem are mainly those with incurable conditions and they\u2019re often too busy being incurable to write books about nature,\u201d she says. \u201cMore importantly, mainstream UK publishing is so attached to the \u2018nature cure\u2019 narrative that it can\u2019t imagine another story to tell about how we relate to the world around us.\u201d</p> <p>The stage is set for a debunking of the literary nature cure but in <em>Natural</em>, it never quite arrives. At the end of the book, despite Levinovitz taking smart aim at the snake-oil salespeople of late capitalism \u2013 those selling expensive natural remedies, natural \u201ccures\u201d for cancer, or loudly advocating \u201cwholly natural\u201d childbirth, sex or sport \u2013 he concludes that there is something innately glorious about the non-human natural world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m worried it\u2019s become mooted as a kind\u00a0of panacea \u2013\u00a0if there\u2019s anything wrong you just go out and look at the flowers</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Mabey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What Levinovitz critiques is what he sees as a religious attitude towards nature. An appeal to natural goodness \u2013 with \u201cunnatural\u201d as its evil twin \u2013 is among the most influential arguments in all human thought, ancient and modern, east and west. In fact, every human-made object is extracted from our planet; everything is \u201cnatural\u201d. Levinovitz argues our veneration of \u201cnature\u201d is dangerous, citing former South African president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mbeki\" title=\"\">Thabo Mbeki</a>\u2019s desire for Aids patients to take beetroot and other \u201cnatural\u201d treatments. What Levinovitz does is help us to identify the \u201cpropagandists, bigots, demagogues, and marketeers who wrap their rhetoric in the mantle of \u2018what\u2019s natural\u2019\u201d. </p> <p>When it comes to making money from nature, the small, poorly renumerated band of writers proselytising for its health benefits do not enter Levinovitz\u2019s line of fire. While <em>H </em><em>Is </em><em>for Hawk</em> will long stand as a literary classic, nature cure writing has taken a practical turn. Hardman and Harkness\u2019s books are squarely self-help. Their qualities include brutal honesty and generous advice. Both authors, alongside others such as Jones and Mitchell, make clear that while time in the natural world has ameliorated their mental illnesses, so too have antidepressants and talking cures. These writers don\u2019t succumb to the requirement for a happy ending either: no one suggests they are cured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3392a105a7aed1b724427f59f6b07eb0dee9e5d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3392a105a7aed1b724427f59f6b07eb0dee9e5d6/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild swimming in Snowdonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild swimming in Snowdonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stockimo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We might wonder if a writing cure is also part of their wider recovery, but it is not always so. John Clare, who died in 1864, has long been the most notable nature writer with mental health problems. The Northamptonshire farm labourer, whose superb poems made him a literary sensation in the early 19th century, could be considered both evidence for and against the theory that nature makes us well. Did he only fall ill once embraced by literary London, psychically uprooted from his rural heartland? Or was he ill despite surrounding himself with nature? A country life is no guarantee of mental wellbeing: depression is a major problem<strong> </strong>in modern farming; plenty of farm workers endure it.</p> <p>There is an echo of Clare\u2019s experience in Harkness\u2019s account of life since the publication of his debut, <em>Bird Therapy</em>. \u201cI will never write about nature again,\u201d says Harkness bluntly. He has been diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">obsessive-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">compulsive </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">disorder</a> and generalised anxiety disorder \u2013 mild medical terms for the crippling anxiety that Harkness vividly describes. After an attempted suicide and a breakdown, he began walking and discovered the exhilaration of encountering birds. \u201cOf all the therapies I\u2019ve tried,\u201d he writes, \u201cnothing has had the prolonged and positive impact that birdwatching has.\u201d He spotted that the requirements of birdwatching matched the five ways to wellbeing devised by a project endorsed by the charity Mind: to connect, to take notice, to give, to keep learning and to be active.</p> <p>As Harkness\u2019s profile grew on social media, he decided to write a book, receiving high-profile endorsements, including an incisive foreword by the naturalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-packham\" title=\"\">Chris Packham</a>, who declared it an \u201cexceptional\u201d publication because it would save lives. Eight months on, Harkness recognises that his book has brought positive things: his honesty about mental illness has encouraged others to reciprocate. He has been told by readers that it has indeed saved their lives. Unfortunately, the online platform that enabled him to promote his book also damaged him. \u201cThe more open I was on social media, the less people engaged with me. If you\u2019re already struggling with self-esteem, it is hell to be on it. The only way I could deal with it is not use Twitter any more,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2bad48acd5409ed167abd0bb8148bc0cd41d1bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2bad48acd5409ed167abd0bb8148bc0cd41d1bf/0_398_3978_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tenby in 1895 \u2026 sea-bathing, an upper-class health fad, inspired the first seaside resorts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tenby in 1895 \u2026 sea-bathing, an upper-class health fad, inspired the first seaside resorts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has also shed his illusions about the \u201cguild\u201d of nature writers. He imagined this literary world would be an inclusive salon for the free exchange of ideas about nature and mental health; instead he found a workplace, \u201ca competitive market with a lot of emphasis on product and what you\u2019re selling\u201d, where \u201cpeople become very focused on themselves\u201d. One nature writer, he says, told him that <em>Bird Therapy</em> only sold well because of Packham\u2019s foreword. Harkness, who is a special educational needs co-ordinator working with vulnerable young people, says he is so glad that writing is not his job. His post-book cure has been to remove himself from social media and literary \u201cbackslapping\u201d and simplify his birdwatching regimen. \u201cI don\u2019t drive to birdwatch any more. I walk from my house. I\u2019m under no pressure to see anything exciting. I\u2019ve stopped commodifying it. I just think of being out where I should be. Whenever I do that I\u2019m really thankful for it. Nature is not there to make me feel better. It\u2019s something we can use to help us but ultimately we have to be there for it as well. And we\u2019ve got to make wholesale changes to how we live.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p> <p>Most nature cure books, both literary triumphs and practical manuals, are overwhelmingly about us. Perhaps we should catch more glimpses of other species as we look into the mirror? Mitchell\u2019s <em>The Wild Remedy</em>, a diary of a year with severe depression, throws welcome attention on natural medicines \u2013 the thrilling dash of a sparrowhawk, or the cosy sight of ladybirds clustered together during winter in a knapweed seedhead. She recreates her encounters with other species around her home in Cambridgeshire in paintings, sketches, photographs and cabinets of curiosities. But, she says, \u201cI\u2019m not using my garden and the wood beyond my cottage as a sort of green Tesco, burgling myself some green serotonin and dopamine. It\u2019s much more of a two-way relationship.\u201d Mitchell, like Harkness, initially connected via social media with readers and others who lived with mental illness. She is not always well enough to visit a nearby wood every day. When she does, she monitors, observes and records the wildlife, and relays it to her audience. A biologist by training, Mitchell hopes her writing and art enlighten our increasingly urban society. \u201cI\u2019m trying to use the place where I live as a source of education for people who may not know what cherry plum blossom looks like \u2013 \u2018This is coming into flower, go and see if you\u2019ve got it on your patch,\u2019\u201d she says. Awakening readers to other species around us is a gift to those species, and it is bequeathed by almost every nature cure writer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As humans reshape life on Earth, it\u2019s hazardous to pin our wellbeing on the fragments of non-human life that remain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last summer, an area of flowery meadowland in the wood near Mitchell exploded with life. The hot summer of 2018 must have produced \u201ca metric fucktonne of caterpillars\u201d she laughs: the following year there emerged hundreds of marbled white butterflies. \u201cThe dose of dopamine was just off the scale.\u201d She filmed it for her social media followers. A few days later, in full flower, the meadow was scalped because of fears it contained ragwort, a flower that can in rare cases prove fatal to horses (and which landowners sometimes mistakenly believe they are obliged to control under an arcane \u201cinjurious\u201d weeds law). An exquisite ecosystem was cut down at its peak. Alongside Mitchell\u2019s enjoyment of this meadow emerged a deep connection with it, and a responsibility for it. \u201cMy connection with this land is not as a commodity. This is not skincare I get from a beauty parlour. This is not a monthly subscription to sniff some dead-nettle flowers. This is something that has changed my ability to live with my depression,\u201d she says. In this case, she went into battle with her local council, at some personal cost \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a spokesperson for thousands of invertebrates because they\u2019ve got no voice,\u201d she says \u2013 and succeeded in changing the cutting regime. The meadow won\u2019t be cut again this year until the flowers and invertebrates have finished flowering and flying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c4c2b62f4d67f0132afe0725956f1eea5ff2e4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c4c2b62f4d67f0132afe0725956f1eea5ff2e4c/2543_145_3258_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Emma Mitchell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Emma Mitchell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Pope/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mitchell\u2019s experience also reveals that in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\" title=\"\">Anthropocene</a>, an era in which humans are reshaping all life on Earth, it is hazardous to pin our wellbeing on the fragments of non-human life that remain. Lucy Jones\u2019s <em>Losing Eden</em> is a passionate and thorough exploration of the growing scientific evidence showing why humans require other species to stay well \u2013 from a diversity of microbiota in our guts to a diversity of species in nearby green space. But she is aware that \u201cthe medicalisation of nature\u201d also \u201cdemonstrates that we still see ourselves as takers and overseers, the authority figures, rather than being on an equal footing with the rest of nature\u201d. Just as Mabey wonders if we can extract wellbeing from an environment we are traducing, so Jones considers the 21st-century challenge posed by ecological grief. Is the epidemic of mental illness in wealthy western societies in part because \u201csome part of our spirits [is] afflicted by the mass burglary humanity has committed on the Earth?\u201d Jones writes. \u201cI know that I feel rotten and out of sorts when I am selfish or hurtful to the people around me\u201d. The ecopsychologist and activist Chellis Glendinning diagnosed western culture as suffering from \u201coriginal trauma\u201d caused by our severance from nature and natural cycles. She noted that the symptoms were the same as PTSD: \u201chyperreactions; inappropriate outbursts of anger, psychic numbing; constriction of the emotions; and loss of a sense of control over our destiny\u201d.</p> <p>The Earth is our home and we are making ourselves homeless. Jones quotes the farmer-thinker Wendell Berry: \u201cWe are involved in a kind of lostness in which most people are participating more or less unconsciously in the destruction of the natural world, which is to say, the sources of our own lives.\u201d Perhaps some of our lack of awareness, Jones thinks, is an instinctive denial of death; just as we block out our own mortality, so too we pretend our compulsive consumption is not hastening the premature end of our species\u2019 enjoyment of the planet.</p> <p>As Jones argues, despite all our writing about \u201cnature\u201d, we still lack the language to bring its jeopardy \u2013 our jeopardy \u2013 to the forefront of our troubled minds. Western consumption has made the planet ill, and now we are patients too. Grief and mental illness can be introspective and paralysing or they can inspire action. Which path will we as individuals, societies and as a species choose?</p>",

Its position in what has now been declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic can be attributed to everything from individual missed opportunities for diagnosis and state funding gaps to restrictive federal guidelines for testing.</p> <p>But at the same time, those high numbers can also be attributed to the simple fact that the state diagnosed its first case before the rest of America and was forced to jumpstart its testing and surveillance response.</p> <p>Dr Scott Lindquist, the Washington state epidemiologist for communicable disease, explained that Washington is not at the country\u2019s center of this outbreak, but rather at the \u201cleading edge\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are leading the rest of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are using all our experience\u2026 as they\u2019re finding the same amount of activity in their state.\u201d</p> <p>As of Thursday, state officials have confirmed 457 cases in Washington across 13 counties, including 31 deaths.</p> <p>Following guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), early testing in Washington was done through the CDC and limited to individuals who had symptoms and a travel history to China or contact with a known case. These guidelines have since broadened, allowing academic and corporate labs to conduct testing and healthcare providers to decide who is eligible for the test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af279d52cf9187c3909bca5677c1dcd60a0dd496\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af279d52cf9187c3909bca5677c1dcd60a0dd496/0_24_4943_2968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As of Thursday, state officials have confirmed 457 cases in Washington across 13 counties, including 31 deaths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As of Thursday, state officials have confirmed 457 cases in Washington across 13 counties, including 31 deaths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted S Warren/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Janet Baseman, the associate dean for the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health, said she doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that could have been done differently at the state and local level, as officials were following the federal guidelines. But if there had been more people tested earlier it could have had an important impact on exposure.</p> <p>\u201cWe would have found the cases earlier, and if we would have found the cases earlier, people who tested positive would have been able to take extra precautions to isolate themselves and to possibly keep other people from becoming exposed, thereby limiting transmission,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The University of Washington\u2019s virology lab was one of those spaces that was prepared early to contribute to additional testing. Keith Jerome, the head of the virology division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said developed a test that detects the virus and worked with the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through February to get approval to start testing.</p> <p>But the lab wasn\u2019t able to start until 2 March, after the FDA changed its policy to say labs that have validated tests could begin testing immediately.</p> <p>The University of Washington lab can currently handle about 1,000 samples a day, and by next week may be able to process as many as 4,000 samples. Jerome said they\u2019re working toward being able to test 10,000 samples a day, but also to simply get the word out that there are labs with plenty of capacity for testing.</p> <p>According to the CDC website, between 18 January and 10 March, the highest number of samples collected for testing in a single day was 404.</p> <p>Jerome said right now it\u2019s not a priority to look at how the situation should or could have been handled, since they need to focus on responding to the outbreak at hand. But, in the future, when officials do take a careful look at how the outbreak developed, he said it\u2019s very possible that they\u2019ll determine that more people should have been tested sooner.</p> <p>He said it\u2019s also possible they conclude that \u201cwe should have tapped into the tremendous expertise that certain academic laboratories have in this kind of thing. To kind of keep them out of the response in the early days may not have been the right decision.\u201d</p> <p>But the factor that may have truly solidified the state\u2019s central position in the outbreak of coronavirus in the US was when the infection struck an acute nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, on the outskirts of Seattle.</p> <p>Although most coronavirus infections cause mild symptoms, for people older than 60 years and those with chronic illness or weakened immune systems, it can cause more severe issues.</p> <p>Over the last three weeks, the facility has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-washington-kirkland-life-care-center-deaths\">13 people</a> associated with the center be diagnosed with coronavirus and die. Originally home to 120 residents and 180 employees, the center has now seen those numbers drastically reduced, with 63 residents testing positive for the virus and 66 employees showing symptoms, according to a report released by the facility on Thursday.</p> <p>Washington state\u2019s health department said Saturday that 18 CDC employees had been at the facility, and they along with Seattle and King county public health have provided technical assistance to the center\u2019s staff. The department said it has also provided the facility with an infection control expert, and there is a team of clinicians on site from the US health and human services department.</p> <p>The state\u2019s health department has spent $3.4m on coronavirus response. Lawmakers are currently in the process of approving $200m to go toward fighting the outbreak.</p> <p>Lindquist said the public health system in Washington has been severely underfunded for years. If the funds they\u2019ve requested in the past had been approved and in place at the start of this outbreak, they would have been more prepared to handle it.</p> <p>For example, during the 2019 legislative session, local health partners advocated for $100m in ongoing funding to support activities in such areas as communicable disease. The final budget included $22m in funding, according to the state health department.</p> <p>\u201cI think we would have had more people working here, so we could have processed things with the latest technology instead of having to upgrade as we\u2019re going along in this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have had enough machines to do this, we would have had enough staff to do this, we would have had enough epidemiologists to give help to the counties that were overly burdened.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On 1 September 1991, a large private yacht cruised towards the Statue of Liberty. It was a clear, breezy evening, and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York, a golden sunset could be seen glinting off the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, a party was in flow. Scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and miniskirts, some as young as 14, danced under disco lights. It could have been a high school prom, were it not for the crowd of older men surrounding them.</p> <p>As the evening wore on, some of the men \u2013 many old enough to be the girls\u2019 fathers, or even grandfathers \u2013 joined them on the dancefloor, pressing themselves against the girls. One balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models, leering into a film camera that was documenting the evening: \u201cCan you get some beautiful women around me, please?\u201d</p> <p>The party aboard the Spirit of New York was one of several events that Donald Trump, then 45, attended with a group of 58 aspiring young models that September. They had travelled from around the world to compete in Elite\u2019s Look of the Year competition, an annual event that had been running since 1983 and was already credited with launching the careers of Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen and Stephanie Seymour. At stake was a life-changing prize: a $150,000 contract with the world\u2019s then leading modelling agency, Elite Model Management, run by John Casablancas.</p> <p>Trump was closely involved in Casablancas\u2019s competition. In 1991, he was a headline sponsor, throwing open the Plaza, his lavish, chateau-style hotel overlooking Central Park, transforming it into the main venue and accommodating the young models. He was also one of its 10 judges.</p> <p>In 1992, Trump hosted the competition again. On a similarly golden evening in early September that year, another group of contestants boarded the Spirit of New York, chartered for another Elite cruise. One of the girls on the boat was Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old from a small town outside Toronto. She recalls how the contestants were encouraged to parade downstairs, one by one, and dance for Trump, Casablancas and others. Lee, an introverted teenager who loved to draw but hated school, was in New York for the first time. \u201cA woman at the agency was pushing me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI said to her, \u2018I don\u2019t see why me going down the stairs and dancing in front of those two has anything to do with me becoming a model. And she said, \u2018No, you look great, take off your blazer and go and do it.\u2019 So I walked down the stairs. I didn\u2019t dance \u2013 I blew a kiss at them, spun around and walked away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81/0_256_5364_3219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4/0_225_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht, September 1991. Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</p></li> </ul> <p>Another contestant, who was 15 at the time, also remembers being asked to walk for Trump, Casablancas and other men on the boat in September 1992. She says an organiser told her that if she refused, she would be excluded from the competition. \u201cI knew in my gut it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t being judged or part of the competition \u2013 it was for their entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>While Elite\u2019s official brochure stated that contestants were aged between 14 and 24, all of those the Guardian has spoken to, competing in both years, were aged between 14 and 19. Some had come to New York with parents or chaperones in tow; others were alone. Many were away from their families for the first time. For them, the stakes were high, and the pressure to impress the judges great. As Casablancas had warned them at the outset of the competition, in a scene recorded by TV cameras: \u201cYou are going to be judged, constantly judged.\u201d (In 1991 and 1992, the Elite contest was filmed for a 60-minute glossy television special, featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and later screened on Fox \u2013 an early foray into reality TV.) Casablancas was a powerful figure in the industry, and to many of the new crop of would-be supermodels, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss.</p> <p>Three decades on, a very different picture of the competition is beginning to emerge. Over the last six months, the Guardian has spoken to several dozen former Look of the Year contestants, as well as industry insiders, and obtained 12 hours of previously unseen, behind-the-scenes footage. The stories we have heard suggest that Casablancas, and some of the men in his orbit, used the contest to engage in sexual relationships with vulnerable young models. Some of these allegations amount to sexual harassment, abuse or exploitation of teenage girls; others are more accurately described as rape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5/592_0_2010_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell and John Casablancas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettina Cirone/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1/0_3_2994_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f/318_689_8865_5318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top left: John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale.

Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>No such allegations have been levelled against Trump, who at the time was dating Marla Maples, the woman who in 1993 became his second wife. But his close involvement in the contest raises questions for the president. Did he know that Casablancas and others were sleeping with contestants? Why would a man in his 40s, whose main business was real-estate development, want to host a beauty contest for teenage girls?</p> <p>Journalists have scoured almost every corner of the 45th president\u2019s life, but his friendship with Casablancas, and his involvement in Look of the Year in 1991 and 1992, have been largely overlooked. Yet the competition is more than a footnote in the Donald Trump story. In time, it would prove to be the foundation of his pivot into reality TV. He even married a former Look of the Year contestant: the current first lady, Melania Trump, narrowly missed out on a trip to New York in 1992, after coming second in the Slovenian heat.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When John Casablancas arrived in New York in 1977, aged 35, he quickly caused a stir. Branded \u201cthe snatcher\u201d for poaching models from rivals for his Elite Model Management agency, he gained a reputation as a ruthless operator. Handsome and charismatic, the son of a former Balenciaga model and a wealthy Spanish banker, he formed the agency that became Elite in Paris in his late 20s. Within years of setting up shop in New York, Casablancas was generating millions of dollars in revenue each year, and ushering in the era of the supermodel. Glamorous friends flocked to Elite parties in fashionable clubs like Studio 54.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how Casablancas first met Trump but, according to several former models who encountered him during the 1980s, the businessman became a regular at his parties. With the opening of Trump Tower on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue in 1983, and the acquisition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mar-a-lago\" title=\"\">Mar-a-Lago</a> resort in Florida in 1985, Trump had gained the reputation of a high-flying playboy in his own right. In 1987 he published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Art </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Deal</a>, and a flurry of publicity followed. \u201cHe sits atop a $3 billion empire,\u201d proclaimed the Washington Post, \u201cand seems to have a Midas touch.\u201d</p> <p>It was perhaps unsurprising that Trump, a New York celebrity who liked to date beautiful women, should come to know the city\u2019s best-known model agent. \u201cTrump was good with PR and that was something John liked,\u201d says Jeremie Roux, who now runs System, a modelling agency he cofounded with Casablancas in 2009. \u201cGood or negative press was all good to Trump.\u201d </p> <p>Patty Owen, an Elle and Cosmopolitan cover star, recalls seeing Trump at Elite parties as far back as 1982. \u201cHe would always be at the bar. That\u2019s where he would stay and that\u2019s where all the new models would hang out,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I saw him, I was always like: why does John have to invite him?\u201d Barbara Pilling, also then an Elite model, told us Trump asked her out for dinner in the summer of 1989 at an industry soiree. She recalls Trump asking how old she was. \u201cI said 17 and he said, \u2018That\u2019s just great \u2013 you\u2019re not too old, not too young.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7/0_199_3312_4137/801.jpg\" alt=\"Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082/0_50_844_506/500.jpg\" alt=\"Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit of New York in 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve.

One was Shayna Love, an Australian model who was 16 when she came to New York for the first time in the summer of 1991. Recalling a dinner she attended, she says now: \u201cIt was presented as our duty as models at the agency. It wasn\u2019t an invitation. It was like, you have to go and do this.\u201d She says the dinner she attended, at which 10 or 15 models were present, was served at a long table in a private area of an upmarket restaurant. \u201cI was at one end with John, and Trump was up the other end\u2026 surrounded by the other girls.\u201d</p> <p>In the spring of 1991, Trump and Casablancas struck a business deal. Trump would sponsor Look of the Year\u2019s final and host contestants at the Plaza, which would double as the headquarters. At the time, Trump faced significant financial pressures and was close to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn\u2019t seem to deter him. In the newly unearthed, behind-the-scenes footage of Look of the Year 1991, Trump makes a series of appearances alongside Casablancas, whom he describes as \u201cmy friend John\u201d. At one point, Casablancas reveals how he and Trump struck their business partnership. \u201cI had prepared for a long meeting with Donald Trump to explain to him why this was going to be a great success,\u201d Casablancas tells the crowd. \u201cIn fact, I hadn\u2019t finished my third sentence and he said: \u2018I love the idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump now disputes being friends with Casablancas. The president\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he denies it \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d. Trump, they said, \u201chardly knew him, spent very little time with him, and knew very little about him\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Stacy Wilkes had never been anywhere like the New York Plaza when she arrived at Trump\u2019s hotel with another contestant in September 1991. Then 16, she was living in Louisville, Kentucky, with her mother, who was struggling to make ends meet. The teenager would hold yard sales and mow lawns to make extra cash. \u201cI was just so excited to be in a hotel,\u201d she says. \u201cTo go from a poor part of Kentucky to a place like this \u2013 I felt like the little kid in Home Alone.\u201d She recalls feeling out of place in a hotel where \u201ceverything was gold\u201d.</p> <p>The teenager had been selected as part of a sprawling international search, overseen by Casablancas, for \u201cnew faces\u201d. Many contestants had come through feeder competitions after winning regional heats, or being spotted in malls and hotel lobbies or, in one case, on the beach. Casablancas had visited Wilkes\u2019 local mall to host an Elite scouting event<strong> </strong>a year earlier, when she was 15. Her local agent had sent her to meet him, telling her what to wear and how to act. She says: \u201cI was told to put my hair down in front of my face and then, like, whoop it around and look up at him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Get%20in%20touch&amp;description=Did%20you%20attend%20Elite's%20Look%20of%20the%20Year%20in%20the%201990s%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Did you attend Elite's Look of the Year in the 1990s?

The contestants assembled beneath crystal chandeliers at the Plaza to meet Casablancas. He told them they would be judged over several days ahead of a gala evening, when the winner would be crowned. The girls would undergo makeovers and attend photocalls, donning spandex for an exercise routine in front of the Plaza. The behind-the-scenes footage shows Casablancas informing the would-be models that attention would be paid not just to appearance, but to \u201cthe way you are, your attitude, your personality, your sense of cooperation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d/178_29_809_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FameFlynet.uk.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36/0_416_2999_1799/1000.png\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top, from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.

The 1992 Fox documentary reported that the average age was 15, and the film\u2019s interviews make the youth of many contestants plain. Standing before the judges for the key swimwear round, the aspiring models are asked to tell the panel about themselves. \u201cI sing and love animals,\u201d says one girl, nervously. Another tells the judges: \u201cI like big dogs and chocolate.\u201d Later, during a photoshoot, a photographer instructs a 15-year-old to show more of her cleavage by pulling her bra lower. \u201cMore,\u201d he tells her. \u201cMore. More.\u201d</p> <p>In 1991, there were 10 judges in total, eight of them men, including Trump, Casablancas, the celebrity magician David Copperfield, and the president of Elite\u2019s European division, G\u00e9rald Marie. For the swimwear round, judges including Trump and Casablancas sat at a table in one of the Plaza\u2019s palatial rooms, rating the teenage models. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable, standing there in my bathing suit,\u201d recalls Wilkes. She says that at one stage of the contest the judges said she should lose weight: \u201cIt felt like they were ganging up on me.\u201d</p> <p>The contestant who came third in 1991 was Kate Dillon, then 17. Dillon, who went on to become a successful plus-sized model, says that many of her fellow competitors were \u201cfrom places that were very poor. I came from a family that had means, so it was something fun to do for a week to get out of school \u2013 but a lot of these girls were desperate.\u201d She recalls various \u201cafter-hours\u201d events over the course of the five-day competition. \u201cIt was very clear that there were opportunities to go out and party with Donald,\u201d she says. The contestants were led to believe \u201cthat if you were nice to certain people, good things will happen to you, and I think that\u2019s why girls were going out\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every time we changed, Trump would find a reason to come backstage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The behind-the-scenes footage seen by the Guardian shows brief snippets of the future president mingling with the Look of the Year models. At an evening reception, he seems to play the role of host, moving regally around the Plaza\u2019s ornate rooms in a suit and tie, talking to VIP guests and contestants. \u201cHow\u2019s the Canadian contestants?\u201d he asks, before moving over to a handful of Canadian would-be models and introducing himself. At another point, he circulates on the top deck of the Spirit of New York as the boat prepares to depart. Wearing a billowing cream blazer, pink open-neck shirt and oversized baseball cap, Trump grins while posing for photographs and chatting to several girls. One tells him she is just finishing school.</p> <p>Some former contestants recall him being there as they got dressed for events. \u201cEvery time we changed, it was like Trump would find a reason to come backstage,\u201d Wilkes says. A Canadian contestant from 1992 recalls similar incidents. \u201cHe\u2019d come by and say, \u2018Hey girls, are we ready?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking, what have I got myself into?\u201d Trump denies, \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d, behaving inappropriately with any Look of the Year contestants. His representatives say he was not aware of any predatory environment at the time.</p> <p>Others, however, observed a disturbing side to the contest. Ohad Oman, a young reporter for a magazine in Tel Aviv, was sent to cover it in 1991 and 1992. He attended a number of the after-parties, and remembers seeing girls drinking alcohol. He recalls one particularly debauched party, telling the Guardian: \u201cI saw girls sitting on guys\u2019 laps, and I remember one guy putting his hand down a girl\u2019s top. I remember thinking they were younger than me, and I was 17 going on 18.\u201d (The legal drinking age is 21 in the US.)</p> <p>Others who were present recall underage models being served alcohol at the contest. Trump\u2019s representatives say he did not provide alcohol to contestants, or encourage any models, whether below the drinking age or not, to drink alcohol, stressing he \u201cdoes not drink alcohol and does not encourage others to do so\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b/0_0_1366_820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behind the scenes footage from 'Look of the year'</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</p></li> </ul> <p>The finale of the 1991 competition was a glittering black-tie gala in the Plaza\u2019s ballroom. Casablancas and supermodel Naomi Campbell presented, as 10 finalists went through a series of costume changes, walking across a stage decorated with columns of sunflowers. Trump sat on the front row alongside a roster of celebrities, his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka perched on his knee.</p> <p>Ingrid Seynhaeve, an 18-year-old from Belgium, was crowned the winner. As the evening drew to a close, Seynhaeve was surrounded by photographers. Guests filtered out of the ballroom as a party got going in another of the Plaza\u2019s grand rooms. In the newly uncovered footage, a man can be heard off-camera, saying: \u201cCome on, babes. Let\u2019s get some liquor in you.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the months before and after the contests, Elite sent several of its teenage models to Milan, New York or Paris on assignments, usually by themselves. Shawna Lee, the 14-year-old from Canada who felt pressured to perform on the Spirit of New York in 1992, had spent the previous summer in Paris, working for Elite. She recalls days at castings, and nights out partying, including at the legendary Les Bains Douches nightclub.</p> <p>After one drunken night at the club, one of the first times she had drunk alcohol, she says a senior executive at Elite offered her a ride home on his motorbike. G\u00e9rald Marie, then in his early 40s, was head of Elite\u2019s Paris office, a powerful figure in the fashion industry and a 1991 Look of the Year judge. Lee accepted the offer. \u201cI was like, OK, sure, because I was always relying on whoever to get me home,\u201d she says. But she alleges that, rather than taking her home, Marie brought her to his apartment and told her to come to his bedroom. Lee says she initially refused, asking about his wife. She says Marie responded: \u201cOh no, just come and sleep in the bed with me, don\u2019t worry,\u201d and she relented. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know, I just went.\u201d</p> <p>Lee says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a> has emboldened her to talk about what happened next. It was her first sexual experience. \u201cI just froze,\u201d she says. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Looking back 30 years later, she feels she was taken advantage of. \u201cI just felt really pressured,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really young and I was manipulated.\u201d She told a friend what had happened, and this soon got back to Elite\u2019s agents. \u201cThey all knew something went down, but they downplayed it,\u201d says Lee, who is now 42 and works as a makeup artist in Toronto. \u201cIt was just understood that it was in my best interest to walk away from it and brush it under the rug.\u201d</p> <p>Questions about Marie\u2019s alleged mistreatment of teenage models are not new. In 2000, New York magazine reported that two of Elite\u2019s senior women executives had pleaded with both Casablancas and Marie to <a href=\"https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/columns/citypolitic/1866/\" title=\"\">stop sleeping with underage models</a>, but had been ignored. (\u201cWe are men,\u201d Marie reportedly said. \u201cWe have our needs.\u201d) In 2011, the Elite supermodel and actor Carr\u00e9 Otis alleged that Marie had repeatedly raped her when she was a 17-year-old model in Paris in the 1980s. Two years ago, another Elite model, Ebba Karlsson, accused Marie of raping her when she was 21.</p> <p>Marie did not respond to a formal letter from the Guardian, but in a brief phone call insisted he had never sexually assaulted any models, and denied the specific allegations levelled against him by Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, I don\u2019t know this person,\u201d he said. \u201cAllegations like this are becoming too easy to make. Frankly, it hurts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1/0_18_1975_2468/800.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the competition final in 1991\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final.

Some allegations are contained in legal proceedings filed decades ago; others have been shared for the first time with the Guardian. The newspaper has decided not to publish some of these allegations, at the request of the women involved.</p> <p>One allegation already made public concerns David Copperfield, an associate of both Casablancas and Trump, who judged Look of the Year in 1988 and 1991, and once dated another Elite supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. Two years ago, as the #MeToo movement reverberated through the entertainment industry, he was the subject of allegations by Brittney Lewis, a 17-year-old contestant in the 1988 Look of the Year, held in Japan. According to her account, published on the <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/david-copperfield-accused-drugging-assaulting-17-year-old-model-1988/\" title=\"\">entertainment news website The Wrap</a>, Copperfield invited her to a show in California after she had returned home to Utah. Lewis alleged that she saw Copperfield pour something into her glass and then blanked out, but says she retained hazy recollections of him sexually assaulting her in his hotel room. Copperfield stated on Twitter at the time that he had been \u201cfalsely accused\u201d in the past, and was now having to \u201cweather another storm\u201d. He added: \u201cPlease for everyone\u2019s sake, don\u2019t rush to judgment.\u201d In response to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the alleged assault, his representatives said that the claims were false and seriously defamatory.</p> <p>Several of the 1991 contestants recall Copperfield behaving in a way that now strikes them as inappropriate. Stacy Wilkes says Copperfield called the hotel room she was sharing with another 15-year-old contestant, inviting the other girl to his room. Another remembers translating a phone call from Copperfield into Spanish so he could invite a teenage contestant to his hotel room. Aimee Bendio, who was a 14-year-old Look of the Year contestant in 1991, says Copperfield and his assistant contacted her at her family home several times after she took part in the contest, \u201cchecking in to see how my career was going\u201d. She says the magician invited her to his shows, offering to send a limousine, but she declined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A 14-year-old contestant says Copperfield contacted her family home several times afterwards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f/0_479_9102_5459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca/295_0_1401_1751/800.jpg\" alt=\"Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York in 1991, the year he was a judge</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer.

Copperfield categorically denies behaving inappropriately with any contestants at any time.</p> <p>In the early 90s, Look of the Year contestants who secured modelling contracts with Elite were introduced to a fledgling financial advisory firm, Star Capital Management. It was run by an associate of Casablancas, David Weil. Housed at Elite\u2019s Manhattan offices, and an official sponsor of Look of the Year, Weil\u2019s company advertised its services in the 1991 competition programme with a photograph of a small girl dressed in adult clothing and jewellery, alongside the marketing line: \u201cJust like you, we\u2019re not just another pretty face.\u201d</p> <p>By the following year, Star Capital Management was handling millions of dollars earned by Elite\u2019s models. The business soon caught the attention of federal authorities, who later accused Weil and his business partner of stealing at least $1.2m from their clients. In 1998, Weil pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. He also pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 15-year-old model he had met at Look of the Year in 1992.</p> <p>Weil was sentenced to serve weekends in prison for three months, and required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Mark Lawless, a New York lawyer who brought a civil fraud case against Star Capital Management on behalf of the 1991 Look of the Year winner Ingrid Seynhaeve and others, says that when he inspected its office, he found an adjoining bedroom. One of the desk\u2019s drawers, he recalls, contained \u201cbullets and condoms\u201d. Weil declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.</p> <p>Four years after Weil\u2019s conviction, in 2002, Casablancas faced his own set of accusations in the civil courts. A former Look of the Year contestant, known only as Jane Doe 44, filed a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73174/strokes-singers-dad-named-in-sex-abuse-suit\" title=\"\">accusing him of repeatedly sexually abusing her</a>, beginning when she was 15. The abuse began, according to the lawsuit, at Look of the Year 1988 in Japan, where Casablancas told Doe he was \u201cfalling in love\u201d with her. At the end of the competition, the lawsuit states, \u201ccontestants drank and partied late into the evening\u201d and Casablancas told the teenager to come to his hotel room. There, Casablancas sexually abused the girl \u201cseveral times over the evening\u201d. The abuse allegedly continued the following year; when the girl became pregnant, Casablancas told her \u201cshe would be having an abortion\u201d. The abortion was allegedly \u201carranged and paid for\u201d by Elite. Casablancas was 46 at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848/157_245_1343_1678/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant <br><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant. Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>The lawsuit also alleged that Casablancas \u201cengaged in a pattern of seducing, sexually exploiting and/or abusing minor girls, including girls as young as 14 or 15 years old\u201d. But in 2003, the Los Angeles superior court dismissed the claims against him because he did not live in California, where it had been filed. At the time, a lawyer for Casablancas said the allegations were without merit.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s representatives have told the Guardian he denies in the strongest possible terms having any knowledge at the time that Casablancas allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with Look of the Year contestants, including those who were under the age of consent, or that Casablancas allegedly enabled others to exploit or abuse teenage models.</p> <p>But Casablancas\u2019 sexual interest in teenage girls predated this period. His marriage to his second wife, Danish model Jeanette Christiansen, ended in 1983 when it emerged that he was having an affair with a 15-year-old model, Stephanie Seymour. Casablancas, who was in his early 40s at the time, later described Seymour as a \u201cwoman-child\u201d. He met his third wife, Brazilian model Aline Wermelinger, in 1992, when she was a Look of the Year contestant staying at Trump\u2019s Plaza. They married the following year; Casablancas was 51 and she was 17.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>By his own account, Donald Trump got to know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\" title=\"\">financier Jeffrey Epstein</a> in the late 1980s. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with,\u201d Trump famously told New York magazine in 2002. \u201cIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d After Epstein was charged with the sex trafficking of underage girls last year, the president distanced himself, telling reporters he knew the financier \u201clike everybody in Palm Beach knew him\u201d, but hadn\u2019t spoken to him in 15 years. \u201cI was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he had \u201ckicked Mr Epstein out\u201d of Mar-a-Lago for acting inappropriately towards staff.</p> <p>Photographs of Trump with Epstein, who owned a house near Mar-a-Lago, were widely circulated in the wake of the financier\u2019s arrest last year. Renewed attention was also given to a deposition by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was first approached by Epstein\u2019s friend, the British socialite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/ghislaine-maxwell-woman-accused-jeffrey-epstein-groom-girls\" title=\"\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 1999.</p> <p>It also appears that Epstein had a Casablancas connection during the 1990s. According to a lawsuit filed in the US three months ago, in 1990 Casablancas sent a teenage model for her first \u201ccasting call\u201d at a residential address on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, to meet a \u201cphotographer\u201d who, it turned out, was Epstein. The lawsuit states that Epstein ordered the 15-year-old girl to undress before taking photographs of her, pushing her against a wall and sexually assaulting her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

Houraney says that Trump asked him to organise a party that month with some of his pageant\u2019s finalists, promising to invite heads of modelling agencies and prospective sponsors for his competition. \u201cHe had me fly in all these girls, and gave me a $30,000 budget for airfares and limos to pick them up at the airport,\u201d he says. \u201cThe girls were all decked out, expecting to meet all these VIPs.\u201d But after an hour at the party, Houraney says, there seemed to be only one other guest: Epstein. \u201cI was like, \u2018Donald, where are the guys? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019\u201d Houraney says he realised \u201cthis is a Jeff Epstein party, basically\u201d.</p> <p>While suspicious of Epstein, Houraney was keen to have Trump as a business partner. A month earlier, in December 1992, Trump had met with Houraney and Jill Harth, who ran the pageant together. They were looking for a new sponsor for their contest, which each year saw models aged 16 to 22 compete to appear in wall calendars wearing bikinis and swimsuits while posing with classic cars. At dinner in the Plaza\u2019s Oak Room, Harth, Houraney and Trump discussed moving the American Dream competition from Las Vegas to one of Trump\u2019s casinos. \u201cHe wanted to build this into the biggest, the best thing that he could do. He was talking about television and pulling out all the contacts,\u201d Harth later said. Eventually, the pageant was held at Trump Castle in Atlantic City in November 1993, but for one year only.</p> <p>The partnership soured and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\" title=\"\">ended in two lawsuits</a>, but for Trump it was a prelude to a series of more lucrative ventures in the beauty business. In 1996, he secured what the New York Daily News described as \u201chis most beautiful deal yet\u201d. After months of negotiations, Trump acquired the Miss Universe Organization in a reported $10m deal that handed him control of three large, well-established pageants: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. Three years later, he founded Trump Model Management, poaching many staff from Elite.</p> <p>For Wolfgang Schwarz, a veteran model agent in Austria who worked closely with Casablancas, and met Trump at the Plaza in the early 90s, Trump\u2019s decision to establish his own agency was about him wanting his own private source for models. \u201cIf you have your own agency and you\u2019re the owner, you can tell your bookers to make a party,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier than calling 15 agencies in New York.\u201d Trump\u2019s representatives say he entered the modelling industry because it was a \u201cvery profitable\u201d business opportunity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3/0_16_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346/26_0_2723_3402/800.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Kate Dillon, in behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 contest</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14. Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>The Miss Universe deal allowed Trump to realise his ambition of turning a pageant into an international televised event. In 1997, he <a href=\"https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/cbs-trump-ink-beauty-of-a-partnership-1117433243/\" title=\"\">sold a 50% stake in the business to CBS</a>. Five years later, amid a slump in the Miss Universe ratings, Trump brokered a deal with NBC that led to the launch of The Apprentice in 2004.</p> <p>The move into reality TV positioned Trump as a heavyweight tycoon with a significant media profile. In many ways, it was a natural progression from his involvement in beauty contests and pageants. Where once he had judged young models, whose hopes, rivalries and insecurities became TV storylines in Fox\u2019s Look of the Year documentary, now he was ruthlessly separating aspiring business people into winners and losers. </p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Three decades on from the contests at Trump\u2019s Plaza, it is striking to reflect on the diverging fortunes of those who attended. Many of the powerful men Casablancas brought on board to help judge the girls thrived in the years that followed. G\u00e9rald Marie is now the chairman of a prestigious model agency in Paris, Oui Management. Although Marie told the Guardian he had retired, his LinkedIn page lists his responsibilities at the \u201cthriving newcomer\u201d agency as scouting for and managing talent. Oui Management did not respond to our request for comment.<strong> </strong>David Copperfield remains a prominent entertainer, with a current residency at the MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas.</p> <p>The fortunes of the teenagers who took part have been mixed. Some became successful models, Hollywood actors and TV hosts, while many more lived quieter lives. Ingrid Seynhaeve, the 1991 winner, became a face of Ralph Lauren and Dior, hosted Belgium\u2019s Topmodel TV show, and continues to front high-profile campaigns. Other contestants we spoke to include a beautician, a stay\u2013at\u2013home mother, a makeup artist, a yoga teacher and a bus driver.</p> <p>In 1992, the crown went to one of Look of the Year\u2019s youngest contenders: 14-year-old Mariann Molski. Months after her victory, a profile in the Chicago Tribune reported that the sporty high school student was \u201con the brink of a career of a kind that most young women only dream about\u201d. While she had some success as a model, it is not clear what happened to her in the years that followed; US public records indicate multiple arrests for probation violations, alcohol offences and prostitution, though there is nothing to say she was ever charged. Molski\u2019s current whereabouts are unknown, but she is believed to have been homeless in Arizona.</p> <p>After years of financial mismanagement, Elite was forced into bankruptcy in 2004. The Elite brand continues to be used by two separate agencies, owned by different corporate entities. One is Creative World Management, which bought the New York division in 2004. It strongly distances itself from the Casablancas-owned firm and era, saying it \u201cutterly\u201d condemns the kinds of \u201cdeplorable behaviour\u201d alleged to have taken place in the past.</p> <p>The other inheritor of the brand is Elite World Group, which operates the successor to Look of the Year, a similar global contest for the next top young model, called <a href=\"https://elitemodellook.com/int/en/home/index.htm\" title=\"\">Elite Model Look</a>. It, too, distances itself from the Casablancas era. \u201cWe would have no tolerance for the conduct you\u2019ve described,\u201d the company told the Guardian. \u201cEmpowering our models and protecting their safety is our foremost priority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e/93_299_8923_5358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af/0_534_8907_5344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year</p></li> </ul> <p>John Casablancas retired in Brazil in the early 2000s.

He never got to see his old associate Donald Trump ascend to the White House, despite a cascade of allegations about Trump\u2019s own treatment of women. There are now <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T\">at least 25 sexual misconduct allegations</a> against the president, ranging from unwanted advances and harassment to serious sexual assaults. More than half relate to models or pageant contestants. Trump denies that he has ever behaved in a predatory or inappropriate fashion with any women or girls. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian 30 years on, several former Look of the Year contestants feel that a #MeToo moment for the modelling world is long overdue. \u201cThe girls are young and they look at these agents like parental figures, and they\u2019re not,\u201d says Shawna Lee. \u201cAnything they say goes, whether it\u2019s \u2018Go cut your hair\u2019, \u2018Go wear this dress\u2019. It\u2019s too bad that there were not more consequences for these men.\u201d</p> <p>After Look of the Year 1991, Stacy Wilkes returned to Louisville and quit school, despite having told the judges she would finish. \u201cI thought that was the reason I lost,\u201d she says, \u201cso I might as well leave if I want to make it as a model. We were really broke, so I thought I\u2019d try and make money for my mom, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d She is content with the path her life took, living in Louisville with her partner and three cats, but adds that women were raising concerns at the time and were ignored: \u201cI think models from the 90s tried so hard, over and over, and nobody believed what we had to say.\u201d</p> <p>Kate Dillon, now a businesswoman living in Seattle, remembers the contest as one that \u201cexploited women\u2019s assets, women\u2019s bodies. A lot of these girls were desperate. They thought modelling was about attracting men, which it isn\u2019t.\u201d There was a climate of opportunism, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the men were like, \u2018Yes, Look of the Year week, let\u2019s make sure my schedule is clear to have chicks over to my apartment.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great is that we now have a language, and a precedent of young people saying: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to let this continue\u2019,\u201d Dillon adds. \u201cThey would never accept being treated the way I was.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p><em>The Guardian will continue to investigate the issues raised in this story.

  "<p>It was just before 9am and the sky was overcast when a small group of reporters were suddenly ushered through the White House\u2019s south portico. They gathered in <a href=\"http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/diplomatic-room.htm\">the diplomatic reception room,</a> once home to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfireside chats\u201d, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn \u2013 more than three times what the president himself had requested \u2013 and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing very well,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut it\u2019s an unforeseen problem. What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: \u201cHow do you keep people from panicking?\u201d Trump\u2019s response in part: \u201cCalm. You have to be calm. It\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p> \n<p>It has not gone away.</p> \n<p>A week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths. The stock market suffered its worst percentage drop since the 1987 Wall Street crash. On Wednesday night alone, Trump announced a travel ban on most of Europe during an Oval Office address, the National Basketball Association suspended its season and it emerged the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson had tested positive. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-401d8f45-603c-4491-9c4b-8c27d14f3a4b.html?chunk=0&amp;utm_term=emshare#story0\">The New York Post\u2019s front page headline</a> declared: A world turned upside down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is at such moments of peril that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/president-leadership-crisis.html\">a nation looks to its leader</a> for reassurance and direction.

The NSC\u2019s global health security chief, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, was fired the day after an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year intelligence agencies warned that the US remained vulnerable to the next flu pandemic but Trump, it seems, hoped that his long streak of political luck would hold.</p> \n<p>Distracted by impeachment in January, the president showed little urgency when the coronavirus exploded in China, apparently unwilling to sour his relationship with authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, whom he praised for having the outbreak \u201ctotally under control\u201d even as it raced across that country and beyond.</p> \n<p>The White House did impose a limited travel ban on China but that alone was not enough. Former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166\">told the Politico website:</a> \u201cThey needed and still need to be searching for where the cases are, instead of trusting that limited travel bans were keeping out a virus that was probably already on the march.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/us_travel_ban_countries/giv-3902kxaGVtNaHNHJ/\" data-alt=\"travel ban\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/us_travel_ban_countries/giv-3902kxaGVtNaHNHJ/\">travel ban</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps Trump\u2019s greatest blunder was <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/question-cdc-who-no-coronavirus-testing-965279/\">turning down</a> the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization and taken up by many countries. The US government\u2019s own painfully slow progress led to a nationwide shortage of test kits at the most critical moment. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxReports/status/1238121576555577346?s=20\">It was reported</a> that just 11,000 tests have been conducted in America so far, whereas South Korea is carrying out 10,000 tests per day.</p> \n<p>Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/u-s-coronavirus-response-was-marked-by-overconfidence-delays?sref=Ptu9QECN\">told the Bloomberg news agency:</a> \u201cThis is an unmitigated disaster that the administration has brought upon the population, and I don\u2019t say this lightly. We have had a much worse response than Iran, than Italy, than China and South Korea.\u201d</p> \n<p>It seems that Trump only began to take the issue seriously two weeks ago when he saw a 1,000-point drop on Wall Street. Even then, he urged aides, including Kellyanne Conway and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to go on television and preach confidence, according to five White House officials and Republicans <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-11/analysis-facing-virus-outbreak-trumps-tactics-fall-short\">interviewed by the Associated Press.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"538cecca-7ee7-4bb8-bf40-77cbda8b4dd3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W8Py8qaAV4M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was \u201cvery much under control\u201d and infections were \u201cgoing very substantially down, not up\u201d. On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be \u201cclose to zero\u201d.</p> \n<p>He also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as \u201ctheir new hoax\u201d, promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">usual playbook of deny and distract</a> proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Robert Shrum,</a> a Democratic strategist and political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cBefore it happened, he dismantled a lot of the preparedness that had been put in place under Obama and Ron Klain [Ebola czar] and Joe Biden, I suppose because they were things Obama had done so he wanted to get rid of them, like the Paris climate accords.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd since then he has over and over again contradicted his own health people and at one point tried to muzzle them. He called the coronavirus \u2018a Democratic hoax\u2019 and then they ran out to explain, \u2018No, no, the hoax was that they were blaming Trump for not handling it well\u2019. Well, I think almost universally people would say Trump has not handled this well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if Trump tried to dismiss the health statistics, he could not ignore the financial markets, an obsession he has made central to his reelection. He put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of a coronavirus task force, demoting Health Secretary Alex Azar, but continued to get in the way of the message.</p> \n<p>Soon after signing the congressional funding bill last Friday, Trump donned a \u201cKeep America great\u201d campaign cap and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/us-coronavirus-death-toll-washington-state\">visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> in Atlanta. In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a \u201csnake\u201d, praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this.</p> \n<p>But on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single worst day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person.</p> \n<p>Trump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government\u2019s top public health experts, testified: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RapD4-7uAbg\">\u201cBottom line, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d</a></p> \n<p>The president tried to provide further reassurance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">only his second Oval Office address</a> on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the \u201cforeign virus\u201d. He also failed to explain how tests will become available and committed factual errors the White House was forced to hastily correct.</p> \n<p>Susan Rice, former national security adviser, tweeted simply: \u201cOMG.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eight months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">from a presidential election,</a> the virus has jeopardised Trump\u2019s central reelection argument \u2013 a strong economy \u2013 just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage by offering stability and a safe pair of hands.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThe most calming and reassuring presidential voice of the past 24 hours has been Joe Biden.

  "<p>As Ronald and Eva Weissberger boarded the cruise ship bound for Hawaii, the couple were looking forward to the trip of a lifetime.</p> <p>The Weissbergers, the 74- and 69-year-olds from Florida, had heard stories about the boat\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan and ultimately resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">more than 700 </a>confirmed cases of coronavirus.

It has also become a potent symbol for everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">America\u2019s woeful lack of test kits</a>, which had to be flown in by helicopter, to the racial politics of who will shoulder the burden of the outbreak.</p> <p>Between the boat\u2019s departure and its return, the nation\u2019s handling of the virus would shift entirely. The World Health Organization declared the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">outbreak a pandemic</a>. Markets tumbled.

The finding suggests an infected person may have traveled from Washington to California and had contact with the someone who boarded the ship.</p> <p>What is certain, however, is that the 75-old-year old Placer county man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on 4 March \u2013 the first death in California attributed to the virus.</p> <p>About 60 passengers who traveled with him to Mexico stayed on the ship\u2019s next journey to Hawaii, mixing with other passengers.</p> <p>Passengers had little reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary until the ship slowly started canceling events: first, the shows that drew large crowds, then the smaller events like music or dancing lessons that keep passengers busy at sea.</p> <p>The morning of 4 March, the same day the Placer county man died at a hospital, Grand Princess officials told the 60 passengers who traveled with him they\u2019d need to stay in their rooms until they could be screened for symptoms.</p> <p>Still, most were allowed to carry on, catching sun on the Lido deck and visiting with their shipmates.</p> <p>The elderly Weissbergers were playing cards with friends when news of the potential outbreak reached their daughter and son-in-law back in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cWe called [the Weissbergers] and asked if they were quarantined,\u201d said son-in-law Chalik, an attorney who has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/grand-princess-cruise-coronavirus-lawsuit\">in a lawsuit filed</a> on the couple\u2019s behalf, accusing the Princess Cruises of gross negligence for its \u201clackadaisical\u201d response to the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018No, we\u2019re playing bridge\u2019,\u201d Chalik recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it.

But still to overcome was was the colossal task of moving thousands of passengers, an untold number of whom had been infected, off the boat and onto buses, where they\u2019d be transported to hospitals, hotels or military bases for 14 days of quarantine.</p> <p>On Monday morning, just before the Grand Princess pulled in, trucks rumbled to and from the docks along the shoreline like any other day. Four large private passenger buses waited to transport the possibly-infected passengers.</p> <p>Passengers disembarked by order of priority, those with acute medical needs first. Officials said it could take up to three days to unload everybody. But by Friday, five days after the Grand Princess first docked, 14 international passengers still remained on board. Officials said they\u2019d be there at least through the weekend while their home countries arranged transportation.</p> <p>The boat\u2019s 1,000-plus crew is expected to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-infected-crew-members-kept-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-2020-3\">remain on board </a>under quarantine while officials determine a place to dock for good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Munsch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Quarantine issues emerge</h2> <p>Prince Cruises declined to be interviewed for this story, saying that currently \u201call team members are focused on the situation at hand and the well-being of our guests\u201d.</p> <p>But complaints quickly started mounting from passengers concerned that recommended <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html\">quarantine protocols</a> weren\u2019t being followed.

There were no hand-washing stations available in the food areas and the passengers had to serve themselves coffee using their bare hands on the coffee dispenser, she said.</p> <p>On 10 March, the day the Grand Princess first reached Oakland, passengers received an official document under their cabin doors that read: \u201cOnce you arrive at the military installation, you may choose to be tested for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>But Morse said that when she and her husband asked to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday, they were told no tests were available.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not testing us.

Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing.</p> \n  <p>But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6c28268f085e564ad83ece\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T00:44:46.728Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New Zealand cancels Christchurch shootings remembrance service</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a pragmatic decision.

From Monday, mass-gatherings of more than 500 people will banned, but will not include schools and universities.</p> \n  <p>Until Friday Morrison insisted he would go to the football to see the Shark\u2019s first NRL match, drawing criticism from his opponents and some public health workers. Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers.</p> \n   <p>Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well. But as soon as that advice was clear, I thought it was a gobsmacking lack of judgement for <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> to continue to go to the football, sending a terrible signal and message to the Australian people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Australia\u2019s home affairs minister<strong> Peter Dutton</strong> being tested with coronavirus, Bowen said; \u201cWe wish him the best, this is not a pleasant disease\u201d.

Clearly, where there\u2019s been an outbreak in... the school it\u2019s appropriate that certain schools will be put into quarantine during that time. However, as we get deeper into the evolving pandemic response and effects, we will have to work with the best possible evidence.

Matches this weekend will continue to take place, but without spectators.</p> \n  <p>This morning at a regular press conference which the head of the Robert Koch Institute, the leading public health and safety body in Germany has been holding for the past two and a half weeks, its director, Lothar Wieler said public health bodies had three aims in their attempts to tackle the virus. </p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>To try to \u2018level off\u2019 the epidemic curve, to ensure the most seriously ill don\u2019t end up having to be hospitalised at the same time.</li> \n   <li>To try to speed up the adaptation of hospitals to cope with an increase in intensive care beds and patients who will need respiratory assistance. He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system.</li> \n   <li>To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels.</p> \n  <p>Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. </p> \n  <p>One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b72be8f088d7575592b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:49:21.690Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports <strong>Rory Carroll</strong> in Dublin.<br></p> \n  <p>An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">announced restrictions on Thursday</a>.

It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. </p> \n  <p>The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East. A German tourist transferred from Luxor to a hospital in the resort town Hurghada died last Sunday from the virus. </p> \n  <p>The outbreak in Mansoura shows that the virus is spreading inside Egypt. \u201cThe 13 new coronavirus cases include six who showed no symptoms and had contracted the virus after coming into contact with people who previously tested positive,\u201d said government-owned outlet Al-Ahram.</p> \n  <p>Egypt\u2019s health ministry continued to update the number of official cases, but has not regularly named the location of infections. The country\u2019s minister for education announced earlier this week that schools were banned from trips in the governorates of Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada due to outbreaks of the virus. </p> \n  <p>The ministry also announced that a school in the central district of Zamalek would close and parents and teachers self-isolate for a fortnight \u201cas a precautionary measure, after a parent of one of the school students was in contact with a foreigner who tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>As the disease shows signs of spreading, some in Cairo attempted to retain a sense of business as usual even as Egypt was battered by a freak storm forcing many to stay indoors.

Helicopters were previously used.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of drones is more precise; it also increases feasibility, and reduces eradication costs of invasive rodents in small and mid-size islands worldwide,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ectech.co.nz/post/drones-used-in-fight-against-invasive-rats-in-the-galapagos-islands\">Campbell said.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/we-used-to-be-leaders-the-collapse-of-new-zealands-landmark-ocean-park\">\u2018We used to be leaders\u2019: the collapse of New Zealand\u2019s landmark ocean park</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The successful eradication of the rat invasion on the Galapagos <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47071513\">is thought to be a world first.</a></p> <p>Using knowledge gained in the Galapagos project, Sam Vye of ECT said the potential for drones in the conservation arena was \u201cexciting\u201d; though he ruled out weaponising the machines for armed pest extermination from the sky.</p> <p>\u201cNew Zealand\u2019s environment has extreme terrain and vegetation type and can be extremely dangerous for people on the ground to lay bait stations,\u201d Vye said. \u201cUsing a drone we can actually fly in slightly more dangerous conditions than a manned helicopter, including to remote islands which are expensive for helicopters to get to. Compared to a manned helicopter, it also comes down to the precision and the placement of baits.\u201d</p> <p>The drone being developed for use in the New Zealand back country will be able to carry up to 170kg of bait. It requires only a drone pilot on the ground and an office worker to control it.</p> <p>So far the government has totally eradicated introduced pests from 117 offshore islands, and is now focusing its attention on the mainland.</p> <p>The drone trial will run over the next two years and involve three phased stages of testing.</p>",

On Friday he paraded a series of major US companies entering into a public-private partnership in order to fix the shortfall.</p> \n<p>Trump said his team expected \u201chalf a million additional tests will be available early next week which will bring probably 1.4m tests next week and 5m in a month. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>He could not resist adding: \u201cOur overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don\u2019t want everybody taking this test. It\u2019s totally unnecessary. This will pass.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump chose not to adopt a German-made test approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) but when questioned by reporters he refused to take the blame for the US now having to play catch-up.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is redesign it very quickly with the help of the people around me \u2026 We\u2019ll have the ability to do millions over a quick period of time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The US military said later on Friday that it would halt all domestic travel, with some exceptions, for service members, defense department civilians and their families amid the fast-spreading coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The memo, signed by defense deputy secretary David Norquist, said the policy would go into effect on Monday through 11 May.</p> \n<p>It added that exceptions could be granted for mission essential travel, travel necessary for humanitarian reasons, and travel warranted due to extreme hardship.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump also announced that he would waive interest on all student loans held by government agencies until further notice and was buying big quantities of crude oil for storage in the US strategic reserve.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to fill it up,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The vice-president, Mike Pence; Dr Anthony Fauci; the health secretary, Alex Azar; and other members of the coronavirus taskforce stood behind Trump.

There will be \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing centres<strong> </strong>in car parks at CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens stores.</p> \n<p>Democrats welcomed the declaration. Chuck Schumer, minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased the president heeded our calls to invoke the Stafford Act to extend vital financial assistance to help keep communities safe from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he added: \u201cAs other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>As coronavirus legislation negotiations continued on Capitol Hill, Trump said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think the Democrats are giving enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>Early on Saturday, the House overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package that would provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices.</p> \n<p>By a bipartisan vote of 363 to 40, the Democratic-controlled House passed the multi-billion dollar effort that would expand safety-net programs to help those who could be thrown out of work in the weeks to come.</p> \n<p>The 110-page bill is the product of extensive negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

We need to anticipate significant increases in hospital admissions, which means that we will need more ICU units and ventilators, we will need more doctors, nurses, and medical personnel of all kinds - and we must make sure that these frontline personnel are well protected from the diseases they are treating. I have talked to nurses recently who worry very much about whether they are getting the kind of knowledge and equipment they need so that they do not get sick.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We need to significantly improve our communications and collaboration with other countries to ensure that we are learning everything that we can about the successes and failures of other countries as they deal with this crisis. And furthermore, we must be honest with the American people and communicate as effectively and directly as we can with all of the scientific information that we can provide.</em><em>Further, and most importantly, our response to this entire crisis must be guided by the decisions of doctors, scientists, and researchers, not politicians. </em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And then Sanders pivoted to his signature issue, healthcare. He argued that the crisis is a reason the country needs to adopt Medicare for All. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>But as we struggle with this crisis, it is also important that we learn the lessons of how we got to where we are today, and what we must do in the future so that we are better prepared for similar crises that may come. </em><em>Poll after poll already shows us that the American people understand that we must do what every other major country on earth does, and that is to guarantee healthcare to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege. As we begin to see the failures and vulnerabilities of the current healthcare system, my guess is that those numbers and the demand for universal healthcare will only go up.</em> </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6bf1d88f088d75755931cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/max-benwell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T20:54:45.674Z\">8.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the <strong>unsettling moment Trump hit out at PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor</strong>, after she asked him about his <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/\">closure of the White House\u2019s pandemic response team in 2018</a>:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1238569990481162240\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Q: What responsibility do you take for disbanding the White House pandemic office<br><br>Trump: \u201cit's a nasty question ... we saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.

Booker and Harris have since dropped out and endorsed Biden.<br></p> \n  <p>The CBC as a whole is not officially endorsing a candidate, Bass said, but the majority of members have already announced support for Biden.</p> \n  <p>Although Biden has strong support within the African American community, especially among older voters, concerns have been raised about his ability to energize young and progressive voters.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs this race settles down, it is my job personally and the job of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to be extremely clear with people in our districts what is at stake here, and what is at stake is their future,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job that we\u2019ve all been doing over the last 3 1/2 years, but we have to step it up.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Asked whether Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard should drop out of the race to unite the party before the Democratic National Convention, Bass said she believes the primary process needs to run its course and allow every voter the chance to weigh in.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI would never be in a position to say, \u2018You need to drop out,\u2019\u201d Bass said. \u201cI do think, though, that math is math.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b73788f085c6327bbf37e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:51:22.103Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was on CBS This Morning talking about the coronavirus, and particularly about the availability - or lack of - testing kits in the US.
