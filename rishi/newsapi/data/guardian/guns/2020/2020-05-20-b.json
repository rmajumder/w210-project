That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June</strong>, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address.</li> \n   <li><strong>France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system</strong>, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures</strong>. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. </li> \n   <li><strong>Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees</strong> who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan</strong>. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d</strong>.

opponents, academics and health workers have demanded greater transparency over Covid-19 death tolls, writes <strong>Charis McGowan</strong> in Santiago.</p> \n  <p>With 53,617 confirmed cases of infection, Chile has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in South America. </p> \n  <p>With a case-fatality rate of around 1% (totalling 544), Chile\u2019s Health Ministry has pointed out that the country has achieved one of the lowest fatality rates among the OECD nations, well below the global average of 6.8%.</p> \n  <p>However, a document published last week from the Civil Register revealed 4,201 deaths in caused by \u201crespiratory disease\u201d between 3 March and 29 April. </p> \n  <p>Compared to data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), this would indicate a 57.2% increase in respiratory deaths from the year before, suggesting that this year\u2019s excess of 2,000+ respiratory-related deaths could be related to the novel coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The information, tweeted by investigative journalist and scholar Alejandra Matus, sparked a frenzy of comment on social media.</p> \n  <p>Within hours of the post going viral, the Health Ministry clarified that numbers confirmed by the Department of Health Statistics and Information totalled 1,949 respiratory-related deaths from March to May, an 8% increase to the year before.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEach institution maintains its responsibilities within the scope of its competence,\u201d said the Health Ministry in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cThe Health Ministry maintains the

Amnesty said the refugees\u2019 lives are at immediate risk, as the Bay of Bengal, where some boats were recently rescued, is facing its biggest storm for decades.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s thought that some of the boats are carrying refugees attempting to flee the desperate conditions in Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, where 1 million Rohingya refugees have sheltered for years after fleeing persecution in Myanmar.</p> \n  <p>The location of the boats is not known, though last week it was reported that at least two vessels carrying Rohingya were believed to have been spotted off the coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey are in rickety boats, these are fishing trawlers that they use to take a very dangerous route in the hope of a better life.

The UN has offered to conduct a risk assessment of the island prior to any refugees being relocated, but this is yet to happen.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, authorities in Bangladesh said the 306 Rohingya who remain on the island have been taken to cyclone centres.

Thank you for following along \u2013 and, always, to those of you who reached out on Twitter and via email. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019. </strong>The US president told reporters at a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting-17/\">cabinet meeting</a> that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/singapore-sentences-man-to-death-via-zoom-call\">Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call</a>. </strong>A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state\u2019s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus. </strong>UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. </strong>Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. </strong>Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019. </strong>Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">\u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d</a>. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

They often use GPS to track people\u2019s location, which Apple and Google are omitting from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.</p> <p>Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants\u2019 privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.</p> <p>The companies said they\u2019re not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic \u201cexposure notification\u201d system can augment that process and slow the spread of Covid-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren\u2019t yet showing symptoms.</p> <p>The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently. The software will be downloadable on most Androids and iPhone models released since September 2015.</p> <p>\u201cUser adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,\u201d the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.</p> <p>The companies said the new technology \u2013 the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants \u2013 solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone\u2019s battery.</p> <p>The statement on Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.</p> <p>\u201cWe invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,\u201d said North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, a Republican.</p> <p>North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other US states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.</p> <p>Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota\u2019s app, said on Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps \u2013 his model, to help public health workers track where Covid-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.</p>",

With the match there for the taking, Ferdinand shoots straight at James, who made himself big, closed the angle, and sprawled bravely at his feet ... but despite all that should never have been allowed to make the save.

But now, after picking up just four points from the last 15 on offer, their advantage has been frittered away, and now they\u2019re three points behind Alex Ferguson\u2019s men. They\u2019ve still got two games in hand, but the margin of error is slight now. They have to convert the contents of their back pocket into points on the board. </p> <p><strong>They could very much do with a result here tonight at Anfield. </strong>That\u2019s far from a pipe dream: they beat Liverpool 2-1 at St James\u2019 Park back in November, then won at Anfield in the League Cup a few weeks later, Steve Watson the unlikely goalscoring hero on both occasions. They look to have Liverpool\u2019s number, and will be hoping to make it three out of three tonight, hauling themselves level with the leaders. That\u2019d put them second on goal difference with a game still in hand, their dream still very much alive.</p> <p><strong>But defeat tonight would be unthinkable. </strong>Liverpool responded marvellously to that League Cup defeat, going on a 20-game unbeaten run that ended only two weekends ago at Nottingham Forest. They immediately got back on the horse with a 3-0 evisceration of Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals last weekend, and are high on life right now. They\u2019re also still on the fringes of the title race, eight points behind Manchester United in third. A win tonight would keep their faint hopes alive. But they do need all three points, or it\u2019s pretty much all over for them.</p> <p><strong>Newcastle by contrast simply need to avoid defeat.</strong> A win would be lovely, naturally, but a point at Anfield isn\u2019t to be sniffed at, and would at least ensure they\u2019d still be in control of their own destiny. With the Toon desperate to end their 69-year wait for the league title, and Liverpool drinking in the last-chance saloon, this is effectively a winner-takes-all gunfight. It\u2019s Wednesday evening!

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Record number of tests conducted</strong></p> \n  <p>A record 177,216 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. The figures were announced after Johnson restated his ambition to get the daily total up to 200,000 by the end of this month. The figures have often been criticised as misleading. Statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website show that although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests to see if people have had the disease. These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK death toll rises by 363</strong></p> \n  <p>A further 363 Covid-19 deaths were announced in the UK, taking the total to 35,704. The number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</p> \n  <p><strong>Government wants tourism to resume in July</strong></p> \n  <p>The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government plans to allow tourism to begin in July. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefin he said: \u201cI would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We\u2019ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. Dowden also announced plans to up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</p> \n  <p><strong>Bereavement scheme extended</strong></p> \n  <p>The government has bowed to pressure to give families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus will be granted indefinite leave to remain. The move follows criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers. Announcing the move, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cWe are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers. We want to ensure families have the support they need and so this will be effective immediately and retrospectively.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set to track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence in the evidence \u2013 on Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total in Wales to 1,238.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit</strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d. Labour said the breach raised serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to command public confidence.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T18:07:14.222Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec56ac18f0886ce4f5d74b9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T17:40:44.222Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bereavement scheme extended</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has bowed to pressure to give indefinite leave to remain to families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The move follows criticism that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/07/foreign-nationals-nhs-indefinite-leave-remain-coronavirus-covid-19\">care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme</a>, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers.</p> \n  <p>The extension of the scheme \u2013 which was originally announced last month \u2013 to include cleaners, porters, social care staff and care home workers will be effective immediately and retrospectively, the Home Office confirmed.</p> \n  <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Every death in this crisis is a tragedy, and sadly some NHS support staff and social care workers have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of saving the lives of others.</p> \n   <p>When I announced the introduction of the bereavement scheme in April, I said we would continue to work across government to look at ways to offer further support.

Dowden said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This sounded like an attempt to counter the impression conveyed by some ministerial messages that the government is in a rush to end the lockdown.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he was setting up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1#block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1\">5.21pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he wanted tourism to resume in July.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can.

Also very little independent study or research about how the app might function seems to be in place to understand the use patterns as they unfold. Technology use generally brings in unintended consequences, and it is difficult to know what these will be.</p> \n   <p>Manual tracing alone is too slow, and if there is a second spike it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to locate the contacts faster than the rate of new contacts are becoming exposed. The rapid transmission of the virus between people, is faster than the time it takes to do the needed detective work and phone calls to alert all exposed individuals. However, an app will not work on its own either, so best way forward would be a combined approach.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Joshua Moon, research fellow at the University of Sussex Business School, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have my doubts that this target will be met, given the issues with the app and the need to train contact tracers. Even then, 1 June is delayed at best - this is a system which should have been in place before the pandemic even started. Accounting even for this, the system is delayed in its scale up.</p> \n   <p>On top of this, the system needs an additional component: isolate. Testing, tracking, and tracing contacts and patients is not going to stop this pandemic unless patients are isolated, and contacts are tested and isolated. This system is going to have to develop as we go along, we need to pay attention to how well it works and adapt as we go along.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science, University of Edinburgh, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any voluntary use of the app would have to be supplemented by traditional contact tracing employing large numbers of people. As it is expected that all of these people will be newly trained, one should expect teething problems and therefore a considerable lag time before the contact-tracing programme is as effective as it could be and when surveillance and testing will therefore play its biggest role in ensuring that infection numbers stay low.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:57:14.743Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec54e768f0886ce4f5d7349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:49:20.843Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier says 'new dynamism' needed to stop UK-EU trade talks ending in failure</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday No 10 released the text of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886168/Letter_to_Michel_Barnier_19.05.20.pdf\">a letter (pdf)</a> sent by <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, to <strong>Michel Barnier</strong>, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in which Frost complained that the EU was just offering the UK \u201ca relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Barnier has now released<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/brexit_files/info_site/uktf-20203060790-mb-reply-to-df-wd.pdf\"> the text of his reply (pdf)</a>. In it, he confirms that Frost has proposed aiming for a less ambitious trade deal than originally envisaged, giving up on the aim of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement.

He says \u201cnew dynamism\u201d is needed to avoid the talks ending in stalemate.</p> \n  <p>And he restates the longstanding EU claim that the UK wants to \u201ccherry pick\u201d - to enjoy the benefits of EU membership, but not the obligations. Barnier says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Regardless of what your letter suggests, there is no automatic entitlement to any benefits that the EU may have offered or granted in other contexts and circumstances to other, often very different, partners. </p> \n   <p>Every agreement that the EU has concluded is unique, with its own balance of rights and obligations, tailored to the partner and era in which it is concluded. There is no model, no uniform precedent to follow in EU trade policy. </p> \n   <p>Neither is there a right to what you admit are unprecedented UK proposals in a number of areas. Just as we do not accept selective benefits in the single market without the corresponding obligations, we also do not accept cherry picking from our past agreements.

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in Northern Ireland taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence \u2013 in the evidence around Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more fatalities from coronavirus, taking the death toll in Wales to 1,238. </p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit </strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year. </p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:31:16.035Z\">at 4.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec534688f0864e579f147e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T13:47:27.723Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across <strong>Europe </strong>is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d says Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).</p> \n  <p>It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic.

He also stressed that, in the Commons this afternoon, the PM said a contact-tracing system would be in place by 1 June.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the contact-tracing system would launch before the NHS contact-tracing app was ready to be rolled out nationwide.</strong> The app is supposed to be one element of the new contact tracing system. But the government now talks about \u201ctest and trace\u201d, not \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d. As the Guardian reports today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-plans-for-contact-tracing-in-doubt-as-app-not-ready-until-june\">rolling out the app has been hit by some setbacks.</a> Yesterday the health minister Lord Bethell told peers the government would begin with the tracing rather than with the app. Asked about this comment, the spokesman said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t disagree with that.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the ONS was planning to publish more information about R, the reproduction number, tomorrow.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government had no plans to reconsider the two-metre rule. </strong>This morning <strong>Prof Robert Dingwall</strong>, a government adviser who sits on Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) told <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8339837/Government-scientist-says-2m-social-distancing-rule-based-fragile-evidence.html\">the BBC that the evidence for this was \u201cvery fragile\u201d</a> and that other countries adopted a different approach.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, will take the government press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. </strong>He will appear with Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A source said that the Conservative party was still making plans for its autumn conference to go ahead</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/lib-dems-urged-to-axe-party-conference-and-switch-to-virtual-format-due-to-coronavirus\">Labour has abandoned its normal conference</a>, and instead plans an online event.

Johnson has still not appeared before it at all, even though he became PM 10 months ago. This evening MPs will be asked to vote on a government motion setting up the committee, with Jenkin as chair, even though Jenkin does not currently chair a select committee. Labour MPs are backing an amendment saying only a serving committee chair should be eligible to chair the liaison committee.

We do have a right to know.\u201d </p> \n  <p>He said the contact tracing that followed the conference didn\u2019t happen at the appropriate scale. Sturgeon rejected this.

She said: \u201cLet\u2019s not engage in ridiculous language of secrecy are covered up to cover.

At first he resorted to bluster, accusing Starmer of ignorance and quoting broad-brush testing statistics to avoid the more specific question about why care homes are still not routinely able to access the level of testing that is supposed to be available. Challenging Starmer on fact is normally a grievous error, but instead of pressing him repeatedly on this, the Labour leader moved on to contact tracing. Johnson had a moderately effective retort when he claimed that Starmer was asking about matters which he had already been briefed on privately (which may well be true, although there is merit in Starmer forcing the PM to put these matters on the record), but what worked best for Johnson was that he was able actually announce something: that contact tracing will be up and running on 1 June, and able to trace 10,000 contacts a day. </p> \n  <p>Starmer did not seem to have anticipated this, allowing Johnson to accuse him of not listening. For the final two questions, on the NHS surcharge, Starmer was on stronger ground, and his point about a care worker on the minimum wage having to work 70 hours to pay for this was a powerful one. Johnson\u2019s defence was glib, but it did not feel like a decisive exchange.</p> \n  <p>So Johnson got through this without the humbling he endured last week. But to do so, he had to make quite a specific promise. When he first said that a contact tracing scheme capable of tracking 10,000 contacts a day would be up and running by 1 June, he made a firm commitment. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c#block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c\">12.38pm.) </a>Later in the exchanges he was a bit more conditional, telling Starmer:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What he heard is that we have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place, it will be in place by June 1.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, gave what may turn out to be a more realistic assessment (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81#block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81\">7.48am)</a>, saying that although he hoped to see a contact tracing system in place by 1 June, \u201cit won\u2019t necessarily be as developed and full blown as we\u2019d like\u201d.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40#block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40\">8.06am.) </a>Buckland was speaking in particular in relation to testing, but the statement has a wider application; in recent days there has been increasing focus on the consequences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1#block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1\">the government\u2019s decision to get elderly patients out of hospitals and into care homes to free up bed space.</a> Buckland\u2019s statement was not, in substance, very surprising \u2013 it has been obvious for some time that this is what has happening \u2013 but, given that most ministers find it near-impossible to admit anything that might look like a mistake, his candour was striking.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago Prof Martin Green, chief executive of<strong> Care England</strong>, which represents care providers, welcomed what Buckland said. Green told the programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s very significant because it\u2019s probably the first time that we\u2019ve had an admission that there was a priority for the NHS. We knew that from the very start of the pandemic, and in fact part of that challenge was that the priority for the NHS led to things like the disruption of PPE supplies for care homes.</p> \n   <p>In many ways I can understand why the government prioritised the NHS. I can understand why they wanted to make sure there was enough capacity, because if the pandemic had gone in the way that it was projected to go there would have been a huge need for hospital beds. So I\u2019m not trying to criticise them.</p> \n   <p>But I think with hindsight what we\u2019ve seen is that care homes are very much at the epicentre of this pandemic. But it\u2019s good to have government ministers acknowledging where we came from, that the NHS was the priority, and now I hope ... they will have learnt from that experience and start shifting their focus on to care homes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Green was more critical of the government\u2019s record in evidence to MPs yesterday. He told the Commons health committee that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52727221\">care homes were planning for coronavirus \u201cwith their hands tied\u201d</a> because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96456cde2e79bc93754ebc34823756fb1ea1e5c7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96456cde2e79bc93754ebc34823756fb1ea1e5c7/77_0_1763_1058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Martin Green\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Martin Green</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T09:42:25.762Z\">at 10.42am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec4f2ad8f0864e579f14440\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T09:13:46.448Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The travel industry is one of the most heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

She says the government has world-leading measures to combat extremism. There will be an independent review of the Prevent programme, she says.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Around 1,000 migrants are said to have arrived across the Channel since the lockdown. What are you doing about that?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is doing a lot. Border Force officers and others are working night and day on this, she says.

Children\u2019s education is vital, she says. She says this does not amount to rushing back to a full school day.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sanctions be taken against councils that don\u2019t cooperate?</em></p> \n  <p>No, says Patel. She says government and councils need to work together.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What happens if a teacher does not turn up?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she has seen some teachers do heroic work keeping schools open for the children of key workers and for vulnerable children.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sentences be increased for people who cough at police officers, threatening them with coronavirus?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is looking at that.

  "<p>The government has finally conceded there will be extra checks and paperwork on some goods trade across the Irish Sea after Brexit. So why, on what, and when will they begin?</p> <h2><strong>Why </strong><strong>will there be checks?</strong></h2> <p>They were agreed by Boris Johnson and the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/10/boris-johnson-and-leo-varadkar-say-they-see-pathway-to-brexit-deal\">meeting in the Wirral</a> last October. Although controversial and vehemently opposed by the Democratic Unionist party, they were cemented into law when they became part of the withdrawal agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/29/brexit-meps-to-vote-on-withdrawal-agreement-ahead-of-uk-departure\">approved in January</a> by parliament. They were proclaimed as the breakthrough to remove the need for checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could have risked the continuing peace process.</p> <h2><strong>Didn\u2019t Boris Johnson say there would be no checks?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. His statements <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/boris-johnson-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-gb-wont-be-checked-brexit\">during the election campaign</a> confounded the EU and fuelled fears that the UK would try to wriggle out of the Northern Ireland protocol and push the border back to the land frontier with Ireland.</p> <h2><strong>What has changed?</strong></h2> <p>Reality has prevailed. The checks were legally agreed and, on Wednesday, Michael Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/brexit-gove-confirms-plans-for-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea\">confirmed them</a> for the first time in a 23-page document.</p> <h2><strong>When </strong><strong>will the checks </strong><strong>be imposed?</strong></h2> <p>From 1 January next year, whether the UK strikes a trade deal with the EU or not. They will hold for at least six years under the withdrawal agreement.</p> <h2><strong>What </strong><strong>will be the main checks?</strong></h2> <p>Checks on all live animals and on agrifood entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will be conducted in airports and ports. This is to ensure the island of Ireland remains one epidemiological unit, minimising the prospect of disease being \u201cimported\u201d from Britain.</p> <h2><strong>Will there be any other checks?</strong></h2> <p>There should also be regulatory checks on the standards of goods. This is to ensure no sub-EU standard phones, TVs or toys, for instance, that could be permissible in the UK post-Brexit, enter the European single market (the Republic of Ireland) via Northern Ireland. The UK has said such checks will not be done at the border but in the market with spot checks in shops and warehouses, for example.</p> <h2><strong>What about tariffs?</strong></h2> <p>The government has said there will be no tariffs on goods entering the region from Britain but remaining in Northern Ireland. It has also said there will be no new customs posts or officials. This is a unilateral interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol and remains to be discussed in detail with the EU.</p> <h2><strong>Anything else?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, the government has said there will be no exit or entry declaration forms. These are normally required for trade between EU and third countries and were identified as necessary by the former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay shortly after the Wirral breakthrough summit. It remains to be seen if the EU will agree.</p> <h2><strong>How will it work in practice?</strong></h2> <p>Gove has said HMRC will be giving \u201cextensive support\u201d to businesses in the coming week and months and that dedicated teams are in place to work out the IT systems needed for the new VAT, excise and customs regime.</p>",
  "<p>Five years after her family fled violence in Lebanon, a 14-year-old Aya Hachem sat with her parents at a charity event to help traumatised refugees settle into life in Lancashire.</p> <p>Hachem was not one to simply settle.

Hachem, 19, was fatally shot from a passing car as she bought groceries near her home in Blackburn. She was not the intended victim of the attack, police said.</p> <p>As detectives arrested eight more people on Wednesday, taking the total in custody to 11, those who knew Hachem expressed their horror at her murder. \u201cThis is a family who came to this country looking for a better life and this is what\u2019s happened,\u201d said Mark Russell, chief executive of Children\u2019s Society, where Hachem had been a youth trustee since 2017. \u201cI\u2019m just devastated.\u201d</p> <p>A growing pile of floral tributes were left at the scene on King Street on Wednesday, where a police cordon remained in place. One line of inquiry being investigated by police is that Hachem was the unintended victim of a botched drive-by shooting relating to a feud between two local groups.</p> <p>Hachem was the oldest of four siblings in a family who arrived in Britain from Lebanon around 10 years ago. A family friend said her father, Ismael, was shot in crossfire and moved his family to England following conflict in the country. He is said to have received his British citizenship last year.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sad, as she came here with big hopes and dreams and then is killed in such a horrific way. We hope they get justice for her,\u201d said Jade Akoum, 29, the sister of 17-year-old Yousef Makki, who was fatally stabbed in Cheshire last March. Her husband is friendly with Hachem\u2019s parents.</p> <p>Those who worked with Hachem said she spoke little about her family\u2019s experience in fleeing Lebanon. But it seems clear that it motivated her: she was in her second year of a law degree at the University of Salford and vice-president of its law society. Her ambition, said Russell, was to work in international law.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a remarkable young woman, a beacon of hope,\u201d he told the Guardian, after holding a virtual minute\u2019s silence with the charity\u2019s leadership team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca352fbfc60c5764f1ed7225ea86fad56f9bd17f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca352fbfc60c5764f1ed7225ea86fad56f9bd17f/0_170_6588_3953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BLACKBURN, 20 May 2020 - The scene in Blackburn where Aya Hachem, a 19 year old law student, was shot and killed last Sunday.

  "<p>I often wonder how many people bought On the Beach when it came out in 1957, assuming it was a novel about a group of gorgeous, sun-kissed surfers catching breaks all summer long. On the Beach is instead about a bunch of miserable Melburnians waiting to die slowly and horribly from radiation poisoning after the world has been annihilated in a nuclear holocaust started by the Albanians.</p> <p>Nevil Shute Norway (he dropped Norway when writing) must have been fond of the beach, because he invented a beach-based weapon of mass destruction called the Panjandrum. Figuring it might be a tad suicidal to launch a frontal assault on the Nazi machine gun nests in Normandy, the British called upon Sub-Lieutenant Norway to come up with a device capable of breaching defences while everyone sheltered in the landing craft. The Panjandrum was two giant wheels connected by a drum, powered by rockets and loaded up with explosives. The idea was you rolled it out of the boat, lit the fuse and stood well back, whereupon it would spin up the beachhead like an out-of-control Burning Man installation and blow the Nazis to smithereens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4022842e854eaa051a08cd698f25893a6d53c813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4022842e854eaa051a08cd698f25893a6d53c813/0_0_2719_3704/734.jpg\" alt=\"Nevil Shute signing books in 1953.\" width=\"734\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nevil Shute signing books in 1953.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It didn\u2019t work. In testing, the Panjandrum ran amok, haring off along the beach at 100km/h, launching missiles in every conceivable direction. It almost wiped out the entire Allied high command, who were observing from a very unsafe distance. It later appeared on Dad\u2019s Army.</p> <p>Disenchanted with Britain, Shute moved to Australia in 1950 and wrote one book a year until his death in 1960. First out of the gate was A Town Like Alice, which saw him quickly accepted as a major Australian writer.</p> <p>On the Beach sold millions of copies upon release and was hailed as the most important Australian book ever written. A movie was immediately rushed into production, starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire and Anthony Perkins, directed by Stanley Kramer. It came out in 1959, only two years after the novel.</p> <p>Despite hewing fairly closely to the book, even going so far as to shoot scenes in Frankston, Berwick, Melbourne CBD and on Phillip Island, the movie was not a success. An apocryphal quote was famously (and erroneously) attributed to Ava Gardner, in which she described Melbourne as \u201cthe perfect place to make a film about the end of the world\u201d. The quote was fabricated by Sydney Morning Herald journalist Neil Jillett for a satirical piece and endures in Victorian folklore to this day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/16/great-beasts-and-american-exceptionalism-the-world-through-the-eyes-of-a-mammoth\">Great beasts and American exceptionalism: the world through the eyes of a mammoth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a microcosm of 1950s Australian paranoia and inadequacy, On the Beach is a dynamite isolation read.

Shute has characters dance the night away, drinking brandy and running riot on Swanston Street. In restriction-era Australia, this alone makes the novel a hedonistic delight, but the main point of excitement is generated by the arrival of an American nuclear submarine, commanded by handsome, veritable \u201csad Keanu\u201d Dwight Towers. Unfortunate survivors of the apocalypse, the crew mope around port, a boat without a fleet.</p> <p>Dwight falls for feisty local Moira Davidson, even though he has a wife and kid back home (he knows they\u2019re probably dead) but their end-times relationship is curtailed by a mission from the prime minister. A nonsensical morse code signal has been picked up emanating from Seattle and the USS Scorpion is being sent to investigate if radiation levels have fallen. Royal Australian Navy officer Peter Holmes accompanies the Americans, leaving his wife and baby daughter behind in Frankston (an unnecessary cruelty). Civilian Julian Osborne (a cynical, ferocious performance by Fred Astaire in the film) joins the expedition as science officer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c0f271c884815ca1797bcab6bee1469f4338429\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c0f271c884815ca1797bcab6bee1469f4338429/0_0_5142_3895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"757\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire in On the Beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No prizes for guessing that the journey is in vain. By the time the submarine returns, radiation is almost upon the city. Chemist Warehouse doles out suicide pills, forcing those with pets and children into a nightmarish scenario.

There is no real plan how to deal with it,\u201d Blackstock said.</p> <p>Senior Trump administration officials have blamed the disparities on the high incidence among black people of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) only produced its <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Race_Hispanic\">first set of death statistics by race</a> this week, despite mounting calls for basic information.</p> <p>In the absence of government data, APM Research Lab has stepped into the breach. It now gathers statistics from 40 states, covering almost 90% of the total of 92,128 deaths in the US recorded by <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins</a>.</p> <p>Andi Egbert, senior researcher at APM Research Lab, said she was astonished that it was left to an independent organization to produce nationwide statistics that should be coming from the federal government. \u201cI won\u2019t speculate about motive, but I can\u2019t believe in a modern economy that we don\u2019t have a mandated, uniform way of reporting the data across states. We are in the midst of this tremendous crisis, and data is the best way of knowing who is suffering and how.\u201d</p> <p>Among the states that are still failing to produce any data on deaths by racial group are Montana, Nebraska, Utah and North and South Dakota.</p> <p>The racial disparities in the US death figures became apparent relatively early on in the pandemic, particularly in large cities where black neighborhoods were hit much harder than wealthier white areas. When New York City produced its first <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-race-ethnicity-04082020-1.pdf\">racial breakdown</a> of Covid-19 deaths in April it showed that Latino and black New Yorkers, especially in the outer boroughs including Queens and the Bronx, were experiencing death rates that were at least twice those of whites and Asians.</p> <p>New figures from the city\u2019s health department released this week and reviewed by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/coronavirus-deaths-nyc.html\">New York Times</a> found that when death rates are ranked by zip code, eight out of the top 10 have majority black or Latino populations.</p> <p>As the pandemic unfolds, some states including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/michigan-task-force-address-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-black-communities-n1189121\">Michigan</a> and New York have begun to convene specialist taskforces to grapple with the disproportionate suffering in black communities. But Blackstock said that there remained no sign of the Trump administration stepping up to tackle the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point we have to assume that the clear lack of guidance from the federal government is going to continue, and that states are going to have to do it for themselves,\u201d she said.</p>",

  "<p>The passing of the immigration bill and the continued evasion on the dropping of the NHS surcharge for non-British nationals working in essential jobs reveal two things about this government (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/points-based-uk-immigration-bill-passed-by-parliament\" title=\"\">Points-based UK immigration bill passes initial Commons stage</a>, 18 May).</p> <p>First is its inability to recognise that this pandemic has changed our view of low-paid workers, both within and outside the NHS. And this is how we repay these workers? By penalising them and discriminating against them? They have truly done essential work \u2013 keeping us fed, cared for and, well, alive. If there are further pandemics, who will be here to do these jobs? Will Priti Patel pick up a mop? Will Boris Johnson empty a bedpan? Or Michael Gove drive a bus? Now that really would be the stuff of nightmares.</p> <p>Second, it makes a mockery of Boris and his cohort clapping the NHS and care workers every Thursday. Clap now and forget later appears to be the watchword. The hypocrisy is as breathtaking as the government incompetency. For the record, I have never felt more ashamed to be British.<br><strong>Julie Coaton</strong><br><em>Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The immigration bill had its second reading in the Commons this week. Back in 2018, I was the first Tory candidate who made a public stance and stepped down because of Brexit. It was clear to me that Brexit means only one thing: a curtailment of our freedoms. The immigration bill confirms our fears that it presents Great Britain as a country that is ruled by self-righteousness, and that, to a large extent, people enjoy looking down on others. This even for the price of the curtailment of their own freedoms.</p> <p>A reasoned person would assume that we have learned in the Covid-19 crisis how much we depend on key workers and that we would appreciate them. Many of them are EU citizens. The bill says the opposite. In post-Brexit Britain, those key workers are seen as unskilled and as not worth having the right to live in Britain. I am deeply saddened. Let us all continue to fight for freedom and respect for everyone, here in London and all over the UK \u2013 the country that people across the world have long seen as the light of freedom, kindness and togetherness.<br><strong>Marx de Morais</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is something deeply wrong and unsettling about the government\u2019s immigration bill returning to the Commons.</p> <p>The bill implicitly suggests \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers \u2013 who earn below an arbitrary threshold \u2013 are unwanted, unnecessary and therefore somehow lesser. This view would always be reprehensible, but to seek to actualise this divisive law is particularly sinister. Care workers fall under the \u201cunskilled\u201d category; that the government wants far fewer foreign-born care workers to migrate here underlines just how rotten the administration is. It is unaware of the plight of care workers? Is it oblivious to how much good they provide? The current crisis has shown just how key \u201cunskilled\u201d workers are, yet the government still hasn\u2019t got the message. It beggars belief.<br><strong>Sebastian Monblat</strong><br><em>Sutton, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Priti Patel has defended the immigration bill, which treats some NHS staff and social workers as low or unskilled workers. Her defence was that this was in line with the public\u2019s priorities of wishing to control immigration. Really?</p> <p>Has she missed the 8pm applause for NHS and social care workers, and other crucial low-income workers who have kept society safer?

Kimmel thought about it for awhile, he said, and came to the \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion: he\u2019s trying to kill himself.</p> <p>\u201cRemember how we all said he didn\u2019t really want to be president?\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWell guess what, I think we were right.\u201d Kimmel joked that Trump is trying to end his presidency with the dangerous drug, since \u201che\u2019s done everything possible to make sure no one would ever want to vote for him again: he colluded with Russia, he extorted Ukraine, he declared his love for Kim Jong-un, he made fun of John McCain, he threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans, he paid off a porn star, in the middle of a pandemic, he wants to reopen the mall.</p> <p>\u201cThe man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/22/not-too-bright-trump-trolled-for-staring-at-the-eclipse-with-no-eye-protection\">stared directly into an eclipse</a>, and none of it worked \u2013 he\u2019s still popular, and he\u2019s still trapped in that White House, and there\u2019s only one way out now: a big glass of bleach with a hydro and Z-pack chaser.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqPZ42isWbE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OqPZ42isWbE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, Seth Meyers traced Trump\u2019s hydroxychloroquine comments back to his long history of shilling scammy products, such as Trump Vodka and Trump University. Given his track record, Meyers said, it makes sense that Trump would claim to personally take a potentially dangerous drug he\u2019s been hawking as a miracle cure for weeks, citing \u201cI get a lot of positive calls about it\u201d as evidence.</p> <p>\u201cYour evidence is that you hear good stories and get positive calls about it \u2026 we\u2019re talking about a potentially dangerous medication, not the new hibachi place in town,\u201d said Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Trump\u2019s gonna say and do crazy shit,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cHe failed on the pandemic response and unemployment is at its highest point in 100 years, so now he\u2019s spraying ink in the water so he can dart under a rock before the press can figure out what happened. We don\u2019t have to spend all day dissecting it, debating whether it\u2019s a chess move or a planned distraction \u2013 the guy doesn\u2019t play chess. He doesn\u2019t even know how to close an umbrella. Watching him play chess would be like asking your dog to change the channel on the remote control.\u201d</p> <p>The drug\u2019s benefits are unproven, Meyers continued, and side-effects can include agitation, confusion, insomnia, mania, hallucinations and paranoia. \u201cSo either Trump\u2019s lying about taking it \u2026 or he\u2019s been taking it for 73 years.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Amid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred. But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19. A lot of the speculation about the post-coronavirus political world is plain fanciful. But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic\u2019s role in boosting the global heft of China.</p> \n<p>The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But when the Obama administration\u2019s US ambassador to the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/samantha-power-former-us-ambassador-un-interview\">Samantha Power, </a>was <a href=\"https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c56cb6a6-8d09-462a-84e3-b668ecdeb54c\">asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee</a> to assess Covid-19\u2019s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China\u2019s rise.</p> \n<p>Covid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/belt-and-road-forum-xi-jinping-promises-transparency-to-ease-concerns\">belt and road\u201d strategies</a>, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China\u2019s \u201cwolf-warrior\u201d diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump\u2019s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3244f1ab-a9c6-4121-a57f-aff4fc353640\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wS_uXk9Pmbo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For proof of this, look no further than what happened at the World Health Organization assembly in Geneva this week. On the one hand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/donald-trump-and-xi-jinping-meet-the-new-cold-warriors\">Trump spent the week slagging off the WHO</a>, threatening to withdraw all US funding, promoting quack medical remedies and attacking China. On the other, Xi addressed the assembly, donated $2bn to the WHO for the coronavirus battle, called for a vaccine to be made available to all, and successfully watered down the planned post-pandemic international investigation into Covid-19. Having done that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/why-has-china-slapped-tariffs-on-australian-barley-and-what-can-australia-do-about-it\">Xi slapped a punitive 80% tariff </a>on Australian barley to punish Canberra for pressing for a fuller, more independent Covid-19 probe. Stand by, if it takes place, for a similar Xi approach at the postponed Cop26 climate conference.</p> \n<p>As the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump\u2019s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China\u2019s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate.</p> \n<p>At this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power\u2019s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government\u2019s <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/225/the-fco-and-the-integrated-review/\">\u201cintegrated review\u201d </a>of Britain\u2019s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain\u2019s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too.</p> \n<p>Covid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review\">Tony Blair </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review\">could write</a> that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/us-message-to-britain-in-bilateral-trade-talks-its-us-or-china\">US message to Britain in bilateral trade talks: it's us \u2013 or China</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/20/some-people-never-convince-david-cameron-reflects-brexit-legacy\">David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic \u201clong game\u201d with China </a>that would give Britain greater political leverage \u201cto bring China into the rules-based international system \u2013 through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.\u201d Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain\u2019s leverage in that or any other global order?</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach \u2013 an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war \u2013 that the American diplomat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/19/guardianobituaries.usa\">George Kennan</a> crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century. Yet it would have to do it in the full knowledge that the UK is nowhere near as powerful as the US was in the postwar world, that the US has defected to isolationism, and that Brexit Britain is itself seen \u2013 and partly sees itself \u2013 as an alliance breaker.</p> \n<p>China in 2020 is not the USSR in 1946. But there is little sign that the Tory party is anywhere close to agreeing on the mature, long-term strategy on China that is needed. The cold war and Euroscepticism both cast long shadows. The bulk of newer Tory MPs, many of them active in the new China Research Group of MPs <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/tom-tugendhat-chairing-the-china-research-group-and-the-foreign-affairs-committee/\">chaired by the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat,</a> now think about China as a threat but regard European allies as the past and thus lack any workable strategy for constraining Chinese power.</p> \n<p>Yet Covid-19 has made the question of how to stand up to China more pressing than before. The dilemmas are not restricted to the Tory party or to Britain. Labour has notably toughened its line, as its China spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/china-presents-itself-as-rival-to-democracy-and-plays-uk-says-labour-stephen-kinnock\">Stephen Kinnock </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/china-presents-itself-as-rival-to-democracy-and-plays-uk-says-labour-stephen-kinnock\">made clear this week</a>. But no single nation state, even the US, can stand up to China and its authoritarian model without alliances, without patient deployment of hard and soft power, and without a readiness to make tactical compromises.</p> \n<p>The answer for a medium-sized power like Britain is to have an alliance-based and institutions-based containment strategy and to work with Germany, France, the EU, India, Australia and others to achieve a relationship with China that rejects both Chinese and American bullying. The problem is that this is the one thing that this government, besotted with its self-image of Britain as an independent, buccaneering world player, cannot bring itself to do.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

For these kind of workers there is no lockdown,\u201d he said. While figures from the <a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-05-13_PE_Mobility_Report_en.pdf\">Google mobility project</a> indicated a significant reduction in movement in Peru, the quarantine may not have been as effective as intended.</p> <p>Tens of thousands fled the capital to their rural home towns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/peru-riot-police-highway-teargas-coronavirus-lockdown\">on foot</a> as the lockdown left them jobless and unable to pay rent.

  "<p>Two months ago Biyu, a worker at a food factory, received just \u00a3150 before she was laid off owing to lockdown. Her life and that of dozens of others at the site have been thrown into chaos. Many are now dependent on food banks. \u201cThey\u2019re saying they won\u2019t furlough anyone, because then those needed to keep working won\u2019t want to. So they\u2019ve laid off instead of working out rotas,\u201d says their union organiser. Those who kept their low-paid, zero-hours jobs have said social distancing in the factory is impossible, and that they have no PPE.</p> <p>On the London underground, TfL is facing similar issues around reduced demand, and workers are also concerned about safety. But their story is vastly different. \u201cPassenger numbers are down; there\u2019s less of us needed. So our first demand was to reduce shifts. We got that. Then [management] wanted \u2018visibility\u2019: for us to sit in the boxes near the barriers. But they\u2019re not cleaned, and the cleaners have got enough to do. We\u2019re refusing, and they\u2019ve backed down,\u201d Jay, who works for TfL, told me.</p> <p>Where Biyu is scared, Jay is confident. The RMT rail union bulletins have explained <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/18/section/44\">section 44</a> of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which gives workers the right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions, making it clear that anyone refusing to work on those grounds who sees push-back from management will be supported by legal representation. \u201cIf the managers kick off,\u201d Jay says, \u201call I have to do is speak to a rep.\u201d</p> <p>His workforce has a long history of strong unionisation. Biyu and her colleagues are in the early days of organising their workplace with the GMB (which represents workers across all sectors). Their union is still not recognised: management has no obligation to engage with members in the workplace or officers outside it. But at least the food factory employees are now building collectively to fight for pay and protection. It is difficult to imagine what those without unions can do. For most people, even quoting section 44 puts them at risk of dismissal. Refusing to work or protesting about pay is almost unthinkable if you are on your own.</p> <p>Lockdown has made clear how vital unions are, and this is significant. In recent years the story told about them has not been a happy one, focusing on their haemorrhage of power and members: from more than 13 million in 1979 to 6.2 million today. Members who stay, union critics say, are trapped in toothless institutions bound by state-imposed legislation and self-imposed bureaucracy.</p> <p>Now those apparently toothless unions have started to bite. The TUC began lockdown by negotiating state support for millions of workers through the furlough scheme and, vitally, union power appears to be waking up in workplaces across the UK. The National Education Union (NEU) reports that its membership grew by 7,500 over one weekend, and traffic on the TUC\u2019s joining page is up 300%. Public support for union demands is also growing: 400,000 people have signed the NEU\u2019s petition against the unsafe opening of schools.</p> <p>But online outrage won\u2019t be enough to sustain power. The union movement now has a once-in-a-generation chance to reverse decline and write itself a happier story, but to do so, it must look carefully at what has changed in the past months. The key ingredients \u2013 of clever online organising, working across unions, mass and dynamic worker involvement, and a willingness to refuse to work unless demands are met \u2013 were missing at scale before now, aside from notable exceptions, such as the Unison Birmingham <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/its-over-victory-birmingham-home-16287725\">care-workers strike</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.scottishleftreview.scot/equal-pay-victory-how-weegie-women-won/\">Glasgow Equal Pay campaign</a>, and the radical effectiveness of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IWGBunion?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">IWGB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/\">UVW</a>.</p> <p>It is to those examples and others that the movement must now look. It has always been stronger than anyone gives it credit for, but now it has all it needs to become even more powerful. With the furlough scheme winding down and a new wave of austerity all but certain, workers and officials must build on this surge in activity, organising in innovative ways, expanding into new workplaces and working together. Biyu and her colleagues will win if they fight together; the rest of us will too.</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Winson is a writer and activist, and a senior organiser for the New Economics Foundation</p> <p><em>All names of workers have been changed to protect their identities.</em></p> <p><br><br></p>",

By 1pm, two hours after it reopened, a line of about 40 vehicles meant an hour-long roadside wait for burger fans.</p> \n<p>The branch is among 33 outlets the fast food chain has reopened for drive-through only in London and south-east England as it eases back into business following the loosening of lockdown restrictions.</p> \n<p>McDonald\u2019s and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/fast-food-chains-step-up-plans-to-reopen-as-lockdown-loosens\">other fast food chains including Burger King, KFC and Nando\u2019s</a> are trialling a gradual reopening of restaurants to allow staff to get used to new safety measures and practise physical distancing inside.</p> \n<p>In Bushey, sisters Casey and Alycia Levy, aged 18 and 20, had bought burgers, chicken nuggets and cold drinks as a surprise for their grandparents, who have been isolating for 11 weeks. \u201cThey\u2019ve been at home since 1 March, so we wanted to cheer them up,\u201d Alycia said.</p> \n<p>Matthew Cohen had brought his children Dylan, 7, and Summer, 11, for lunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been missing the sweet and sour sauce with our chicken nuggets,\u201d Cohen said. <br></p> \n<p>The family usually visit the drive-through weekly, and had a longer wait than usual, because only one lane was open, but did not find a radical change in the experience.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"18a79773-f6b5-4d9c-bcd2-ee8dff031dc3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-s6g_JgxxYo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The changes in restaurant operations will be more noticeable for the staff. They now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/mcdonalds-to-reopen-some-restaurants-for-deliveries-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">have their temperatures checked</a> when they arrive for a shift, and will be given protective equipment including masks and gloves. They are also protected from customers by perspex screens installed at the drive-through windows, and from their fellow workers inside the restaurant\u2019s kitchen.</p> \n<p>As a McDonald\u2019s employee \u2013 his face covered with a face mask and wearing a hi-vis vest \u2013 marshalled the queue of cars, other staff members walked the line of vehicles to tell customers they were serving only a limited menu. Clients were asked to use contactless payment methods if possible and spending was capped at \u00a325 per vehicle.</p> \n<p>The details of which branches were reopening were kept secret until just 45 minutes before the first customers were served, as McDonald\u2019s tried to avoid a rerun of its experience in France and Switzerland. When drive-throughs were reopened there, the first locations were announced well in advance, leading to queues of up to seven hours.</p> \n<p>Many customers at Bushey had heard about the reopening on social media and had brought their children for a trip out to buy a meal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>By lunchtime, so many vehicles were queueing for the Bushey branch that they were starting to disrupt traffic on the adjoining A41, and the restaurant\u2019s franchise owner and some of his staff enlisted the help of a nearby highway maintenance crew to cordon off part of the road, creating a one-way system.</p> \n<p>Despite almost two months passing since the government introduced lockdown measures and the closure of seating spaces in all restaurants, some customers were still unsure how to behave. Having ordered burgers from their car window, one mother and son were disappointed not to be able to eat their lunch at a sunny table outside.</p> \n<p>The fast food chain said it had informed police forces, local authorities and the highways agency in all places where it was due to reopen. At one restaurant, in Peterborough, a police officer called in to check that the agreed vehicle queueing system was in place and that no further crowd control measures were required.</p>",

She\u2019d had a difficult childhood, allegedly suffering sexual abuse from a family member. She\u2019d been married at 16 but had left her husband. She had addiction issues. She\u2019d had two children already and placed them for adoption. She was depressed. She was desperate for a safe and legal abortion. Texas, however, wouldn\u2019t give her one. So she challenged the state laws and her case eventually went before the US supreme court, legalizing abortion across America.</p> <p>After becoming the poster girl of the pro-choice movement, McCorvey performed a very public about-face in the 1990s. She found religion, ended the romantic relationship with her girlfriend, and became a vocal anti-abortion crusader.</p> <p>As it turns out, it wasn\u2019t God himself directing this new path. It was leaders from the evangelical Christian right. McCorvey, who died in 2017, delivers this confession in a new FX documentary, AKA Jane Roe, out on Friday. According to the documentary, McCorvey received at least $456,911 in \u201cbenevolent gifts\u201d from the anti-abortion movement in exchange for her \u201cconversion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was the big fish,\u201d McCorvey says in the documentary. \u201cI think it was a mutual thing. I took their money and they\u2019d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say. It was all an act. I did it well, too. I am a good actress. Of course, I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jane-roe-confesses-anti-abortion-conversion-all-an-act-paid-for-by-the-christian-right\">Rev Flip Benham</a>, one of the evangelical leaders featured in the documentary, apparently has no moral qualms about how McCorvey, who was clearly vulnerable, was used. \u201cShe chose to be used,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s called work. That\u2019s what you\u2019re paid to be doing!\u201d Ah yes, I remember reading that in the Bible: thou shalt pay others to cravenly lie.</p> <p>The Rev Rob Schenck, another of the evangelical leaders featured, is rather more thoughtful. \u201cFor Christians like me, there is no more important or authoritative voice than Jesus,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018What does it profit in the end if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul?\u2019 When you do what we did to Norma, you lose your soul.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly, it seems as though many anti-abortion extremists don\u2019t have much of a soul to lose in the first place. While the right claims to stand for morality and family values they \u2013 as AKA Jane Roe makes very clear \u2013 are more than happy to lie and cheat in order to propagate their fringe beliefs. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1262803968087912448?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cIt turns out a huge part of the anti-choice movement was a scam the entire time.\u201d Most Americans have moderate views when it comes to abortion; according to a 2017 Pew study, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/03/about-seven-in-ten-americans-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/\">69% of Americans don\u2019t think Roe v Wade should be overturned</a>. However, a small but powerful group of extremists are doing everything they can to roll back women\u2019s rights.</p> <p>Of course, McCorvey, as she admits herself, is not exactly an innocent victim in all this. Her reversal on reproductive rights was national news in the 1990s, and dealt a blow to the pro-choice movement. But, at the end of the day, McCorvey never really set out to be a pro-choice activist. She was a desperate woman battling for the right to have control of her own body; along the way she loaned her name to a bigger fight. McCorvey taking money to lie obviously isn\u2019t something she should be applauded for, but the real villains in this story are the hypocrites who preyed on a vulnerable woman in the name of \u201cfamily values\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).</p> \n<p>It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job title new to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment.</p> \n<p>And Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, speaks frankly in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began.</p> \n<p>\u201cLooking at the characteristics of the virus, looking at what now emerges from the different countries in terms of population immunity \u2013 which isn\u2019t all that exciting, between 2% and 14%, that leaves still 85% to 90% of the population susceptible \u2013 the virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February \u2026 I don\u2019t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier this month the former hospital doctor, who worked through the various levels of healthcare bureaucracy to be become ECDC director in 2017, announced that, as of 2 May, Europe as a whole had passed the peak of infections. Only Poland was technically not yet there, she said.</p> \n<p>European governments have started easing their lockdown restrictions, some to the extent that bars and restaurants will soon reopen, others rather more tentatively. Boris Johnson has tweaked his message to Britons from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d and is seeking to send pupils back into schools in a fortnight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b45712c2dfe5082ec43b09d6fd7b0aace127f513\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b45712c2dfe5082ec43b09d6fd7b0aace127f513/0_378_5666_3403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The beach in Southend on Sea, England, 17 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The virus is around us\u2019 ... the beach in Southend-on-Sea, England, 17 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Keeble/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ammon\u2019s job is to scrutinise the fallout and catch any rise in infections early. Talking through Skype from her kitchen at home, from where she has been working remotely for the last two months, she insists a disastrous second wave is not inevitable if people stick to the rules and keep their distance.</p> \n<p>But she detects an ominous weakening of the public\u2019s resolve.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think now it\u2019s beginning to strain. What we see is that, on the one hand, the economic part for small and medium-sized businesses but also the experience of people not being able to exercise all the freedoms that we normally have: to go where we like, to be with whom we want to be. And this is a quite fundamental change to our normal way of life.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd especially now when it is clear [infections] are going down, people think it is over. Which it isn\u2019t, which it definitely isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked whether the data was showing any repercussions, Ammon gave a deadpan answer. \u201cNot yet. I mean, maybe it doesn\u2019t come ever, maybe all the adjustment of these measures is done in a prudent way. This is something we are really right now are closely monitoring: what is happening after all these measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>As of Wednesday 158,134 people have died from Covid-19 in the EU and the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, according to ECDC data for the countries the agency monitors.</p> \n<p>The UK has the highest level of deaths in Europe, with 35,341, followed by Italy (32,169) and France (28,022).</p> \n<p>A total of 1,324,183 cases of infection have been reported. Among those is a member of Ammon\u2019s own staff. Only a skeleton group of fewer than 10 now work in the agency\u2019s office in Stockholm.</p> \n<p>\u201cPart of our crisis team that needs to be there because they need very close cooperation. But they\u2019re sitting wide apart. Honestly. We have to do what we preach.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ammon recalls that it was only in late January that it had become clear that a novel virus causing a cluster of deaths in the Chinese city of Wuhan could be transmitted human to human, with initial concerns focusing on the possibility of the disease spreading through imports.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As the extremely contagious nature of the virus emerged, the ECDC advised governments on 26 January to strengthen the capacities of their health services. There was fear of them being overwhelmed, as was shortly to be the case with tragic results in Lombardy in northern Italy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did really emphasise that these plans have to be updated. And in particular, the hospital preparedness needs to be looked at, how to make sure to have a surge capacity for beds, in general, but also in particular for intensive care unit beds.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think what turned out is that [the governments] underestimated, in my view, the speed of how this increase came. Because, I mean, you know, it\u2019s a different situation if you have to look for an increased capacity of beds within two weeks or within two days.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ammon believes that when the inevitable inquiries look into the twists and turns of the crisis, the return of holidaymakers from Alpine skiing breaks in the first week of March will be seen as a pivotal moment in the spread of Covid-19 into Europe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c412a708b4043f100d8b76ce8815ed7db9f17ed2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c412a708b4043f100d8b76ce8815ed7db9f17ed2/33_481_5684_3411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tourist wearing a protective respiratory mask tours outside the in Rome, 28 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tourist wearing a protective respiratory mask in Rome on 28 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBecause at that time we saw that new cases all over Europe [and] actually [they] had been in the skiing places in the Alps, in Italy, Austria. I mean this is a crowded place, the ski resorts, and then you have these cabins that you go up the mountain and these are really crammed. Yeah, it\u2019s just perfect for such a virus. I mean I am pretty sure that this contributed to the wide spread in Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lockdowns followed \u2013 a theoretical possibility in the pandemic planning that few believed was feasible. \u201cI remember when China put the lockdown to Wuhan, people told me, \u2018Look this wouldn\u2019t be possible in Europe.\u2019 Hmm.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now the lockdowns were straining the public\u2019s tolerance, she said, but questioned whether they still came in too late and whether swifter action could have saved more lives. \u201cI believe if we would have put in these measures earlier, it might have been possible, but \u2026 these measures are so stark, I mean they are so out of our experience that it, I think it needed \u2026 unfortunately the situation in northern Italy to make everybody clear that it is necessary.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Ammon now believes the battle with coronavirus will be a long haul. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s forever but I don\u2019t think it will go away very quickly. It seems to be very well adapted to humans.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is yet to book a summer holiday and warns those craving a break away to prepare for some disappointment. \u201cWhat we are saying is that they should be prepared that even if there are some holidays and they go somewhere, it will not be comparable to what they had last year. At this stage we cannot say you can go out there, wash your hands and everything is fine. You have to keep your distance. These measures have to be in place.\u201d</p> \n<p>But despite the privations of recent months, Ammon expresses little sympathy for the argument put forward by some, including the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption that merely shielding the elderly would have been sufficient.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople who are perfectly healthy are also getting severe illness and they die. Knowing what we have seen in Europe with approximately 10% of the population [infected] I think there is for me not an option to let this go. If the the other 90% would have come as well, I think we don\u2019t want to think of this.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Many terrible crimes have been perpetrated in Afghanistan\u2019s 42 years of war. Yet the attack on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/gunmen-attack-kabul-hospital-used-by-medecins-sans-frontieres\">maternity wing</a> of a Kabul hospital on 12 May was unprecedented and particularly devastating. Even in a country where bloodshed has become grimly familiar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/mothers-in-labour-pregnant-women-and-babies-were-kabul-gunmens-target-msf\">this attack</a> was unbearable.</p> <p>The gunmen had passed through general wards to kill mothers: women who were pregnant, giving birth or with their newborns. They killed 24 people; apart from one midwife and two babies, all were mothers. The footage of one tiny baby wrapped in a blood-drenched blanket carried out during the four hour-long attack seemed to symbolise the despair felt by many: a child born in Afghanistan can barely draw breath before war engulfs her.</p> <p>Who carried out the attack is still unknown. The hospital is in a neighbourhood where most people are Shia Muslim from the ethnic Hazara community. That would suggest the assault was the work of the local franchise of the Islamic State group, ISKP. It has carried out many grisly, sectarian attacks on civilians in the past, whereas the Taliban have not.</p> <p>ISKP has not put its name to this transgression, however, and the Taliban were quick to deny responsibility. Yet, suspicion against the latter movement or elements within it lingers. The Taliban\u2019s understanding of <a href=\"http://alemarahenglish.com/?p=34192\">the agreement</a> they signed with the United States on 29 February was that they would not carry out attacks on cities. However, if the movement had wanted to continue carrying out major acts of urban terrorism \u2013 useful militarily for demoralising the population and spreading chaos within government \u2013 what could be more deniable than an attack that was this savage and this sectarian?</p> <p>Whoever carried out the attack,<strong> </strong>the anguish people felt over this particular act of butchery was heightened by the fact that it came in the middle of a \u201cpeace process\u201d initiated by Washington, which has so far brought political dividends for the administration of Donald Trump but little protection for Afghan civilians.</p> <p>America\u2019s agreement with the Taliban was supposed to usher in talks between the insurgent movement and other Afghans. It followed eight days when all parties to the conflict, including the Taliban, had reduced violence markedly. The US thought it also had an unwritten understanding that violence would remain at low levels. Yet on 2 March the Taliban spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200302-taliban-say-will-resume-operations-against-afghan-forces\">Zabihullah Mujahid, announced</a> an end to the temporary respite: \u201cAs per the agreement, our mujahideen will not attack foreign forces but our operations will continue against the Kabul administration forces.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a strange time, when the leaders of a \u201cjihad\u201d hold their fire against foreign forces while targeting their fellow Afghans and fellow Muslims during a pandemic and, in the last three weeks, during Ramadan.</p> <p>Since the March announcement, the Taliban have turned down repeated requests for a ceasefire or at least a reduction in violence. At first, Afghan government forces and the US military acted with restraint, even as the Taliban ramped up their attacks. Research in late March and early April by my organisation, Afghanistan Analysts Network, found people in some areas controlled by the Taliban describing continuing peace.</p> <p>One elder in Logar, a province to the south of Kabul, said that before the deal, people had been taking sleeping pills just to get some rest. \u201cThey were afraid of night raids by the government and Taliban attacks during the day.\u201d Since the US agreement, he said, people were happy, busy and able to return to their fields and get on with their lives.</p> <p>By contrast, we found people in other contested areas of the country in despair as bloodshed swiftly resumed. \u201cIt\u2019s only the Taliban that are attacking,\u201d a local journalist in Badghis province, in the north-east, said. \u201cCorona is one disaster and Taliban attacks another.\u201d</p> <p>In mid-March, the government did order a shift of stance from \u201cdefensive\u201d to \u201cactive defensive\u201d. Civilians are again being killed and injured by both the Taliban and government forces, <a href=\"https://unama.unmissions.org/rising-civilian-casualty-numbers-highlight-urgent-need-halt-fighting-and-re-focus-peace-negotiations\">according to the United Nations</a>, in greater numbers last month than in April 2019.</p> <p>The US military is still far less active than it was. Provisional data from the UN <a href=\"https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/unama_protection_of_civilians_in_armed_conflict_-_2020_first_quarter_report_english_0.pdf\">for the first quarter of the year</a> suggests the number of civilians killed or injured by US forces has fallen to zero since the February agreement.</p> <p>Meanwhile the withdrawal of US troops \u2013 from about 13,000 to 8,600 \u2013 and the abandonment of five military bases are on track to be completed by mid-July.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/19/afghan-kabul-hospital-attack-i-thought-my-baby-had-died-and-i-would-be-next\">Afghan hospital attack: 'I thought my baby had died and I would be next'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kabul does at least now have a recognised leader, following disputed elections in September and parallel presidential inaugurations by the two frontrunners in March. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/afghan-rivals-power-sharing-deal-would-promote-official-accused-of-and-torture\">power-sharing deal</a>, signed on Sunday, leaves President Ashraf Ghani in place. As soon as it was agreed, the US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, left for the region to press the government and the Taliban to start talks.</p> <p>It is possible, indeed common, for parties to a conflict to talk and fight during a peace process. However, when that happens, there must be a serious intention to reach a negotiated end to the war. Doubt hovers over whether the Taliban really do want to negotiate. Since 29 February, there has been little to suggest they aim to replace fighting with talking, despite US government claims.</p> <p>Instead, it seems plausible that the Taliban see the US agreement as a means of removing their most dangerous enemy from the battlefield, leaving Kabul open and vulnerable. Unfortunately, Washington has no plan B if the Taliban do not actually want to negotiate with their fellow Afghans. The US approach relies on the Taliban\u2019s good intentions.</p> <p>The continuing Taliban insurgency is also the \u201csea\u201d in which other groups swim. Even if the hospital attack was not carried out by the Taliban,<strong> </strong> their continuing campaign of violence still makes such an atrocity easier to mount. If they had agreed to a mutual reduction in violence, Afghan intelligence would have been less tied up, and the Taliban themselves might have had a good chance of uncovering and preventing the attack. But this was not the case.</p> <p>In this bloody spring, the one flicker of hope for civilians is that not every Taliban field commander enthusiastically returned to the fight in March; some did hope the negotiations would succeed. In more than one district, locals described to us commanders sitting down to talk to elders about their hopes for peace. However, one Afghan aid worker in the south warned that Taliban members hungry for peace in his district would still obey the leadership; if it did not order them to lay down arms, he said, \u201cthey cannot stop fighting\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Taliban launched a major offensive against the northern city of Kunduz, as they have done most years since 2015, when they briefly captured it. The Afghan government responded with an airstrike on an NGO clinic that was treating wounded Taliban fighters alongside civilian patients. Medical facilities, staff and patients are specifically protected by the Geneva conventions and international humanitarian law.<br><br>The horrible fear is that the US-initiated peace process will prove a chimera, the conflict between Afghan forces will intensify as American troops withdraw, and neither the Taliban nor the government will spare civilians.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Kate Clark is a co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/\">Afghanistan Analysts Network</a>, a Kabul-based research organisation, and has worked on or in Afghanistan for 20 years<br></p>",
  "<p>Barbora Kysilkova, a Czech painter, had just recently moved to Oslo when she received a distressing phone call from a gallerist.

It was part modesty \u2013 \u201cI am not a known artist that is worth it to break in, break a law and steal. I\u2019m not Picasso,\u201d she told the Guardian \u2013 and part practicality. The two stolen works, Chloe &amp; Emma and Swan Song, were absorbing, photorealistic paintings that both stretched beyond 4x6ft. The thieves not only managed to walk out with the canvases rolled up under their arms, but carefully uprooted over 200 staples to remove them from their frames intact, a task that would take an expert at least an hour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/07/documentary-spaceship-earth-isolation-film\">'It's useful for viewers today': the film about a two-year voluntary isolation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kysilkova was as much fixated on the men who carefully absconded with two of her beloved works as with the recovery of the paintings themselves. So when security footage led to the arrest of the thieves, but not the paintings, she took matters into her own hands. As she prepared to witness the trial of one thief, a heavily tattooed man with prior prison history named Karl-Bertil Nordland, she \u201cfelt very curious as a person but foremost as an artist\u201d, she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what, but I knew something had to be done with it.\u201d If he had stolen her cellphone or her watch, she could move on. But not her work. \u201cI can\u2019t just let it pass,\u201d she thought.</p> <p>And so she approached the witness stand, and asked Nordland: \u201cMaybe we could meet some time?

The film, which earned <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/the-painter-and-the-thief-review-1203472656/\">rave reviews</a> after its premiere at Sundance earlier this year, traces first the artist\u2019s determination to understand Nordland, who claimed to be too intoxicated to remember what he did with her paintings (his accomplice is, for the most part, edited out of this narrative). But in their first post-court meet-up, at an Oslo restaurant, he remembers why he stole them: \u201cBecause they were beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>His answer won over Kysilkova, who can\u2019t resist the pull of a risky aesthetic experience; she begins to paint him, while Ree, a recessive presence, films their congenial encounters over the course of three years. Before meeting the odd couple, Ree had been fascinated with art thievery, a high-stakes crime with a delicate touch. A chance Google search coincided with the Galleri Nobel robbery, and he connected with Kysilkova for what he thought would be a short film. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure where this story might end up,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"897223832c18ced0f058ce8e1bc84cd64bd1eefe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/897223832c18ced0f058ce8e1bc84cd64bd1eefe/0_0_1100_619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl-Bertil Nordland said he stole the paintings \u2018because they were beautiful\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl-Bertil Nordland said he stole the paintings \u2018because they were beautiful\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That changed as he continued to witness Nordland and Kysilkova open each other up and, in particular, the moment when the painter surprise reveals a portrait to the unsuspecting thief. \u201cWhen we first began filming and before I got to know Karl-Bertil, he was a really tattooed guy who had spent many years in prison. And for people who don\u2019t know him, he can appear like a dangerous person,\u201d said Ree.</p> <p>A tattoo blared across Nordland\u2019s chest: \u201cSnitchers are a Dying Breed.\u201d But the hardened persona, one honed through an abusive, distant childhood and, later, narcotics dealing, crumbled at the sight of Kysilkova\u2019s empathetic rendering of his likeness. A time-lapse of emotions plays over his face as he slowly, then all at once, breaks down in sobs, and the two embrace, a bond sealed. The scene is a standout; the intensity of the human desire to feel seen hits like the sharp high of plunging into clear, cold water.</p> <p>When Ree first started filming them, \u201cI was still quite occupied by this person, so the fact that there was a movie did not play a role in the first line for me,\u201d said Kysilkova. \u201cIt was like, why not?\u201d But as she got to know him \u2013 over WhatsApp and through Facebook, at dinner and with Nordland\u2019s girlfriend, whom she also photographs for a joint portrait \u2013 the painter began to see the project as its own emotional exploration: \u201cWhat happens if you allow the person who you should condemn \u2026 to come into your life?\u201d</p> <p>When, about a third of the way into the 106-minute film, Nordland\u2019s struggles with drugs land him in the hospital, Kysilkova attends to his recovery, which strips the instinct-propelled emotional experiment of their friendship of its remaining guardrails. Kysilkova is drawn to paint the scars of Nordland\u2019s hand, which resemble Christ\u2019s stigmata \u2013 fitting for a man who felt misunderstood and stigmatized for his whole life. The film then refracts the past year through Nordland\u2019s perspective, as he observes the attentive painter. \u201cShe sees me very well, but she forgets I can see her too,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"360dd8ffb60b5429d0a8f2c08b1ac7ce6f6b4ce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/360dd8ffb60b5429d0a8f2c08b1ac7ce6f6b4ce4/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from The Painter and The Thief\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Kysilkova he, and the film, sees is a woman perpetually drawn to the darker edges of humankind (many of her paintings depict death with unflinching imagery), one who rebuilt from the wreckage of an abusive relationship, who struggles to reconcile creativity with the financial realities of the art world, who attempts to explain her instinctual desire to pursue a friendship with Nordland to her partner, \u00d8ystein Stene, who likens Kysilkova\u2019s trust in her works\u2019 thief to letting a child play in traffic. (\u201cI played in traffic in Prague, there was no other way,\u201d Kysilkova half-jokingly retorts in a couples\u2019 counseling session Ree also attended).</p> <p>The second-half twists in the film \u2013 Kysilkova\u2019s continued pursuit of her paintings without Nordland, his continued opening of his emotions during a stint in jail \u2013 bend their separate arcs back together, albeit with some film-making sleight of hand (as mentioned, little is revealed of the other accomplice), into a satisfying and expertly revealed final bow. But the relationship between the painter and the thief does not reconcile or reduce so easily \u2013 it is, like the most emotionally raw and grounded of friendships, born of universal desire to be understood, yet feels singular in its specifics. Kysilkova and Ree spoke of the project, however, as less an answer than the natural flow into a question of curiosity, of temporarily setting aside one\u2019s judgment and prejudices, or the anger of stolen hard work.</p> <p>\u201cThe questions I would like to explore here are: what do humans do in order to be seen and appreciated?\u201d said Ree. \u201cAnd what it takes of us to help and see others.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The Painter and the Thief is available on Hulu and to rent in the US on 22 May and in the UK at a later date</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In a bid to attract the young viewers who have long since deserted it for Netflix, the BBC is toying with the idea of doubling the budget of BBC Three and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52719883\">bringing it back as a regular TV channel</a>. To commemorate what could be one of the greatest comebacks in television history, here\u2019s a look at the best ever BBC Three shows.</p> <h2>20. Casanova</h2> <p>A three-part Russell T Davies comedy drama based on the memoirs of Giacomo Casanova, this was originally supposed to be a vehicle for Peter O\u2019Toole. However, even O\u2019Toole was blasted off the screen by the sheer electric crackle of David Tennant. This show is basically the reason Tennant became Doctor Who.</p> <h2>19. The Call Centre</h2> <p>A show from much simpler times, when people were content to watch docusoaps about relatively obnoxious bosses twonking about for the cameras while their beleaguered employees pull faces behind his back. This one was about a man named Nev who liked to sack people if they didn\u2019t participate in his pre-shift company-wide singalong. Monstrous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53cfa99e85cc4c805a1099029f5662add89f6c08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53cfa99e85cc4c805a1099029f5662add89f6c08/0_998_3118_1870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don't tell the bride\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The happy couple? Don\u2019t Tell the Bride.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>18. Don\u2019t Tell the Bride</h2> <p>A BBC Three mainstay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/22/when-good-tv-goes-bad-the-moment-dont-tell-the-bride-got-over-its-honeymoon-phase\">simply for its horrible premise</a>. Each week a bride-to-be detailed the wedding of her dreams, then handed financial control of the ceremony over to her groom, who inevitably ruined everything so much that the bride burst into tears.</p> <h2>17. People Just Do Nothing</h2> <p>A mockumentary about a pirate radio station operating out of Brentford, west London. What was most remarkable about People Just Do Nothing is how it took a niche sub-genre and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/27/the-joke-is-always-on-us-how-people-just-do-nothing-struck-comedy-gold\">turned it into a solidly classical sitcom</a>. For a while, this was the new Only Fools and Horses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4231476bcf7c30464d1ee7b0ab573f4a556b969\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4231476bcf7c30464d1ee7b0ab573f4a556b969/0_25_2097_1258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mighty Boosh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mighty Boosh ran for only three series but is still influencing comedy today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Mark Chilvers/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>16. The Mighty Boosh</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to believe that The Mighty Boosh ran for such a comparatively short time, because its legacy is so strong. In the course of three years, the show introduced a brand of violently aggressive whimsy that almost singlehandedly created an entire comedy movement.</p> <h2>15. Gavin and Stacey</h2> <p>More proof that BBC Three worked best as a comedy incubator. This was the channel that offered a chance to a nothingy little relationship sitcom by James Corden and Ruth Jones. It did well, then was promoted to BBC One. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/25/gavin-and-stacey-christmas-special-review-absolutely-crackin\">it returned for a Christmas special in 2019</a>, it was the most-watched scripted show of the entire year.</p> <h2>14. Snog Marry Avoid?</h2> <p>Possibly the worst-titled show in the history of the channel \u2013 because, really, it had almost no bearing whatsoever on the content itself \u2013 Snog Marry Avoid was basically a programme in which people with distinct looks were \u201cmade under\u201d to look like functioning members of society. It had a weird undertone of \u201cconform or die\u201d, but in a way that just made it more interesting.</p> <h2>13. The Revolution Will Be Televised</h2> <p>A politically angry prank show. Heydon Prowse and Jolyon Rubenstein attempted to expose societal hypocrisy by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/22/the-revolution-will-be-televised\">dressing up and infiltrating protests</a>, or asking members of the public what they thought about issues. Perhaps a little heavy-handed in places but, when it worked, it was stunning.</p> <h2>12. Little Britain</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to remember that Little Britain began on BBC Three, or how deliberately edgy it initially was. Before all the merchandise, playground catchphrases and kids\u2019 books, Little Britain was a riot of nudity and blackface and suicide jokes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/19/little-britain-prince-harry-take-that\">It would all do very badly now</a>, but at the time it was a sensation.</p> <h2>11. Pls Like</h2> <p>Exactly the sort of thing that BBC Three should have been producing from the online wilderness, Pls Like was a razor-sharp satire of influencer culture. Depressed, charisma-free host Liam Williams investigated various YouTube fads, only to discover that they were ultimately as empty as he was. Fantastic.</p> <h2>10. The Wrong Door</h2> <p>Before embarking on his career as a director of elliptical arthouse films, Ben Wheatley made this sketch show. Just six episodes long, with a vaguely linked narrative, The Wrong Door was both incredibly funny, visually beautiful and spectacularly well cast. This is such an overlooked gem of a thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97548e8dbf1a86a00f86261bd488b9786fe88fc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97548e8dbf1a86a00f86261bd488b9786fe88fc6/32_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Country Men sketches in Monkey Dust\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Black Country Men sketches in Monkey Dust bore a striking resemblance to Four Lions, which arrived five years later.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Talkback</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9. Monkey Dust</h2> <p>Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye\u2019s satirical animation was dark. Like, brutally dark. Suicide, bestiality, sexual degradation and terrorism were some of its regular targets. A girl returning her birthday presents so her dad could maintain his gambling addiction. A father killing himself because he could no longer identify with his children. Like I said, bleak. But funny, too. I promise. It did Four Lions before Chris Morris got there, too.</p> <h2>8. This Country</h2> <p>There is a very good chance that we\u2019ll look back and see This Country as the pinnacle of the mockumentary. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/17/this-country-series-three-review-bbc-mockumentary-charlie-and-daisy-may-cooper-cotswolds-comedy\">A near-perfect look at rural village life</a>, it\u2019s both incredibly depressing and very silly. Kerry and Kurtan have no real means of escape from their surroundings, but they fill their time by focusing hard on nothing at all. The best episode is about an argument over who gets to use a certain shelf on an oven. It\u2019s majestic.</p> <h2>7. Bodies</h2> <p>Although naturally more suited to comedy, BBC Three was also unafraid to find new dramatic voices. Perhaps its biggest success was Bodies, an unflinching drama about medical malpractice written by a former doctor named Jed Mercurio. This remains his best work, and I\u2019m not only including it here for fear that he\u2019ll have another Twitter tantrum if I don\u2019t.</p> <h2>6. Him &amp; Her</h2> <p>Russell Tovey and Sarah Solemani in a sitcom \u2013 any sitcom \u2013 together would have been a recipe for success. But this wasn\u2019t any sitcom, it was Stefan Golaszewski\u2019s gorgeously observed and intermittently filthy delve into the nitty gritty of twentysomething relationships. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/04/mum-a-show-with-no-baddies-stefan-golaszewski-baftas\">Golaszewski most recently wrote Mum</a>, and you can see the seeds of that show being sown here.</p> <h2>5. Fleabag</h2> <p>If BBC Three does return to television, a lot of that will be down to the unstoppable international success of Fleabag. Everyone has already heard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/farewell-fleabag-the-most-electrifying-devastating-tv-in-years\">every possible opinion about the series</a>, but it\u2019s important to remember that its success was by no means guaranteed. Phoebe Waller-Bridge had already written one show (Channel 4\u2019s Crashing) and it was basically mishandled to death. But Fleabag ended up with a channel that treated it with the care it deserved, and the rest is history.</p> <h2>4. Pulling</h2> <p>The last show developed by Monkey Dust\u2019s Thompson before his death in 2005, Sharon Horgan\u2019s Pulling was a sitcom about three single female friends and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/may/16/pulling-sharon-horgan-dennis-kelly\">their generally disastrous attitudes towards life</a>. Pulling was funny and filthy and unflinching, and BBC Three\u2019s decision to cancel it just as it was hitting its stride is perhaps its greatest ever mistake.</p> <h2>3. Catterick</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ad7b511a741b2ff454596a0481630187824890\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52ad7b511a741b2ff454596a0481630187824890/0_321_1672_1003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catterick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catterick is Vic and Bob\u2019s \u2018greatest work\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/John Rogers/Pett Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike almost anything else Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer have done (with the possible exception of Channel 4\u2019s The Weekenders), Catterick was a six-episode sitcom written by the pair. It\u2019s ostensibly about a man who returns to his home town to reunite with his brother in search of his long-lost son, but it really just lays a canvas for Vic and Bob\u2019s trademark silliness. To date, it remains their greatest work.</p> <h2>2. Nighty Night</h2> <p>It isn\u2019t until you see a list like this that you realise exactly how dark comedy was in the middle of the 00s. And yet the darkest of all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/13/nighty-night-box-set-review-julia-davis\">might have been Julia Davis\u2019s Nighty Night</a>, a sitcom about an opportunistic woman who uses her husband\u2019s terminal illness as a chance to ascend the social ladder. It begins with her learning her husband\u2019s diagnosis and uttering the line: \u201cI mean, why me?\u201d, then tears off into storylines that revolve around disability, torture, murder and paedophilia. But it was funny too, I promise.</p> <h2>1. 15 Storeys High</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF58cOGfzAs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IF58cOGfzAs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A few weeks ago I wrote a list of overlooked comedy shows that were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/05/forget-friends-the-25-greatest-overlooked-sitcoms-from-lovesick-to-younger-comedy-tv-shows-lockdown\">currently available to stream</a>. Top of my wishlist was Sean Lock\u2019s 15 Storeys High, but I had to omit it on the basis that it wasn\u2019t streamable anywhere. This is an outrage. Not only was 15 Storeys High \u2013 a sitcom about a grumpy misanthrope in a tower block \u2013 the best ever BBC Three show, but it should have set Lock on a more celebrated path than the panel show circuit he has found himself on. It\u2019s simultaneously very quiet and uproariously funny. People sorely deserve to have 15 Storeys High in their lives again.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>I Believe in UFOs: Danny Dyer; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/jan/31/becoming-human-bbc3\">Becoming Human</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/27/festivals-sex-suspicious-parents-review\">Sun, Sea and Suspicious Parents</a></p>",
  "<p>Her feet never touch the ground. That\u2019s the premise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/17/james-cousins-epilogues-review-within-her-eyes-duets\">James Cousins\u2019s Within Her Eyes</a>, his breakout, award-winning duet from 2012. Made into a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNxAGDPNVo&amp;t=80s\">film</a> in 2016, it\u2019s the most substantial part of a new online offering from Cousins\u2019s company, made of up three short films adapted from stage works.</p> <p>The film of Within Her Eyes is atmospherically directed by David Foulkes and ex-EastEnders actor James Alexandrou. The two dancers, Lisa Welham and Aaron Vickers, are on a desolate hillside, dancing under low cloud in long, windswept grass. The setting emphasises the architectural qualities of the dance (as opposed to the emotional), with Welham suspended parallel to the ground, or held starkly aloft, its strong lines clear against the wide emptiness of the landscape. Vickers is somewhere between a statuesque, Atlas-like protector, and the lad carrying his girlfriend at the end of the night after she\u2019s jettisoned her heels. Welham torques around his torso, or takes a big step into the void only to be pulled back at the last moment, her curled frame enveloped in his arms. The obvious symbolism is of a woman\u2019s vulnerability, but actually it\u2019s Welham demonstrating the greatest strength.</p> <p>The power of the piece lies in its slowness and simplicity, its empty space (enhanced by Seymour Milton\u2019s sparse, melancholic piano), the measured movement under completely even control. The limitations of the set-up mean it returns to certain images that anchor the focus, and the utter trust and careful equilibrium between two people is distinct, even as the light gradually fades into the gloaming and moody skies turn to a dark blur.</p> <p>The other two films are very short, but show Cousins\u2019s choreographic thinking getting more experimental. He\u2019s a dancemaker strongly interested in storytelling and relationship dynamics, although the brevity of these promo-style films doesn\u2019t always lend itself to going that deep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b74068042734e073bbd0bdfdc57b27089ee91c54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b74068042734e073bbd0bdfdc57b27089ee91c54/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Frampton in The Secret of Having It All\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unpindownable movement ...

An incongruous presence in skin-toned leggings and crop top, Frampton looks both a bit lost and like she\u2019s never been more sure of herself.</p> <p>As her torso judders to pummelling beats and she bends over, bum-to-camera, in front of shelves of yellow vegetable oil and giant sacks of rice, we\u2019re definitely thinking about the performance of a woman\u2019s body, selling her wares, but it\u2019s all too short to get a real handle on. The odd juxtaposition of dance and setting and the unpindownable movement means the film has an impact, even if you\u2019re not sure what that is.</p> <p>Inspired by a poem by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/19/sabrina-mahfouz-interview-noughts-and-crosses-emma-watson\">Sabrina Mahfouz</a>, Clothes to Cover is a mere two and a half minutes, but more successful in its neat concept: a woman, Amy Hollinshead, pulling on the clothes of her ex, futilely trying to reinhabit that feeling of a lost love. We see her memories of the couple (Meshach Henry dances the ex), bodies and clothes entwined, merging, then Hollinshead alone in her flat, tussling with messy feelings and three layers of crumpled cotton. It\u2019s just a sliver of a piece, but an entire story is there, given downcast, bittersweet mood by Gaika\u2019s music.

Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of </em><em>public </em><em>health and regional medical officer for the </em><em>north-west of England, describes his experience of contact tracing at the early stages of the </em><em>coronavirus crisis and highlights pitfalls the UK should avoid.</em></p> \n<p>\u201cIn early February I was invited to Bahrain to examine the country\u2019s preparedness for Covid-19. The first case, that of a religious pilgrim returning from a visit to holy sites in Iran, was diagnosed while I was in Bahrain on 24 February.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe first thing I asked for was a tour around the island state to visit key places where the virus might make an entry: air and sea ports, the road causeway with its heavily used link to Saudi Arabia, the main prison, public health laboratories and each of the hospital estates, as well as housing projects for migrant workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cTogether with members of the Covid task force that had been set up in early February, I spoke to all those in leadership positions to seek out weaknesses in the chain of epidemic control and to assess the capacity for an effective public health response.</p> \n<p>\u201cAmong other things, we were exploring forensically for weak spots where the virus could get hold, replicate and spread. At this early stage we were able to identify that a lack of testing capacity was an issue, and in mid-February I was able to advise the crown prince, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, and the Supreme Health Council to urgently order more supplies and equipment, a recommendation that was immediately acted on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe result is that although Bahrain has a population of under 2 million, the Bahrainis are doing far more testing now per head of population than say, Wales, which has double its population. In practical terms, at Bahrain airport, where screening and triaging of all arriving passengers has been in place for three months, up to 1,000 passengers coming from affected parts of the world, or who might be manifesting early symptoms of infection, have been routinely tested for coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has been followed up by a systematic approach to isolation, quarantine, contact tracing and treatment with a large measure of success. As of last week 6,000 tests were being carried out daily with 4,000 cases of diagnosed infection; at that time there had only been eight deaths.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWith the Bahrain situation in mind together with my own long experience of public health in England, I see several pitfalls ahead for the contact-tracing system in Britain unless things are put right urgently. One problem for instance is the use of test kits sent through the postal service. It should be remembered that the swabs needed to be taken from a person\u2019s nose and throat are quite invasive. Mistakes can be made and there is the risk that an inadequate sample is taken, resulting in a false negative report. </p> \n<p>\u201cAnother potential problem in the current recruitment system for contact-tracing staff is the lack of local knowledge. Ideally the national contact-tracing system should be decentralised and put into the hands of local public health specialists, who know their populations and are able to fully engage with them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMy fear is that we recruit an army of people working in call centres who are hundreds of miles from an area they are dealing with. There are thousands of experienced environmental health officers together with currently furloughed local government civil servants out there who could be recruited into the call pool who have the detailed knowledge to engage with their local communities and ensure a high-quality test, track and trace service.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A larger proportion of Americans have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/us-unemployment-jobless-coronavirus-economy\">lost their jobs</a> during this pandemic than at any time since the Great Depression.<strong> </strong>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/uk-jobless-april-coronavirus-crisis-unemployment-benefits\">unemployment increased</a> to 2.1 million in April, and economists expect millions more people to become unemployed<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/uk-furlough-scheme-unemployment-rise-coronavirus\">once the furlough scheme ends</a>. The current, acute crisis in unemployment is likely to become a chronic condition that, even if it waxes and wanes, will not remedy itself. Like the Great Depression, it demands intervention not only to resume trade and employment, but also to preserve the institutions we cherish.</p> <p>The virus will not simply evaporate; many of the jobs that used to exist have already gone, and more will go still. We will have to feel our way to reviving industries in a world altered by fear of contagion. People will want to avoid human contact to a greater degree than ever before, accelerating existing trends toward greater automation and socially distanced work. Economic busts generally foster market consolidation, as bigger operators weather a storm that swamps smaller enterprises. These effects have an inequitable impact, hurting the poor far more than the rich, demonstrating the cruel effects of inept or inactive governments. For all the clamour that the economy is in peril, what remains of democracy is in far greater danger of perishing from this new depression without some form of new New Deal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hoover ran for re-election in 1932, claiming his policies had ended the depression and urging voters to be grateful to him. They chose Roosevelt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The United States tried denial as its first response to the Great Depression of the early 20th century. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover said: \u201cAny lack of confidence in the economic future or the basic strength of business in the United States is foolish.\u201d When his scolding failed, Hoover insisted that government could do nothing to alleviate the crisis. \u201cEconomic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Soaring unemployment finally provoked political action<em><strong>.</strong></em> Hoover allowed a federal public works programme that provided, he noted with satisfaction, sustenance to some 700,000 Americans and their families; at the time, about seven million remained unemployed. Hoover ran for re-election in 1932, claiming his policies had ended the depression and urging voters to be grateful to him: \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful for the presence in Washington of a Republican administration.\u201d He pledged a balanced budget, higher tariffs and tighter monetary policy. Unpersuaded, voters chose Franklin D Roosevelt. <br><br>Roosevelt promised public works and jobs, labour rights, and a transition to more sustainable practices of production. He acknowledged that he, too, would like a balanced budget \u2013 once the nation had spent the necessary amount to end the depression. He espoused \u201cthe philosophy of social justice\u201d, rejecting \u201ctrickle down\u201d prosperity and preferring instead to \u201cmake the average of mankind comfortable and secure [so] their prosperity will rise upward, just as yeast rises up\u201d.<br><br>Taking office in March 1933, with more than ten million unemployed, Roosevelt and Democratic majorities in Congress delivered looser monetary policy, price support for agriculture, union rights and billions of dollars for public works and employment. Economic recovery began immediately and continued thereafter, with rapid growth that nevertheless took years to make up ground lost during the Hoover years.<br><br>It took several tries to get the jobs programme going. First, the Roosevelt administration bankrolled projects to be managed at the local level. But major works required advance planning, and by the end of summer 1933, only 250,000 Americans had jobs on such projects. Some smaller works did get under way, but letting local governments run them meant there were inequities in working conditions and wages, along with varying degrees of managerial competence.<br><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"423defdb18168a907bfc753e73c32a127cc589d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/423defdb18168a907bfc753e73c32a127cc589d9/0_14_5019_3013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unemployed men queuing fat a soup kitchen run by the Bahai Fellowship at 203 East 9th Street, New York, circa 1930.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployed men queuing fat a soup kitchen run by the Bahai Fellowship at 203 East 9th Street, New York, circa 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FPG/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually the Roosevelt administration decided to hire workers itself, on projects of all kinds in all states and territories. Mandating eight-hour days and 40-hour weeks, calibrating wages to assure a decent standard of living, and barring child labour, the public works programmes set national expectations for working conditions. Racial discrimination on the works was prohibited first by rule and then by law; the public works programmes gave black Americans unprecedented economic opportunities, even in an age of continued segregation.<br><br>Mostly, the workers were builders. They installed or improved more than half a million miles of roads. They built schools, parks, libraries, post offices, seaports and airports; bridges and hydroelectric dams; stadiums and theatres and \u2014 humble but vital \u2013 sidewalks. They brought power \u2013 electrical, to be sure, but with it political and symbolic \u2013 to people and parts of the country that never had it before.<br><br></p> <p>Even with three to four million workers at once on its payroll, Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was still too small: as many more citizens remained unemployed. To dispel the depression, the New Deal should have grown bigger, sooner. Washington remained fearful of spending the necessary sums until after the war. But economic recovery was not the New Deal\u2019s only aim.<br><br>The depression had brought self-government into global disrepute. The apparent incapacity or unwillingness of elected officials eroded faith in representative government and emboldened dictators. Roosevelt wanted the New Deal public works programmes to prove that democracy worked, and for everyone. Recovery could not begin anywhere unless it began everywhere: \u201cinterdependence is the watchword of this age\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/18/covid-6m-britons-fear-losing-their-jobs-despite-chancellor-measures\">Despite UK furlough scheme 6 million fear losing their job \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps no part of the New Deal reflected this commitment so well as the programmes for artists, musicians, and writers \u2013 cheap, compared to construction, but without them the construction would have had less meaning. The New Deal was the biggest peacetime expression of national purpose in American history. New Deal art reflected this notion. Writers and artists documented the memories of formerly enslaved people, the music of rural folks and the lives of workers in factory and field, and by making art out of them acknowledged their importance. This version of democracy, built on the interdependence of a variety of peoples, became Roosevelt\u2019s vision for the United Nations.<br><br></p> <p>During this pandemic, sheltering in place \u2013 or staying at home \u2013 has robbed us of the common spaces that were vital to the New Deal\u2019s cultural programme. We cannot congregate in theatres or stadiums, or even stop to chat in the street. Yet our interdependence is no less real for its intangibility. We should remember that cornerstone of the New Deal.</p> <p>We can learn, too, from New Dealers\u2019 commitment to providing people not only with a social safety net but with jobs to lift them out of unemployment. We might also take as a model the New Deal programme of public works that modernised the economy and adapted it to the world that was then new; advocates for a global \u201cgreen new deal\u201d have long contended that we need a new infrastructure to prepare ourselves for a more sustainable way of life.</p> <p>We might also learn from the New Deal\u2019s deficiencies. We should be bold, going bigger sooner and erring on the side of too much rather than too little, and uncompromising in seeking equity. And we should remember that the purpose of a jobs programme is not only to provide economic stimulus, but also the dignity of work at a decent wage under good conditions to all who can do it, and moreover to remind us that, should enough of us choose it, we can prove that democracy works.</p> <p>\u2022 Eric Rauchway is distinguished professor of history at the University of California, Davis.

  "<p>The title, at once aimless and coyly, almost whimsically seductive, gives a partial sense of this film\u2019s mood. It\u2019s an elegantly made road movie in a style I can only call Euro-arthouse quirk. The director is Ena Sendijarevi\u0107, making her feature debut with deadpan borrowings from Suleiman and Jarmusch. It is a dry, dark comedy that is clearly riffing on elements from her own background: like her lead character, Sendijarevi\u0107 was raised in the Netherlands, but born in Bosnia, which her parents fled during the 90s war. You are left wondering about the less quirky reality that must lie some way behind the story.</p> <p>Alma (Sara Luna Zori\u0107) is a teenager who lives in the Netherlands with her mum, but hears that her dad \u2013 who ran out on them when she was a kid \u2013 is now very sick back in Bosnia. Alma conceives a desire to see him for the first and last time. Her mum fixes her up with a place to stay out there with her moody, slightly gangster-y cousin, Emir (Ernad Prnjavorac), and, on her arrival, Emir\u2019s friend Denis (Lazar Dragojevi\u0107) is rather enamoured of Alma, who does a lot of sunbathing in a bikini or her underwear and who flavours the movie with a tang of artless sexiness.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kgU4kpku2Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9kgU4kpku2Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Sendijarevi\u0107 displays some arch film-making mannerisms: characters tend to speak only after a tiny contrived pause while impassively holding the gaze of the person with them; they will often be photographed in odd, rectilinear compositions, their heads and faces occupying the lower half of the screen with a lot of dead space overhead. And most of the time there is a hard, sunlit sheen that hints at something menacing or even violent just out of shot.</p> <p>It\u2019s an amusing and diverting film that, with a series of ellipses and jumps, finally takes us to an unexpected world of fear and grief \u2013 and then back again, to stylised unseriousness. An engaging debut, which Sendijarevi\u0107 will follow up with more substance to go with the style.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/take-me-somewhere-nice\">Take Me Somewhere Nice is available on Mubi</a>.</p>",
  "<p>In 1992, on a tour bus heading to Canada, the American singer Mark Lanegan felt a tightness in the crook of his arm. By the time he reached Quebec, his arm had swollen to twice its normal size. Already an alcoholic, Lanegan \u2013 known to friends as \u201cOld Scratch\u201d, the pseudonym for the devil \u2013 had developed a ferocious heroin habit and would regularly share needles. In hospital he was diagnosed with a blood infection and given intravenous antibiotics. Using a pen, a doctor drew a line around the inflamed area which stretched from his shoulder to his wrist and told him: \u201cI\u2019m gonna come back in 12 hours. If the redness has gone outside the line, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to have to amputate your arm at the shoulder.\u201d Eight torturous days later, the swelling had subsided and Lanegan was discharged, his arm still intact. \u201cNot for one moment did it cross my mind that I had done this to myself,\u201d he writes in <em>Sing Backwards and Weep</em>. And so the next day he resumed shooting up.</p> <p>Rock memoirs are traditionally full of myth-building and depravity, but Lanegan\u2019s account of his tenure in the proto-grunge quartet Screaming Trees sidesteps the myth-building and rushes headlong into grand guignol scenes of degradation and self-abuse. Rare in its rawness and candour, the book is a brutal chronicle of addiction that began aged 12 when Lanegan was \u201creviled as a town drunk before I could even legally drink\u201d, and continued into his 20s when he branched out into heroin and crack.</p> <p>The book sprints through Lanegan\u2019s early life as the child of an abusive mother and alcoholic father in small-town Ellensburg, Washington \u2013 a period on which he would clearly rather not dwell. Formed with a bunch of old schoolmates in 1985, Screaming Trees were his passport to a new life. Given his contempt for the band\u2019s songwriter, Gary Lee Conner, with whom he would regularly get into fistfights, he never expected it to last. But following a move to Seattle, he was soon on a merry-go-round of touring, recording albums and buying and selling drugs that would continue for the next 16 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a255ccc898ce98f0c07bea90711a40aeeec1e25f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a255ccc898ce98f0c07bea90711a40aeeec1e25f/0_146_6608_3966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screaming Trees, including Lanegan, left, in London, 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screaming Trees, including Lanegan, left, in London, 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this memoir, as the band lurch chaotically from one tour to the next, we find Lanegan variously blacking out; picking fights; robbing and being robbed; and shooting up in dressing rooms, tour buses, hotels and aeroplane toilets. He makes no attempt to disguise or justify his behaviour, which includes habitually lying and cheating those close to him out of money, though his openness about his basest moments is disarming. There are epic stories of attempts to score drugs in strange cities while in painful states of withdrawal; on one such occasion, he ends up in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross during early-morning rush hour, falling over and \u201cspasm[ing] like a jellyfish on my side upon the hard concrete sidewalk, puking uncontrollably, tears streaming from my eyes\u201d. As he lies there, a group of schoolchildren pick their way around him, whispering, giggling and pointing at \u201cthe pitiful scene of my public shame and sickness\u201d.</p> <p>Friends die along the way, among them Nirvana\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain\">Kurt Cobain</a>, the Gun Club\u2019s Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff, and Demri Parrott, partner of the Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley, who himself died of an overdose in 2002. Cobain\u2019s suicide in 1994 hits Lanegan particularly hard \u2013 the pair had been close and Lanegan remembers him affectionately as \u201ca sensitive, non-social, and thoughtful, quiet guy, highly intelligent with a wicked, biting, and sometimes caustic sense of humour\u201d. Hours before his death, Cobain had called and asked him to come over. Comfortable at home doing drugs and watching soap operas, Lanegan let the answering machine pick up the calls. When Cobain\u2019s body was found two days later, he \u201cburst into tears of remorse, self-hatred and mountainous grief. I knew I would never get over his death.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Hours before his death, Cobain called and asked Lanegan to come over. At home on drugs, Lanegan let the answerphone pick up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite the tragedies, an arch humour characterises a lot of the writing, which is at its most withering when he recalls a beef with Liam Gallagher, singer of Oasis, who Screaming Trees supported on their 1996 US tour. The pair first met when Gallagher, flanked by two minders, shouted \u201cHowling Branches!\u201d at the notoriously short-tempered Lanegan while he was eating lunch, prompting an exchange of insults. Later, as Lanegan and his bandmates played their set, Gallagher stood at the side of the stage pulling disapproving faces in full view of the audience.<strong> </strong>Exasperated, the Trees bass player, Van Conner, walked up and clubbed Gallagher in the face with the head of his Fender Precision. No one emerges from the spat smelling of roses. Nonetheless, Lanegan\u2019s recollections of Gallagher as \u201creckless, witless, despotic\u201d and an \u201cunbearable minor-league dictator \u2026 In my thirty-one years on earth, I had never encountered anyone with a larger head or tinier balls\u201d<strong> </strong>make for bracing reading.</p> <p>The book ends in 1997 as he enters rehab, organised and paid for by Cobain\u2019s wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/courtney\">Courtney Love</a>, and shortly before the start of a new musical chapter that would see him collaborate with Queens of the Stone Age, the Afghan Whigs\u2019s Greg Dulli and Belle and Sebastian\u2019s Isobel Campbell, and make more albums as a solo artist. Bloody-minded to the last, he opts to keep the details of his path to sobriety to himself, though an epiphany of sorts arrives as he sits in the hospital gardens in the early stages of treatment, alternately laughing and sobbing. \u201cIn order to survive,\u201d he writes, \u201cI would have to change every single fucking sorry thing about myself.

We\u2019ll really need to increase the effective protection of those sites and that\u2019s a priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report acknowledged that not properly looking after protected land was having \u201cdisastrous consequences on biodiversity\u201d.</p> \n<p>The commission is promising to outline in 2021 legally binding targets on EU member states to restore nature reserves, such as meadows, wetlands, peatlands, bogs, marshes, grasslands and forests.

ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/two-coasts-one-virus-how-new-york-suffered-nearly-10-times-the-number-of-deaths-as-california\">recently released a report outlining catastrophic missteps</a> by Cuomo and the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, which probably resulted in many thousands of needless coronavirus cases. ProPublica offers some appalling numbers contrasting what happened in New York with the outbreak in California. By mid-May, New York City alone had almost 20,000 deaths, while in San Francisco there had been only 35, and New York state as a whole suffered 10 times as many deaths as California.</p> <p>Federal failures played a role, of course, but this tragedy was absolutely due, in part, to decisions by the governor. Cuomo initially \u201creacted to De Blasio\u2019s idea for closing down New York City with derision\u201d, saying it \u201cwas dangerous\u201d and \u201cserved only to scare people\u201d. He said the \u201cseasonal flu was a graver worry\u201d. A spokesperson for Cuomo \u201crefused to say if the governor had ever read the state\u2019s pandemic plan\u201d. Later, Cuomo would blame the press, including the New York Times for failing to say \u201cBe careful, there\u2019s a virus in China that may be in the United States?\u201d even though the Times wrote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jorgearangure/status/1255180205678886919\">nearly 500 stories</a> on the virus before the state acted. Experts told ProPublica that \u201chad New York imposed its extreme social distancing measures a week or two earlier, the death toll might have been cut by half or more\u201d.</p> <p>But delay was not the only screw-up. Elderly prisoners <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-new-york-medical-parole-20200507-i7tr6ginbnfupizijzp5lmykjm-story.html\">have died</a> of coronavirus because New York has failed to act on their medical parole requests. As Business Insider documented:</p> <p><em>\u201cTesting was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/slow-start-for-rapid-coronavirus-tests-frustrates-states-11586597401\">slow</a>. Nonprofit social-service agencies that serve the most vulnerable <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-coronavirus-social-services-covid19-federal-support-bailout-2020-3\">couldn\u2019t get answers either</a>. And medical experts like the former CDC director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1247184873615433729\">Tom Frieden</a> said \u2018so many deaths could have been prevented\u2019 had New York issued its stay-at-home order just \u2018days earlier\u2019 than it did. On March 19, when New York\u2019s schools had already been closed, Cuomo said \u2018in many ways, the fear is more dangerous than the virus.\u2019\u201d</em></p> <p>The governor has failed to take responsibility for the obvious failures, consistently blaming others and at one point even saying \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-bugle-coronavirus.html\">governors don\u2019t do pandemics</a>\u201d. (Actually, some governors just don\u2019t read their state\u2019s pandemic plans.) But much of the press has ignored this, focusing instead on Cuomo\u2019s aesthetic presentation: his poise during press conferences, his dramatic statements about \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d (even when he obviously hasn\u2019t), and his invisible good looks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cuomo\u2019s record was shameful long before coronavirus began</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/04/29/andrew-cuomo-new-york-mural-donated-masks-ny-then-social-media-weighed/3048534001/\">mask mural</a> is yet another publicity stunt mistaken by the press as a sign of leadership. On 29 April, Cuomo unveiled a wall of handmade cloth masks that had been sent to his office by concerned citizens all over America. He called it \u201ca self-portrait of America. You know what that spells? It spells love.\u201d Since the arrangement of masks doesn\u2019t form words, the mural doesn\u2019t actually spell anything, but it is a perfect symbol of Cuomo\u2019s leadership failures. Handmade cloth face coverings are not as effective as N95 masks, of course, but if unsuitable for healthcare workers they would still have been perfectly appropriate to distribute to New Yorkers (some of whom have been brutally <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mom-arrested-after-confrontation-with-nypd-officers-over-face-mask/2416440/\">arrested</a> for not wearing masks). But Cuomo, rather than putting the needs of New Yorkers first, chose to tack hundreds of cloth masks on a wall as a monument to himself.</p> <p>Cuomo\u2019s record was shameful long before coronavirus began. He enabled the IDC (Independent Democratic Conference), a group of conservative Democratic state lawmakers, in allying with the Republican minority to block progressive legislation. (Cuomo denies any role in the IDC, but <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/05/another-cuomo-noninterference-story-falls-apart-049022\">that stretches credulity</a>.) Before the pandemic, he pushed through <a href=\"https://www.uticaod.com/news/20190310/hospitals-warn-against-cuomos-proposed-medicaid-cuts\">Medicaid cuts</a> which shut down necessary hospital space in the name of \u201cefficiency\u201d despite the warnings of medical professionals. And on 3 April, as 3,000 New Yorkers already lay dead from the virus and hospitals like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-elmhurst-queens.html\">Elmhurst</a> in Queens were overwhelmed with cases, Cuomo forced through further Medicaid cuts, slashing <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/budget/medicaid-cuts-make-state-budget-some-tweaks.html\">$400m</a> from hospital budgets.</p> <p>As the state now staggers to its feet, Cuomo has partnered with the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/05/06/cuomo-questions-why-school-buildings-still-exist-says-new-york-will-work-with-bill-gates-reimagine-education/\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to \u201creimagine education\u201d (which almost certainly means <a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/schools/2020/05/critics-slam-gov-cuomos-plan-to-reimagine-schools-with-bill-gates-foundation.html\">privatization</a>), and with the ex-Google chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Eric Schmidt</a> to \u2013 as Naomi Klein puts it \u2013 \u201cpermanently integrat[e] technology into every aspect of civic life\u201d. All of this has happened without the democratic input of New Yorkers, who would likely prefer that the progressive legislators they elected could govern without interference, that their hospitals have enough money to function and that billionaires don\u2019t infiltrate and control every element of civic life.</p> <p>There\u2019s something disturbing about Cuomo being hailed as the hero of the pandemic when he should rightly be one of the villains. As Business Insider notes, he is now only able to attain praise for his actions because his earlier failures made those actions necessary. He\u2019s lauded for addressing a problem that he himself partly caused. Of course, part of this is because Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/04/notes-on-a-nightmare-4-the-criminality-of-donald-trump\">bungled the coronavirus response even more badly</a>, so that Cuomo \u2013 by not being a complete buffoon \u2013 looks like a capable statesman by contrast. But this is the problem: for too long, Democrats have measured their politicians by \u201cwhether they are better than Republicans\u201d. This sets the bar very low indeed, and means that Democrats end up settling for incompetent and amoral leaders who betray progressive values again and again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lyta Gold is the managing editor and amusements editor of Current Affairs.

Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has thus far taken a far more traditional approach, with an app and organizing events that point more to the list-building approach common among federal and statewide campaigns. It allows for voters that aren\u2019t necessarily hardcore Democrats or Biden supporters.</p> <p>In a campaign where door-to-door knocking is limited because of the coronavirus, strategists are having to explore new online ways of rallying voters and collecting information on potential supporters.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t want you to knock on their door any more. Digital does that now. They haven\u2019t wanted to go to events. Only old people want to go to events. Well, you\u2019ve seen digital solve all that with Zoom. You\u2019ve seen digital solve that with an app,\u201d said Republican strategist Jim McIntosh. \u201cCoronavirus has sped up the natural cycle of things. We were already going this way but digital impact will have the biggest impact this year.\u201d</p> <p>Strategists have taken note of the differences in the two presidential campaigns\u2019 approach.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Trump is doing with the app that I think is so interesting \u2026 is he\u2019s really building up this idea of \u2018us versus them. You\u2019re on our team. You\u2019re with us,\u2019\u201d said Democratic digital strategist Stefan Smith, former online engagement director for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cSo you become this sort of under-siege political minority \u2026 because that\u2019s the language they\u2019re using, even though they\u2019re winning. That mentality keeps them feeling like, \u2018OK, we have to stay together\u2019, and then you\u2019re getting constant uploads.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between the two apps is apparent from the minute the downloads have completed.</p> <p>The Trump campaign app sends out multiple email alerts over a few days \u2013 the Biden campaign app over the same period barely sent out any. Both campaign apps offer updated lists of events, but the Trump campaign app also offers other ways to help it. You can help registering voters, become \u201ca bundler\u201d for fundraising, \u201cHost a Maga meet-up\u201d, join the campaign\u2019s election day team, or \u201cBecome a Trump team leader\u201d. There\u2019s also a point system on the app for rewards.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about energizing the base and getting more out of the same people,\u201d said Republican strategist and ad maker Will Ritter.</p> <p>For the Biden campaign app, there are standard links to make calls, send texts, volunteer and donate, and a list of campaign events. But there is no point system. And the variety of ways to engage with the campaign is smaller.</p> <p>It\u2019s a similar situation with supporter events online. Both campaigns send out fundraising and supporter emails. Both campaigns have migrated mostly to holding events online with surrogates. For Biden, it\u2019s often himself and other elected officials or leaders of various wings of the Democratic party; for Trump, it\u2019s minor icons within the larger Trump movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb/0_113_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden in San Diego last year.

Trump himself doesn\u2019t participate in those events but he doesn\u2019t have to as he has the bully pulpit of his office. Oftentimes during the pandemic official White House events involving Trump have been featured live on major cable networks.</p> <p>Smith said that another major difference between the campaign\u2019s online approach has been the types of voters the campaigns are trying to reach.</p> <p>\u201c[The Trump] ecosystem is really about sharing, putting things on your own social media profile. Like if you look at the instructions on the app,\u201d Smith said, pointing to the step-by-step instructions on the Trump campaign app to invite friends and use specific hashtags.</p> <p>Those directions are for a specific audience of older Trump supporters who may not be as savvy as younger voters. \u201cIt has instructions in the app \u2013 \u2018How do you sign up for a Facebook page?\u2019 Not: how do you post on one? But they\u2019re helping their older supporters get on Facebook just to spread news about the president to earn points so that they can maybe see him and get merch or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Smith added: \u201cThis is a base strategy. This is the assumption that if we can get everybody in the same direction and we don\u2019t lose anybody then we can keep them.\u201d</p> <p>Even before the Democratic presidential primary shrank to only Biden, strategists fretted about the data lead Republicans and the Trump campaign had been building over their Democratic rivals. </p> <p>\u201cAs a digital professional, the Trump campaign scares me a little,\u201d Smith warned. \u201cThey have so much runway, they have so much data.\u201d</p> <p>The Biden campaign has been working to catch up.

  "<p><em>The June Rebellion, also known as the Paris Uprising of 1832, took place between 5-6 June, 1832, when republicans in Paris attempted to reverse the establishment in 1830 of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/July-Revolution\">July Monarchy</a>. It began during the funeral of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Maximilien_Lamarque\">General Lamarque</a>, a member of the French parliament and a critic of the monarchy who had died as part of a deadly cholera epidemic. There were 100,00 participants and it inspired French novelist Victor Hugo to write his 1862 novel Les Mis\u00e9rables.

Notwithstanding an unfavourable state of the weather, several thousand persons attended the obsequies of this republican politician, though Napoleonist soldier, and the whole of the windows, terraces, and balconies along the boulevard, commencing from the church of La Madeleine, were filled chiefly with elegantly dressed females, who seemed anxious to view that ceremony. The cort\u00e8ge, of course was chiefly composed of persons professing what are still called liberal opinions.</p> <p>The immense number of national guards, in full dress, formed part of it. I am sorry to say that though many persons of unquestionable respectability attended, some disturbances took plate. The crowds on the boulevards, in the early part of the morning, mistook the military honours which were paid to the body on its being placed in the hearse, as an attack upon the people. Everyone armed himself with a chair, or whatever he could lay hands upon, for defence. When the cause of the firing become known, tranquillity was restored. The crowds who attended the procession attacked and handled in rather a rough manner several sergens de police, whom they met on the boulevard. The Duke of FitzJames was compelled to come to his window and take off his hat, under pain or having his house pulled about his ears.

The people have risen everywhere, and are fighting with the troops in almost every street. From all sides I hear firing going on, and, so far as I have seen, the people are getting the better of the troops. There is every appearance that we are on the evening of a new revolution. The signal was given at five o\u2019clock this afternoon, at the Place de la Bastille, as the return from General Lamarque\u2019s funeral, which. was attended by nearly 100.000 persons, a great portion of whom were national guards.</p> <p>This is what has been related to me by two respectable persons, who witnessed the commencement of the business. An immense crowd were following a coach in which General Lafayette had been placed, and which was drawn by the populace. This crowd was suddenly charged by a party of cavalry, who had been concealed behind some houses in the neighbourhood of the Place de la Bastille. The cavalry commenced operations by firing their pistols at the crowd, and afterwards used their sabres. A universal cry of \u2018Aux Armes\u2019 was raised by the people, and, arming themselves with everything they could lay hands upon, they fell upon the mounted soldiers, whom they very soon routed, wounding a great number.</p> <p>The whole of this populace who took part in this affray proceeded in a state of the highest exasperation to several of the postes militaires about the town, where they disarmed the soldiers, and rallied out into the streets with their arms. All the garrison was immediately placed under arms and divided into detachments, who are up to this moment fighting with the people. The latter have by this time risen in vast numbers. It is expected they will be masters of the field of battle by the morning, and the first use they will make of victory will be to change the government. I have seen some streets already barricaded by omnibuses. The firing has been going on for the last hour under the windows of the room in which I am writing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/26/hugo-manet-paris-poor-privilege\">How Hugo and Manet unveiled Paris's poor and privileged faces</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>From the Constitutionnel <br></em>The funeral of General Lamarque has not passed over without an effusion of blood. What we can say at present with certainty is, that the attempt, whether revolution of counter-revolution, has failed. Some agitators, among whom, in the midst of a multitude difficult to characterise, we remarked some uniforms of the national and of the artillery of the national guard and some students of public schools, amidst cries of \u2018Vive la Republique\u2019 fired upon the national guard and the troops of the line, and at first took possession of several posts, particularly the bank, the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, the royal printing office, and some others. They began to construct barricades upon several points by stopping and overthrowing carriages, and forcing the inhabitants of the houses to give them materials. It was in fact an open and armed revolt, and we may estimate the number of persons who took part in it at 1,500 to 2,000.</p> <p>In a short time the troops of the line and the national guard united upon the principal points, and marched against the perturbators. All the posts were taken, the barricades were removed, and victory declared itself everywhere for the national guard and the army \u2013 that it is to say, for citizens fighting for the preservatIon of their property, for order and law. But this victory was not a bloodless one. Several of the national guard, and officers and soldiers of the line, became victims to the performances of their duty.

  "<p><em> </em>In July 2017, William Perry Pendley, a crusading conservative attorney, delivered a speech to a group of rightwing activists in North Carolina in which he was completely candid about his ideological commitments.</p> <p>He accused \u201cthe media\u201d of selling \u201ctheir soul to the greens\u201d. <strong> </strong>And after criticizing the Endangered Species Act, he made light of killing endangered species.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why out west we say \u2018shoot, shovel and shut up\u2019 when it comes to the discovery of endangered species on your property,\u201d he said, according to an audio recording of the event obtained by the Guardian. \u201cAnd I have to say, as a lawyer, that\u2019s not legal advice,\u201d he added, as some in his audience quietly snickered at the reference to the illegal extermination, and the burial, of endangered animals.</p> <p>It has been almost three years since he gave those remarks, and Pendley is now the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, a powerful agency that oversees more than 240m acres of federal land belonging to the American people, manages mineral resources and is required to comply with environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act.</p> <p>Pendley has helped turn BLM into what one high-level employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, called \u201ca ghost ship\u201d in which \u201csuspicion\u201d, \u201cfear\u201d and \u201clow morale\u201d abound, despite the best efforts of career civil servants to support each other.</p> <p>As Pendley and his superiors at the interior department press ahead with an effort to move BLM\u2019s headquarters from Washington DC to Grand Junction, Colorado, the agency has hemorrhaged staff members and lost critical institutional memory, which many critics believe was the true purpose of the relocation effort all along.</p> <p>\u201cA skeleton crew is left\u201d at BLM headquarters, said the employee. \u201cSo few people were able to move west that a lot of people retired early and a lot of people took other jobs, so my ballpark estimate is there is only about 20% of permanent employees left\u201d at headquarters. As a result, the agency is failing to fulfill its most basic duties, like responding to public records requests and conducting oversight of state and regional operations, the staffer added.</p> <p>Environmental and government watchdog groups are now responding with a lawsuit that calls into question the legitimacy of Pendley\u2019s position. Last week a pair of environmental nonprofits sued the interior department, alleging that by repeatedly tapping Pendley as the BLM\u2019s acting director, rather than officially nominating him for the position, the interior secretary has skirted the Senate confirmation process usually required for high-level executive branch appointments, and has violated federal law. </p> <p>\u201cThe illegitimate Pendley appointment is particularly troublesome because he has forcibly moved the BLM Headquarters from Washington DC, to remote western Colorado,\u201d said Peter Jenkins, a senior counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, one of the groups that sued. \u201cIn doing so he uprooted the lives of scores of seasoned BLM staff and disrupted this already strained agency.\u201d</p> <p>An interior department spokesperson defended Pendley\u2019s record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0/0_236_4988_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Bleier/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMr Pendley brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the department and is committed to carrying out the administration\u2019s priorities and achieving the BLM\u2019s \u2026 mission for the betterment of the American people,\u201d said Conner Swanson, the spokesperson. \u201cMr Pendley has provided a steady hand in facilitating important matters, from the BLM headquarters move west to its response to Covid-19.\u201d Swanson has said that the lawsuit against Pendley is \u201cbaseless\u201d.</p> <p>Pendley, a tall man with a handlebar mustache and a penchant for cowboy boots, has remarked in the past that his \u201cpersonal opinions are irrelevant\u201d to his job at BLM.</p> <p>\u201cI have a new job now. I\u2019m a zealous advocate for my client. My client is the American people and my bosses are the president of the United States and [interior] secretary [David] Bernhardt,\u201d Pendley said during an appearance at <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">conference</a> of the Society of Environmental Journalists in Fort Collins, Colorado, last year. \u201cWhat I thought, what I wrote, what I did in the past is irrelevant. I have orders, I have laws to obey, and I intend to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Pendley has long opposed public lands and wildlife protections. After serving in the Reagan administration in the 1980s, he became the president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF), a conservative litigation organization funded by conservative and industry groups including the Charles Koch Foundation and Exxon Mobil, according to research from the watchdog groups Documented and Accountable.US.</p> <p>Under Pendley\u2019s leadership, the firm was a persistent foe of federal land agencies, getting involved in dozens of cases on behalf of industry groups and private landowners to challenge environmental protections implemented by the interior department. </p> <p>Pendley became something of a fixture among the anti-government set, writing numerous books extolling rebellion against public lands and the federal government. He has expressed sympathy in the past for the Bundy family, whose militant agitation against federal land ownership included the armed takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016.</p> <p>He has compared climate change to unicorns because \u201cneither exist\u201d. And in a 2016 National Review <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/federal-government-should-sell-western-land-follow-constitution/\">article</a>, he laid out a case that argued for the near-total abolition of federal public lands across the nation.</p> <p>Given his long history of legal advocacy on behalf of extractive industries, Pendley brought with him a 17-page recusal list of past clients, employers and investments<strong> </strong>when he took control of the BLM in 2019. The list included groups such as the American Exploration &amp; Mining Association and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. It has been nearly impossible for the public to know whether Pendley has abided by his recusal list, however, because the BLM has failed to release his detailed official calendar to the public.</p> <p>Though Pendley has long been a committed conservative, he has not always had kind words for Donald Trump. In a 2016 <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2016/06/13/trump-the-polar-opposite-of-reagan/\">op-ed</a> in the Daily Caller, for instance, he said then-candidate Trump \u201cis not fit to pull off Reagan\u2019s boots\u201d.</p> <p>Apart from Pendley\u2019s role in moving BLM\u2019s headquarters to Colorado, the agency under his leadership has also repeatedly proposed <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/18/blm-plan-western-colorado-public-land-drilling/\">land management plans</a> that heavily promote the <a href=\"https://missoulian.com/opinion/columnists/lets-stop-giving-oil-and-gas-control-of-public-lands/article_ea8c0d90-3af6-528c-9a88-bf040863059c.html\">energy industry</a>. In March, for instance, conservationists in Montana came out aggressively against a BLM resource management plan that they believe is far too friendly to corporate oil and gas interests, <a href=\"https://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/recreation/conservationists-launch-fight-against-blms-management-plan-for-central-montana/article_dcdb3503-06a6-58a6-bedf-d396a8f56e1f.html\">according to</a> the Billings Gazette.</p> <p>In a statement issued earlier this year, Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, expressed his concerns over Pendley.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who wants our land management agencies to be functional in the future needs to recognize the seriousness of what Secretary Bernhardt, acting director Pendley, and their subordinates are doing.\u201d</p>",

in several jurisdictions, including 24 cases in the last 3 days across 2 jurisdictions, the risk of introduction across an interstate border remains. The current quarantine restrictions ensure that such cases are isolated and unable to spread the disease further within the community. </p> \n   <p>While AHPPC provided no specific advice on interstate borders, closure has been an effective mechanism in reducing the introduction of disease in several jurisdictions, including South Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory. </p> \n   <p>As Western Australia increases the size of mass gatherings in the hospitality, community and sports sectors in Phases 2 and 3, the re-introduction of Covid-19 back into the community from travellers could lead to substantial outbreaks that may require either delay in easing of further restrictions or re-introduction of social distancing and mass gathering measures.</p> \n   <p>Until community spread is eliminated in the affected jurisdictions, which will require at least a month to confirm (two 14-day incubation periods), opening of the interstate borders is not recommended.

Some Australian politicians, including Australia\u2019s foreign minister <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, Prime Minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and Minister for Home Affairs <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, have been in a bullish mood, as some media reports said, in criticizing China for its lack of transparency, and vowed to stand up for their values. <br><br>Some Australian media outlets see this as a move aimed at further pressuring China and seeking to hold Beijing accountable for the outbreak, calling on Beijing to face overwhelming global pressure at the WHA meeting. <br><br>\u201cThis is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,\u201d <strong>Zhao Lijian</strong>, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday on the resolution approved by the international community.

It\u2019s a win for the international community, and Australia, as a strong and active part of that international community, would certainly see it that way. Do you have any comment?</p> \n  <p><strong>Zhao Lijian:</strong> First and foremost, China supports a comprehensive evaluation of global Covid-19 response to ensure experience gained and lessons learnt after the pandemic is brought under control, which should be led by WHO and conducted in a science-based, professional, objective and impartial manner. China has been consistent and clear about this all along. The draft resolution on Covid-19 being discussed at this year\u2019s WHA is consistent with China\u2019s position and reflects the widespread consensus of other countries. China, along with other parties, has actively participated in the consultations on the draft resolution and the co-sponsoring of the draft resolution.</p> \n  <p>Second, the above-mentioned draft resolution is entirely different from what the Australia called \u201cindependent international review\u201d. For example, the draft resolution proposes to initiate at the appropriate moment an evaluation rather than to launch an \u201cindependent international review\u201d instantly, which confirms WHO\u2019s leading role instead of adopting another mechanism. The draft resolution calls for an evaluation of experience gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-coordinated international health response, rather than an inquiry based on the presumption of guilt targeting certain country. We hope Australia will read the text carefully instead of making conclusions based on assumptions.</p> \n  <p>Lastly, I want to stress that we welcome it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political manoeuvere and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:44:10.234Z\">at 3.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494eb8f08a1782fa7de65\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:28:04.951Z\">3.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Beijing calls on Australia to 'completely give up its political manoeuvre'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to theWorld Health Assembly motion (which was led by the EU) and recommended Australia \u2018changes its course\u2019.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The spokesperson highlighted the differences between the WHA resolution and Australia\u2019s proposal of an independent international review <strong>and stressed that China welcomes it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political </strong><strong>manoeuvre</strong><strong> and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:39:46.283Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494a38f0864e579f141fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:54.889Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Covid crisis, and the trade situation, has resulted in this announcement from the government:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Following broad industry consultation and further consideration of the impacts on industry, the Australian government has made the decision not to proceed with the Onshore Biosecurity Levy. </p> \n   <p>The department undertook a co-design process with industry to develop a levy model that was practical for industry and the government. </p> \n   <p>This process highlighted that a levy could not be implemented without significant regulatory impacts on industry and proposed levy payers. </p> \n   <p>This decision has also been made in consideration of the ongoing impacts of drought, bushfires and Covid-19 on the Australian economy and the rapidly changing global trade environment. </p> \n   <p>The department would like to thank the Industry Working Group and other stakeholders who provided valuable input and feedback on the proposed levy design. </p> \n   <p>A levy will not be progressed and this decision will not impact on the overall biosecurity budget. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s biosecurity system will continue to be funded through existing arrangements. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:26:16.972Z\">at 3.26am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494418f0886ce4f5d6bff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:06.199Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Penny Wong </strong>also spoke to the ABC radio this morning (in Adelaide) where she repeated Labor\u2019s stance on the government\u2019s relationship with China:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think on the inquiry, if that\u2019s the question, this is the inquiry into the pandemic, I\u2019ve made very clear from the start we supported it.<br></p> \n   <p>And we welcome the resolution at the World Health Assembly to have an inquiry, a European Union-led resolution that has many countries signed up to it, including Australia.<br></p> \n   <p>It does differ from what <strong>Marise Payne</strong> announced on Insiders, in that the World Health Organisation is doing the inquiry.

They serve in their personal capacity, they are not, if you like, part of the WHO structure.

  "<p>I was lucky in a way, because I was really busy when everything shut down, so I didn\u2019t have that \u201cwe\u2019re in lockdown\u201d feeling until about four or five weeks in. I have been covering Zoe Ball [<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08h8z5t\">on Radio 2</a>] a lot, and it has been strange to see how desolate central London has been. I wouldn\u2019t call it a beauty, but there is something quite special about it because the only people in town are construction workers, people who work for the NHS and BBC staff, so you find yourself nodding to people to check in on them. It\u2019s quite heartening, really. Working on my podcast [People, Just People] has been a godsend, too, although I am a Luddite with technology \u2013 I have a great engineer who comes on to my computer and takes control of it remotely.<br><br>My wife works as a director so we have always loved watching TV together. There hasn\u2019t been a massive shift in our viewing habits during lockdown, although it has given us the opportunity to kind of catch up on a few things that we\u2019ve been meaning to watch for a while.<br><br>We thought <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80190519\">Giri/Haji</a> (Netflix) was great. It\u2019s a Japanese-British drama about a detective, played by Takehiro Hira, who is searching for his brother, who joined the Yakuza, in London. Kelly Macdonald plays the British cop who ends up helping him. It\u2019s much more nuanced and layered than a regular procedural and it has some animated elements to it, like Kill Bill. I know nothing about Japanese culture, but I think it captures British culture and how mundane it can be really well. Will Sharpe is brilliant; he is half Japanese in real life and flips between the languages in the show, so his character is quite integral to the plot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91ccb6f0e2a9827c88a88efb754f37b9dbf7863a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91ccb6f0e2a9827c88a88efb754f37b9dbf7863a/0_81_878_527/500.jpg\" alt=\"Normal People\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve all lived their lives\u2019 ...

It was so beautiful, nuanced and underplayed, and the two leads are just magnificent. The show is all killer. No scene or dialogue is wasted and the ending just pierces your heart. I was talking to a friend about it, and he said: \u201cDo you think it\u2019s because of the situation we\u2019re in right now that it chimes with so many people?\u201d But I actually think it\u2019s because we have all lived the characters\u2019 lives \u2013 we have all fallen in love at 16 or 17, whether that love was unrequited or lasted a couple of months or it was lifelong, and we\u2019ve all played out that movie in our heads.<br><br>We really enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Outsider-Season-1/dp/B07Z8T53X5\">The Outsider</a> (Apple TV+/Amazon), which is a Stephen King adaptation. Jason Bateman plays a local baseball coach in Georgia who is arrested for the killing of a small child. There are witnesses who see him coming out of the woods with blood all over his mouth, so they have him absolutely bang to rights. But then it transpires that he was 60 miles away in Atlanta when it happened. Cynthia Erivo plays a private investigator with an incredible attention to detail. The supernatural element wouldn\u2019t normally be our thing, but it\u2019s so well done and so well acted. It\u2019s not like Jeepers Creepers or something, where it\u2019s terrifying for 15 or 20 minutes and then it\u2019s just \u201chere\u2019s a monster\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s scarier than that.</p> <p><em>Series two of Dermot O\u2019Leary\u2019s podcast, People, Just People, is available now on <a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/ep/podcasts\">Audible</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Right now, it feels as if there is no escape.

From travelling abroad to exercising outside, and even visiting friends, it\u2019s all possible if you\u2019re willing to strap on a headset.</p> <p>Consumer VR technology, although still not perfect, has improved a lot in the past couple of years. The most advanced headsets are the <a href=\"https://www.vive.com/uk/\">HTC Vive</a> (or its more living-room-friendly variant, Cosmos, from \u00a3500), <a href=\"https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/index\">Valve Index</a> (\u00a3920) and <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/?locale=en_GB\">Oculus Rift S</a> (\u00a3400), all of which boast very high definition displays, extraordinary responsiveness and intricate controller tracking \u2013 but they\u2019re expensive, quite complicated to set up and they need to be attached via cables to a high-end PC.</p> <p>There are alternatives. <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/explore/playstation-vr/\">PlayStation VR</a> (\u00a3260) plugs into a PS4 console and provides a decent though comparatively low resolution experience with a really vast range of games, including platformer Astro Bot Rescue Mission and epic space exploration sim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/12/no-mans-sky-beyond-a-childhood-fantasy-realised\">No Man\u2019s Sky</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69f57286c89bff1de9bfb04c762606234756c3b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69f57286c89bff1de9bfb04c762606234756c3b7/210_358_3290_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Oculus Quest is an all-in-one headset, complete with wireless controllers.

It comes with two wireless controllers that track your arm movements accurately, and the setup process is intuitive: you simply use the controllers to draw out the usable space in your living room, and an external camera makes sure you don\u2019t get carried away and trip over your coffee table.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Apps such as AltSpaceVR have let me meet strangers with weird avatars in virtual hangouts \u2013 as unsettling as it sounds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being freed from a bulky PC opens up the possibilities of VR as a casual home entertainment option. It means you can sit on your sofa (or in bed) and explore space or climb a mountain while your partner is watching TV. Over the past fortnight I\u2019ve been happily trawling YouTube, Amazon and Oculus for short 360-degree VR movies (mostly available for free), and have spent many happy minutes swimming with sharks and gatecrashing LA pool parties. Quest has also made energetic games like the excellent <a href=\"https://beatsaber.com/\">Beat Saber</a> and <a href=\"https://superhotgame.com/\">SuperHot</a> feel safer because you\u2019re not worried about tripping over a cable that\u2019s coming out of your head. Apps such as AltSpaceVR have also let me meet strangers with weird avatars in virtual hangouts, which has been as unsettling as it sounds.</p> <p>Recently, I may have taken my interest in VR technology a bit far by accepting a <a href=\"https://www.rotovr.com/\">Roto VR Chair</a> on loan from British tech startup Roto VR. It looks like a sports car seat mounted on a circular plinth, but it comes with an ingenious head-tracking device that you attach to your VR headset so that the chair rotates in the direction you\u2019re looking.</p> <p>At first the movement is rather unsettling, but as you get used to it, it adds a rather wonderful sense of being physically present in a world, which is perfect for virtual tourism apps as well as multidirectional games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/09/robo-recall-virtual-reality-review-oculus-rift-touch\">Robo Recall</a>. The head-tracking rotation is also meant to cut down on VR motion sickness because it reduces the disparity between the screened activity and our body\u2019s sense of where it is and what it\u2019s doing. (There are also foot pedals to control forward and backward movement, although few games currently support this feature.) It\u2019s expensive at $999 (\u00a3800) \u2013 Roto VR says most of its pre-orders have been from universities, businesses and arcades \u2013 but perhaps if the lockdown goes on much longer, many more living rooms will have one.</p> <p>Even without a revolving chair, VR games and experiences are now providing a true sense of \u201cpresence\u201d, the holy grail of the technology \u2013 and for a few minutes every day, I have genuinely forgotten that I\u2019m standing alone in the living room in my pyjamas swinging my arms about.</p> <p>Here are some of our favourite lockdown apps for VR:</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.everestvirtualreality.com/\">Everest VR: Journey to the Top of the World</a> (Oculus TV; Oculus and Samsung Gear VR)</strong></p> <p>Jaw-on-the-floor VR documentary with crisp visuals.

  "<p>An Australian epidemiologist and member of the World Health Organization\u2019s emergency experts panel has called for the overhaul of a key process which she criticised for delaying by a week the declaration of Covid-19 as an international public health emergency.</p> <p>Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales who also sits on the WHO\u2019s health emergencies program experts advisory panel for Covid-19, said it was a disagreement between WHO member nations, and not the response of the WHO\u2019s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that ultimately slowed down the international escalation of the response to the virus.</p> <p>McLaws also said the newly announced investigation into the origins and response to Covid-19 should examine whether the WHO\u2019s international health regulation committee should have acted quicker to call a meeting earlier than 22 January.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/who-to-agree-deal-over-future-coronavirus-inquiry\">WHO to agree deal over future coronavirus inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She explained that when the committee <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">met on 22 January</a>, members did not all agree to declare a public health emergency of international concern \u2013 a move that requires all 194 WHO member nations to begin preparations and initiate a response to the emergency.

It\u2019s the international health regulation committee ... on that they had a committee that had the US, Australia, Senegal, and Russia and many other countries. They met on the 22nd of January. Now, could they have met earlier? That\u2019s something that WHO might want to look at, [its] processes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened during those meetings, the 22nd and 23rd, those members, the countries, not the WHO, the countries that are on that WHO committee, couldn\u2019t come to a decision about whether it would be a public health emergency of international concern.\u201d</p> <p>McLaws suggested that the WHO reform the requirement for a PHEIC to be declared in a binary sense, and called for gradual levels of the emergency to be called, so that member nations were not as restricted in the domestic health responses they needed to activate if the health issue in question turned out to be less serious than first thought.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that WHO will probably look to change. Can they have a scale, so that when the committee can\u2019t decide, WHO could at least ... officially say, \u2018Look, I think it\u2019s not a zero, not a one, but it\u2019s somewhere in between.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meeting minutes from the international health regulation committee note this \u201cbinary\u201d nature of declaring the PHEIC as a reason why members did not agree to it during the 22 January meeting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">World Health Assembly: what is it, and what is the coronavirus inquiry proposal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf there is a criticism or a change the member states need to take some control as well, because it\u2019s not WHO and WHO staffers that make these calls or do these,\u201d McLaws said. \u201cWHO is run by its member states. So, the member states need to consider how best they can speed things up if the group takes it too slow.\u201d</p> <p>During the webinar, McLaws also criticised epidemiologists who were considering economic impacts, including the connectedness of state economies, in their responses to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cI am just an epidemiologist, I\u2019m not an economist. And so I don\u2019t even bring that [economic impact] into my thinking because my position is to tell it as it is epidemiologically, and let others decide how they feel about doing, like a social experiment to allow it to let it run its course like Sweden, which is abhorrent.\u201d</p> <p>McLaws also cast doubt on the reliability of modelling that predicts case numbers and deaths, arguing the Covid-19 death rates have not allowed sufficient time for recoveries and further deaths to occur before being calculated.</p>",
  "<p>New York faces enormous challenges in its attempts to implement one of the largest contact tracing schemes in the US, as the city prepares to reopen after nearly two months of coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said the state is recruiting an \u201carmy of people to trace each person who tested positive\u201d for an \u201cunprecedented, nation-leading contact tracing programme\u201d. The New York city mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced a new test and trace corps, which he said would \u201clead the way in creating testing and tracing on a level we\u2019ve never seen before in this city or this country\u201d.</p> <p>Contact tracing is considered to be a key pillar of safely lifting stay-at-home orders, and involves asking Covid-19 patients to recall everyone they have had close contact with while they may have been infectious, and asking those people to quarantine themselves to help prevent the virus from spreading. In countries such as South Korea and Germany, early contact tracing has been credited with successfully minimising outbreaks.</p> <p>But as New York authorities roll out their plans to hire and train thousands of contact tracers, experts warn of the difficulties of pulling it off in thecity of 8.6 million in which the pandemic that has killed more than 20,000 people.</p> <p>And De Blasio, who is hiring his own team of 5,000 contact tracers \u2013 separate from the 6,400 to 17,000 being recruited by New York state \u2013 is facing mounting questions over its organisation.</p> <p>Dr Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the former commissioner of the New York City health department, said: \u201cThere are enormous challenges in New York City \u2013 ranging from the extent of the outbreak here, which is still very large, to the mobility of population in metro areas.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the biggest health emergency in more than a century and New York City has had a heartbreaking number of deaths.\u201d</p> <p>Frieden, who is now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, which is working on the state\u2019s contact tracing effort, said other challenges include population density, reliance on public transport, and the amount of travel into the city.</p> <p>\u201cAll the things that we love about New York City \u2026 make it more susceptible and more challenging to do contact tracing.\u201d</p> <p>Large crowded housing, including in nursing homes, correctional facilities and homeless shelters, is also an issue, he said.</p> <p>New York state said contact tracing was already under way, while New York City said it plans to have hired 1,000 tracers by 1 June. Neither city nor state have said how much their programmes will cost. Other US states developing tracing programmes include neighbouring New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as Massachusetts and California.</p> <p>New York City said although previous experience in public health is preferred for tracers, new recruits will be supported and trained by experienced \u201cdisease detectives\u201d. Tracers, they said, will do most of their work on the phone.</p> <p>Frieden said contact tracing is \u201cnot an easy job\u201d and requires an understanding of patient confidentiality, medical terms, principles of exposure, infection and symptoms as well as interpersonal skills and cultural sensitivity.</p> <p>The mayor has come under fire for putting NYC Health and Hospitals (H+H), the city\u2019s public healthcare system, in charge of contact tracing rather than the department of health and mental hygiene (DOHMH), which has historically done it \u2013 including for diseases like tuberculosis and HIV.</p> <p>A group of New York politicians, including senator Gustavo Rivera, have called on De Blasio to reverse the decision. Such was the concern that the city council speaker, Corey Johnson, who said the plan \u201craises a lot of alarm bells\u201d, held a hearing on Friday to investigate.</p> <p>Frieden said the move was \u201ca big mistake\u201d. Adding: \u201cMoving it to an agency that has no experience with it, no legal mandate to do it, no institutional memory of how to do it, will make something that\u2019s very difficult even harder.\u201d</p> <p>Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said it was done to \u201cprioritise continuity, speed and the ability to break down bureaucratic barriers\u201d by \u201chousing testing, tracing and isolation under a single, streamlined entity\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16b2301a14d07f1e10f8a79ddcfb9a75110328ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16b2301a14d07f1e10f8a79ddcfb9a75110328ff/0_163_4879_2928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A contact tracer with Turkey\u2019s health ministry, clad in protective gear, visits a home in Istanbul.

The tracer notifies and interviews each contact, tells them to quarantine for two weeks, and monitors them by text to see if they are showing symptoms.</p> <p>Dr Kelly Henning, who leads Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 public health programme, which is assisting in the hiring process, said the initial interview with the person who has tested positive is key.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise that it won\u2019t be 100% [effective] but the goal is to get as many contacts identified and pulled into the system as quickly as possible to break those chains of transmission.\u201d</p> <p>And if people refuse to cooperate?

On Thursday, five Democrats introduced a bill to protect the health data of consumers using contact tracing technology.</p> <p>Katharina Kopp, deputy director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said: \u201cHistory has taught us that the deployment of technologies is often driven by forces that tend to risk privacy, undermine fairness and equity, and place our civil rights at risk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a65b999dfec1f6a186e5acb18614b95dbd81c345\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a65b999dfec1f6a186e5acb18614b95dbd81c345/0_89_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman displays her phone to doorman, to conform using a mobile application to help contact-tracing at the entrance to the upmarket shopping mall Siam Paragon in Bangkok, Thailand, on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman displays her phone to doorman, to confirm using a mobile application to help contact-tracing at the entrance to the upmarket shopping mall Siam Paragon in Bangkok, Thailand, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Friday\u2019s hearing, Dr Mitch Katz, president and chief executive officer of Health and Hospitals, said they are working on an app, but that \u201cwe are absolutely committed that none of the data that is collected will be shared.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about quarantine enforcement, he said: \u201cWe believe that carrots are much better than sticks.\u201d</p> <p>Bloomberg has said the public health non-profit Vital Strategies, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, is developing three smartphone apps for New York state. But Henning said initially the focus would be on using human contact tracers and that all information would be kept \u201cfully private\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe idea of using humans is the tried and true public health strategy so we have confidence that that will be a successful model \u2013 assuming we have the right number of contact tracers and they\u2019re well-trained and well-supervised.\u201d</p> <p>Amid record unemployment, there has been no shortage of applications. New York City said it had had more than 10,000 people apply and the state has had over 30,000.</p> <p>The online course, which takes five hours to complete and is open to anyone, had 150,000 enrolments in its first week.</p> <p>Student Shernidane Romelus applied to both the state and city to be a contact tracer.

You can fly into them without trouble and legally travel between without having to isolate. But if you are coming from any other state or territory, chances are you will need to quarantine when you arrive back. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Queensland \u2013 </strong>There is currently a hard border closure in Queensland, meaning unless it\u2019s for essential reasons you are not allowed to enter the state. You can return if you are a Queensland resident, but if you have been to a \u201cCovid-19 hotspot\u201d in the last 14 days you must quarantine for two weeks.

It will be providing masks to all passengers and recommending they be worn, but will only require this if a passenger is displaying symptoms during the flight.</p> \n<p>From 1 June it will be mandatory for all passengers on Regional Express flights to wear a mask while travelling unless they are exempt for medical reasons. While you can purchase a mask at the time of your flight, passengers are encouraged to bring their own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/22/bad-neighbour-will-the-cruise-industry-ever-be-the-same-again-after-coronavirus\">'Bad neighbour': will the cruise industry resume its rise in Australia after coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>McLaws notes that if lower grade or cloth face masks are being used passengers should not talk during the flight.</p> \n<p>\u201cCloth masks provide anywhere between 10 and 60% protection. That\u2019s not at the 98% of a hospital-grade mask, therefore the wearer is required not to speak or laugh through the mask. This will push particles through the looser weave.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What else are airlines doing?</h2> \n<p>Qantas has laid out a \u201cfly well\u201d program, which aims to increase safety on all Qantas and Jetstar flights. Measures at airports include contactless check-ins, extra disinfectant stations at terminals and rearranging the Qantas lounge. Onboard there is additional cleaning of aircraft, travellers being asked to limit movements around the cabin, limits on the number of times attendants offer food and drinks, and the provision of alcohol wipes to all passengers.</p> \n<p>Rex will also have mandatory temperature testing of all passengers and Qantas appears to be ramping up this testing as well. On both airlines, travellers with flu-like symptoms will be turned away from flights.<br></p> \n<h2>What if I feel sick on the day of my flight?</h2> \n<p>Along with new safety procedures, Qantas has increased flexibility for all Qantas and Jetstar flights.</p> \n<p>For domestic flights booked between 21 May and 30 June, for travel between 12 June and 31 October, the change of flight fee will be waived one time.</p> \n<p>This means as long as you haven\u2019t already changed your booking, if you wake up with a raised temperature or any flu-like symptoms you are able to reschedule your flight with no charge. If you are denied boarding due to illness you can also be moved to another flight free of charge.</p> \n<p>Rex said that in the event that someone was denied check-in due because they had a high temperature, the airline would allow them to rebook for a later date. Any refund would be considered on a case by case basis.</p> \n<h2>Is it too soon to be planning an interstate holiday?</h2> \n<p>It depends on who you ask, but currently, no states or territories are actively encouraging travellers to come to visit.</p> \n<p>The national cabinet guidelines have suggested 10 July as the time to review interstate travel, however, it\u2019s unclear which states are likely to follow this.</p> \n<p>The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has said the state\u2019s borders would be reviewed at the end of each month, with September floated as a \u201crealistic\u201d timeframe by the state\u2019s chief health officer.</p> \n<p>Previously, the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, said the state border would be lifted \u201cdead last\u201d and Western Australia appears to be on a similar trajectory.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has urged other states to reopen sooner rather than later, and holiday travel inside the state will be allowed from 1 June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The federal tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said he would like to see restriction relaxed in time for the winter tourism boom.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose states who\u2019ve got border controls in place, assuming we\u2019ve continued to see very low rates of transmission of Covid-19, ought to be looking at opening up their borders,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need people moving across this country again when it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, airlines are also keen to see travel begin again.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe look forward hopefully to seeing a lot of you on our flights in July for a holiday,\u201d Joyce said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI encourage you to do your research now and to look at some of the very attractive airfares we\u2019re going to have \u2026 If you need to visit family and friends, now\u2019s the time to start planning.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Art galleries and museums in NSW are scrambling to prepare for visitors again after being somewhat taken by surprise by Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s announcement that they could reopen from 1 June.</p> <p> The announcement, which came alongside an opening up of travel restrictions across the state, came sooner than expected for the gallery and museum sector, which on Tuesday was still waiting for the NSW government to provide clear protocols on how institutions could operate with social distancing.</p> <p> Visitor numbers will be capped according to the 4msq-per-person rule.

At least we are only 30 minutes from Byron Bay, so we\u2019re hoping to attract people who are coming to the area to visit family they haven\u2019t seen for weeks.\u201d</p> <p>There is a lot of work to be done before then.

There will be timed ticketing to control the numbers of people in the building and we\u2019re still working out the social distancing required \u2013 and there won\u2019t be any cloaking. But the beauty of an art museum is that visitors tend to wander around the space and you can take multiple paths and directions.

There is already some self-policing.\u201d</p> <p>Esther Anatolitis, executive director of National Association for the Visual Arts, said it was exciting to imagine spaces reopening, but there was a lot of work to be done. </p> <p>\u201cNot every gallery has the capability to implement timed ticketing \u2013 but more importantly, that\u2019s quite a significant shift away from the welcoming, inclusive spaces that galleries offer.</p> <p>\u201cVisual art, craft and design spaces are freely open to everybody \u2013 there are no barriers. There needs to be good risk management in place, but for months now everybody\u2019s been able to walk into a supermarket and touch anything they like without leaving their name at the door.

  "<p>The greatest public health emergency of our time has been unfolding for at least three months. Yet England\u2019s local public health directors have found themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/05/private-covid-19-tracing-disaster-councils\">struggling to get a hearing</a>, let alone a key role, in the fight against the deadly disease.</p> <p>\u201cIt is remarkable,\u201d says a rueful Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/\">Association of Directors of Public Health</a> (ADPH), their representative body. \u201cI think it reflects a historic lack of understanding of the importance of public health.

Their role is statutory and separate from that of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england\">Public Health England</a> (PHE), the government agency that has faced criticism over its handling of the crisis.</p> <p>Over the past fortnight, the directors have belatedly been drawn closer into national Covid-19 planning: on 7 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/public-health-directors-take-charge-covid-19-testing-care-homes\">the care minister Helen Whately issued a letter</a> admitting that the testing programme for the disease in care homes needed to be \u201cmore joined up\u201d and giving directors lead responsibility to coordinate and prioritise. Last Friday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, pointedly spoke at the daily Covid-19 media briefing of \u201clocal public health officials playing such a critical role\u201d.</p> <p>The directors are now hoping to be influential also in the rollout of community tracking and tracing of Covid-19 carriers: the appointment last week of Tom Riordan, the chief executive of Leeds council, to lead on tracing strategy is being seen as a key pointer.</p> <p>De Gruchy is reluctant to dwell on what might have been. \u201cWe are now being recognised as having an important role. I hope that will continue,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to do much better than handing down decisions to councils with a \u2018made in Westminster\u2019 label. That is what has been happening.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not saying it\u2019s one or the other, national or local. We are saying the scale of this is so large it needs to be multi-agency, a team of teams. Our position is that we want to be as constructive as possible, but as challenging as necessary.\u201d</p> <p>She says her members will use their leadership role to ensure that testing is prioritised according to local needs and that people get clear advice on contact tracing. In a <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/2020/05/statement-of-principles-covid-19-contact-tracing/\">statement of principle</a>s on tracing, published on Monday, the ADPH identified 11 key issues including greater responsiveness, local flexibility and effective data-sharing among relevant agencies, expressing \u201cdisappointment at the limited extent that government has involved local government in all aspects of the test, track and trace programme\u201d.</p> <p>De Gruchy is herself director of public health in Tameside, part of the <a href=\"https://www.gmhsc.org.uk/\">Greater Manchester devolution partnership</a>, and she operates de facto across both local government and the NHS. She says this has made it immeasurably easier to organise <a href=\"https://www.tameside.gov.uk/mentalhealthsupport\">integrated responses</a> to the Covid-19 crisis, especially on tracking and tracing, distribution of personal protective equipment, <a href=\"https://public.tameside.gov.uk/pressreleases/f1030pressreleasestory107.asp?story=2138&amp;keyword=\">domestic abuse under lockdown</a> and humanitarian measures. Some of her staff have been seconded to food banks.</p> <p>Elsewhere, however, argument persists over the wisdom of the <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06844\">transfer of public health duties from the NHS in England to local government</a> in 2013. And the crisis has <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">raked over the coals</a>. Would the overall response have been better, some ask, if the function had remained in the health service alongside hospital and community services?</p> <p>De Gruchy insists not. \u201cWe absolutely need to be in local government,\u201d she says. \u201cWe feel strongly that given the range of influences on health and wellbeing \u2013 and remember that healthcare contributes to only<a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-health-care-improvement/the-contribution-of-the-health-and-care-system-to-improving-health\"> 10% to 20% of all our health</a> \u2013 we are in exactly the right place to bring about change.</p> <p>\u201cBut more than that, the NHS is fundamentally just not set up to focus resources on [illness] prevention. Yes it\u2019s one of the best healthcare systems in the world, but its main focus is still on acute hospital care. And that\u2019s where the money goes.\u201d</p> <p>She concedes that the cause of public health in local government in England was not helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/england-public-health-coronavirus-cuts-regional\">cuts totalling \u00a3850m</a> in its earmarked government grant between 2014-15 and 2019-20. Research has suggested that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/05/poorest-hit-hardest-by-cuts-to-public-health-spending-research\">burden of resulting service reductions fell heaviest on deprived inner-city communities</a>. In mid-March this year, just as Covid-19 was taking hold, ministers made an exceptionally late announcement of a real-terms <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/response-to-public-health-grant\">increase of \u00a3145m in grant for 2020-21</a>.</p> <p>While welcoming the boost, De Gruchy reckons the system still needs \u00a3850m to get back to where it was in 2014, after allowing for population change. And she fears the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-crisis-english-councils-funding-shortfall\">impact of the present crisis </a>on local government finances. \u201cThere needs to be proper recognition of the importance of \u2018local\u2019 to really get us out of this crisis \u2013 and if you recognise local, you have to fund local.\u201d</p> <p>Brought up in South Africa, where she qualified as a hospital doctor, De Gruchy moved in the late 1990s to the UK where she found her public health vocation and further trained for the role. She thinks the experience of growing up under apartheid primarily shaped her strong belief in social justice, but she also credits her family background \u2013 she comes, she says, from \u201ca family of theologians\u201d \u2013 and her experience as a gay woman. Covid permitting, she plans to marry her partner next January in a ceremony in South Africa.</p> <p>She thinks the crisis has laid bare the deep inequalities in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s held up a mirror to society,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s people from particular deprived communities who are dying, it\u2019s people from BME communities, it\u2019s older people in care homes which have been calling for improved funding for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to normal after this. There are some things about normal I really liked, like seeing my friends and family, going out for a meal once in a while and, yes, going to the hairdresser. But the normal I don\u2019t want to go back to is hidden inequalities, hidden poverty, hidden discrimination against groups of people.

  "<p>The big debate over the past few days has been whether it\u2019s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable. However, this isn\u2019t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it\u2019s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are <em>safe enough</em> to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.</p> <p>In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/rushed-and-premature-parents-reveal-fears-over-schools-reopening-amid-covid-19-crisis\">parents</a> alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.</p> <p>That scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31103-X/fulltext\">A recent study in the Lancet</a> found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don\u2019t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can\u2019t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.</p> <p>Elsewhere, we see that Denmark, Norway, Germany and New Zealand are starting to reopen their schools, which raises the question of why those countries might be in a position to do so while the UK is not. Politicians desperate for answers point to a <a href=\"http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2020-04/NCIRS%20NSW%20Schools%20COVID_Summary_FINAL%20public_26%20April%202020.pdf\">preliminary study </a>from New South Wales in Australia that found that \u201cclose contact\u201d in schools resulted in very little transmission. However, one major caveat is that research was conducted during a period when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">attendance had dropped to 5%</a>, enabling true physical distancing. In addition, early widespread implementation of <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-contact-tracing\">community testing, contact tracing and isolation</a> of carriers across the country has helped to manage the number of cases. Australia is therefore easing its lockdown against a background of solid control of the virus. The lesson from there and other nations with similarly effective regimes is that the UK needs to suppress the virus and ensure that public health infrastructure is ready to detect new infections and identify clusters rapidly.</p> <p>Given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2020-05-11/students-in-denmark-go-to-school-in-soccer-stadium-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium</a>, that aren\u2019t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils \u2013 because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities \u2013 or to focus on older pupils \u2013 because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead \u2013 is a political one.</p> <p>Flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.</p> <p>Given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented \u2013 and then only if \u201ctest, trace, isolate\u201d, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.</p> <p>The tragedy is that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">countries </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">that moved the fastest and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">\u201ccrunched the curve\u201d</a> are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what\u2019s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">UK government\u2019s poor decisions</a> over the past 12 weeks.</p> <p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

  "<p>People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to die of Covid-19 than those with type 2, according to NHS research confirming that diabetes significantly increases coronavirus sufferers\u2019 risk of dying.</p> <p>Almost one in three of all deaths from coronavirus among people in hospital in England during the pandemic have been associated with diabetes, according to the study.</p> <p>People with type 1 diabetes \u2013 the autoimmune form of the disease \u2013 are three-and-a-half times more likely to die if they catch Covid-19 than non-diabetics, while type 2 diabetics \u2013 those with the form closely linked to being overweight \u2013 are twice as likely to die as non-diabetics. Nine out of 10 diabetics have type 2, and many are obese.</p> <p>Age, however, is the biggest determining risk factor for death among those with either form of diabetes who get Covid-19. Under-40s have a very low risk compared with those over 40, and especially compared with older people, according to new findings collated by NHS England. People with type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood, tend to be younger than those with type 2. </p> <p>Last week, separate findings suggested that a quarter of coronavirus-related deaths were among people with diabetes. The findings have not yet been subjected to peer review but will soon be published in a leading medical journal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/one-in-four-people-who-died-in-uk-hospitals-with-covid-19-had-diabetes\">Quarter of Covid-19 deaths in English hospitals were of diabetics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So far during the pandemic, 7,466 people who died in hospital in England had type 2 diabetes and 365 had type 1. </p> <p>Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for diabetes and obesity and the study\u2019s lead author, said: \u201cThis research shows the extent of the risk of coronavirus for people with diabetes and the different risks for those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, it also shows that higher blood glucose levels and obesity further increase the risk in both types of diabetes.\u201d</p> <p>Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, said: \u201cBacterial infections are more common and more severe in diabetes. This has generally not been thought to be such a problem with viral infections such as coronavirus, but any severe infection can cause problems with insulin control so this too will likely contribute to the increased mortality rate in type 1 patients.</p> <p>\u201cSo diabetic patients are probably not at greater risk of catching coronavirus, but do have a greater risk of becoming seriously ill if they do catch it.\u201d</p> <p>The study also found that the overall death rate for people with diabetes doubled in the early stages of the pandemic. Among both type 1 and type 2 patients, men, BAME people and those living in more deprived communities were at higher risk. In both types of sufferer, those with underlying kidney disease or heart failure and/or who previously had a stroke, were also at higher risk.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2020 to amend references to diabetes that did not adhere to house style guidelines.</p>",

  "<p>\u2018It\u2019s everything. Tourism feeds me and my daughter. It lets me give jobs to 22 people. It goes into the whole community,\u201d says Naima Montejo, owner of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SurfMedsCaribe/\">Surf Meds Caribe</a>, the only female-run surf school on Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean coast.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been planting, growing food, trying to come back to our roots,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s not much money, so we\u2019ve been trading. Some trees or seeds, some yucca or plantain. We switch. People are getting together, being creative. What we <em>can </em>do is help each other.\u201d</p> <p>Montejo lives in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, a coastal town known for surf, three-toed sloths and an eight-mile stretch of jungle-edged sandy beach (now behind police tape). With a tropical climate and jubilant mix of Tico, African-Caribbean, indigenous and nearly 70 more nationalities, it touts pared-back beach life and an offbeat Caribbean vibe: languid yet lively. Much of the region is nature reserve. Most of its residents remember a time when the only route to town was the beach and, like a lot of the country, tourism is its lifeforce.</p> <p>Puerto Viejo has been \u201cshut\u201d since 16 March, when Costa Rica declared a state of emergency, and then closed borders, businesses and beaches in quick succession. The country\u2019s mantra, main greeting and answer to all questions, <em>pura vida</em> (literally, pure life), was traded for <em>qu\u00e9date en casa</em> (stay at home).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92d8e784eb7784b6fe19a2aaee01c11943bedbbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92d8e784eb7784b6fe19a2aaee01c11943bedbbf/0_434_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The beach at Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beach at Puerto Viejo de Talamanca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassia Geller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the exception of a local <em>ley seca </em>(dry law) banning booze sales \u2013 quietly dropped in April \u2013 the general view is that the swift, strict response worked. With its hotels and rental homes shuttered and driving access restricted, remote Puerto Viejo has no registered cases (or hospitals).</p> <p>But running a surf school when the beach is behind police tape, you have no students and strict social distancing is in place \u201chas been hard on all of us,\u201d says Montejo, whose team are all ardent pro-level surfers \u201cusually more in the water than out\u201d.</p> <p>With lessons off, Montejo has got back into landscaping and garden design, and her work as a jeweller. Making ends meet \u201ctakes a lot more energy,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the only thing that really worries me is the guys: a lot of them live from teaching.\u201d</p> <p>Tourism and local livelihoods are inextricable. \u201cIt\u2019s 99.5% of our economy. Other regions have plantations, commerce, ports; we have tourism,\u201d says Roger Sans, who had the dubious honour of becoming president of the <em>C\u00e1mara de Turismo y Comercio Caribe Sur</em> a week before the borders closed. After launching a <em>qu\u00e9date-en-casa</em> campaign, his second act was to open a food bank. It has delivered food parcels to more than 1,000 families.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"834a5b6cd3825cffb274a75aa7073f58e1f70750\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834a5b6cd3825cffb274a75aa7073f58e1f70750/0_322_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puerto Viejo de Talamanca on Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puerto Viejo de Talamanca is on Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassia Geller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The World Tourism Organization estimates the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">Covid-19 crisis could cut international tourist arrivals (around the world) by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">up to 80%</a> compared with 2019, threatening more than 100 million jobs in the process. In Costa Rica, more money is made in foreign exchange through tourism than via exports such as coffee, bananas, pineapples and pharmaceuticals combined. Official figures, from 2016, documented just over 210,000 people (then 8.8% of the population) working in tourism.</p> <p>The government is paying out a monthly unemployment \u201cbonus\u201d, but only to those \u201cofficially\u201d employed before the crisis. Which leaves out the casual workers, from fishermen to bike rental people, who usually cater to the 400,000 international visitors Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean area sees every year. Many of this number, plus thousands more Costa Ricans, come especially for Semana Santa, Easter week. Last year, hostel Selina, in Puerto Viejo, sold 1,045 beds between 14 and 20 April.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like it,\u201d says Mat\u00edas Llaituqueo, who runs <a href=\"https://www.costaricaspanishteachers.com/\">Spanish language classes</a> , as well as managing a local hotel and several Airbnb properties. He moved to Puerto Viejo from Argentina 13 years ago. \u201cSemana Santa is incredible here: the people, the traffic, it\u2019s so busy. But this year, nothing. No people on the street: like a ghost town.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d54b74b0783caaeaacbd1a93115f77328659f8e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54b74b0783caaeaacbd1a93115f77328659f8e0/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mat\u00edas Llaituqueo, right, who provides Spanish language classes; pictured with is daughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mat\u00edas Llaituqueo, right, who provides Spanish language classes; pictured with his daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassia Geller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tourist exodus left established expats and a smattering of travellers, including several escapees from Panama\u2019s locked-down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/lockdown-leaves-festivalgoers-stranded-on-beach-with-sewage-problem\">Tribal Gathering festival</a>. Some are pleased to wait out the pandemic jungle-side; others are concerned about the start of dengue season and the flesh-eating <em>papalomoyo</em> parasite (fun to say, terrible to have).</p> <p>Of the unafflicted expats, many are following the worldwide upskilling trend. Llaituqueo\u2019s Spanish classes have, if anything, increased: \u201cPeople want to use their time well,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t move, they can\u2019t travel, they can\u2019t go to the beach \u2013 so they decide to learn.\u201d</p> <p>The staff at Aguas Claras hotel are also learning: \u201cOur chef is helping out the gardeners, our receptionist is painting chairs, and our manager is helping set up jungle night-lights,\u201d says co-owner Elena Rohrmoser. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all delivering groceries for the families of the<em> </em>schoolchildren in [the nearby village of] Manzanillo. You can\u2019t keep everyone hanging on not doing anything.\u201d</p> <p>Rohrmoser and her mother \u2013 both originally from the capital, San Jos\u00e9 \u2013 opened the hotel a year and a half ago. They\u2019re now facing relative inaction until the end of the year. \u201cIt had just started happening,\u201d Rohrmoser says. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, to give opportunities to so many people and now try to maintain things, keep jobs and keep a sense of perspective.\u201d</p> <p>This week, Costa Rica\u2019s boutique hotels, restaurants and national parks have reopened at limited capacity, while the beach is accessible from 5am-8am. But the impact has already been felt. Shevonne Newton set up <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PVesenciales/\">Puerto Viejo Esenciales</a> to supplement official food banks with necessities such as cooking gas and pet food, but found the need for food was far more urgent.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting dozens of calls a day, from all over,\u201d says Newton, who says there are approximately 7,000 people in Talamanca who need food right now. Already 20% of Costa Rica\u2019s population falls below the national poverty level.</p> <p>\u201cThis has just made it more extreme,\u201d she says. \u201cLocals were already struggling. Now they definitely don\u2019t have their gardening or their cooking positions. Without tourism the businesses just go under.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a3c5f1b76590aa33f6c5871fc5b8e96e05695df1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3c5f1b76590aa33f6c5871fc5b8e96e05695df1/0_101_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sloth Conservation Foundation\u2019s Becky Cliffe, and brown-throated sloth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sloth Conservation Foundation\u2019s Becky Cliffe, and brown-throated sloth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzi Eszterhas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impact may go beyond people and harm the environment, too. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask people to prioritise conservation when they\u2019re struggling to eat,\u201d says Becky Cliffe, who runs the <a href=\"https://slothconservation.com/\">Sloth Conservation Foundation</a> in Puerto Viejo and holds a PhD in sloth behaviour. Fewer visitors means fewer cars, and fewer tourists harassing the town\u2019s sloth residents, she says. But on the other hand, the crisis can \u201cmean the exploitation of nature: hunting, cutting down trees for wood \u2013 and lost income for the rescue centres\u201d.</p> <p>Nature guide Abel Bustamante agrees: \u201cMany conservation programmes are closed because there are no volunteers. We go to the beach first thing to stop people taking turtle eggs and selling or eating them. Sadly, they mean money or food, and you don\u2019t think about sustainability when you need to eat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25c5ab8bdf11e497d8f05ca558017d08b352bafd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c5ab8bdf11e497d8f05ca558017d08b352bafd/0_147_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abel Bustamante near a beach in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abel Bustamante</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Abel Bustantamente</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The community is using the time to preserve its cherished <em>pura vida</em>, with landlocked surfers reforesting the beachside areas affected by erosion: \u201cWe used to come out of the water, grab some mango, eat right there and go back to surf \u2013 but these trees have disappeared,\u201d says Montejo. \u201cTourism picked up really quickly here. Hopefully, after this we can manage it more respectfully.\u201d </p> <p>There\u2019s a lot to work out: from how to run a biosecure hotel to how to teach surfing in a world of social distancing.

  "<p>Public trust in the travel industry has plunged to an all-time low as airlines and holiday companies continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/big-uk-airlines-and-travel-firms-denying-refunds-which-coronavirus\">deny and delay refunds</a> for coronavirus cancellations, in breach of the law, according to new research from a UK consumer group.</p> <p>The latest consumer insight tracker from Which? reveals that trust in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">airlines</a> and holiday companies has slumped from a net score of nine in February 2020 to -12 in May 2020, a fall of 21 points and the lowest in the seven years of collecting the data.</p> <p>Researchers asked more than 2,000 people about their trust in airlines and holiday operators between 13 and 15 May \u2013 eight weeks after the UK\u2019s lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/09/can-we-claim-travel-insurance-now-foreign-office-advice-indefinite-travel\">halted non-essential foreign travel indefinitely</a>. Just 22% said they trust these industries, while 34% said they did not trust them.</p> <p>This compares with 32% of people saying they trusted the sectors in February \u2013 shortly after the coronavirus outbreak began in the UK \u2013 and 23% saying they did not trust airlines and holiday companies.</p> <p>It is only the second time since Which?\u2019s records began that the net score for trust in airlines and holiday companies has dropped below zero. The previous occasion was after the collapse of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/23/thomas-cook-as-the-world-turned-the-sun-ceased-to-shine-on-venerable-tour-operator\">Thomas Cook</a> in September 2019, when it decreased to -1%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/big-uk-airlines-and-travel-firms-denying-refunds-which-coronavirus\">Last month</a> Which? said all of the UK\u2019s major airlines and holiday companies were openly breaking the law by delaying refunds for cancelled trips or removing customers\u2019 refund rights. The industry\u2019s own estimates suggested that up to \u00a37bn of travellers\u2019 money was affected.</p> <p>Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said:\u201cThese latest figures are a damning indictment of the behaviour of many airlines and holiday companies in recent weeks. With customers being told to either wait months for their money back or accept a voucher that may prove worthless if a company fails, it should come as a surprise to no one that trust has plummeted so drastically.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He urged the industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to \u201ccome down strongly on any airlines found to be systemically denying or delaying refunds for cancelled flights and holidays\u201d and for the government to set out how it will support the industry and restore trust in the sector.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: \u201cThe impact of Covid-19 on UK aviation has been severe and truly unprecedented, with a huge increase in cancellations following travel restrictions and lockdowns around the world. Airlines continue to face a far higher volume of refund claims than normal. They are doing everything they can to work through the backlog and thank customers for their patience.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, the UK\u2019s independent watchdog said some rail commuters are waiting six weeks or more for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/rail-season-ticket-holders-coronavirus-refund\">a refund on their season ticket</a>. The new survey from Transport Focus found that more than a third of passengers holding season tickets had not yet received a refund. In addition, six out of 10 passengers hadn\u2019t been kept informed how long their claim could take.</p>",
  "<p>The director Robert Altman used to tell Peter Gallagher, the suave star of his 1992 movie The Player: \u201cGallagher, you\u2019re so good-looking it makes me sick.\u201d To hear Gallagher impersonating the gruff auteur, it was not quite a compliment. But he was used to that.</p> <p>During a heated rehearsal for The Real Thing, Gallagher\u2019s breakout role on Broadway at the age of 29, another director, Mike Nichols, admitted to not being able to stand the sight of him. \u201cAnd we were close!\u201d says Gallagher cheerfully, speaking over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. He responded by growing an \u201cawful white goatee\u201d until Nichols pleaded for him to shave.</p> <p>Critiques of Gallagher\u2019s performance often linger on his looks. They seem integral to the cocksure ne\u2019er-do-wells he plays: from a vengeful spouse in Altman\u2019s Short Cuts, to a lawyer sleeping with his wife\u2019s sister in Sex, Lies and Videotape, to the braggadocious \u201creal estate king\u201d in American Beauty. Altman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/archives/film-an-actor-in-search-of-elusive-lady-luck.html\">said he cast</a> Gallagher as a shortcut to character, just his face communicating \u201chandsome, vain, sleazy\u201d.</p> <p>Even at 64, Gallagher continues to play bad guys: an absent father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/26/new-girl-screwball-comedy-gets-funnier-and-smarter-and-is-best-when-binged\">in the sitcom New Girl</a>, a three-time divorcee and white-collar criminal in Netflix\u2019s Grace and Frankie. \u201cIt has a lot to do with how I look,\u201d he agrees. \u201cWhen I was younger, I had the kind of face that if <em>I</em> saw me walking down the street, I\u2019d say: \u2018What an asshole! Look at that rich kid who\u2019s had everything handed to him! Fuck him!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet Gallagher has little in common with his privileged parts. From working-class Irish-Catholic stock, he carved out a 40-year career in show business by \u201cshowing up\u201d, he says. \u201cThe only thing I know is you\u2019ve got to be willing to work harder than everybody else.\u201d Even now, quarantining at home, Gallagher is practising singing daily, so as to \u201cnot completely go to seed\u201d.</p> <p>The character he seems most like is Sandy Cohen, the statesmanly patriarch of the 00s teen-dramedy The OC, one of television\u2019s greatest-ever dads. \u201cAfter Bill Cosby fell a few spots \u2026\u201d he jokes drily. As a father, to film-maker James and musician Kathryn, Gallagher says: \u201cI try to be Sandy Cohen. I never, ever wanted my kids to see me angry, because I know that anger just stops a kid. It chokes everything off.\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher\u2019s own childhood was characterised by that emotional instability. \u201cThe impression was we were always sort of living on the edge.\u201d He was born in New York City in 1955, the unplanned youngest of three. He was close to his mother, a bacteriologist, but for much of his childhood she suffered from social anxiety and depression, which he connects to her parents\u2019 experience of emigrating to the US from Ireland. \u201cShe would be unable to get out of bed, and I had to take care of her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca5e7ffaf759a7b3f875c5c8d11fee694d7b3184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca5e7ffaf759a7b3f875c5c8d11fee694d7b3184/0_0_1536_1001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Kathleen York in The OC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Kathleen York in The OC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gallagher\u2019s parents, both of whom are dead, fought constantly. He remembers, at age six, seeing the family\u2019s brand-new television sailing through the air. \u201cI used to pray for them to get divorced, it was just so noisy sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Later, as an adult, he saw the love between them, and \u201cthat there was grace to be maybe had, if you stayed the course\u201d. That has informed his own marriage, to Paula Harwood, a former producer turned interior designer, whom he met in his first year at Tufts University in Massachusetts. This month they mark their 37th<strong> </strong>wedding anniversary, which is, says Gallagher, \u201cembarrassing for Hollywood\u201d.</p> <p>But his relationship with his father \u2013 a second world war veteran and advertising executive \u2013 casts a long shadow. Gallagher describes a distant, dismissive figure. \u201cI would try my whole life to reach him, just to get him to respond to me. \u2018Dad, what were you in the war?\u2019 \u2018A general. Now go clean the gutters.\u2019 \u2018Dad, what are taxes?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Young Gallagher took his father\u2019s indifference as a personal failing. In his career \u2013 he says, in that cogent way that comes with therapy \u2013 he sought out surrogates such as Nichols, Altman and his co-stars Jack Lemmon and Peter O\u2019Toole. Lemmon gave Gallagher a set of golf clubs. O\u2019Toole took him to a football game.</p> <p>On stage, following a script, Gallagher felt liberated, finally confident he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing anything wrong\u201d. In fact, he was getting enough right to land the part of Danny Zuko in Grease on Broadway, from an open audition in 1978. Yet he was not immune from the fickleness of show business. He notes the irony of \u201cthe best creative experience I ever had\u201d \u2013 1984\u2019s The Real Thing, alongside Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons \u2013 precipitating his quarter-life crisis of confidence. Despite all his promise, opportunities dried up. Now Gallagher blames his agent; then it coalesced with his \u201cself-loathing, lack of confidence\u201d and childhood trauma. \u201cI started to question every morsel of my being until I couldn\u2019t really function.\u201d</p> <p>Even in his depression, Gallagher recognised he was at a \u201ctransition point \u2026 I could keep banging my head against the wall and have a tragic outcome \u2013 or pay attention to what was going on inside.\u201d He quit the play and started over, with therapy and acting classes. \u201cIt was like a key into a lock.\u201d</p> <p>Focusing on the craft allowed Gallagher to distance himself from the outcome \u2013 for better and worse. What he identifies as his career low, the 1992 Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls, was a critical and commercial hit. But Gallagher felt boxed in by the director, prevented from giving his best; that \u201crough treatment\u201d led him to avoid musicals for 25 years.</p> <p>\u201cWhen something works in show business, it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d says Gallagher \u2013 so he has little time for big egos making it harder. Seeing someone get fired on a film set \u201cjust for a power thing\u201d made a lasting impression. \u201cOne of the most toxic things in the world is success. I\u2019ve seen people think they have all the answers, like: \u2018If I\u2019ve succeeded at this, then there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t succeed at!\u2019 You want to say: \u2018Dude \u2013 you\u2019re a member of the effin\u2019 lucky club.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Given his consistent career, it could seem surprising that Gallagher never made it as a leading man. In 1993 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/archives/film-an-actor-in-search-of-elusive-lady-luck.html\">the New York Times noted</a> how \u201clady luck\u201d was resistant to his \u201clubricious charm\u201d. Gallagher puts it down to his inability with self-promotion. For years he wanted to prove that \u201cit\u2019s not who you know, it\u2019s how good you are\u201d \u2013 but, he laughs: \u201cThat\u2019s fucking stupid, because [who you know] means a lot. I just don\u2019t have the confidence socially.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, he says: \u201cI think the whole idea of stardom is kind of baloney; I never really bought into it. I wouldn\u2019t have had the skills, the way of thinking \u2026 I\u2019ve seen the people who have achieved it, and what they\u2019ve done to get there.\u201d</p> <p>There is more freedom to being a character actor, he says; more scope to surprise. The benefit to playing bad guys is that the parts were often underwritten. \u201cThey just wanted him to be an asshole \u2026 so it gave me a little elbow room,\u201d says Gallagher. In the 1995 romcom While You Were Sleeping, he resisted the writers\u2019 attempt to zhoosh up his character by making him an \u201cawful person\u201d, instead of just poorly suited to Sandra Bullock. \u201cWhy burden the audience with someone to hate? There\u2019s just more opportunity in playing the character truthfully.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06194627b46afc7ed6b5045f1b3b08f5d8d5aacb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06194627b46afc7ed6b5045f1b3b08f5d8d5aacb/0_0_1780_1185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Laura San Giacomo in Sex, Lies, and Videotape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Laura San Giacomo in Sex, Lies, and Videotape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Virgin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He served as a similar check on The OC. At just 26, the showrunner, Josh Schwartz, was open to his input on \u201cthe parent stuff\u201d, says Gallagher \u2013 so each week he and Harwood would go through the script: \u201cAw, jeez, if I said that, they should just send me to social services.\u201d \u201cMischa [Barton, who played troubled young Marissa Cooper] spends the night with my business partner, and I\u2019m supposed to say: \u2018That\u2019s cool\u2019? No way!\u201d</p> <p>For all the writers\u2019 occasional \u201ccapriciousness\u201d, Gallagher says The OC was successful because of \u201cthe organism of the ensemble\u201d \u2013 and the timing. Post 9/11 the US had \u201crun with the wrong ball\u201d, closing borders and embracing xenophobia, \u201cthe most cowardly, un-American thing\u201d. Sandy Cohen was a corrective: a principled public defender, a New York Jew married to a gentile Californian, \u201cnot afraid to welcome others into his home. I thought that was the perfect story to be telling.\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher sees parallels with his latest project, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist\">Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist</a>, which just concluded its first season on NBC (E4 in the UK). In the whimsical musical dramedy, Zoey hears others\u2019 private thoughts as songs \u2013 highlighting, for Gallagher, the importance of a sympathetic ear \u201cin an era when we\u2019ve been intentionally divided\u201d.</p> <p>The Trump presidency has special significance for born-and-bred New Yorkers, he says sombrely. \u201cWe knew his father was a white supremacist,\u201d he says, but they didn\u2019t take Donald seriously until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">his attacks on the Central Park Five</a>, a group of black teenagers who were wrongly convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman. \u201cWe realised he was no longer funny; there was a darkness, and a willingness to do harm.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to look to Trump for Buddy Kane, Gallagher\u2019s ludicrous character in American Beauty: \u201cI thought, who has the hugest opinion of themselves in real estate?\u201d Gallagher was made heavier and older, and approximated the \u201cpouffey thing going on\u201d with an old wig of Cary Grant\u2019s. \u201cSo when I was in bed with Annette Bening, Cary Grant was on top of her.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years on, it is \u201cheartbreaking\u201d, says Gallagher, to see the country \u201cbamboozled by this con man \u2026 It really feels like they left the back door of the Capitol open.\u201d He mimes a bandit, egging others on. \u201cTake anything you can and get the hell out before they catch on! You want the parks?\u201d</p> <p>And amid coronavirus, the stakes have never been higher. Gallagher winces: \u201cIt\u2019s a little painful, having been raised by a bacteriologist mother, to hear someone blatantly disregarding science.\u201d His mother had helped to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/17/health/17romansky.html\">develop the</a> Romansky formula during the second world war, revolutionising the administration of penicillin. She died in 2004 after a 20-year struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d150f136cb59fa8082c50c2ca39023c43098de80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d150f136cb59fa8082c50c2ca39023c43098de80/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Jane Levy in Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Jane Levy in Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The experience informed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/04/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist-review-musical-dramedy-hits-all-the-wrong-notes\">his role in Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist;</a> he plays Zoey\u2019s father, who is paralysed by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a somewhat similar brain disease. \u201cWhat gave me some relief was that PSP doesn\u2019t always find the same expression in people,\u201d says Gallagher. The series creator, Austin Winsberg, whose father died of PSP, was also a check. \u201cI knew that if I was screwing it up, he\u2019d go: \u2018No!\u2019 And if he was leaving because he had to cry, I thought: \u2018I\u2019m in the ballpark.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher has been gratified by praise from people with experience of PSP, or of caring for a parent \u2013 but some criticised his casting, as an able-bodied actor. What is his view: that disabled parts should go to disabled actors? That there is a limit to the experience that can be portrayed by acting? Gallagher flips the question: \u201cI would say, people with disabilities shouldn\u2019t be automatically excluded from playing any role.\u201d He notes that one episode features deaf actors and musical numbers in sign language. And \u201chard and fast rules about who should do what\u201d do not recognise the hurdles a project has to clear in order to get made, he says, with mounting (and somewhat surprising) impatience.</p> <p>The answer, as he sees it, is more, and more diverse stories \u2013 and by that measure progress is fast. He points to Grace and Frankie, in which he plays Jane Fonda\u2019s love interest. \u201cWhat an extraordinarily disruptive notion: people older than 25 have life experience that deserves investigation and sharing!\u201d he says with good-natured sarcasm. \u201cAnd, my God \u2013 there are people 25 and under that want to watch!\u201d</p> <p>It is the chance to be part of those stories that have \u201ca place in the world\u201d that keeps Gallagher singing his scales in quarantine and, he believes, will see show business through the challenge of coronavirus. \u201cBroadway was supposed to be over with 9/11; it turned out to be exactly what the world needed. And what are people doing in quarantine? They\u2019re watching a lot of Netflix. Because these stories are important.\u201d</p> <p>And even the bad guys have a part. Days after 9/11, Gallagher was asked to go to Ground Zero to boost the morale of emergency workers who had missed out on visits from the president and the Yankees. \u201cThe fires were still burning, the smell of death \u2026\u201d Gallagher\u2019s last big picture had been American Beauty. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018What have I done with my life?

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million</strong></h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</p> <h2><strong>Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The US President told reporters at a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting-17/\">cabinet meeting</a> that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus</strong></h2> <p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared to over 320,000 deaths worldwide.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases</strong></h2> <p>Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full.</p> <h2><strong>Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief</strong></h2> <p>Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%.</p> <h2><strong>US President claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump claimed a recent United States study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">\u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d</a>. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

The beginning of the spring semester has been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online.</p> <h2><strong>China gears up for annual congress</strong></h2> <p>China\u2019s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy. The annual gatherings have been occasions for the Communist Party to tout its achievements, set the country\u2019s economic agenda and consolidate Xi\u2019s power, but this year\u2019s congress comes on the back of the biggest challenge of Xi\u2019s political life, with a virus that has killed thousands of people, paralysed the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and sparked a bout of online criticism of the government.</p> <h2><strong>WHO assembly passes a resolution to investigate global pandemic response</strong></h2> <p>Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/member-states-back-who-after-renewed-donald-trump-attack\">None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections</a> to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.

  "<p>A former Apple contractor who helped blow the whistle on the company\u2019s programme to listen to users\u2019 Siri recordings has decided to go public, in protest at the lack of action taken as a result of the disclosures.</p> <p>In a letter announcing his decision, sent to all European data protection regulators, Thomas le Bonniec said: \u201cIt is worrying that Apple (and undoubtedly not just Apple) keeps ignoring and violating fundamental rights and continues their massive collection of data.</p> <p>\u201cI am extremely concerned that big tech companies are basically wiretapping entire populations despite European citizens being told the EU has one of the strongest data protection laws in the world. Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.\u201d</p> <p>Le Bonniec, 25, worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Cork offices, transcribing user requests in English and French, until he quit in the summer of 2019 due to ethical concerns with the work. \u201cThey do operate on a moral and legal grey area,\u201d he told the Guardian at the time, \u201cand they have been doing this for years on a massive scale. They should be called out in every possible way.\u201d</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings\">revelations</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/06/apple-rewrote-siri-to-deflect-questions-about-feminism\">Le Bonniec</a> and his colleagues, Apple promised sweeping changes to its \u201cgrading\u201d program, which involved thousands of contractors listening to recordings made, both accidentally and deliberately, using Siri. The company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/apple-apologises-listen-siri-recordings\">apologised</a>, brought the work in-house, and promised that it would only grade recordings from users who had explicitly opted-in to the practice.</p> <p>\u201cWe realise we have not been fully living up to our high ideals,\u201d the company said in a statement in August. It eventually released a software update in late October that allowed users to opt-in or out of their voice recordings being used to \u201cimprove Siri dictation\u201d, and to choose to delete the recordings that Apple had stored. The company also emphasised that, unlike its competition, Siri recordings are never linked to a specific Apple account.</p> <p>But, Le Bonniec argues, the company never really faced the consequences for its years-long programme in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cI listened to hundreds of recordings every day, from various Apple devices (eg. iPhones, Apple Watches, or iPads). These recordings were often taken outside of any activation of Siri, eg in the context of an actual intention from the user to activate it for a request. These processings were made without users being aware of it, and were gathered into datasets to correct the transcription of the recording made by the device,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe recordings were not limited to the users of Apple devices, but also involved relatives, children, friends, colleagues, and whoever could be recorded by the device. The system recorded everything: names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, background noises, films, and conversations. I heard people talking about their cancer, referring to dead relatives, religion, sexuality, pornography, politics, school, relationships, or drugs with no intention to activate Siri whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cThese practices are clearly at odds with the company\u2019s \u2018privacy-driven\u2019 policies and should be urgently investigated by data protection authorities and Privacy watchdogs. With the current statement, I want to bring this issue to your attention, and also offer my cooperation to provide any element substantiating these facts. Although this case has already gone public, Apple has not been subject to any kind of investigation to the best of my knowledge.\u201d</p>",
