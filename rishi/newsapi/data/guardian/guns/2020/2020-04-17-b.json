  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global death toll exceeds 150,000</h2> <p>At least 2.2m have been infected worldwide and at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e9a04b88f08bade1f2955ef#block-5e9a04b88f08bade1f2955ef\">153,177 people have died since the outbreak began</a>, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>The figures, which are based on official data and media reports, are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes.</p> <h2>War veteran raises \u00a320m for health service</h2> <p>Capt Tom Moore, the British second world war veteran who sought sponsorship to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e99fc858f080ee110447103#block-5e99fc858f080ee110447103\">raised more than \u00a320m for National Health Service charities</a>.</p> <p>Moore has been hailed as a \u201cone-man fundraising machine\u201d by the Duke of Cambridge.</p> <h2>Chile to become first country to issue \u2018immunity cards\u2019</h2> <p>Chile will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e99e39a8f08b7689b03085f#block-5e99e39a8f08b7689b03085f\">become the first country</a> to issue \u201cimmunity cards\u201d to those who have recovered from Covid-19, exempting holders from quarantine so that they can return to work.</p> <p>Chile\u2019s health minister announced that some of the cards will be issued according to the presence of antibodies to the virus, despite difficulties in producing reliable tests.</p> <h2>French death toll exceeds 18,000</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e99e5bf8f08b7689b030874#block-5e99e5bf8f08b7689b030874\">According to the most recent official data</a>, 18,681 people have now died in France; an increase of 761 in 24 hours. The death toll in hospitals rose to 11,478 from 11,060, while fatalities in nursing homes rose to 7,203 from 6,860 on Thursday.</p> <h2>US using pandemic to unlawfully expel asylum seekers, says UN</h2> <p>An unprecedented US policy that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-asylum-seekers-coronavirus-law-un\">uses the pandemic as grounds</a> to summarily expel people who have migrated to or sought asylum in the country violates international law, the United Nations warns.</p> <h2>More than 14,000 have died in UK hospitals</h2> <p>The British government announced that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e99aa648f08b7689b030455#block-5e99aa648f08b7689b030455\">further 847 people have died</a> in UK hospitals, taking the total to 14,576 since the outbreak began. That represents slightly decelerated growth. But the figures do not take into account those who have died in other settings.</p> <h2>Nearly 100,000 EU citizens remain stranded</h2> <p>The European commission says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e99c3e68f080ee110446dd9#block-5e99c3e68f080ee110446dd9\">98,900 EU citizens are still stuck abroad</a>, though efforts to bring them home continue. That compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak.</p> <p>The figures reveal the UK government has made sparing use of the EU programme to repatriate citizens, under which the bloc funds 75% of the cost of emergency flights.</p> <h2>Health workers to run out of protective gear</h2> <p>Health bosses in England are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">preparing to ask doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns</a> when treating patients, as hospitals are set to run out of supplies within hours.</p>",
  "<p>It is a snapshot of a more abstemious nation, as staying at home and being unable to eat out means Britons are making their food go further and throwing less away.</p> <p>Consumers are rising to the challenge of a \u201clockdown larder\u201d as a result of the pandemic, and ignoring recommendations on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/apr/09/britons-throw-away-720m-eggs-a-year-over-best-before-date-fears\">best-before and use-by labels</a> and piling less food on to their plates, new research has revealed.</p> <p>Cooking from scratch, having \u201cvirtual\u201d dinner parties online, and eating more family meals together are some of the positive shifts in shopping and cooking behaviour under way in households across the UK since restaurants and pubs closed, according to a survey by the environmental charity <a href=\"https://www.hubbub.org.uk/\">Hubbub</a>.</p> <p>Yet the findings also reveal that many are struggling to put meals on the table and are worried about food, with increasing numbers turning to food banks for the first time.</p> <p>Overall, 90% of consumers polled earlier in April say their shopping and cooking habits have changed since the coronavirus lockdown started. More than half (57%) admit they value food more now since the restrictions kicked in, with 43% enjoying it more.</p> <p>In the drive to eke out the contents of their fridges and larders, one in six are paying less attention to use-by dates, eating more out-of-date food than usual. One respondent retrieved a can of beans from 1989 at the back of their cupboard. Others used up a can of coconut milk six years past its sell-by date and a six-year-old bag of pasta \u2013 with no ill effects. Portion control also plays a part, with 27% serving up more accurate portion sizes and one in four leaving less on the plate.</p> <p>Fears that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/03/off-our-trolleys-what-stockpiling-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-about-us\">the surge in panic buying and stock</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/03/off-our-trolleys-what-stockpiling-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-about-us\">piling</a> before the lockdown would lead to an increase in food waste levels appear not to have materialised. Almost half of people (48%) said they were throwing away less food and only 5% were throwing away more.</p> <p>Of those wasting less, more than half (51%) said they were planning meals more carefully (51%) and getting better at using up their leftovers. Consumers are also making better use of their freezer, with about a third using it more and freezing a wider variety of foods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Trewin Restorick, chief executive of Hubbub, said: \u201cAt what is a deeply troubling time, it\u2019s encouraging to see some really positive changes taking place in households across the country.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies are eating together more, young people are learning to cook, people are planning meals better and using up leftovers. However, it\u2019s concerning to see some of the downsides of food restrictions impacting on the health of people\u2019s diets and I was horrified by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/11/uk-hunger-crisis-15m-people-go-whole-day-without-food\">the recent report from the Food Foundation</a>, which showed that 3 million people have gone full days without meals since lockdown started.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the generally positive experience of reconnecting with food, nearly half said they were more worried about food than before and a similar proportion were anxious about the extra cost of putting food on the table.</p> <p>The consumer group Which? advises that while the rules can be bent for some products, those on fresh and processed meat, poultry and fish should not. Anyone classed as vulnerable or with underlying health conditions should also adhere to the dates on the labels. Unlike use-by dates, best-before labels are put on foods as a quality indication to show that though they are no longer at their best they are still safe enough to eat.</p>",
  "<p>Governments in Europe and the US can learn from Hong Kong, which has kept infections and deaths from Covid-19 low without resorting to the socially and economically damaging lockdown that the UK and other countries have imposed, scientists say.</p> \n<p>Hong Kong, with a population of nearly 7.5 million, had had just 715 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection, including 94 asymptomatic infections, and four deaths as of March 31, according to <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30090-6/fulltext\">a new study</a> published on Friday in the Lancet.</p> \n<p>Early in the pandemic, it was thought to be at significant risk because of travellers arriving from mainland China, but since early February the outbreak has appeared to be under control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The semi-autonomous city took the route that the World Health Organization recommends and embarked on a rigorous programme of testing everyone with symptoms.

But as the numbers grew, testing and tracing was abandoned in favour of strict lockdown measures to keep people in their homes and prevent them mixing.</p> \n<p>But Hong Kong has not had that sort of lockdown. Although people were not required to stay at home, they chose to change their behaviour, says <a href=\"www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30090-6/fulltext\">the paper in the Lancet Public Health journal</a>.</p> \n<p>In a survey in March, 85% of respondents reported avoiding crowded places, and 99% reported wearing face masks when leaving home, which the authors say is an indication of their concern.</p> \n<p>During the Sars outbreak in 2003 that affected Hong Kong severely, causing 299 deaths, 79% of the population wore masks, but only 10% in the swine flu pandemic of 2009.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The scientists estimate that the reproductive rate \u2013 the average number of people infected by each person who has the virus \u2013 has remained at one over the eight weeks from the beginning of February when measures were put in place. That means no acceleration of the epidemic.</p> \n<p>Prof Benjamin Cowling from the University of Hong Kong, who led the research, said Hong Kong shows how the disease can be kept to a low level without the economic and social damage that European countries and the US are experiencing.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy quickly implementing public health measures, Hong Kong has demonstrated that Covid-19 transmission can be effectively contained without resorting to the highly disruptive complete lockdown adopted by China, the US, and western European countries,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"472f6d59336d9cf2ae3b8e1e679682629959dda5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/472f6d59336d9cf2ae3b8e1e679682629959dda5/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachgoers in Hong Kong make the most of the good weather.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beachgoers in Hong Kong.

If these measures and population responses can be sustained, while avoiding fatigue among the general population, they could substantially lessen the impact of a local Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>The team of scientists examined whether influenza levels dropped as a result of physical distancing and behaviour change in Hong Kong, as a proxy for Covid-19 transmission in the community.</p> \n<p>The two diseases are transmitted in similar ways. Flu transmission was reduced by 44% during February after school closures. Schools were also closed during swine flu in 2009, but that led only to a drop of 10-15% in flu transmission.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a3e9ca6-9c27-4eed-ba07-63828dd45a49\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1ELwVTWTnfc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe speed of decline in influenza activity in 2020 was quicker than in previous years when only school closures were implemented, suggesting that other social distancing measures and avoidance behaviours have had a substantial additional impact on influenza transmission,\u201d said the report\u2019s co-author, Dr Peng Wu, from the University of Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs both influenza and Covid-19 are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics, it\u2019s likely that these control measures have also reduced Covid-19 transmission in the community.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added that Hong Kong\u2019s population was more aware of the need to change their behaviour because of the experience of past infectious disease outbreaks.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo me this paper is very timely and provides important evidence that should influence our own plans for moving away from lock-down,\u201d said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough one cannot always extrapolate from an Asian to a European country, the Hong Kong approach could provide us with a way of easing the severity of the lockdown without risking case numbers increasing again.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs one of the most heavily affected [areas] during the Saras epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong is better equipped to contend with an outbreak of Covid-19 than many other countries,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cImproved testing and hospital capacity to handle novel respiratory pathogens, and a population acutely aware of the need to improve personal hygiene and maintain physical distancing, put them in good stead.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cowling was unable to say whether the policy of testing, contact tracing and isolation had been the most important measure. \u201cThat is a really important question and one which we have not yet been able to answer. We think most likely it is a combination of measures that works well. Social distancing slows transmission and prevents large outbreaks, allowing test and trace to keep up,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The extensive contact tracing and quarantine would be the most difficult element to replicate, he said. \u201cIn Hong Kong we have designated facilities for quarantine outside of the home, and also procedures for strict enforcement of home quarantine. Individuals with higher risk of infection (perhaps greater exposure to infection) would be quarantined outside the home, and those with lower risk would be placed in home quarantine for 14 days.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This article was amended on 18 April 2020 to clarify that the Hong Kong case figures were as of 31 March.</p></li> \n</ul>",

  "<p>Plants, like most things, go in and out of fashion.</p> <p>There is a tradition of English cottage gardening in my neighbourhood, where orchards grew a century ago. But with the climate arching towards the sub-tropical, rather than the temperate, the dainty English roses drooped from the heat. Then, local gardeners realised the value of hardier native species.</p> <p>May Gibbs, the famous illustrator and author, lived in the neighbouring suburb. The popularity of her illustrations \u2013 though her subjects were native to Western Australia, not Sydney \u2013 ignited the imagination of children and gardeners.

These days, they\u2019re nary seen on verges.</p> <p>But these plants served a purpose, besides throwing cheer into the air for all passersby to enjoy.

It is a permaculture 101 plant with so many uses. It has a mighty, deep taproot and pulls nitrogen out of the soil to the surface to enrich its neighbours that might otherwise struggle to access nitrogen due to their shallower roots. The leaves can be cut and dropped to make a readily available fertiliser and mulch all at the same time. Voila!</p> <p>Comfrey is also known as knitbone due its use for wound healing, and calming of irritated skin \u2013 the roots and leaves are used to makes salves. Lastly, the clustered bell-shaped flowers are pleasing and are a great pollinator attractant.</p> <p><strong>Lavender</strong>: One of the calmest scents, that also has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. It is great for keeping mosquitoes at bay. Grow it, and you will find yourself making little dried out lavender potpourri pillows, as I am doing, to stash in cupboards to repel moths \u2013 something my aunt taught me.</p> <p><strong>Chamomile:</strong> There are two predominant varieties that are easily sourced in Australia, Roman and German chamomile. They have a distinctive smell, and are a cousin of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matricaria_discoidea\">pineappleweed</a> otherwise known as wild chamomile, which I absolutely adore, much to the disgust of my Scandinavian farmer friends who see them just as weeds. They make wonderful borders, and the flowers can be dried for a delicious calming tea.</p> <p><strong>Houttuynia cordata aka fish mint</strong>: With its heart-shaped leaves, this is one of the most unassuming ground covers. It grows easily and often pops up unexpectedly in gardens in Australia. Fish mint has long been used for food and medicine in South East Asia to treat pneumonia, hypertension, constipation, fevers and for liver detoxification. You can guess what it tastes like.</p> <p><strong>All the mints</strong>: For their beautiful fragrance as well as their lovely nature. Mints creep along to act as a wonderful living mulch. I have mine covering the bases of our fig trees. Round mint in particular is easy to cultivate and an excellent addition to our home cooking. They are also excellent pest deterrents \u2013 repelling ants, spiders and mosquitoes.</p> <p><strong>Anything that contains citronella</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6292262da5d7e3ec0f5553b476cd67be97594b8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6292262da5d7e3ec0f5553b476cd67be97594b8e/0_304_4576_2746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lemon scented myrtle, rich in citral oil, in bloom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lemon-scented myrtle, rich in citral oil, in bloom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heinz Hauser/botanikfoto/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Catnip:</strong> Which also contains nepetalactone (the part that cats love) and is a deterrent for flea beetles, mosquitos and cockroaches.</p> <p><strong>Artemisia aka wormwood or mugwort:</strong> Japanese mugwort is used for cooking, both fresh and dried in mochi rice dumpling, as well as medicinally as a tool alongside acupuncture where they are made into moxa for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion\">moxibustion</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/29/super-flower-lemon-myrtle-can-clean-cook-and-makes-great-marshmallows\">Lemon myrtle</a></strong>: Probably containing the highest amount of pure citral oil of any plant.</p> <p>If I had my way, the list would continue for days, because I\u2019m a kitchen sink kind of person.

  "<p>Can the world\u2019s greatest coral reef system be rescued from the rapid march of the climate crisis?</p> <p>With global temperatures already about 1C higher than pre-industrial levels, Queensland\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been through three mass bleaching events in only five years.</p> <p>Corals are dying and the system is changing rapidly as temperatures keep going up and greenhouse gases keep accumulating in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the Australian government revealed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/brightening-clouds-and-coral-larvae-study-picks-best-great-barrier-reef-rescue-ideas\">$150m research and development program</a> to build the reef\u2019s resilience to future warming.</p> <p>Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the Apollo 11 mission. It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years\u2019 time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.\u201d</p> <p>On its own, the project \u2013 called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program \u2013 is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/05/rescuing-the-great-barrier-reef-how-much-can-be-saved-and-how-can-we-do-it\">Rescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they\u2019re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder.</p> <p>Some 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs.</p> <p>The program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation \u2013 it\u2019s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches:</p> <ul> <li><p>Shading and cooling reefs to cut sunlight or lower ocean temperatures;</p></li> <li><p>Stabilising and rebuilding reef structures damaged from bleaching, cyclones or ocean acidification;</p></li> <li><p>Helping corals adapt to warmer temperatures and then moving their larvae around en masse.</p></li> </ul> <p>So what\u2019s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time?</p> <h2>Shading and cooling the Great Barrier Reef</h2> <p>In early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/scientists-trial-cloud-brightening-equipment-to-shade-and-cool-great-barrier-reef\">led a trial of equipmen</a>t that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air.</p> <p>The idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets.</p> <p>The process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds.</p> <p>Harrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below \u2013 perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching.</p> <p>Such a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress.</p> <p>Harrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cbfa02b48e4d7dcb1cfe0a25387800c45c04594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cbfa02b48e4d7dcb1cfe0a25387800c45c04594/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists have carried out a trial of prototype cloud brightening equipment on the Great Barrier Reef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists have carried out a trial of prototype cloud brightening equipment on the Great Barrier Reef.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Southern Cross University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.\u201d</p> <p>Other methods under this \u201cshading and cooling\u201d category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a race against time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can go really hard on emissions and meet or beat the Paris [climate] targets, then these interventions have the potential to help get the reef to a sustainable future \u2013 but only under that very aggressive emissions reduction scenario.\u201d</p> <h2>Stabilising damaged reefs with scaffolding</h2> <p>Anyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what\u2019s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre.</p> <p>Coral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore individual reefs.</p> <p>There are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover.</p> <p>Removing natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation.</p> <p>Modelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8858c6376a1f5b30463493ece9d33644e0efddc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8858c6376a1f5b30463493ece9d33644e0efddc7/0_0_5253_3238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Barrier Reef coral bleached in the most recent event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Barrier Reef coral bleached in the most recent event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anthony says if temperatures stay below 2C \u201cthen there is so much we can do\u201d across all the approaches.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAt 3C the reef will look very different \u2013 it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn\u2019t give up.\u201d</p> <h2>Transporting corals and larvae</h2> <p>Prof Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,\u201d he says.</p> <p>One approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in \u201cslicks\u201d and drop them in places that need help to recover.</p> <p>Harrison says there is always masses of excess coral larvae that would float away or be eaten and, before the impacts of climate change, \u201cit didn\u2019t matter if 99% [of the larvae] drifted away or got eaten fish, because there were so many of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/snow-white-coral-of-once-vibrant-great-barrier-reef-a-sign-urgent-action-must-be-taken\">Snow-white coral of once-vibrant Great Barrier Reef a sign urgent action must be taken | Adam Morton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs.</p> <p>Corals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae.

  "<p>Built like a truck but with the capacity to be as gentle as a pussycat, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/16/brian-dennehy-actor-dies-aged-81\">Brian Dennehy</a> was smarter than the average bear-like character actor. The 6ft 3in performer, who has died aged 81 from a heart attack resulting from sepsis, made his screen breakthrough as an adversarial small-town sheriff in First Blood (1982), the thoughtful opening instalment in what would become the Rambo action series. It was the first in his hat-trick of hits from that decade: he also twinkled benignly as one of a group of aliens who have a rejuvenating effect on an elderly community in Cocoon (1985) and played a grizzled but amiable cop in F/X (1986), an enjoyable thriller set in the special effects industry; it was popular enough to spawn a 1991 sequel in which he also starred.</p> <p>Unusually for a character actor, he had a handful of movie leads, including The Belly of an Architect (1987), a rare foray into arthouse cinema. Dennehy\u2019s extraordinary range, from cowering vulnerability to a fury fit to scare the gods, was given full rein in the British director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-greenaway\">Peter Greenaway</a>\u2019s otherwise austere tale of an esteemed architect dying of stomach cancer; the critic <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/janet-maslin\">Janet Maslin</a> called it \u201cone of the best things\u201d the actor had done. He also gave a complex and probing performance as the serial killer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/12/john-wayne-gacy-victims-search\">John Wayne Gacy</a> in the TV mini-series To Catch a Killer (1992).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e30130d111cf756d99db0c0b5666f52aba08530\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e30130d111cf756d99db0c0b5666f52aba08530/0_111_2306_1383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Dennehy, right, in his breakthrough role in First Blood, 1982, with Sylvester Stallone as Rambo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Dennehy, right, in his breakthrough role in First Blood, 1982, with Sylvester Stallone as Rambo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thorn EMI Video/Joseph Lederer/Visual Icon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was on stage, however, that Dennehy established himself as a genuine colossus and one of the US\u2019s foremost tragedians. He won Tony and Olivier awards for playing Willy Loman in the New York and London productions of Death of a Salesman (in 1999 and 2005 respectively), as well as a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award for the 2000 television version. \u201cYou can play Willy as a little man with big ideas,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/may/17/theatre\">wrote Michael Billington in his review of the Lyric theatre production</a>, \u201cbut what Dennehy gives us is a physical giant facing up to his own vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>His second Tony, in 2003, was for Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night, in which he starred opposite Vanessa Redgrave and the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/03/philip-seymour-hoffman\">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>; it was directed, as Death of a Salesman had been, by his friend and collaborator Robert Falls, whom he called \u201cthe person who\u2019s had the greatest effect on my life\u201d. Falls also directed him twice in another Eugene O\u2019Neill masterpiece, The Iceman Cometh, first in 1990 with Dennehy as the charismatic lead, Hickey, and <a href=\"https://www.theatreinchicago.com/news.php?articleID=646\">then in 2012</a> with him playing the sloshed \u201cFoolosopher\u201d and former anarchist Larry Slade; both productions originated, like much of their work together, at the Goodman theatre in Chicago. Preparing for the most recent one, he said: \u201cThe only way to do it is to grab the fuckin\u2019 audience by the throat, shake the shit out of \u2019em and say, \u2018You think you\u2019re getting out of here alive? You\u2019re not. Prepare to spill your fucking blood, because I\u2019m gonna spill mine, and you\u2019re coming with me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s work was vital to any understanding of Dennehy \u2013 Falls also directed him in productions of Hughie, A Touch of the Poet and Desire Under the Elms \u2013 and he claimed to concur with the playwright\u2019s mordant, ravaged vision. \u201cExcept in terms of my kids and my grandchildren and my wife, it\u2019s pretty hard not to look outside yourself and feel bleak. I\u2019m not as dark as O\u2019Neill, thank God. But I have my dark moments.\u201d His own personality flowed freely into those performances. \u201cFalls always says that I have more rage than any person he\u2019s ever known \u2026 Tragic acting involves going to those places, places that do actually exist in yourself. I don\u2019t have any trouble tapping into them.\u201d</p> <p>He was an intemperate drinker, describing himself as a former \u201cfunctioning alcoholic\u201d, and once joked: \u201cAt my parties, the sheriff\u2019s department comes three or four times a night.\u201d But it was his background that helped make him an ideal interpreter of O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty self-evident for me. Irish Catholic, lapsed Catholic, whatever the hell you want to call it. Somebody who\u2019s definitely gone 15 rounds with the booze, and wound up with a lot of black eyes and broken teeth as a result of it.\u201d</p> <p>He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised first in Brooklyn, New York, and then, from the age of 12, in Mineola, Long Island, by his parents Hannah (nee Manion) and Edward Dennehy, a correspondent for the Associated Press. He was educated at Chaminade high school, where a teacher encouraged him to pursue a career in acting. He chose sport instead and went to Columbia University on a football scholarship before joining the Marines. He told the New York Times in 1989 that he had incurred shrapnel injuries in Vietnam. When it later emerged that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-war-stories-exposed/\">he hadn\u2019t served there at all</a>, he apologised for fabricating his record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"781a2a36989ba5ac726925c012d18a53aaedbe4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/781a2a36989ba5ac726925c012d18a53aaedbe4b/0_109_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Dennehy in Dynasty, with Joan Collins as Alexis, 1981\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Dennehy in Dynasty, with Joan Collins as Alexis, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the Marines, he completed a graduate degree in dramatic arts at Yale and then worked as a delivery driver, a butcher, a bartender and a stockbroker. In the early 1970s he decided to give acting a concerted shot after several years of community theatre in Long Island. Stage roles in New York led eventually to minor parts in movies, beginning with Looking for Mr Goodbar and Semi-Tough (both 1977), and on TV in the likes of Kojak, M*A*S*H, Dallas and Dynasty. His film work became increasingly memorable: he played a consoling bartender in the Dudley Moore comedy 10 (1979), a father whose son joins a cult in Split Image (1982), a cop moonlighting as an author in Best Seller (1987), a corrupt district attorney in Presumed Innocent (1990) and Romeo\u2019s father in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s modern-dress Romeo + Juliet (1996). Notable theatre credits include the title role in Brecht\u2019s Galileo in 1986 at the Goodman theatre (his first play with Falls) and Lopakhin in Peter Brook\u2019s revival of The Cherry Orchard at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1988.</p> <p>Dennehy worked relentlessly throughout his career. He appeared in a series of TV movies, five of which he also directed, as the Chicago cop Jack Reed, beginning with Deadly Matrimony (1992). Recently he had recurring roles on television in Public Morals (2015) and The Blacklist (2016\u201419).</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, the costume designer Jennifer Arnott, whom he married in 1988, and by their children, Cormac and Sarah, as well as by three daughters, Elizabeth, Kathleen and Deirdre, from his first marriage to Judith Scheff, which ended in divorce in 1974.</p> <p>\u2022 Brian Manion Dennehy, actor, born 9 July 1938; died 15 April 2020</p>",

  "<p><strong>What is contact tracing?</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">This is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. </p> \n<p>It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014/15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it harder to do in the case of a respiratory infection?</strong></p> \n<p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street. </p> \n<p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So the contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p> \n<p><strong>What do the contact tracers do then?</strong></p> \n<p>In the way it was operating in February, the tracer would call the contacts and ask them how close they had been to the person with symptoms and establish whether they were low-risk or high-risk. If the latter, they would be asked to isolate themselves for 14 days at home. </p> \n<p>The contact tracers would either call each day to check how they were or ask them to phone if they felt ill. If they developed symptoms, the tracers would start again, looking for their contacts in turn.</p> \n<p><strong>Who does the contact tracing?</strong></p> \n<p>It is organised by Public Health England, which had 290 staff doing it before community testing stopped in mid-March. Public health in recent years has been the responsibility of local government, so any increase in contact tracers might come from councils.</p> \n<p><strong>Which other countries have done this to scale?</strong></p> \n<p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine. </p> \n<p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>",

The team of high moral priests sent to the Samoan FA\u2019s door that day were handpicked by a specially convened Fifa emergency committee, a delegation that read, in no particular order: Sepp Blatter, Jack Warner, Issa Hayatou, Michel Platini, Reynald Temarii, Mohammad bin Hammam and Nicol\u00e1s Leoz.</p> <p>Or to give them their full Seven Dwarves-style nicknames: Six Year Ban Guy, Criminal Charges Guy, TV Rights Fine Guy, Dishonest Payment Guy, Eight Year Ban Guy, Life Ban Guy and of course everyone\u2019s favourite crime-fighting administrator, Interpol Red Notice Guy.

Just how abnormal do you have to be to require this degree of normalising? But then these were the golden years of footballing chicanery, when the yak-hide handbags flowed like wine and when Fifa could basically do as it wished.</p> <p>The anomaly was that Samoa fought back. In a rare show of resistance the Samoan FA appealed to the court of arbitration for sport. It didn\u2019t work. The appeal was rejected and the good times continued to roll at Fifa house, reaching a peak with the bribe-shadowed World Cup bid decisions that would prove an act of hubris even for that thoroughly debauched regime.</p> <p>And so to the present day. Replace one bald, unctuous Swiss with a slightly younger bald, unctuous Swiss and something similar is happening in the Caribbean, a test case for where we may be heading in the struggle for the heart, soul and wallet of world football.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2019/08/02/warner-acolytes-battle-return-control-trinidad-tobago-fa/\">Trinidad </a><a href=\"http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2019/08/02/warner-acolytes-battle-return-control-trinidad-tobago-fa/\">&amp; Tobago FA </a>experienced its own visit from the Fifa Normalisers in March after another shemozzle over debt. Like Samoa the TTFA has fought back. Another appeal has been lodged at Cas, this time via crowdfunded legal action.</p> <p>Fifa\u2019s move does seem bizarrely aggressive. The deposed TTFA committee had been in place for only four months, having seen off Gianni Infantino\u2019s favoured candidate David John-Williams in a local vote.</p> <p>The TTFA board member Keith Look Loy has accused Fifa of acting like \u201ca colonial absentee landlord\u201d. The former Newcastle, West Ham and Portsmouth goalkeeper Shaka Hislop has called the intervention \u201ca coup\u201d. In an excellent twist the leader of the ousted rebel FA is even called William Wallace. They can take our lives but they\u2019ll never take \u2026 our freebies.</p> <p>Much has been made by the <em>ancien r</em><em>\u00e9gime</em> of Look Loy and co\u2019s historic association with the disgraced Jack Warner, once of the Samoan Normalisation Committee and now avoiding the US justice system.</p> <p>Asked about rumours he might have lobbied for the Wallace campaign \u2013 something Wallace fiercely denies \u2013 Warner told the broadcaster Andre Errol Baptiste of Port of Spain-based i95.5fm: \u201cEven if that was the case, and by the way that is not the case, and it means that is the beginning of the way to lift football in the country, so be it. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Which pretty much clears that one up.</p> <p>What is actually happening here? This might feel like a dispute at the edge of things, with plenty that is undesirable on both sides, but Fifa\u2019s actions seem extraordinarily high-handed and patrician, even by its own standards, evidence of the increasing hawkishness of the Infantino regime. As the Norwegian <a href=\"http://josimarfootball.com/infantinos-revenge/\">Josimar</a><a href=\"http://josimarfootball.com/infantinos-revenge/\"> website has pointed out</a> the man in charge of all this normalisation is even one of Infantino\u2019s best friends, his old university chum V\u00e9ron Mosengo-Omba<em>.</em></p> <p>This matters right now. There is a great deal up for grabs a month into the total collapse of club football\u2019s broadcast rights power base. This perhaps explains why Fifa\u2019s public statements during the Covid-19 crisis have been almost alarmingly relaxed. Fifa may suspend all international football. Fifa may, we hear, dig into its \u00a32bn cash fund to bail out clubs and leagues.</p> <p>\u201cNever let a serious crisis go to waste\u201d is an overused line in the current uncertainty but you can bet Infantino has it inked on the back of his hand. Make no mistake Fifa has a great deal to gain at a time when every entity that has tried to resist its power, from Premier League to Uefa to the poor old TTFA, is significantly weakened.</p> <p>The collapse of the Blatter-Warner-Platini era hit Fifa hard but not that hard. Money continued to flow but what Fifa really wants is power, most noticeably in its shadow-struggle with club football, where Infantino is convinced it is Fifa\u2019s destiny to take a stronger role.</p> <p>This seemed to be coming to a head late last year as Florentino P\u00e9rez presented a breakaway plan led by the richest clubs to cut out domestic leagues, with Fifa seemingly in close, approving pursuit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exciting new plans come and go. This one seemed as likely as so many others but Covid-19 has shifted the picture even further. Every league, every club is facing a financial nosedive, their power tied inexorably to those freeze-framed TV deals. \u201cFootball can \u2013 and I believe will \u2013 play a big part in helping our world recover,\u201d Infantino mused last week, no doubt pondering the majesty of his organisation\u2019s bank balance and with the next major Fifa payday safely tucked away in late 2022.</p> <p>Nobody really knows what the world will look like once normalisation returns to all of us but some certainties do remain. Resistance, as the case of the TTFA demonstrates, is still futile and right now Fifa is in a position to bend that future to its will.</p>",

They include hospitals that still have gowns lending each other batches of them, wearing coveralls \u2013 one-piece items of personal protective equipment (PPE) that cover the whole body \u2013 and using plastic aprons as alternatives.</p> \n<p>It confirms that wearing \u201cdisposable, non-fluid-repellent gowns/coveralls with a disposable plastic apron for high-risk settings and aerosol-generating procedures [such as intubation] with forearm washing once gown/coverall is removed\u201d is one of the alternatives staff should deploy once gowns run out.</p> \n<p>In total, PHE set out three alternatives to using the high-spec fluid-repellent gowns that are now in short supply.</p> \n<p>The second of those also involves staff using \u201creusable (washable) surgical gowns/coveralls or similar suitable clothing (e.g. long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown, industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for aerosol-generating procedures and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown/coverall is removed\u201d.</p> \n<p>Under the third option, hospitals should conserve supplies of fluid-repellent gowns by using them only during aerosol-generating procedures and surgery.</p> \n<p>A source had told the Guardian: \u201cThe new guidance will say \u2018this is what you do if you don\u2019t have any gowns\u2019.

The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, has also warned that doctors\u2019 lives are being put at risk by stocks of PPE having reached \u201cdangerously low levels\u201d.</p> \n<p>Shortages of gowns in hospitals in England are far worse than Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has admitted, hospital bosses claim. \u201cWe are tight on gowns. That is the pressure point at the moment,\u201d Hancock told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee in an evidence session on Friday morning.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe have another 55,000 gowns arriving today and we\u2019re working on the acquisition internationally of more gowns, but it is a challenge. This follows changing the guidance 10 days ago which increased the advice on the use of gowns but also said that they should be used for sessional use rather than for individual patient use ... And it is a big challenge delivering against that new guidance and we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can.\u201d</p> \n<p>He could not guarantee that every hospital would have the supplies needed to tide it over this weekend.</p> \n<p>Hancock had sought to reassure MPs by stressing that 55,000 more gowns were due to arrive on Friday. However, those equate to about eight hours\u2019 supply because the NHS is currently using 150,000 gowns a day.</p> \n<p>There were only \u201cseveral tens of thousands\u201d left in the NHS\u2019s reserve stockpile, sources said on Friday. \u201cGowns have in effect already run out,\u201d one said. \u201cThe situation is so serious that some trusts will run out today and others over the weekend.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned that PHE\u2019s downgrading of the advice on PPE could result in more lives lost. \u201cChanging official guidance on protective equipment from gowns to aprons translates to increased risk to frontline staff, at a time when the death toll from Covid-19 is already rising for frontline workers. This is intolerable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe health secretary\u2019s repeated reassurances the supply of protective kit for staff was under control now look totally threadbare.

However, some senior figures in NHS England were \u201cexasperated\u201d about PHE\u2019s earlier stipulation that staff in high-risk Covid-19 environments should wear full PPE, including a gown, and regarded that as \u201cexcessive\u201d.</p> \n<p>NHS leaders and Hancock have been desperately trying to find a solution to the lack of gowns since the Guardian first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/lack-of-surgical-gowns-for-medics-a-disaster-in-waiting-say-nhs-bosses-coronavirus\">highlighted</a> last week an internal memo from NHS bosses warning hospital chiefs that \u201cthere are no immediate stocks of gowns due in the national supply chain over the next few days and we are unsighted on when further deliveries will be made\u201d.</p> \n<p>More than a week later, they have been forced to draw up the controversial new guidance, which is a tacit admission that shortages are set to continue.</p> \n<p>NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said hospitals would implement the new guidance. \u201cThe supply of clinical gowns is now critical, and it is now clear that some trusts will run out of fully fluid-repellent gowns,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Saffron Cordery, the organisation\u2019s deputy chief executive, said: \u201cTrusts and the National Strategic Reserve have very carefully managed the last remaining stock and trusts have helped each other wherever possible. They have used the remaining stock of coveralls as alternatives to gowns and have been deploying their gown stock very carefully.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe understand the new recommendations \u2026 are aligned with World Health Organization guidance on the use of PPE when it is in short supply.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrust leaders will now implement this plan wherever needed and will therefore use the highest possible level of alternative protection equipment such as a fluid-retardant, as opposed to fluid-repellent, gown combined with an apron.\u201d</p> \n<p>The British Medical Association (BMA) said using aprons instead of gowns would increase the risks run by frontline staff. Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the BMA\u2019s consultants committee, said: \u201cThe health and social care secretary admitted he couldn\u2019t guarantee that supplies of gowns wouldn\u2019t run out this weekend, and now this illustrates the dire situation that some doctors and healthcare workers are finding themselves in.<br><br>\u201cIf staff are now told to use aprons in the place of gowns, this directly contravenes the evidence and guidance from both Public Health England and the World Health Organization. Guidance that\u2019s there to help keep healthcare workers and their patients out of harm\u2019s way.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many healthcare workers have already died. More doctors and their colleagues cannot be expected to put their own lives on the line in a bid to save others, and this new advice means they could be doing just that. It\u2019s not a decision they should have to make.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social care said:<strong> </strong>\u201cNew clinical advice has been issued today to make sure that if there are shortages in one area, frontline staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk. This has been reviewed by the Health and Safety Executive, and is in line with WHO and CDC guidance on PPE use in exceptional circumstances.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, the Covid-19 incident director for PHE, said: \u201cThe UK PPE guidance continues to recommend the highest level of protection for health and social care teams treating Covid-19 patients. PPE is currently a precious resource and it is crucial that everyone that needs it has access to the right protective equipment. That is why we have worked with the NHS and [Health and Safety Executive] to suggest ways that they can maximise the resources they have available.\u201d</p>",

He was backed by the Labour leader <strong>Sir</strong> <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> who said he thought he was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the government would have to start advising people to wear masks in certain circumstances, in step with changes taking places across Europe. </li> \n   <li>Booking summer holidays at this time would be a mistake, the transport secretary <strong>Grant Shapps</strong> said, highlighting that while there are signs that the curve is flattening there has yet to be a decline.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side.

Vallance did not question the importance of finding a vaccine. But he did at least twice stress that finding one might take time. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First of all, we\u2019ve got to get a vaccine. That isn\u2019t two days away, it\u2019s not two months away. Making a vaccine is a difficult, complicated process. It doesn\u2019t only have to work, it has to be safe, and of course for a disease like this it has to be very safe if you are going to use it right across the population. So there is a lot to do before we\u2019re in that position.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just to put some realism on vaccine development, each single project does not have a high probability of success.</p> \n   <p>So although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it\u2019s never the case that you know you\u2019ve got a vaccine that\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s the first thing that we need to be sure of. </p> \n   <p>The second thing is then the safety and it\u2019s incredibly important that these vaccines are tested properly, that\u2019s why it takes some time to get to the clinical trials and understand the potential unwanted effects of a vaccine.</p> \n   <p>And then only when that has been done can this be used widely across the population and so those are the stages we need to go through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that government advisers would decide on Tuesday next week whether to recommend a change of policy on face masks.</strong> At the moment the government does not advise members of the public to wear them. Vallance said this was in line with World Health Organisation recommendations. But Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said that people on public transport should be advised to wear them (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad#block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad\"> 7.53am)</a> and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he thinks a change in policy is inevitable.

It\u2019s not easy to really get a firm position on some of it, and there aren\u2019t really good trials of masks. We are looking at the evidence now. We\u2019ve looked at it this week twice. We\u2019re going to look at it again on Tuesday and hope to be able to make some advice around whether any changes are needed or not at the moment. We\u2019re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. </p> \n   <p>The difference between this disease and others is the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread which adds an added complexity to where masks may or may not fit into this. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fab8e92f76afdfe1cbb866925115fdade568690d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fab8e92f76afdfe1cbb866925115fdade568690d/1625_342_1755_1053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alok Sharma (left) and Sir Patrick Vallance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alok Sharma (left) and Sir Patrick Vallance.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/Crown Copyright/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T17:20:10.455Z\">at 6.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99e1128f08bade1f2954a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T17:02:27.775Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ec6f3359b26b67de0d9317e625d60f45618600b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ec6f3359b26b67de0d9317e625d60f45618600b/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People exercising and maintaining physical distance on Thames Walk, Erith, Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People exercising and maintaining physical distance on Thames Walk, Erith, Kent.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99dc8e8f08bade1f295425\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T16:43:45.897Z\">5.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sharma</strong> ends by thanking people for the sacrifices they are making.</p> \n  <p>And he repeats the message about staying at home to protect the NHS.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it.

The number of new applicants fell to 220,000 in the most recent week, down from its peak of 540,000 in the final week of March. This is, however, still more than twice as bad as the worst of the financial crisis.</p> \n   <p>More encouraging is timelier data based on the frequency of web searches for unemployment-related terms which has closely matched the path of UC claims in recent weeks. Web searches have now fallen back to close to levels seen on average during 2019. This suggests new UC claimants will fall again next week.

When<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\"> it was originally announced</a> it was open for a period of three months, until the end of May.</p> \n  <p>Now it will be extended for a month. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-to-end-of-june\">a press notice</a> the Treasury said this decision was being announced in the light of the decision yesterday to extend the lockdown for at least three weeks. It will now be open until the end of June, \u201cproviding businesses with the certainty they need\u201d, the Treasury says.</p> \n  <p>In a statement Sunak said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide job retention scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity.</p> \n   <p>It is vital for people\u2019s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March.</p> \n  <p>Even thought a one-month extension may not sound like something hugely significant, this amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury \u00a310bn or more. That is because the scheme itself amounts to a colossal public spending commitment. The Resolution Foundation has estimated that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\"> it will cost the government between \u00a330bn and \u00a340bn every three months.</a></p> \n  <p>This is one reason why the Treasury is so keen for the lockdown not to last too long. At this price, ministers reportedly believe that keeping the scheme going through the summer and beyond would be simply unaffordable.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"371b3e51089071d9b822cc41a14fa7c753a040cd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/371b3e51089071d9b822cc41a14fa7c753a040cd/0_88_3196_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T14:57:31.358Z\">at 3.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99c0dc8f08b7689b0305f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T14:46:23.125Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The<strong> Duchess of Cornwall</strong> recorded a video message of support for the official opening of <strong>NHS Nightingale Hospital North West</strong> in Manchester. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ClarenceHouse/status/1251150212480897024\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today the new NHS Nightingale Hospital North West was opened in Manchester. <br><br>To mark the occasion, The Duchess of Cornwall sent a message of support from Birkhall, her home in Scotland. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHSNW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NHSNW</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHSuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nhsuk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PD3PP3JiGf\">pic.twitter.com/PD3PP3JiGf</a></p>\u2014 Clarence House (@ClarenceHouse) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarenceHouse/status/1251150212480897024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p> Speaking from Birkhall, Prince Charles\u2019s home on the Balmoral estate, Camilla said the new field hospital was bringing \u201clight at a dark time\u201d.

It establishes clearly that the PM\u2019s colleagues were not being fully truthful about how ill he really was in the days before his admission to intensive care. Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">and self-isolating</a> with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. [Matt] Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d.</p> \n   <p>In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d</a>. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert.</p> \n   <p>The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes.</p> \n   <p>At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday.</p> \n   <p>It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.)</p> \n   <p>On Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">got significantly worse</a>. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street.</p> \n   <p>At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/global-leaders-send-messages-of-support-to-boris-johnson\">sent him good wishes</a>. His aides were knocked over, distraught.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is the full article, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukeharding\">Luke Harding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh\">Dan Sabbagh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deniscampbell\">Denis Campbell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/owenbowcott\">Owen Bowcott</a>.

The health secretary today said that he hadn\u2019t decided whether it was going to be done centrally or with local government and I think one of the lessons we could reasonable draw from the slowness of ramping things up centrally is that this is something we should trust local government to help us with when we move out of the lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt said in South Korea 1,000 people were involved in contract tracing. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This could be tested out in places like Yorkshire or Cornwall because those are parts of the country which have got relatively few Covid cases - and so we could start seeing whether it was possible to lift the lockdown by replacing it with this testing and contact tracing.

Why don\u2019t we have that distanced through the day? And there may be different ways, both in terms of businesses and organisations, but also to do with the way the government responds, to spread the load better. </p> \n   <p>We should look, as we think about the future, for lessons that we can take away that actually might change the way we can live life in the future a bit for the better.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that it would be a mistake for people to start booking summer holidays now. </strong>Asked if people could book a holiday now, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Clearly people will want to see what the trajectory of this disease is in the next few weeks.

He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There would have been no difference to those decisions [if Johnson had been present] because we have been guided by the scientists and the medical advice. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps said it was too early to tell if the UK would end up with a higher coronavirus death toll than other countries.</strong> Asked about this, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Look, I simply don\u2019t know the answer to that question.

  "<p>A former partner at the accounting firm EY has been awarded $10.8m (\u00a38.6m) in damages after being forced out of his job when he exposed professional misconduct during an audit of a Dubai gold refiner.</p> <p>The high court in London ruled on Friday that EY had repeatedly breached the code of ethics for professional accountants in its dealings with one of its clients, Kaloti Jewellery International.</p> <p>The claim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/ernst-young-whistleblower-suing-gold-audit-dubai\">was brought by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/ernst-young-whistleblower-suing-gold-audit-dubai\">Amjad Rihan</a>, who revealed that silver-coated gold had been shipped from Morocco to avoid export restrictions and precious metal obtained from other countries such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iran without due diligence.</p> <p>After telling EY about his concerns, Rihan was ordered back to Dubai but feared for his and his family\u2019s safety. He resigned and subsequently made whistleblowing disclosures in 2014.</p> <p>Mr Justice Kerr found EY had breached its duty to Rihan through failing to perform the Kaloti audit in an ethical and professional manner.</p> <p>The court awarded Rihan a total of $10,843,941 and \u00a3117,950 in sterling for damages for past and future loss of earnings, and loss of employment benefits.</p> <p>After the ruling, Rihan said: \u201cAlmost seven years of agony for me and my family has come to an end with a total vindication by the court. My life was turned upside down as I was cruelly and harshly punished for insisting on doing my job ethically, professionally and lawfully in relation to the gold audits in Dubai.</p> <p>\u201cThe court ruled in my favour and found that EY breached its duties towards me, for which I am very grateful. I hope that EY uses this judgment as an opportunity to improve and take the necessary measures to avoid anything like this ever happening again.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Dowling, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day who represented Rihan, said: \u201cFor years EY has refused to admit any wrongdoing in relation to the Kaloti audit. Instead it accused Mr Rihan of being a liar and a fantasist. Our client\u2019s character and actions have now been completely vindicated by the court.</p> <p>\u201cBy contrast it is EY which has been found to have committed serious professional misconduct at the highest echelons of the organisation. This important judgment sends a clear message to would-be whistleblowers that they do not have to tolerate unethical conduct within their organisation, no matter how high up the chain it goes.</p> <p>In his judgment, Kerr said: \u201cGold is used in the banking industry, for investment purposes; in the jewellery industry; and in the electronics industry, for manufacturing. It is recognised internationally as being among the \u2018conflict minerals\u2019 attractive to criminals and terrorists because it is relatively easy to move and holds its value well.</p> <p>\u201cFor these reasons, the importance of good due diligence and regulation in the gold refining industry and other \u2018conflict minerals\u2019 trading is emphasised in guidance published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in US legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Act. The claimant and his colleagues at EY Dubai and EY MENA saw this as an opportunity to acquire fruitful work producing assurance reporting to gold refiners in Dubai and elsewhere in the region. Kaloti was the most substantial of the Dubai refiners, with the largest market share.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on the Morocco transactions, Kerr said: \u201cI accept as a fact that the defendants were responsible for suggesting to Kaloti that it should draft its compliance report in a manner that masked the reality of the Morocco gold issue, removing the reference to Morocco and changing the coating of gold bars with silver to documentary irregularities. I regard this as professional misconduct.\u201d</p> <p>An EY spokesperson said: \u201cWe are surprised and disappointed by the judge\u2019s decision, its introduction of an unprecedented legal duty and its financial award to a former EY Dubai partner. We will appeal and, therefore, not comment in detail. It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities. Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Your article on planning for a strategy to exit from lockdown (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/uk-government-has-no-exit-plan-for-covid-19-lockdown-say-sources\" title=\"\">UK government has no exit plan for Covid-19 lockdown, say sources</a>, 15 April) was highly significant, particularly in highlighting the reluctance of ministers to respond to growing calls for their thinking on any potential strategies to be published.</p> <p>Despite their efforts to rewrite history, evidence from meetings of the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) and the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag) all the way up to mid-March shows clearly that the scientific evidence was, at various times, either confused or delivered to ministers with insufficient clarity. As a result those ministers then made fundamental mistakes, which meant we lost valuable time to prepare for the epidemic, in particular by locking down the country much earlier.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the decision announced on 12 March to abandon community testing and tracing, almost certainly because we no longer had sufficient capacity to do it, has undoubtedly cost a huge number of lives in the UK. Nearly 14,000 have died so far, compared with under 4,000 in Germany \u2013 a larger country than us, but one that never stopped testing and tracing.</p> <p>The reality now is that we don\u2019t even know who all the people are who are advising the government, let alone what advice they are giving. That advice needs to be published so that all of us, and especially parliament, can interrogate it to ensure that it is robust and that important factors have not been overlooked.</p> <p>Lobby journalists have done their best, but we have to hope that the return of parliament will mean that the government and its advisers are made to be a good deal more accountable than they are required to be in their daily press briefings.<br><strong>Chris Dunne</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The suggestion that we should repeatedly flip-flop between lockdown and relaxation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-distancing-continue-until-2022-lockdown-pandemic\" title=\"\">Coronavirus distancing may need to continue until 2022, say experts</a>, 14 April) is dangerous nonsense. Denmark and Greece, among others, have shown what must be done. Lock down fast, hard, long, and once and for all. Wait until new coronavirus cases have fallen to a trickle. Only then let everyone go back to work and socialise, when there is very little virus left to spread. With the economy finally back to firing on all cylinders, keep the virus in check with rigorous testing, tracking, isolation and border control. Our government failed its first test. Its second test will be to resist pressures to lift lockdown too early.<br><strong>David Allen</strong><br><em>Kinoulton, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 This government is obsessed with drawing parallels between Covid-19 and the second world war. Odd, therefore, that ministers can\u2019t see that in claiming it\u2019s too early for an exit strategy, they are aligning with those short-sighted strategists who said the Beveridge report on rebuilding and improving health and social services would be a distraction. It wasn\u2019t.

  "<p>News that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, used Friday morning to announce a \u201c<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/matt-hancock-lays-six-point-battle-plan-conquer-coronavirus-2153878/\">six-point battle plan</a>\u201d stirs memories of yore \u2013 Thursday afternoon \u2013 when the supply prime minister, Dominic Raab, announced his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/dominic-raab-s-five-tests-for-easing-the-lockdown\">five tests</a>\u201d.

Alas, in a development best described as ironicidal, the care badge website then swiftly ran into difficulties, leaving visitors greeted with the news that there was now a shortage of care badges. Until production is \u201cramped up\u201d, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the chief success of the care badge was to form a psychic shield around the health secretary. It will, however, take more than a badge if he doesn\u2019t hit his 100,000 tests a day target for the end of April, having already <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/testing-for-coronavirus-covid-19-will-increase-to-25-000-a-day\">missed the 25,000-a-day</a> target for the middle of the month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-crisis-britain-young-people-future-bill\">When the coronavirus crisis is over, it should be payback time for the young | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Can you recall if the 100,000 tests was ever technically a pillar?

Even so it was very disappointing recently to learn that one No 10 official had told the Sunday Times\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/inside-no-10-everyone-is-at-war-over-coronavirus-56rwtmf9q\">Tim Shipman</a>: \u201cThere is not much love for Matt Handjob here.\u201d Known to receive even less favourable notices from his officials is Raab, who gives the 5pm press conference with the air of a man who strongly suspects there\u2019s a chalk penis drawn on his back, but is just going to butch it out by facing forward till the bell goes.</p> <p>Talking of butching it out, the good news is that the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/eu-and-uk-government-to-resume-post-brexit-talks-next-week\">going to refuse to extend</a> the Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, even if the EU requests a delay, and against the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52304821\">urging of the International Monetary Fund</a>. I know the ultra-Brexiteers enjoy a good war metaphor, so let\u2019s just say that this out-of-the-pandemic-into-the-no-deal move threatens to give our nation a strong <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)\">USS Indianapolis </a>feel to it. By way of background, the Indianapolis was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese in 1945, in one of the worst naval attacks of the second world war. Those sailors who survived were left bobbing in the Pacific, where, over the next few days, they were subject to the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-worst-shark-attack-in-history-25715092/\">worst recorded shark attack</a> in history.</p> <p>Anyway, thus things rumble on while the prime minister remains off games. Boris Johnson is at Chequers, where his spokesman clarifies he is \u201cnot doing government work\u201d. A slightly strange styling, which makes some people assume Johnson is finishing his late-delivered Shakespeare book. I\u2019m sure nothing is further from the truth \u2013 not even Johnson himself, who has rarely been in the same hemisphere as the truth for his entire career.</p> <p>But there is clearly some trade-off as to how his stand-ins should handle this particular chit from matron. On the one hand, they keep stressing absolutely everything is proceeding in accordance with a plan laid out by the prime minister before he fell ill. On the other, they want to avoid going too far on that front, or risk casting the UK as the driverless car of governance, a largely automated enterprise where the role of prime minister is essentially meaningless. A bit like that of regimental goat, or England football captain. (The Italians, of course, just give the armband to the oldest guy on the pitch. Then again, the past couple of months have arguably shown that we don\u2019t care to learn anything much from the Italians.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000\">Coronavirus live news: China denies cover-up as Wuhan death toll revised up by 50%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the best thing that can be said at the moment is that at least we\u2019re not the United States. At the time of the Antonine plague, the Roman empire was ruled by Marcus Aurelius, a philosopher-statesman whose Meditations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/apr/16/how-stoics-are-speaking-to-locked-down-readers\">still racks up healthy sales</a> a full 1,840 years after his death. At the time of the coronavirus, the US is ruled by Donald Trump, a realtor whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\">The Art of the Deal</a> \u2026 probably won\u2019t do. Pressed repeatedly on Thursday to tell his supporters who are flouting the lockdown to stay at home, Trump said: \u201cThey seem to be protesters that like me and respect my opinion.\u201d So, unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to.</p> <p>Having actively contributed to the loss of lives, Trump is going to have to get very creative in citing any that he\u2019s saved. That said, last month was the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-school-shooting-stats-gun-laws-hillary-clinton-coronavirus-a9465406.html\">first March without</a> a school shooting since 2002, so maybe he could credit himself with the new approach to the US school shootings problem currently being trialled. Which is to say: no schools. All that time parent activists have spent trying to limit guns, it turned out that the smart way to do it was just to shut schools. Really makes you think. Do expect to see the National Rifle Association unveil a new slogan in the coming months: Guns don\u2019t kill people; schools do.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020.

  "<p>I\u2019m really antisocial, so just sitting on the sofa and having a cup of tea is my idea of heaven. I\u2019m trying to politely decline all the Zoom offers that are being thrown my way and I\u2019ve been watching lots of TV instead.</p> <p>In terms of total escapism, something I\u2019ve been going back to is my favourite sitcom: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/23/how-we-made-the-royle-family\">The Royle Family</a>. I watched it when it was first shown, but I didn\u2019t appreciate just how clever it was. It was always on in the background because my family loved it, but I was a bit more passive. I sat down a couple of weeks ago and went through it all again and realised how the cast are the most brilliant actors. It\u2019s one of the only series that makes me properly laugh.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite nostalgic for me, too, because their house looks like the house we grew up in and it feels very familiar \u2013 it\u2019s like sitting in the living room with your own family. One of my favourite episodes is when they go to Prestatyn. They rarely leave the house, so it\u2019s a big deal for them to be off on their holidays. Then they get to the caravan and Jim\u2019s got the hump because there\u2019s no chip pan and the telly isn\u2019t that good. It really tickles me. I love Ricky Tomlinson as an actor and he\u2019s such a sweetheart in real life; he\u2019s a really charitable man and very generous with his time.</p> <p>My partner, Kev, and I sat down on the sofa and got through five or six episodes in one go. It\u2019s a running joke that Antony\u2019s always sent to get the tea in the show \u2013 he\u2019s the dogsbody \u2013 and that\u2019s like Kev and I, taking it in turns to delegate and winding each other up.</p> <p>The other show I\u2019ve got into is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/insane-intoxicating-tale-of-big-cats-is-perfect-lockdown-tv-tiger-watch-james-mcavoy-greta-gerwig\">Tiger King</a>. I do this all the time when people are talking about a show \u2013 for some reason, I only watch it later, mainly because I\u2019m not in on the jokes and all the memes that are going around. Eventually, I gave in with Tiger King and it\u2019s just so captivating \u2013 the characters are so charismatic and, even if I fundamentally disagree with most of what they stand for, I\u2019m still so drawn to them. You\u2019d believe it if it was fiction, but as real life it almost makes no sense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7314ef77de800831b91f0d3e0bfc6bf2891ca26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7314ef77de800831b91f0d3e0bfc6bf2891ca26/0_149_1692_1015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Royle family cast: (back row from left) Ralf Little and Ricky Tomlinson; (front) Craig Cash, Caroline Aherne, Sue Johnston and Liz Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Royle family ... <em>(back row from left)</em> Ralf Little and Ricky Tomlinson; <em>(front)</em> Craig Cash, Caroline Aherne, Sue Johnston and Liz Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC One</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a film-maker myself, it\u2019s also amazing to see the access the team got for Tiger King and to be able to dedicate that amount of time to one story. That\u2019s a luxury that few of us have now. It got me thinking about a documentary I made on big game hunters a few years ago in South Africa. I remember there was a debate around conservation there and it was less black and white to me, because they donated a lot of their hunted meat to the orphanages in the surrounding areas and they were assuring us that they didn\u2019t shoot anything that was endangered.</p> <p>It\u2019s hilarious that everybody is slightly on Joe Exotic\u2019s side, though, and that they\u2019ve taken to hate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/03/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-tv\">Carole [Baskin]</a> \u2013 when you look at the pair of them on paper, the way they behave, what they stand for and what they do, they\u2019re just as bad as each other. It just shows you that you never know how the public is going to react to some of the people that you film, no matter how objective you try to be.</p> <p><em>Stacey Dooley: Locked Up With </em><em>the Lifers is on BBC Two on 19 April and Stacey Dooley: Costa Del Narcos is on BBC Two on 26 April at 9pm</em></p>",

That is worse than economists expected, with a Reuters poll having forecasted a contraction of -6.5%. </p> <p>But markets aren\u2019t fazed. Stocks in Asia shrugged off the news, with the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.7%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rising 3.1% and Australia\u2019s ASX up 1.8%. Europe is also called higher. </p> <p>Some investors seem more intrigued that American biotech firm Gilead may have found a potential drug to treat coronavirus. Others seem to be taking the view that the data could have been much, much worse. </p> <p>However, there is the age-old concern that the figures may not be telling the whole story, and many economists still question the reliability of China\u2019s data - especially when you drill down into indicators like retail sales, which were hammered after shops were ordered to close during the worst of the outbreak. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1251021593356222464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#China</a> GDP declined 6.8% YoY in Q1 2020.

While turning out its bacon naan roll from your dwindling store cupboard may be a step too far, its kejriwal is within grasp. A tip from Dishoom: \u201cThe most convenient way of finishing the eggs here is to use a frying pan that can go into the oven. If you don\u2019t have one, fry the eggs until cooked in the pan, then top with the cheese, spring onions, chilli and pepper.\u201d The cheese won\u2019t melt as much, but at this point, who is splitting hairs? Add a good dollop of ketchup and your own tailor-made soundtrack, \u00e0 la Dishoom.</p> <p>Serves<strong> 1</strong></p> <p><strong>80g mature cheddar, </strong>grated<br><strong>1 or 2 thick slices </strong><strong>white bloomer, sourdough or brioche</strong> (depending on size and level of hunger)<br><strong>2 spring onions,</strong> chopped<br><strong>1 green chilli, </strong>very finely chopped<br><strong>1 tsp vegetable oi</strong>l (optional)<br><strong>1 or 2 large eggs</strong> (one for each slice of toast)<br><strong>Coarsely ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>To serve<em><br></em><strong>Tomato ketchup</strong></p> <p>Let the grated cheese come up to room temperature; it needs to be quite soft and workable. Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/gas mark 9 and put in a baking tray to warm up.</p> <p>Toast the bread until very lightly browned on both sides, then set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the topping.</p> <p>Set aside a small handful of grated cheese (roughly 10g), a teaspoon of chopped spring onion and a pinch of green chilli, to be used when you fry the egg(s).</p> <p>Crack the egg(s) into a cup or small bowl, being careful to keep the yolk(s) intact.</p> <p>Put the remaining cheese, spring onions and chilli in a bowl, add plenty of black pepper and mix well. Using the back of a spoon (or your fingers), work the cheese mixture into a paste by pressing it firmly into the sides of the bowl.</p> <p>Spread the cheese mix evenly over the toast and press it in, using the back of the spoon, to create a firm, even layer that goes all the way to the edges of the toast. Place on the tray in the oven and cook for six to eight minutes, until deep golden and bubbling.</p> <p>While the chilli cheese toast is cooking, warm a frying pan over a high heat and, if using, add the oil. Gently tip the egg(s) into the hot pan and add some black pepper. Top with the reserved grated cheese, spring onion and green chilli. Place the frying pan in the oven and cook for two minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the egg white(s) are cooked but the yolk(s) are still runny.</p> <p>Carefully slide the egg(s) on to the cheese on toast and serve right away, with plenty of ketchup.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recipe from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dishoom-9781408890677.html\">Dishoom</a> by Shamil Thakrar, Kavi Thakrar &amp; Naved Nasir (Bloomsbury, \u00a326)</em></p> <h2><strong>The Quality Chop House\u2019s confit potatoes</strong></h2> <p>Few things have the ability to cosset and hug quite like these carby cuboids from the <a href=\"https://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House</a>. The restaurant\u2019s celebrated confit potatoes are cooked in duck fat, which is sold in most large supermarkets; the local butcher might have it, too. This recipe is a labour of love but, well, we have the time. Plus, that shattering crunch and fluffy interior will put even the most perfectly roast spuds to shame. Use maris pipers, if you\u2019ve got them, says The Quality Chop House: \u201cThey have the perfect sugar-starch-water content to prevent collapse while cooking.\u201d</p> <p>Serves<strong> 6</strong></p> <p><strong>1kg maris piper potatoes<br>125g duck fat<br>1 tbsp salt<br>Oil, for frying <br>Maldon salt, </strong>to taste<strong><br>Mustard dressing </strong>(see below)</p> <p>For the mustard dressing<strong><br>425g dijon mustard<br>Juice of \u00bd lemon<br>\u00bd tsp cider vinegar<br>375ml vegetable oil</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/gas mark \u00bd and line a standard 1.7-litre terrine mould with baking paper.</p> <p>Peel and wash the potatoes, then use a mandoline to slice them as thinly as possible. In a large bowl, toss the slices thoroughly in the duck fat and salt. Layer the potatoes in the mould, one slice at a time, until you have built up multiple tiers. Once you\u2019ve used up all the potato, cover the top with baking paper and cook for about three hours, until the potatoes are completely tender. Put a small baking tray or plate on top of the baking paper cover, along with a few heavy weights (we find tins work well) and leave to cool, then refrigerate overnight to compress.</p> <p>For the dressing, mix the mustard, lemon juice and vinegar in a bowl, then whisk in the vegetable oil until emulsified. Store in squeezy bottles in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to use.</p> <p>The next day, remove the potatoes from the mould and cut into 3cm x 3cm pieces.</p> <p>Heat enough oil for deep-fat frying to 190C (170C fan)/gas mark 5, either in a deep fryer or a heavy-based saucepan. Fry the pieces for about four minutes, until croissant-gold. Sprinkle over some sea salt, drizzle with the mustard dressing and eat immediately.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recipe from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/quality-chop-house-9781787134485.html\">The Quality Chop House: Modern Recipes and Stories from a London Classic</a> by Will Lander, Dan Morgenthau and Shaun Searley (Quadrille, hardback and ebook available, \u00a330)</em></p> <h2><strong>The Sportsman\u2019s soda bread</strong></h2> <p>While the sound of gulls and smell of seaweed have been put on ice for most of us, you can still bring a taste of <a href=\"http://thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk/\">the Sportsman pub</a> at Seasalter, Kent, into your home. While people flocked to the justly lauded pub for local oysters, slip sole grilled in a bath of seaweed butter, and its stupendous treacle tart, chef Stephen Harris\u2019s homemade bread is a winner, in particular his treacly soda bread. We seem to be baking bread like there\u2019s no tomorrow right now, so if you have stashed bags of flour, there could be no finer way to put it to use; if you didn\u2019t, bank this recipe for brighter times.

Add the treacle and buttermilk, and mix until fully incorporated. You can do this in a stand mixer fitted with a dough-hook or paddle at low speed.</p> <p>Turn the sticky dough out on to a well-floured work counter and knead lightly, just until no longer sticky. Form into a loaf shape and lift on to the prepared baking sheet.</p> <p>Bake for five minutes, then lower the heat to 180C (160C fan)/gas mark 4 and bake for 30-40 minutes. When the loaf is done, it should sound hollow when you tap the underside. Or test with a skewer, which should come out clean when probed into the centre.</p> <p>Leave the bread to cool on a wire rack.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recipe from The Sportsman by Stephen Harris (Phaidon, \u00a329.95)</em></p> <h2><strong>Ravneet Gill\u2019s crumbly chocolate biscuits</strong></h2> <p>If you joined the lengthy queues at bakery pop-up Puff at <a href=\"https://passorestaurant.com/\">Passo</a>, in Old Street, London, before lockdown, you will be well acquainted with Ravneet Gill (formerly of <a href=\"https://stjohnrestaurant.com/\">St John</a>, among others) and Nicola Lamb (ex-<a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/restaurants\">Ottolenghi </a>and<a href=\"http://lbpedlar.com/\"> Little Bread Pedlar</a>) and their cracking cookies, lemon brulee tart, and rhubarb and custard pie. Happily, Gill has released her first cookbook, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pastry-chef-s-guide-9781911641513.html\">The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide</a>, which includes a recipe for crumbly chocolate biscuits, which Gill recommends sandwiching together with a filling of mascarpone mixed with white chocolate and a touch of sea salt. However, they are equally good as they are.</p> <p>This dough is a bit sticky to work with, but worth it for the intense chocolate flavour and gorgeously crumbly texture.</p> <p>Makes<strong> 35</strong></p> <p><strong>225g unsalted butter, </strong>softened<strong><br>150g caster (superfine) sugar<br>240g plain flour<br>80g cocoa powder<br>\u00bc tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>\u00bc large pinch fine salt<br>2 \u00bd tbsp golden syrup</strong></p> <p>Put the butter and sugar in a stand mixer or large bowl. Cream together using the paddle attachment or a handheld electric whisk until well combined with no lumps.</p> <p>Mix the dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate and salt) in a separate bowl. Add these to the butter mixture and mix until a loose dough starts to form.</p> <p>Add the golden syrup and mix until the dough comes together. Remove the dough and pat into a flat shape. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least two hours.</p> <p>Remove the plastic and knead the dough through briefly. Roll it out between two sheets of baking paper to a thickness of about 4mm. Transfer to a baking sheet on the paper and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Stamp out rounds using a cutter of your choice (the dough makes 35 biscuits using a 7cm fluted cutter). Use a palette knife to slide the biscuits back on to two new baking sheets covered with baking paper, slightly spaced out (they won\u2019t grow much) and chill again for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas mark 4. Bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes, until dry to the touch. Leave to cool completely on the baking sheet and eat them as they are or sandwich together with a filling; I like mascarpone mixed with white chocolate and a touch of sea salt. The baked biscuits will keep in an airtight container for up to two weeks. Once any filling has been added, they are best eaten on the same day.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recipe from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pastry-chef-s-guide-9781911641513.html\">The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide </a>by Ravneet Gill (Pavilion, \u00a318.99)</em></p> <h2><strong>Ducksoup\u2019s mozzarella, borlotti and wild garlic green sauce</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e365eeb9074bb8796c61523624b5c758f5b6d94b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e365eeb9074bb8796c61523624b5c758f5b6d94b/0_685_2940_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ducksoup\u2019s mozzarella, borlotti and wild garlic green sauce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ducksoup\u2019s mozzarella, borlotti and wild garlic green sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Are you craving for a night perched on a stool at <a href=\"https://www.ducksoupsoho.co.uk/\">Ducksoup</a>, in central London, with a glass of natural wine in hand and pared-back plates inspired by Italian, Middle Eastern and Nordic flavours in front of you?

While gatherings are off the cards, if you\u2019re cooking for your family (or particularly hungry), you need to adopt the \u201cGoldilocks Rule\u201d, says Khan: \u201cYou want the drumsticks to be neither too fat, not too thin.

These kababs can be cooked either in an oven or on a barbecue.</p> <p>If cooking in an oven, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas mark 6. Place the drumsticks on an oven tray in a single layer to allow them to cook evenly and pour over any remaining marinade. Bake for 20\u201325 minutes, then use a sharp knife or skewer to pierce the thickest part of the drumstick to check whether the juices run clear; if not, return to the oven. When cooked, the drumsticks should be speckled with brown patches, but the meat should not be dry.</p> <p>If cooking on a barbecue, wait until any flames have subsided and a low heat is evenly spread across the coals (if the heat is too high, the outsides of the drumsticks will cook quickly but the insides will still be raw). The cooking time will vary depending on the heat of the coals.

  "<p>From the minute we went into lockdown, there\u2019s been a lively discussion, online and elsewhere, about how to fill <a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/2020040387411/productive-things-to-do-during-lockdown/\">all our extra spare time</a>. We parents of small children permitted ourselves a hollow laugh at that (before immediately worrying that the hollow laugh was turning into a dry cough). Because for us, there was suddenly no time at all. Every waking second was accounted for, so the advice that we might seize this opportunity to reread the novels of Jane Austen or dust off our half-written screenplays felt deeply surreal \u2013 and therefore, I suppose, entirely in keeping with the times.<br><br>There\u2019s nothing new about people having radically different quantities of time, of course \u2013 nor about the fact that <a href=\"https://stateofopportunity.michiganradio.org/post/time-poverty\">time inequality</a> doesn\u2019t line up with economic inequality. (Low-income workers and senior executives wish they had more time; unemployed people and super-wealthy layabouts would be happier with less.) But never before has the distribution of time divided my social circle so sharply, providing another reminder that this thing we\u2019re all doing these days is, in fact, a completely different thing, depending on who you are \u2013 rich or poor, parent or not, nurse or novelist, homebody or compulsive socialiser.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now I rarely doubt I\u2019m spending my time on things that matter.

Mostly, it\u2019s absorbing. It\u2019s dawning on me that much of what I called busyness, before coronavirus, was really scatteredness \u2013 a focus on too many things, including some I unconsciously knew were a waste of time. In lockdown, I rarely doubt I\u2019m spending my time on things that matter; not because I\u2019ve become a time-management ninja, but because I have no choice. Honestly, I\u2019m grateful not to have time to reread Austen because I know what I\u2019d actually be using it for: ruminating impotently on the horrors in the news.<br><br>I hope it goes without saying that I know I\u2019d feel differently if the time-crunch left me at imminent risk of homelessness or hunger, or if I weren\u2019t so fortunate in numerous other respects. But the point isn\u2019t that it\u2019s good to be deprived of time. It\u2019s that the pandemic is forcing us, in ways large and small, to confront reality. The big realities include the inadequacy of our safety nets and our utter reliance on essential workers we don\u2019t properly support. One smaller reality, for me, has been seeing with fresh eyes what it means <a href=\"https://www.raptitude.com/2017/01/why-theres-never-enough-time/\">to have finite time</a>. The truth is, I don\u2019t have less of it than before (I\u2019ve always had 24 hours a day). It\u2019s just that now I\u2019m less free to fritter it or be seduced by the various industries whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to try to persuade us to waste it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/10/if-somethings-out-of-your-control-should-you-still-worry-about-it-oliver-burkeman\">If something\u2019s out of your control, should you still worry about it? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who knows if this insight will stick once the pandemic passes \u2013 or, conversely, should the virus hit closer to home.

  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has said it would be \u201clogical and sensible\u201d for Scotland to diverge from the rest of the UK in terms of an exit strategy from lockdown where the evidence directs it.</p> \n<p>The Scottish first minister issued what will be seen as a veiled criticism of the UK government\u2019s warning that discussing an exit strategy at this stage would confuse critical health guidance. She promised to treat the Scottish public \u201cas the grown-ups that you are\u201d, and share \u201cas much detail as I can\u201d on plans for an eventual emergence from lockdown and future management of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Speaking directly to the public at her daily briefing, she said: \u201cThe challenge we face is to find a balance that allows us to suppress and control the virus and and minimise absolutely the damage it can do, while also allowing life to go on, if not completely as normal, then at least in as normal a way as is possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile we know that the current lockdown measures are essential, we also know that they bring serious consequences of their own and these may also be measured in lives lost and life changes curtailed.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/17/woman-90-climb-highland-mountain-home-help-nhs-margaret-payne\">Woman, 90, to climb Highland mountain on her stairs to help NHS</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>She added: \u201cI want to stress again that the government will be as open as we can be.

  "<p>Conservationists have condemned the decision to allow falconers to take wild peregrine falcon chicks from nests as \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201csending the wrong message\u201d.</p> <p>For the first time ever this year, Natural England, the government\u2019s wildlife watchdog, will <a href=\"https://naturalengland.blog.gov.uk/2020/04/16/natural-england-issues-licences-for-taking-peregrine-falcons-from-the-wild-for-falconry/\">allow the taking of six chicks from peregrine nests</a> to help falconers establish a lucrative new \u201cstudbook\u201d of British falcons.</p> <p>Peregrine falcons \u2013 the fastest species on the planet, reaching more than 200mph during dives for prey \u2013 were threatened with extinction as a breeding bird in the 1970s.

The application will therefore be regarded by many as selfish \u2013 it should be reconsidered in light of alternative solutions, and in the context that peregrines suffer from illegal persecution, trade and loss of breeding range.\u201d</p> <p>While all nesting birds are legally protected, licensing the removal of chicks for falconry is permitted under wildlife laws. Falconers argue that their current captive birds are not verifiably British birds and EU regulations permit the sustainable use of species for cultural purposes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/house-sparrows-flocking-back-british-gardens-survey-shows\">House sparrows flocking back to British gardens, survey shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unesco recognises falconry as an \u201cintangible cultural heritage of humanity\u201d and the ancient practice is increasingly lucrative, with birds changing hands for as much as \u00a36,000 to supply the sport of falcon-racing in the Middle East. Three falconers will remove chicks from nests in England, although they <a href=\"https://markavery.info/2020/04/16/guest-blog-taking-peregrines-from-the-wild-for-falconry-by-gary-wall/\">will not be allowed to do so in parts of northern England</a> where the peregrine is still threatened.</p> <p>Natural England said its licence would only allow a chick to be taken from a nest where there were three or more chicks present.

If you\u2019re going to be doing falconry, use the birds in captivity. What is wrong with them? Someone is making money from this somewhere along the line \u2013 what sort of message does this send around Europe and the Middle East? It validates the idea that the peregrine is not a species in decline and we can take some more from the wild.\u201d</p> <p>Jade Emery, wildlife campaigner for Animal Aid, said it was \u201ca huge step backwards\u201d for wild bird protection.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWhile Natural England attempt to dignify falconry by describing it as \u2018an ancient tradition\u2019, it is in fact just outdated. Taking animals from the wild and subjugating them for entertainment or sport is fundamentally wrong, should be consigned to history, and is certainly not something that should be supported by Natural England. The wellbeing of these majestic birds should be prioritised over this outdated and cruel hobby, and this decision should be quickly reversed.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Gordon Mellor, chairman of falconry organisation the Hawk Board, said: \u201cFalconers across the world have controlled access to wild populations of raptors following the principles of sustainable use. In this respect UK authorities are following established conservation practice.</p> <p>\u201cUK wildlife legislation is predicated upon the need to conserve and protect wild populations. Given that the peregrine population is currently buoyant, the taking of limited numbers will have no impact upon the wellbeing of that species in the wild.\u201d</p>",

He denies all the charges.</p> <p>Det Supt Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation into the journalist\u2019s murder, made a direct appeal for help to the Creggan community.</p> <p>In his letter, the senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer said: \u201cLyra\u2019s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person.</p> <p>\u201cThe events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important.

  "<p>After years of being overwhelmed with choice in the wine aisles and inundated with wine offers, it\u2019s strange suddenly to be in a situation where it can be hard to lay your hands on a decent, well-priced bottle. Although many independents are still offering a free local delivery service, I\u2019m conscious that many of you don\u2019t live in an area that has one, and that budgets may well be too tight to buy a whole case (though you could always share with neighbours).</p> <p>Which is not to say that supermarkets are easy right now, what with limits on the number of bottles you can buy and a shrinking range. And have you noticed that special offers are thinner on the ground, too? The kind of prices I used to see at a tasting and think: \u201cWell, that\u2019s clearly designed to be discounted\u201d, are now becoming the norm.

I get that supermarkets, like other businesses, are encountering extra costs right now, but they\u2019re some of the few companies that must be doing reasonably well out of the current crisis. I doubt we\u2019ll see any of those 25%-off six bottles any time soon, but who knows? Nothing is certain in these uncertain times.</p> <p>Aldi and Lidl win out for some of the cheapest buys around, although almost certainly anything under a fiver will have been raided. That said, it\u2019s well worth looking out for Aldi\u2019s three Grapevine wines, which are all under \u00a34, of which I think the cabernet sauvignon<strong> </strong>from Spain\u2019s La Mancha (\u00a33.79, 12.5%), which shows amazingly good cabernet character for the price, is the best.</p> <p>Lidl is running one of its periodic Wine Tour promotions \u2013 I mentioned the moscato <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/10/sweet-cravings-wines-to-match-desserts-fiona-beckett\">last week</a> \u2013 but the quality of its basic range, which includes the well-priced pecorino below (a wine, not just a cheese), has improved, too.</p> <p>Mainly, however, it\u2019s a question of keeping your eyes open, rather than setting out with a particular wine in mind. I spotted (and seized) the last bottle of <strong><a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/products/davida\">Davida</a></strong> (14%), a glorious, pretty well natural garnacha from Spain\u2019s Navarra region that has the added advantage of having no added sulphites, for \u00a38 in my local Co-op the other day.

It feels like apt and cheering happenstance that in 2020, the go-to floral has switched from outright moodiness to the more tentatively hopeful combination of green and white.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/28/how-to-wear-70s-look-jess-cartner-morley\">How to wear the 70s look | Jess Cartner-Morley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These Gap khaki trousers have been in my wardrobe for a couple of years.

  "<p>At Amazon, it\u2019s always \u201cday one\u201d. Founder Jeff Bezos coined the phrase in the company\u2019s early days, and it\u2019s now deeply woven into the firm\u2019s culture: it has appeared in every shareholder letter since 1997, and even adorns the building in which Bezos works. As tech reporter Alex Kantrowitz <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/607065/always-day-one-by-alex-kantrowitz/\">writes</a>, \u201cday one\u201d means \u201cinventing like a startup\u201d \u2013 a call for continual improvement and innovation. Dynamism is in; complacency is out. For Bezos, \u201cday two\u201d is another name for<a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders\"> death</a>.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s not always wise to take corporate self-description at face value. Still, given the staggering speed and scale of Amazon\u2019s growth, it\u2019s reasonable to think that its \u201cday one\u201d mentality has had something to do with its success. Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalisation of just over $1tn at time of writing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-jeff-bezos-gains-24bn-coronavirus-pandemic\">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos grows fortune by $24bn amid coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the Covid-19 outbreak hasn\u2019t slowed Amazon down. Quite the opposite: even as other businesses have downsized or shuttered, Amazon has proved remarkably well-placed to capitalise on these new circumstances, with customers spending a reported $11,000 (\u00a38,845) a second on its products and services. As lockdown orders have trapped people indoors, many are turning to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/amazon-to-take-almost-50-percent-of-us-e-commerce-market-by-years-end.html\">home</a> deliveries via Amazon, bolstering the importance of a company that has already captured nearly 50% of the US e-commerce market. To keep up with increased customer demand, the company plans to<a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/operations/amazon-opening-100000-new-roles\"> hire</a> 100,000 new workers. Despite being a commercial entity, Amazon increasingly looks like a public utility. It has even partnered with the<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cornavirus-canada-amazon/canada-signs-agreement-with-amazon-canada-to-distribute-medical-equipment-idUSKBN21L2MO\"> Canadian</a> government to distribute medical equipment, and with the<a href=\"https://www.verdict.co.uk/coronavirus-home-test-delivery/\"> UK</a> government to deliver at-home testing kits. Indeed, it may be one of the few retailers to<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/10/21215953/amazon-fresh-walmart-grocery-delivery-coronavirus-retail-store-closures\"> emerge</a> from this pandemic stronger than before.</p> <p>But despite the outward success, Amazon\u2019s embrace of ceaseless invention has come at a cost. In the absence of a strong ethical code, the ruthlessness that makes Amazon so successful for its shareholders can become indistinguishable from cruelty toward those who are not counted in its success metrics. Amazon itself may be flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic, but not all Amazonians are benefiting equally.</p> <p>As customers turn to delivery services such as Amazon out of fear of contracting the virus, the risks appear to have merely been shifted on to workers. A warehouse worker in New York state organised a walkout last month to protest what he alleged were the company\u2019s inadequate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-safety\">safety</a> measures, including its lack of paid sick leave, and was fired; a leaked<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\"> memo</a> indicated that Amazon\u2019s general counsel wanted to depict him as \u201cnot smart or articulate\u201d in their PR strategy (the executive who made this remark later published a statement that read \u201cI let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me\u201d).</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s poor treatment of its frontline workers \u2013 both during this crisis and beforehand \u2013 illustrates the dark side of the \u201cday one\u201d mentality. Amazon\u2019s constant push to improve productivity may serve shareholders, but it also results in working conditions so physically taxing that warehouses are stocking vending machines with <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/working-amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-center-emily-guendelsberger-on-the-clock-20190709.html\">pain medication</a>, in a tacit acknowledgement of the physical toll. For Amazon, collateral damage appears irrelevant as long as there\u2019s a steady flow of workers walking through the doors every morning.</p> <p>That Amazon is evidently not accountable to its workers should raise the question of who Amazon <em>is </em>accountable to. The more Bezos\u2019s empire <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/coronavirus-is-speeding-up-the-amazonification-of-the-planet-21cb20d16372\">embeds</a> itself into the infrastructure of our lives, the more important it becomes to question its motives. In the midst of a crisis with an easily identifiable villain \u2013 the virus \u2013 Amazon has an opportunity to recast itself as corporate saviour for our times, the company that kept everyone stocked with necessary supplies, even when they couldn\u2019t leave their houses. As other services have slowed or ground to a halt, Prime deliveries are one of the few continuities from the world we\u2019re leaving behind. But make no mistake \u2013 Amazon is not merely a benevolent or charitable force, akin to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/220bf850-726c-11ea-ad98-044200cb277f\">Red Cross</a>. It is, after all, a commercial company, and its ownership structure is absurdly out of sync with the map of who\u2019s affected by it.</p> <p>Most technology companies reserve a large chunk of shares for founders, and Amazon is no exception. Bezos currently owns nearly 60 million shares, or 11% of the company, even <em>after </em>having<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/jeff-bezos-amazon-stock-net-worth-2/\"> liquidated</a> $12bn of shares (Bezos\u2019s ex-wife MacKenzie<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/28/tech/mackenzie-bezos-amazon-shares/index.html\"> holds</a> 4%, as part of their divorce agreement last year). Of the shares held by employees, ownership is heavily concentrated among early employees in executive roles. The workers most at risk during this pandemic are severely underrepresented: warehouse workers, who were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/03/amazon-offsetting-pay-rise-by-removing-bonuses-union-says\"> previously</a> awarded approximately one share per year, saw their pay adjusted in 2018 to remove even that paltry grant.</p> <p>As this pandemic makes the world more dependent on Amazon, it\u2019s useful to remember who is actually doing the day-to-day work that keeps the company running. It\u2019s not Jeff Bezos making the deliveries or packing the boxes, after all. For that, we should thank the frontline workers, who are underpaid, overworked and often putting themselves at risk.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has essentially functioned as a stress test of our entire socioeconomic order, inadvertently shining a harsh light on all the ways people are being failed by this system. The result could be massive upheaval. In the US, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/04/09/ureal-unemployment-rate-jobless-claims-this-week/\">unemployment</a> rates are higher than they\u2019ve been in eight decades; millions of renters are skipping their<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/business/americans-rent-payment-trnd/index.html\"> rent</a> payments; policies that would have been considered anathema before the crisis are being seriously debated. The structure can be changed \u2013 indeed, once we emerge from this crisis, we may find that it will have already changed. Our political imaginations will need to be updated to reflect this new reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000\">Coronavirus live news: China denies cover-up as Wuhan death toll revised up by 50%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The more Amazon effectively functions as a utility, the more we should be thinking about how to treat it that way. There are many avenues that could be explored: stronger<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html\"> anti-trust</a> legislation; something akin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/nationalise-google-facebook-amazon-data-monopoly-platform-public-interest\">nationalisation</a>; breaking it up into separate companies; stronger labour protections; increased worker control. Rather than an Amazon that sacrifices workers on the altar of shareholder value, we could have an Amazon that balances the needs of all relevant stakeholders.</p> <p>These suggestions might sound impossibly radical, not least because those currently in charge are unlikely to support measures to decrease their wealth and power. But maybe we can borrow a page from Amazon\u2019s book to frame this discussion in a new way. After all, there\u2019s something quite appealing in the idea of \u201cday one\u201d, with its connotations of disruption and reinvention. It\u2019s just a pity that Amazon has directed that energy exclusively towards maximising shareholder value.</p> <p>Imagine instead, if that \u201cday one\u201d spirit were directed toward the socioeconomic system that subordinated these workers in the first place, such that the fruits of their labour were shared more equitably.

  "<p>A number of civil society organisations have quit the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council\u2019s independent Taser advisory group in protest, claiming no meaningful action is being taken to address the disproportionate use of stun guns against BAME people.</p> <p>Use of the weapons <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/853204/police-use-of-force-apr2018-mar2019-hosb3319.pdf\">rose by 39% last year</a> as growing numbers of police officers were equipped with them. But a new analysis of Home Office figures found black people in England and Wales were almost eight times more likely to have stun guns used against them by police than white people.</p> <p>In a joint resignation letter to the NPCC, the human rights groups Liberty, Inquest, StopWatch and the Open Society, and the policing expert Dr Mike Shiner said that a decision announced privately in February to absorb a planned assessment of the disproportionate impact of the use of stun guns on minority ethnic people into an officer safety review demonstrated that concerns were not being taken seriously.</p> <p>\u201cWe are increasingly concerned that the [<a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/NPCCBusinessAreas/OtherWorkAreas/Taser.aspx\">National </a><a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/NPCCBusinessAreas/OtherWorkAreas/Taser.aspx\">Taser </a><a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/NPCCBusinessAreas/OtherWorkAreas/Taser.aspx\">Stakeholder </a><a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/NPCCBusinessAreas/OtherWorkAreas/Taser.aspx\">Advisory </a><a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/NPCCBusinessAreas/OtherWorkAreas/Taser.aspx\">Group</a> (NTSAG)] is now regularly sidestepped, while the group\u2019s existence is relied on to legitimise current use of Taser,\u201d the letter, sent on 24 March, said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not something we can support \u2026 Police representatives have not valued our expertise, treated the issues we have raised with the level of seriousness they warrant, followed through on commitments made to the NTSAG, or constituted the group to engender meaningful consultation. Accordingly, we can no longer continue as members.\u201d</p> <p>The organisations said the group was not consulted about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/police-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-tasers-in-10m-rollout\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/police-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-tasers-in-10m-rollout\">adoption of stun guns</a> by thousands more officers last year and that an eventual offer \u201cto discuss the potential for unconscious bias training\u201d demonstrated a lack of urgency and mischaracterised an issue that required police policies, practices and organisational drivers to be thoroughly examined.</p> <p>\u201cWe joined the group because we thought it would help ensure that Taser [use] is subject to meaningful scrutiny and appropriate safeguards, but it became clear that it is not fulfilling this role,\u201d said Shiner, an associate professor at LSE\u2019s department of social policy.</p> <p>\u201cWhere commitments were made they did not translate into meaningful action and it felt like delay, delay, delay. The NPCC has effectively sidelined the group and is using it for decorative purposes, creating a false impression of consultation and engagement.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe\u2019re at a dangerous moment when police powers are being increased without corresponding increases in scrutiny and accountability. The rollout of Taser represents a significant escalation in the weaponisation of the police and there is a real danger that we\u2019re sleepwalking into military-style policing.\u201d</p> <p>Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cTasers can and do kill. The rising use of these weapons is alarming and there are serious concerns over how disproportionately they are used against people of colour.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen time and again that stronger, discretionary police powers often result in uneven policing with some communities feeling the brunt of these more than others.\u201d </p> <p>A similar working group, the Best Use of Stop and Search scheme, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/aug/12/met-apologises-over-cressida-dicks-stop-and-search-group-claim\">scrapped after the Home Office withdrew from consultations</a> with experts and then lifted all the conditions governing the use of section 60 powers in August.</p> <p>Last month, the Home Office announced that police forces would receive a further \u00a36.7m to purchase more than 8,000 new stun guns after \u00a310m in ringfenced funding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/police-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-tasers-in-10m-rollout\">was provided in September</a>.</p> <p>Nearly a fifth of 157,000 officers are trained to use the weapons, but fears they damage the principle of policing by consent are growing. Senior police figures have called for all officers to be allowed to carry them on patrol.</p> <p>Of the 22,059 occasions stun guns were used in 2018-19, 4,381 of the incidents involved black people, with discharges in 443 cases. White people were subject to the use of stun guns by police in 14,562 cases, with 1,800 discharges. Using 2011 census data, Shiner\u2019s analysis shows black people are 7.7 times more likely to have the weapons used against them.</p> <p>Serious questions have been raised over the police\u2019s role in the deaths of a number of people after having stun guns used on them, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/14/dalian-atkinson-death-police-officers-suspended-charged\">former footballer Dalian Atkinson, 48</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-46376372\">34-year-old Adrian McDonald</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/police-tasering-of-man-with-mental-health-issues-contributed-to-his-death\">30-year-old Marc Cole</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/officer-who-tasered-jordan-begley-guilty-of-potential-misconduct\">23-year-old Jordan Begley</a>.</p> <p>The NPCC lead for less lethal weapons, the deputy assistant commissioner Lucy D\u2019Orsi, said: \u201cWe have had a good relationship with [NTSAG]. The group is independent of policing with an independent chair who is also a valued member of the police national less lethal weapon working group.</p> <p>\u201cThe group was formed to provide expertise, critical appraisal and advice to police on the use of Taser. As the national lead I have always valued the constructive discussions that we have had and the invaluable insight provided which has influenced policy decisions.</p> <p>\u201cIt is accepted by all parties that sometimes advisory groups and police will disagree on points.

Ella, a 34-year-old climate change scientist, has been raiding her festival fancy-dress box since lockdown began. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fall into the trap of spending all day mooching around in pyjamas, so I decided to wear something every day that I couldn\u2019t wear to work,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has raised more than a few smiles when I\u2019ve been out for my daily dose of fresh air.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d91ec5803783b681456b0ab8b3be1e692ce46f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d91ec5803783b681456b0ab8b3be1e692ce46f/0_0_2472_3296/750.jpg\" alt=\"Ella in one of her fancy-dress outfits\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raiding the fancy-dress box: climate change scientist Ella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by reader</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as many seasoned home-workers extol the mind-focusing values of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/solitary-refinement-a-lockdown-survival-guide\">wearing shoes indoors</a>, some head teachers have advised children <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8151673/Superhead-says-locked-children-wear-school-uniform-HOME.html\">to wear school uniform for home schooling</a>, in order to make the \u201cmental switch\u201d required for learning.

  "<p>The three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.</p> <p>Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit.

It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.</p> <p>\u201cPlease keep your distance,\u201d one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia\u2019s space agency.</p> <p>Following the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US.

  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Never has the slogan \u201ca day at a time\u201d that I learned at my first Narcotics Anonymous meeting well over 33 years ago \u2013 yes, I am still counting the days \u2013 seemed more apposite. On a day-by-day basis I can just about muddle through the coronavirus pandemic. I still wake up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/digested-week-fear-loathing-coronavirus-lockdown\">gripped by anxiety</a> and it can still take a couple of hours for me to feel brave enough to get out of bed, but for the rest of the day I can more or less function. Work provides both a distraction and an outlet for my feelings of powerlessness, pedalling up and down the same hill 10 times on my wife\u2019s (much too small) bicycle replaces cortisol with endorphins and our small back garden has been a haven in the good weather. So I am more than aware that I am so much more fortunate than many others in the current situation. It\u2019s when I start to think about the future that things rather fall apart. When will I next see my daughter in Minneapolis? We were due to fly over in August but, even if the flights are operational, would it be a good idea to go to the US with health insurance that is certain to exclude Covid-19? When will I next see my son in Brighton? When will I next see my mother? Her care home went into lockdown three weeks ago and has now reported its first suspected coronavirus case. So, she is lonely and frightened, confined to her room, seeing almost no one. These are the thoughts that dominate my subconscious and to which there are no clear answers. Which is presumably why I wake up in a complete state every morning.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I can\u2019t help feeling that government ministers must be secretly wishing they had never agreed to give a daily Downing Street press conference. Obviously, given the gravity of the situation, they didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter but, having now watched every single one of them, it\u2019s now clear their main underlying purpose is to show just how little command of the situation ministers actually have and how policy is being made up day by day. Rishi Sunak has already delivered at least six new budgets since his first one on 11 March and looks set to hit double figures by the end of the month. Matt Hancock has managed to forget his first promise to deliver 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April \u2013 we\u2019re currently at about 16,000 \u2013 and has instead committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/britain-on-target-for-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day-says-no-10\">100,000 tests daily</a> by the end of the month. He has also rather belatedly remembered he is secretary of state for social care as well as health, though care workers would probably more appreciate personal protective equipment and testing than his offer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus\">shiny green </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus\"> \u201cCARE</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus\">\u201d badges</a>. And Sunak and Hancock are two of the more able cabinet ministers. After many complaints that the government was treating the coronavirus as man\u2019s work, the home secretary, Priti Patel, was sent out last Saturday to face the media. An experiment unlikely to be repeated. First Patel managed to imply that NHS workers were deliberately wasting PPE and then insisted that the government had so far carried out <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/priti-patel-300-034-974-000-tests-carried-out-2149924/\">300,034 974,000 tests</a>.

In the absence of Boris they don\u2019t even dare to suggest what criteria might govern their thinking in any relaxation of the lockdown, which gives each briefing a sense of deja vu. One of the most annoying parts of every ministerial statement is the constant reiteration of the mantra that \u201cthe government\u2019s actions have at all times been driven by the science\u201d. Mostly because that merely serves to underline just how little the government actually understands the nature of science. The whole point of science \u2013 especially in regard to a disease as new as the coronavirus \u2013 is that there is no overall consensus. Disagreement and pressure-testing each other\u2019s arguments are precisely what makes scientists and other academics tick. So there is no uniformity and the government is having to make judgment calls on which scientists are the most trustworthy. Donald Trump is clearly doing that, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/g7-backing-for-who-leaves-trump-isolated-at-virtual-summit\">rubbished the World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/g7-backing-for-who-leaves-trump-isolated-at-virtual-summit\">zation</a> for having less of a grip on the science than a couple of his close mates. And yes, the UK government has been too craven to call the Donald out on this. Nor does the UK\u2019s insistence on scientific evidence quite explain why the government did a complete U-turn nearly four weeks ago. On the Friday, it had been fine for 80,000 people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/10/cheltenham-festival-key-event-in-racing-calendar-goes-ahead-despite-coronavirus\">to go to the Cheltenham races</a>; by the following Monday the country was being put in near total lockdown. I don\u2019t remember anyone saying the science had changed over the weekend.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>My concentration levels are still hopeless. I have done slightly better this week, having now made it to page 10 of Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Mirror and the Light and I can report the extra six pages are every bit as good as the first four that I had already read several times. It\u2019s immensely frustrating as there\u2019s nothing more I would like than to be immersed in someone else\u2019s world, but my mind won\u2019t allow me to settle. I\u2019m reluctant to temporarily give up as I hate the idea of abandoning a book I have waited the best part of eight years to read, but I fear this is the way I\u2019m heading. After all, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m not spoiled for choice as I have Hadley Freeman\u2019s House of Glass, Adam Macqueen\u2019s Beneath the Streets and Svenja O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Inge\u2019s War piled up beside my bed. I did also have Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet but my wife has already pinched that and has advised me not to read it at present. It\u2019s set against the background of plague and she is worried about the effect it might have on my mental health. I\u2019ve also been struggling to dip in and out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/wisden-2020-offers-plenty-scope-cricket-loving-self-isolators-ben-stokes\">this year\u2019s Wisden</a> because, although the pieces are an ideal length, the print is just too small. My eyesight is fighting a losing battle with the almanack and I fear that next year I may have to order the large print edition. In the meantime, I have come up with a reasonable compromise by downloading it as an audible book. It calls itself the Shorter Wisden \u2013 mainly because it doesn\u2019t give you the scores of every game \u2013 but still comes in at over 20 hours. And at \u00a310, I reckon 50p an hour is a bargain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Apparently it\u2019s Friday, though it\u2019s hard to be too certain as the days all tend to merge into one another with little to differentiate them. Same feelings, same activities, much the same TV. Weirdly it\u2019s the weekends I now find trickiest as they have even less structure than the weekdays. I have to struggle more to find a sense of purpose and retain my fragments of identity. But when this lockdown started I made a commitment to try to end every week on a positive note, so here are my notes of love among the ruins. I would rather I didn\u2019t have to look at myself during online calls \u2013 do I really look that bad? \u2013 but FaceTime and Zoom chats both with family and friends have proved to be a lifeline. Although they are reminders of the closeness that has been lost, they do give me a sense of connection. And I\u2019ve been genuinely touched by the number of readers who have emailed in to check up on me, to share their own thoughts and send me photos; I\u2019m also happy to report that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/weirdos-misfits-and-why-i-had-to-check-my-dogs-horoscope\">Herbert Hound</a> has now adjusted to the new normal. Initially he was rather put out to find that Jill and I were around 24/7 and he would self-isolate in our daughter\u2019s bedroom. But now he seems to need less \u201cme time\u201d and has come back to sleep in our room. I have finally finished cataloguing my book collection and am about to start on the ceramics: a far trickier enterprise as it involves including pictures and my tech skills are rudimentary at best. I will report back. Incidentally, I have taken to talking to my pots ... I fear I may be turning into Prince Charles. Also huge kudos to the Spurs\u2019 players and the supporters trust who persuaded the club to reverse its decision to furlough and lay off non-playing staff. It made me feel proud to be a fan again. And finally, do watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/harry-birrell-presents-films-of-love-and-war-review-second-world-war-documentary\">Harry Birrell Presents Films of Love and War</a> on iPlayer. It\u2019s an astonishingly moving and intimate collection of homemade movies collected into a feature length film. I cried. But then I tend to do that a lot these days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"781f8fb6c93c14f8d2b9999b293598d4bd928e03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/781f8fb6c93c14f8d2b9999b293598d4bd928e03/0_119_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phone box food drop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Do you have an online delivery service?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Same as it ever was</p>",

But that was overturned by the state\u2019s supreme court, meaning voters would gather in large groups to vote against the warnings of health experts. However, Democrats came out of the election with a victory in the state\u2019s supreme court election where the liberal candidate beat a conservative incumbent endorsed by Trump.</p>",

Only once these issues have been addressed should we consider performing elective surgery that cannot be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAn additional measure that will ensure the safety of healthcare workers and patients would see a defined perioperative quarantine period of 14 days prior to surgery. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public have made a concerted effort to socially isolate and reduce transmission of Covid-19 in our community and in our healthcare system.

  "<p>The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies \u2013 near-empty airplanes flying through the air.</p> <p>Widespread travel restrictions around the world have slashed demand for air travel, with more than eight in 10 flights canceled. But there is a disparity in the US \u2013 while the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported a 96% slump in passenger volume, to a level not seen since 1954, this hasn\u2019t been matched by the number of flights being scrapped.</p> <p>Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rutherdan/status/1248625740003696641?s=20\">according to an estimate</a> by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.\u201d</p> <p>This situation is leading to a \u201chuge environmental waste\u201d, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.</p> <p>In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/solo-passenger-coronavirus-trnd/index.html\">video</a> of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston.

The reduction in flights is expected to reduce pollution levels, with emissions from the sector dropping by almost a third last month, the Financial Times has reported.</p> <p>However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>\u201cYou have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,\u201d said Rutherford. \u201cI imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency \u2013 what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.\u201d</p> <p>The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.</p> <p>The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.</p> <p>According to Airlines for America, an industry group, more than a third of the US fleet, about 2,400 aircraft, have been parked, with airlines burning through cash at more than $10bn a month as cancellations \u201cfar outpace\u201d new bookings. Planes have gone from \u201cload factors\u201d of 80% in January to just 11% in April.</p> <p>\u201cThe novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,\u201d a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.</p> <p>Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: \u201cThose that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.\u201d </p> <p>A spokesman for United said it was \u201cstill somewhat rare\u201d for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.</p> <p>The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airlines-lobby-to-rewrite-carbon-deal-due-to-coronavirus?\">Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement</a> designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.</p> <p>Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to \u201cdodge their obligations\u201d, but the industry said it was \u201ca matter of survival\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2020 to replace the main image with one that was more relevant to the focus of the article.</p>",

The property owner of her building last week repeatedly called police to try to remove her and her six children after she couldn\u2019t immediately pay full rent due. \u201cI told the police, \u2018You guys are wearing masks and gloves, but you want to throw us out to the streets when the virus is out there?\u2019 How are we supposed to \u2018stay at home\u2019 when they kick us out?\u201d</p> <p>As California prepared to implement a shelter-in-place order to stop the spread of the virus, government leaders acknowledged that rent would be an urgent and vast problem. In March, the governor ordered a two-month statewide delay on imposing evictions for people who cannot pay rent due to Covid-19. The order prevents the enforcement of evictions until the end of May, but requires tenants to repay the full amount later. Some cities, like <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/27/oakland-passes-2-month-freeze-on-evictions-for-renters-and-small-business-owners\">Oakland</a> and LA, have adopted stronger protections.</p> <p>But the accounts and records from tenants across the state indicate those regulations ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/california-rent-strike-coronavirus-eviction\">fail to provide relief</a> for those who are most in need, and are not being properly enforced. In some cases, the confusing patchwork of local ordinances has allowed landlords to continue targeting tenants in a state that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/06/silicon-valley-california-housing-crisis\">had a severe housing crisis</a> before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/california-lockdown-shelter-in-place-traffic-schools-jobs\">coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>Roughly <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/gov-newsom-coronavirus-briefing-april-15/32159606\">2.7 million people</a> have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/california-coronavirus-unemployment-newsom\">filed unemployment claims</a> in California since residents were ordered to stay home. Across the US, an estimated one-third of renters <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nearly-a-third-of-u-s-renters-didnt-pay-april-rent-11586340000\">didn\u2019t pay</a> April rent.</p> <p>Though the courts <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/04/07/state-courts-shut-door-on-evictions-some.html\">are</a><a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/04/07/state-courts-shut-door-on-evictions-some.html\"> not currently processing evictions</a>, some landlords are still starting the process, or unlawfully attempting to remove tenants. It\u2019s difficult to know how many tenants across the state are threatened with eviction, but advocates in LA, the Bay Area, and parts of the Central Valley say they have anecdotally heard of a handful of cases in which owners have launched evictions. They are hearing more frequently about tenants facing misinformation and misleading <a href=\"https://www.antievictionmap.com/blog/landlord-responses-to-covid\">threats from landlords</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Tenants facing eviction: </strong>\u2018<strong>I will be homeless and pregnant\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Krystal McMorris, 29, is pregnant and currently fighting to keep her apartment in Alameda, an island across the bay from San Francisco: \u201cI don\u2019t have any options. I have to stay here. I have to fight. If not, I will be homeless and pregnant. I already fear this stress is going to cause me to lose my baby.\u201d</p> <p>McMorris worked for six years for FPI Management, a real estate corporation, as an on-site property manager, a job which included her apartment. After the pandemic was declared last month, FPI terminated her position and told her she had 30 days to move out, despite the eviction moratorium and regional shelter-in-place orders. When McMorris asked the company to allow her to stay until the Covid-19 emergency had passed, telling her boss she was pregnant, the company responded that she \u201cdoes not have rights\u201d and that it could have forced her out in three days, but instead gave her until 17 April.</p> <p>\u201cIf she fails to vacate by that deadline, we will take immediate legal action to regain possession of the unit as soon as legally possible,\u201d Brandi Hutchinson, FPI senior director, wrote to McMorris\u2019s attorney, adding that she would now owe $3,030 a month.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no housing, no employment.

Everyday I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s been dreadful, scary, stressful, frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>McMorris, who lost her health insurance and has been unable to go to the doctor, said she wants to leave her apartment, but has nowhere to go. \u201cPeople are dying left and right. I was just asking that they at least give me more time.\u201d</p> <p>FPI\u2019s chief operating officer, Dave Divine, did not respond to specific questions about how the company plans to \u201cregain possession\u201d of her apartment, but said in an email that \u201cFPI is compassionate to Ms McMorris\u2019 situation\u201d and has not forced her to pay rent . \u201cFPI\u2019s actions have been and shall remain consistent with all applicable laws.\u201d</p> <p>G\u00f3mez, the mother of six, has lived with her family for three years in the Courtyard Motel in Downey, an LA suburb. Although it\u2019s a motel, she and other tenants live there full-time and, according to attorneys, are protected under anti-eviction laws, including the new Covid-19 regulations. But after the father of her children lost most of his income at a restaurant due to Covid-19, the family ran out of money to pay rent. She said she pleaded with the motel manager, saying she would pay everything she had as soon as possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c57d3f9ea45e0fb57c23cd91c6e49d9b5b0081a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c57d3f9ea45e0fb57c23cd91c6e49d9b5b0081a/0_36_2320_2899/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sonia Aguilar, 43, has faced threats from her Los Angeles landlord during the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonia Aguilar, 43, has faced threats from her Los Angeles landlord during the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Sonia Aguilar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Managers responded by calling the Downey police department to remove her, and officers showed up to her door, telling her she had to leave. Because she happened to be on the phone at the time with Monica Arellano, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of LA, the lawyer was able to talk to the officers and explain the law. Police eventually left, but the motel called the department again multiple times that day, requiring her to repeatedly explain her rights to new officers.</p> <p>She still paid the minimal cash they could, $370, after getting a check, leaving her with little money for other basic necessities. She said the managers continue to threaten her. \u201cAnytime I leave my room, I fear they are going to call the cops on my kids, and I\u2019ll come back and they\u2019ll be kicked out,\u201d said G\u00f3mez, who has lupus, a long-term autoimmune disease that puts her at higher risk of Covid-19 complications. \u201cI keep telling them whatever money we have we\u2019ll give it to them.\u201d</p> <p>The Downey police department did not respond to inquiries. Reached by phone, Rushabh Bhakta, a representative with the motel, said his staff made a payment arrangement with G\u00f3mez after calling police.</p> <p>Sonia Aguilar, 43, who is recovering from breast cancer, has faced threats from her LA landlord, who has said he wants her family out by the end of April. Earlier in the year, Aguilar, her husband and three children had planned to move, but once the pandemic hit, it became impossible and dangerous for her: \u201cI have underlying health issues and I only go out for food and medicine. I\u2019m not in any condition to rent a U-Haul. It\u2019s scary.\u201d</p> <p>But the landlord, Ezequiel Navar, won\u2019t stop calling them, she said: \u201cThe stress is making me more ill.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Renters fight back: \u2018You picked the wrong tenant\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Some tenants are fighting hard to assert their rights in the face of eviction threats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd46e347e8fe3b0fc03a73c50b3066758516b3ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd46e347e8fe3b0fc03a73c50b3066758516b3ab/0_111_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Johnson, a 28-year-old LA resident, was furloughed from her job.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Johnson, a 28-year-old LA resident, was furloughed from her job.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Levin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t an obligation to pay, and that it was better to keep that money for food and emergencies,\u201d said Michelle Johnson, a 28-year-old LA resident recently furloughed from her job at a coffee company. After she told her property manager she couldn\u2019t pay, the manager said she was required to submit three pay stubs, proof of unemployment and two bank statements, and then sign a payment plan. None of this is required by law. The manager then taped an eviction notice on her door, a \u201cthree-day notice\u201d to pay or leave, the first step of an eviction lawsuit.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not only an intimidation tactic for me, but it was also for other tenants to see,\u201d said Johnson, whose apartment is near the front door of the building. \u201cUnfortunately for y\u2019all, you picked the wrong informed tenant. I know this is illegal.\u201d</p> <p>It was still emotional for Johnson, who experienced homelessness as a child. But she responded with an email reminding the manager of her rights, and then filed a complaint with the city. \u201cThe city isn\u2019t doing enough to make sure landlords are doing their job.\u201d (LA\u2019s housing department did not respond to a request for comment.)</p> <p>Shirin Bina, 36, said she \u201ccompletely fell apart\u201d and cried for days after receiving a similar three-day eviction notice on her door in Oakland. \u201cIt just seemed like she had absolutely no regard for me as a human being,\u201d Bina said of her landlord, Debra Reese. \u201cShe broke the \u2018shelter in place\u2019 to put that on my door.\u201d</p> <p>Bina told Reese she couldn\u2019t pay after losing a job as a bookkeeper and other work. She reminded her landlord of Oakland\u2019s ordinance. Reese responded: \u201cYou failed to provide documentation and you failed to pay your rent; therefore this method will be utilized.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"889865ee13ad8b3920f8b589f1c92a6ca9a4f917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/889865ee13ad8b3920f8b589f1c92a6ca9a4f917/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shirin Bina, of Oakland, had to remind her landlord of the city\u2019s anti-eviction ordinance after receiving a notice on her door.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shirin Bina, of Oakland, had to remind her landlord of the city\u2019s anti-eviction ordinance after receiving a notice on her door.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bina said she has struggled at times to understand her rights, adding, \u201cIf there\u2019s such severe repercussions for a tenant not paying rent, there should be severe repercussions for a landlord abusing the law at this point.\u201d</p> <p>Reese did not respond to inquiries.</p> <p>Chris Tyler\u2019s landlord in LA asked that he sign an agreement saying he would immediately report his \u201cstimulus payments, unemployment benefits, payments related to paid family leave, disability insurance payments and Covid-19 related loans\u201d so the owner can \u2018\u201caccelerate amounts due\u201d. Tyler, who works with the LA Tenants Union and lost his job at a bar, said he knew not to agree to the contract, but worries about others: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a precarious situation, and you don\u2019t know your rights, you obviously feel compelled to sign.\u201d</p> <p>The LA Tenants Union has urged people to withhold rent and has called for lawmakers to freeze rent and mortgage payments during the crisis. If the state passed a rent forgiveness law, it would ensure tenants avoid insurmountable debts.<strong> </strong>In the meantime, advocates said, cities should proactively enforce the protections in place and hold landlords accountable when they violate renters\u2019 rights.</p> <p>The tenants union is also assisting 70-year-old Pamela Fairbanks. She paid her rent, but her landlord, Steve Kaali, showed up at her door this week with an eviction notice, alleging she had too many cats. Fairbanks, who has lived in her apartment for 25 years, said she has long owned three cats. She said she has also been in quarantine for weeks while recovering from bacterial pneumonia: \u201cI panicked. I was shaking. I could barely breathe through the tears.\u201d </p> <p>Reached by phone, Kaali said the cats were an ongoing issue because they go in and out of the apartment, and his eviction notice was meant to be a \u201cscare tactic\u201d to get her to install a window screen: \u201cI\u2019m not taking her to court knowing I\u2019m not going to win.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"522199100b49a32e4cca78a29b676cc3d0679c9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522199100b49a32e4cca78a29b676cc3d0679c9c/0_683_2730_3413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Ca\u00f1ez lost his job during the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Ca\u00f1ez lost his job during the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Jonathan Ca\u00f1ez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added that he hadn\u2019t tried to remove her from her rent-controlled apartment and bring in a higher-paying tenant: \u201cI could\u2019ve been a slumlord scumbag who kicks everyone out.

When they told their landlord they couldn\u2019t pay rent, the manager told them they would owe the full amount and should move out if they can\u2019t afford it.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided it\u2019s better to just cut our losses,\u201d said Ca\u00f1ez, 25, who is moving in with his brother. They didn\u2019t know how they would ever be able to pay back the rent: \u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard to have this place to call my own, a safe space. To have that shift away from me has been very hard and humiliating.\u201d</p> <p>Moore, 26, is going to sleep on an air mattress at a friend\u2019s house for now. She\u2019s been applying to jobs at grocery stores, but is also afraid of working there due to her asthma and the reality that essential workers are dying on the job. \u201cI\u2019m emotional because I was just getting my life together.

He quickly accrued nearly 2 million followers.</p> <p>Depp encouraged people to be creative during the crisis: \u201cWe cannot and must not succumb to shutting down and giving in to what feels like hellish quarantine monotony. Create something today that will benefit yourselves and others tomorrow. Do anything you think could be of use to brighten someone\u2019s day.

  "<p>During two weeks of social isolation, I discovered the best antidote to coronavirus anxiety I\u2019ve found so far: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/12/how-jonathan-creek-went-from-geek-in-a-duffel-coat-to-boring-besuited-businessman\">Jonathan Creek</a>.</p> <p>For those unfamiliar with the 1990s murder mystery show, Jonathan Creek follows the adventures of the eponymous magician\u2019s consultant (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/26/alan-davies-my-family-values\">Alan Davies</a>), who \u2013 for the first few series at least \u2013 gets dragged into solving crime by his writer friend, Maddy Magellan (Caroline Quentin). Each episode starts with a baffling mystery that defies any rational explanation. The pair investigate, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/16/tales-mystery-imagination-edgar-allan-poe\">Creek, with a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/16/tales-mystery-imagination-edgar-allan-poe\"> talent for rational thought</a> worthy of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s amateur sleuth Auguste Dupin, is unfailingly able to make sense of the crime. The trick is revealed.</p> <p>Today, with uncertainty sprawling off into the horizon, there is something deeply comforting about a universe in which everything can be explained after an hour. A detective who uses unwavering rationality to crack the most bewildering of mysteries is a reassuring presence. No shit, Sherlock. But there are other things about Creek that make it particularly enjoyable right now.</p> <p>Compared with the mounting crises of the past decade, Creek\u2019s late 90s world seems like a shimmering paradise. Post-Berlin Wall but pre-9/11. A time when, to borrow from the poet Frank O\u2019Hara, the day came fat with an apple in its mouth. There\u2019s something deeply enjoyable about seeing the denim jackets, brutal haircuts, the slang, the landline etiquette, Blur playing in the background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dae296f731ff8dcbe9130f30d67c5531de43c34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dae296f731ff8dcbe9130f30d67c5531de43c34/0_0_1480_2215/668.jpg\" alt=\"Davies and Quentin\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling baffled? Davies and Quentin in Jonathan Creek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there is Maddy. The character, who was <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a554580/jonathan-creek-star-on-sheridan-smith-exit-we-dont-mention-joey/\">written </a><a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a554580/jonathan-creek-star-on-sheridan-smith-exit-we-dont-mention-joey/\">for Caroline Quentin</a>, is one of the best things about the show, drawing from 90s \u201cladette\u201d culture (of which Quentin was more than familiar with from Men Behaving Badly) but without lazy cliches. Her boundless confidence, rogue investigative methods, and dismissal of \u201cmacho protectiveness\u201d, make her the driving force of the drama and a counterweight to Creek\u2019s lateral thinking abilities. In The Curious Tale of Mr Spearfish, Jonathan debunks a theory Maddie comes up with in a way that could come dangerously close to mansplaining. But he is undermined by her having duped him into doing her laundry, and is in the middle of trying to iron her bra even as he talks.</p> <p>Of course, there are some elements that have dated poorly. Subplots around minor female characters can be a little horrifying; there are some cringe-worthy moments of orientalism. But Maddy\u2019s vibe is still liberating to behold, more than 20 years later: she is commanding, resourceful, sexy without being oversexualised, attractive for her authenticity, and bold \u2013 all on her own terms. It is interesting to see how this expression of late 90s feminism (which often gets a bad rap) matches with today\u2019s ideas. But also, while everyone around you is constantly anxious, it\u2019s relaxing to spend time with such a fantastically self-assured character.</p> <p>Stuck inside for days on end, I found myself getting lost in the places Jonathan and his companions visit. The old manors. The ghostly castles. The moody coastal walk. The weather plays a key role in creating atmosphere, switching between gothic-style thunderstorms and sunlit old English towns. And this isn\u2019t the only source of storybook cosiness; there is also a healthy emphasis on food, chats in cosy pubs, late-night coffee. The show\u2019s homeliness is a reminder of happier, more sociable times.</p> <p>But probably the most comforting thing of all is that it\u2019s a show about friendship. Under lockdown, we can be both very near and very far from those we love. In Jonathan Creek, the exasperating overfamiliarity between the partners is where the relatable human drama comes from. On the surface, there\u2019s a Sherlock-Watson style set-up. But unlike the showboating Holmes, Creek is an introverted soul who would rather not be there. Particularly in the first season, the only reason he even gets to the crime scenes is because Maddy keeps tricking him into thinking they are going on some kind of date.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/nov/27/tvandradio.television\">creator, David Renwick</a>, leans heavily on familiar detective tropes \u2013 all the better to subvert them. In doing so, he creates a driving concept for the action, but with plenty of scope for characters sending each other up, stepping on each other\u2019s toes, getting on each other\u2019s nerves. All too familiar for those of us working from home.</p> <p>No one knows how long this crisis will last. If you are not in a frontline job and feel as if you are living in your own locked-room mystery and are thus looking for some relief, Creek can help restore some joie de vivre. It will take you through an absorbing 90s reverie of castles, companionship, and conviction \u2013 things we all need more of at the moment.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Creek is available on most major streaming platforms</p></li> </ul>",

Donald Trump has backed hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic form of the old anti-malaria drug chloroquine.</p> \n<p>Used together with azithromycin, an antibiotic, it could be \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241367239900778501\">tweeted</a>. The French doctor Didier Raoult has claimed the combination is a cure, leading to public clamour for the drugs in France. President Macron visited Raoult\u2019s hospital in Marseille last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/macron-urges-on-trials-of-controversial-coronavirus-drug\">giving him tentative support but suggesting that trials were needed.</a> </p> \n<p>Both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being tested separately as part of the Recovery trial, and if there is any effect in patients given those drugs alone, compared with those given no drugs, they can be combined later.</p> \n<p>For now, said Horby, the data flying around in emails from enthusiasts and posted on social media about patients who have recovered after taking hydroxychloroquine proves nothing. He says there is no real evidence to support its use yet.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would say no,\u201d said Horby. \u201cThere is in-vitro evidence that it is inhibitory against the virus [in the lab]. But I haven\u2019t seen any sound clinical data.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a large number of publications. It\u2019s hard to keep up with them. Most of them are very disappointing. There was a paper that said it was a breakthrough \u2013 chloroquine works. But there was zero data in it. It seems to follow in that vein. They show a certain percentage of patients recovering, which would happen anyway.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The hype and pressure cause problems for serious researchers. \u201cThere is pushback from clinicians saying we should just use this because it clearly works and shouldn\u2019t use that because it clearly doesn\u2019t work. They are both wrong because neither of them know.\u201d</p> \n<p>The number of patients being enrolled on the Recovery trial across the UK tells a story of doctors who have faith in scientific evidence over hope alone. Ten per cent of Covid-19 patients in the UK are now taking part in the trial, and the researchers say the more people join, the sooner they will have answers.</p> \n<p>Also in the trial now are a combination of two antiretroviral drugs used in HIV treatment, lopinavir-ritonavir, known by the brand name Kaletra, and low-dose dexamethasone, a type of steroid used in a range of conditions, typically to reduce inflammation.</p> \n<p>The next one to be included, said Horby, is an interleukin 6 antagonist, one of the immunomodulator drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis and to treat cytokine storm \u2013 something that happens when the immune system goes into overdrive, as can happen in Covid-19. They are looking at tocilizumab.</p> \n<p>They are also in discussions about introducing convalescent plasma \u2013 blood from people who have recovered that contains antibodies against the virus. They want to trial remdesivir, but have not been able to obtain the stocks they need, because it is being tested in China and the US and because doctors are already prescribing it on compassionate use grounds.</p> \n<p>Repurposed drugs are first because they already have a proven safety record. But as experimental drugs come along, Recovery will include those. Patients are randomly allocated one of the drugs (or a placebo). There are already 500 to 900 patients on each of the drugs being tested and 2,000 in the control groups.</p> \n<p>The UK trial was set up with unprecedented speed. The team went to see the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, to gain his support and enrolled the first patient nine days later. The NHS and National Institute for Health Research are on board. They recruited 1,000 patients within the first two weeks.</p> \n<p>Martin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, who co-leads the trial with Horby, says it\u2019s extraordinary and may change the landscape once the pandemic is over.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the things it tells you is what can happen when everybody is incentivised to make stuff happen as opposed to dither, delay or feelings that they will get into trouble if they say no,\u201d said Prof Landray, who has worked for 20 years on cardiovascular drug trials coordinated from Oxford. After this, he thinks, it will be hard to return to the snail\u2019s pace that has been the norm for setting up clinical trials in the UK, which can sometimes take years.</p> \n<p>The second extraordinary thing is that the clinical care of the patients and the scientific rigour involved in trialling the drugs are hand in hand in a way that doesn\u2019t normally happen, where the research might be going on in one corner of the hospital. \u201cFrontline clinicians don\u2019t know which treatments are best for patients apart from supportive care or ventilation,\u201d he said. That gives them massive motivation to get involved in the trial, which is central to the care of the patient.</p> \n<p>Horby says it\u2019s unlikely they will come up with a quick cure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got anything like a magic bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to temper people\u2019s expectations about these drugs. It\u2019s possible some might have an effect, but it\u2019s likely to be modest. I think what we\u2019ll be looking at in terms of making a significant impact will be moving on to combinations once we know of things that work. If we combine antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs, they might have a bigger impact.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: how have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He holds out more hope for monoclonal antibodies, which worked in Ebola. \u201cIf you are saying this is an acute, serious viral infection, that\u2019s really difficult to treat, you can counter that with \u2026 well, look at Ebola.

The tragic death of a heavily pregnant nurse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/pregnant-healthcare-workers-pressured-into-covid-19-frontline\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong</a>, is a chilling reminder of the anxieties facing many expectant key workers, although we still cannot know whether she was infected at work or not.</p> <p>Parents can now ask to be furloughed on 80% of salary if they can\u2019t work due to caring responsibilities, an enormous relief to some. But if the recession deepens and companies start shedding staff to survive, could that become a trap? Asking to be furloughed is one thing if you assume that once this is over, everyone will simply get their jobs back, but another if it turns out to be a much bumpier recovery. What if asking now is held against you later on when redundancies have to be considered? Should you just stagger on, hiding the fact that you\u2019re having to get half your work done in the middle of the night, for fear of being judged the weak link?</p> <p>Parents worry at the best of times about competing with childfree colleagues who can put in as many hours as it takes, but strip away our childcare and we feel more exposed than ever. This epidemic has been a giant leap back to the dark days before organised childcare; families can muddle through for a bit, but in the longer term home-working with kids underfoot is the 21<sup>st</sup>-century equivalent of Victorian urchins playing under their mothers\u2019 looms in textile mills.</p> <p>Single parents, the vast majority of them women, are as ever at the sharp end of this, and lone parent charity <a href=\"https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/\">Gingerbread</a> warns that many feel increasingly \u201calone and overwhelmed\u201d. But dual career couples have their challenges too.</p> <p>There\u2019s no hard data, obviously, on which gender is doing the lion\u2019s share of home-schooling, toddler-entertaining, and fielding heated demands for retribution against whichever sibling started it. It\u2019s too early for research to confirm which parent the kids consider fair game for interrupting at all times, and which is most likely to be enjoying long stretches of concentration while everyone tiptoes silently around their Very Important Phone Call. But, jobs permitting, many families will probably fall into much the same groove inside lockdown as they do outside of it. Couples who usually split childcare and chores scrupulously fairly will still try and do so, but elsewhere, the gender that previously did <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronavirustheukeconomyandsocietyfasterindicators/16april2020\">60% more</a> of the unpaid work is probably picking up a fair bit more of the slack now.</p> <p>Whichever partner chose a job in normal times that seemed flexible around the family is more likely to be slumped over a laptop at 2am now, the classic price paid for stealing time with the kids in the afternoon.

Seven in 10 of those ending up in intensive care with Covid-19 are also male, something only partly explained by risk factors like more men smoking. On the economic side, the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds job losses so far have <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14791\">disproportionately hit women</a>, as well as young and low-paid people. That\u2019s no surprise given who tends to work in the pubs, restaurants and shops most directly hit by lockdown, and things may change as other industries start being affected by slumping consumer demand. But the lesson from the aftermath of the banking crash is that ministers were too slow to realise austerity was affecting women differently from men; there\u2019s no excuse for making the same mistake this time.</p> <p>Now that four in 10 companies still trading are seeking to reduce staffing levels and over a quarter are cutting hours, ministers should be auditing what\u2019s happening on the ground and using the pulpit of those daily press conferences to warn employers that discrimination law still applies in a crisis.</p> <p>There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s illegal to target women on maternity leave when making redundancies, and it\u2019s that too many bosses try it on at the best of times.

  "<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t work on North Atlantic right whales and be a pessimist,\u201d Clay George tells me. He\u2019s a senior wildlife biologist and right whale specialist at Georgia\u2019s department of natural resources, and one of the only people in the south formally trained to disentangle a whale from fishing gear.</p> <p>Right whales are known to spend most of their time near the surface of the water, feeding and socializing. This behavior leaves them vulnerable to boat strikes and entanglement in fishing lines, almost exclusively the cause of their deaths.</p> <p>There are so few North Atlantic right whales left in the world\u2019s oceans \u2013 estimates hover around 400 \u2013 that many are known entities to the scientists who devote their careers to saving them. They often identify them by the patterns of callosity on their heads, raised tissue colored white by an infestation of cyamids, commonly known as \u201cwhale lice\u201d.</p> <p>I want to know if George feels any optimism at the slight uptick in calving in 2020, as 10 were seen in calving grounds this winter. There were <em>zero</em> calves recorded in 2018, and according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, calving has been down 40% since 2010.</p> <p>\u201cPeople <em>always</em> focus on the calves,\u201d George says. \u201cBut what really matters is protecting the females of reproductive age. There are only 100 left, and at their current calving rates, they aren\u2019t replacing themselves, or the number of right whales killed each year by human activity.\u201d The females need to have an estimated 17-20 calves total each year to sustain the population.</p> <p>I mention Dragon, a 19-year-old female right whale spotted this year off the coast of Nantucket with a fishing buoy entangled in her mouth, dying. George pauses. \u201cI remember when she had her first calf,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not a quick death,\u201d George adds. \u201cThey suffer out there, entangled and not able to feed. It\u2019s long and painful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"272d4845a7371a91928a30236cbaf3aa3e0b8024\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/272d4845a7371a91928a30236cbaf3aa3e0b8024/0_0_5315_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Atlantic right whale callosities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Atlantic right whale callosities \u2013 which allow scientists to recognise individual whales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilles Martin/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>George has watched whales struggle to survive horrendous ship strike injuries. He\u2019s seen fishing rope embedded in the whales\u2019 faces, cutting through bones, entire lips pulled off.</p> <p>One of his favorite whales is Ruffian, whom he first spotted with chunks of blubber missing after an entanglement. \u201cWe assumed he was a goner,\u201d George says. \u201cBut he came back the next season, scarred.\u201d Ruffian returned to Georgia waters another time, snow crab rope trailing behind him.</p> <p>\u201cEighty per cent of right whales have scars,\u201d George tells me. \u201cAnd 60% have been entangled twice. People would be shocked.\u201d</p> <h2>An intelligent, gentle giant</h2> <p>Right whales were once hunted to near-extinction by whalers. They were known as the \u201cright\u201d and easy whale to hunt \u2013 docile, slow-swimming and huge \u2013 52 feet long and sometimes weighing in just under 70 tons.</p> <p>Often referred to as the \u201curban whale\u201d, North Atlantic right whales spend most of their year feeding close to the shorelines of New England and Atlantic Canada. Each winter pregnant females and other members of the species migrate 1,000 miles south to Georgia and Florida, the species\u2019 only known calving grounds. Their coastal distribution places them in close proximity to large population centers, and all the human activities that go with that, from commercial fishing and shipping, to pollution and military training. </p> <p>No one really knows how long North Atlantic right whales can live, because human activity has affected their life spans so drastically. Experts presume they can live until 65 or 70, though some species of whale, like the bowhead, can live to 200. What we <em>do</em> know is that human activity has endangered this species and drastically shortened their lifespan to 35-40.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"95db188ea7617ac32c0b272ac09ba161cba90e34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95db188ea7617ac32c0b272ac09ba161cba90e34/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 9-year-old male right whale lies dead on a beach on Miscou Island in New Brunswick after being towed onto the shore the night before on June 7, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nine-year-old male right whale lies dead on a beach on Miscou Island in New Brunswick after being towed on to the shore the night before on 7 June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Klima/Boston Globe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year\u2019s calving season of 10, while better than zero, is still not enough to sustain the species.

Make that a calving season of nine \u2013 less than half of what the right whales need to replenish themselves.</p> <p>Why is it so hard to save this intelligent, gentle giant \u2013 one so critical to the health of our planet? (Whale excrement fertilizes phytoplankton that produce a significant amount of oxygen on Earth.)</p> <p>\u201cA species that most people have never seen is harder to convince others to save,\u201d says Dr Erica Fuller, a veterinarian and a lawyer with Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cIf you saw one, you\u2019d be struck by how majestic they are.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Deadly entanglement</strong></h2> <p>The whales are at risk any time fishing rope is left unattended in their habitat. But ropes used on offshore gillnets, lobster pots, snow crab pots and other so-called \u201cfixed gear\u201d fisheries are particularly problematic. These synthetic ropes can be set for weeks or months at a time, and require thousands of pounds of force to break loose from.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of the frustration of the right whale work is the slowness at which agencies are taking action,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cPlus, the same federal agency charged with authorizing the commercial fisheries that entangle them is also in charge of protecting this critically endangered species. It\u2019s a terrible conflict of interest.\u201d</p> <p>The real tragedy, according to Fuller, happened when the whales traveled into the Gulf of St Lawrence looking for food and, simultaneously, the snow crab fishery exploded. This shift was the perfect storm for entanglement, responsible for several deaths in 2017.</p> <p>When I speak with Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, she is quick to point out that no fishermen <em>intend</em> to catch whales. \u201cThey aren\u2019t doing it on purpose,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know they face hardships, too.\u201d</p> <p>Asmutis-Silvia, who has been working on these issues for 30 years, remembers seeing her first entangled whale: \u201cYou could see visible infections, and the whale was in a great deal of pain. The skin had grown over the line. For me, that\u2019s when entanglement moved from a conceptual problem to a real one.\u201d</p> <p>There hasn\u2019t yet been a broad fix to entanglement. \u201cI think we\u2019re closer with so-called ropeless fishing gear,\u201d Asmutis-Silvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a costly transition, but it has tremendous potential. It\u2019s the most promising solution I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13614ccd2878b8e08274cc3a78db423540316035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13614ccd2878b8e08274cc3a78db423540316035/0_0_5100_3400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Atlantic Right Whales, off Grand Manan Island, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Atlantic right whales, off Grand Manan Island, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barrett &amp; MacKay/Getty Images/All Canada Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u2019s the boat collisions. More than half of the known right whale population migrated into Cape Cod Bay in the summer of 2019, following their food source of phytoplankton. As they journey there and further northward toward Canada, they cross shipping lanes, putting them at risk of death by blunt force trauma and propeller cuts.</p> <p>Research shows that slowing shipping speeds down from an average of 24 knots to 10 can help improve the odds for right whales, but several ships were fined by Transportation Canada for ignoring the warnings. The reduction in speed orders are lifted when no right whales are spotted, but detection mechanisms are faulty, and ship strikes have contributed to 30 deaths of right whales in the last three years.</p> <p>The right whale calf born to Derecha that was struck this calving season \u2013 its head sliced by the propeller of a vessel \u2013 is presumed dead.</p> <h2><strong>Noise pollution</strong></h2> <p>\u201cTrying to understand where the right whales are, and what their lives are like underwater, is difficult for humans,\u201d Dr Genevieve Davis says. She\u2019s an expert in passive acoustic monitoring, listening for whales as they pass through specific zones. Right whales are vocal \u2013 when socializing in \u201csurface active groups\u201d they scream, blow, gunshot, upcall, warble and downcall.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t think about noise pollution as a common threat, but it masks important communication cues,\u201d Davis says. \u201cA calf might not be able to find her mother. These whales need to navigate, find mates and locate food. There\u2019s a masking effect that changes communication abilities.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think about Massachusetts bays and New York harbors,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s like trying to talk on a phone in the city with sirens and traffic, versus talking on a phone in an empty field. That\u2019s what their world is like now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf2cc713fb634aa8c15248034e7b103f9cd4e0d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2cc713fb634aa8c15248034e7b103f9cd4e0d3/0_15_1230_1537/800.jpg\" alt=\"A right whale calf and its mother swimming in the Atlantic Ocean near Sapelo Island, Ga.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A right whale calf and its mother swim in the Atlantic Ocean near Sapelo Island, Georgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This human-caused \u201cacoustic smog\u201d travels far, and is now constant in our ocean. It includes vessels, alternative energy sources and seismic surveys, which Davis says are so loud they can cause chronic stress and physical pain, like being next to the speakers at a loud concert.</p> <p>Passive acoustic tracking is an important component of a suite of whale-tracking measures, including aerial surveys and reports from fishermen. Currently there is no reliable, compassionate way to track the right whales with GPS, which would theoretically help boat captains avoid ship strikes. Blubber and water make tagging difficult.</p> <p>\u201cNo tagging method is really long-term,\u201d Dr Davis says. \u201cThese whales are already endangered and many are in poor health \u2013 we don\u2019t want to cause more suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI look forward to the day when there aren\u2019t more people working to save right whales than the actual number of whales themselves,\u201d Asmutis-Silvia tells me. She recounts the time she spotted a right whale named Wart off the coast of Cape Cod, with a calf.</p> <p>\u201cThere she was,\u201d Asmutis-Silver says. \u201cA tiny little shoehorn face with no callosity. The crazy thing is that Wart had been entangled several years prior. We thought she was dead \u2013 but here she comes back, free of gear, and gives birth in Cape Cod. It was incredible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re so amazing \u2013 so resilient,\u201d she adds. \u201cThese whales have such an ability to recover if we would only give them the chance.\u201d</p> <p>Climate change is already acting as a cruel catalyst, warming the whales\u2019 habitat, causing currents to shift and altering the distribution of plankton the whales depend on.

  "<p>We\u2019ve seen it a bunch of times: a second-contract quarterback who due to their own averageness or organizational incompetence is dumped from one team then experiences a Renaissance with another.</p> <p>Our latest example: Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill was let go by the Dolphins after years of bang average interspersed with brief flashes of brilliance \u2013 most notably a season that was cut short by a knee injury when Tannehill looked like he had finally pieced it all together.</p> <p>The Dolphins bailed. Tannehill was shipped to Tennessee. He rode the bench for a little while then took the lead role when Marcus Mariota was benched for his own stretch of mundane play. Then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/ryan-tannehill-titans-ravens-nfl-playoffs-quarterback\">liftoff</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/brian-allen-coronavirus-los-angeles-rams\">LA Rams\u2019 Brian Allen becomes first NFL player to reveal positive Covid-19 test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tannehill exploded into, legitimately, one of the five best quarterbacks in the league. That sounds like hyperbole, but it\u2019s a fact. By the metrics, Tannehill finished fifth or better in each of the following categories: DVOA, completion percentage under pressure, completion percentage to targets in tight coverage, completion percentage from a clean pocket, completion percentage on third downs.</p> <p>You might be able to bluff one of the metrics, but not <em>five. </em>Most importantly, he ranked second in the league in big-time throws v turnover worthy throws, the single best measure we currently have of a quarterback as a \u201cpassing playmaker\u201d. He trailed only Russell Wilson and was comfortably ahead of Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.</p> <p>And the eye test was no different. Take the nameplate of his back and you would be conceived you were watching a perennial All-Pro: throws to all levels; consistently nailing the so-called bucket throw, dropping a pass over the top of a linebacker and in front of a rotating safety; throwing on the run; running; setting and resetting protections; taking command of the whole offense; making, big, BIG time throws on third downs, the one that decide a game or not.</p> <p>Tannehill was reborn. And while it\u2019s tempting to scoff at the Titans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/15/ryan-tannehill-tennessee-titans-tom-brady-free-agency-nfl\">putting out a massive contract</a> to keep him around for the foreseeable future, what else were they supposed to do? Move on after witnessing that?</p> <p>Tannehill will likely regress back to his mean: an above-average starter who needs a good deal of help around but who can move and create on third downs, create off-script, and has a cannon of an arm. But there\u2019s a chance, albeit a slight one, that something has clicked. That his second act is sustainable, if only for another season.</p> <p>So, who\u2019s next? Across the league young veterans have switched teams, looking for a chance, any chance to land that sweet gig; that moment in time when an offensive guru meets a gifted offensive line, a pair of decent receivers and a complimentary running back. When perhaps a starter goes down and it\u2019s your time.</p> <p>The two most fascinating possibilities: Marcus Mariota and Cam Newton.</p> <p>Newton, a former No 1 overall pick and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/06/cam-newton-named-nfl-mvp-and-offensive-player-of-the-year\">2015 MVP</a> is still searching for a team after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/cam-newton-trade-carolina-panthers-football-nfl-instagram\">release</a> from the Panthers.</p> <p>Ordinarily, that would be bonkers. Whether you think Newton is on the downside of career or not, he remains a starting-caliber quarterback in a league that\u2019s lacking them. But Newton\u2019s checkered injury record makes any potential signing an impossibility right now.</p> <p>Any team who would be willing to commit big money to the 30-year-old \u2013 and Newton will likely command big money, even if only on a one-year deal \u2013 will want to work Newton out to make sure he still has the same oomph in his legs and zip on his fastball, not to mention have their own medical experts take a look at his files. Until the current global pandemic subsides, that\u2019s going to be a near-impossibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6102662c1c2163765a164a467d906df3fb6de589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6102662c1c2163765a164a467d906df3fb6de589/0_0_4794_3195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Mariota\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Mariota warms up before last year\u2019s AFC championship game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Riedel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the peak of his powers, Newton was a singular force: A blend of size, speed and arm strength the quarterback position has never seen. He was a linebacker in the backfield, but one with just enough touch to shred defenses down the field. He helped take the Panthers to a Super Bowl in a funky offense that was built around his own quirks: his willingness to bang between the tackles and his penchant to mistime some of dropbacks, leading the team to take a whole bunch of timing routes out of the system. It worked! Newton was pretty much unstoppable. But he\u2019s regressed since then. Injuries have taken over and his accuracy, which has always fluctuated based on his footwork, has become wince-inducing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/13/christian-mccaffrey-contract-carolina-panthers-nfl-football\">McCaffrey signs $64m deal to become highest-paid running back in NFL history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But think how wild that above paragraph is. How odd it is to write about the past being the peak of Newton\u2019s powers. <em>Right now</em> should be his peak. He\u2019s 30, still blessed with all the physical gifts he\u2019s always possessed but also with all the experience and savvy of a veteran. This is when he should be staking his claim as one of the league\u2019s five most important players on a consistent basis, serving as the linchpin of perennial Super Bowl contender, not sitting out as a street free agent trying to prove he still has <em>it.</em></p> <p>The spot that makes the most sense for a Newton comeback is in Los Angeles with the Chargers. Right now, LA lists Tyrod Taylor as its starter, with head coach Anthony Lynn saying he\u2019s \u201ctheir guy\u201d. The only issue, we\u2019ve seen systems built around Taylor before in Buffalo (with Lynn) and Cleveland. Neither started or ended particularly well.</p> <p>Taylor is a fine backup, but he\u2019s a couple of ticks below Newton on the quarterback index. If the Chargers want to move away from the dropback passing system they ran with Philip Rivers and commit to the spread option, why do that with a smaller, leaner version or Newton rather than the real deal? Taylor might be a <em>little </em>bit more accurate as a passer. But it\u2019s a nominal difference, and he\u2019s also far less aggressive. Rolling with Taylor is an admission that a team is happy to be average-to-bad.</p> <p>Newton, at least, improves that risk profile to good-to-bad \u2013 that\u2019s a gamble worth taking. Add to that, with Rivers leaving the Charges could use a little bit of star power, particularly as they get set to move into a new stadium. There are few higher-wattage stars in the league than Newton.</p> <p>One other option: The Rams. Sean McVay\u2019s team is in cap hell and have been flogging assets. And you could make a decent argument, based on scheme-fit and accuracy without pressure, that you\u2019d rather have Jared Goff than Newton. But I\u2019d trust in McVay to adapt his system, and I\u2019d sooner take the quarterback who is the same when pressured and when not, rather than the guy who\u2019s accuracy and decision-making craters when there\u2019s pressure in his face.</p> <p>Would Newton be open to a one-year, cheap deal to work alongside McVay and make a potential Super Bowl run? The idea is fairly tantalizing.</p> <p>But Mariota to the Vegas Raiders remains the most likely breakout/rebirth spot.</p> <p>Mariota was lethal in college in an offense that weaponized his north-south speed and lightning-quick release. He was smart, played within himself, got the ball out on time, and was all about maximizing efficiency, both with his arm and legs. He\u2019s a timing player, not an oft-script creator. Planting him in a system that says <em>control the game on first and second down then win it for us on third down</em> was never his style; thrust into that position he crumbled.</p> <p>\u201cWe got to rebuild him a little bit to get his confidence back,\u201d Las Vegas general manager Mike Mayock said this week. By that, Mayock meant to restore him to his Oregon days. \u201cI mean, he went through \u2018Gruden\u2019s (QB) Camp\u2019 on television. I had him as the top quarterback in that draft. He knows that both of us believed in him coming out and still believe in him.\u201d</p> <p>In Jon Gruden, Mariota finds a coach who sees his skills as a virtue, not a shortcoming. Is he a game-breaker? No. Can he efficiently take a team down the field, play within structure, make sure the team gets from a bad play into a good one, follow instructions, make throws on time and in rhythm, and lead a team to eight or nine wins, giving them a playoff shot? Sure.</p> <p>Mariota will have to beat out Derek Carr, who is due for his own second act any year now. Carr has been solid if unspectacular since Gruden returned to the Raiders, happy to take on the coach\u2019s touchdown-or-checkdown mantra. But the fit remains iffy. Mariota\u2019s arrival, as well as a brief flirtation with Tom Brady, tells you all you need to know about how Mayock and Gruden view Carr\u2019s future with the team.</p> <p>We love a redemption arc, that\u2019s just human nature. Tannehill was last year\u2019s feel-good story. Newton and Mariota have a chance to take the crown whenever football returns..</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></h2> \n<p>It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p> \n<h2><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></h2> \n<p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p> \n<p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill.

  "<p>There are many things The Kindergarten Teacher, a 90-minute psychodrama now available to watch online, is not. It is not, for one, in any of the main pandemic-streaming categories \u2013 not a stress-processing action flick (Contagion), nor a nostalgic favorite. It\u2019s not one of Netflix\u2019s popular originals; the streamer seems to have botched the film\u2019s US promotion when it was released in October 2018, despite an absolute knockout performance from Maggie Gyllenhaal that inexplicably did not earn any award nominations. But The Kindergarten Teacher, directed by Sara Colangelo and based on the 2014 Israeli film of the same name, is worth a watch as an absorbing portrait of one individual\u2019s subtle but desperate slide into obsession, and as an affair story, though not the kind you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s also, to restate what\u2019s worth restating, a masterclass showcase for Maggie Gyllenhaal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/13/starcrash-david-hasselhoff-film-amazon-prime\">My streaming gem: why you should watch Starcrash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gyllenhaal plays Lisa Spinelli, a kindergarten teacher and married mother of two teenagers in Staten Island who, at the beginning of the film, seems secure but empty. For two decades, she\u2019s poured her energy into fostering creativity in her five-year-old students \u2013 a job, the film suggests, that has drained her faith in society to foster talent. And she\u2019s developed a deep faith in the cult of individual creative talent, which she desires but appears to lack; her poems at a continuing education class in Manhattan go unnoticed by her instructor, Simon (Gabriel Garc\u00eda Bernal). Everywhere, she sees spurned potential \u2013 when she catches her teenage daughter smoking weed, she rips her a new one not for the drugs, but for what she could be doing if she just had the <em>curiosity.</em></p> <p>One day after class, she catches one of her students, Jimmy, stringing together words seemingly unprompted, and her malaise coalesces into purpose. She writes his \u201cpoem\u201d down with the fervor of a Delphic oracle, a devotee of the boy\u2019s talent that she believes no one else understands. In a brisk yet emotionally packed hour, Lisa becomes obsessed with the boy. She believes she\u2019s discovered a young Mozart of poetry. Gyllenhaal is mesmerizing as years of pent-up and unspoken feelings warp good intentions into increasingly bad actions: she drags Jimmy into one-on-one time to hone a craft the child is too young to understand, passes off his poems as her own in class, and wheedles her way into being his after-school caretaker. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, kindergarten teachers are allowed to call their students,\u201d she tells Jimmy on the phone, even though of course it\u2019s not.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n1NP6w5lXs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8n1NP6w5lXs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a sharp ache, like pressing a bruise, in watching Lisa spiral from the familiar experience of fixation into dangerous obsession. Colangelo\u2019s style encourages this voyeurism; her camera lingers over characters\u2019 shoulders or in door frames like a practiced eavesdropper. With hardly any background music, she cedes the soundscape to the shuffling of schoolchildren or the smacking of Gyllenhaal\u2019s lips as she considers her words.</p> <p>Though the final third takes some far-fetched and excruciating turns that could have derailed the film if not for Gyllenhaal\u2019s grounded performance, Colangelo\u2019s natural style \u2013 unsteady camera orbiting Gyllenhaal\u2019s face \u2013 smartly keeps the focus on Lisa. Her fixation with Jimmy is, as most obsessions go, much more about Lisa\u2019s own dissatisfaction and insecurities as a \u201cshadow\u201d of a person than any talent Jimmy might have, which Colangelo leaves up to interpretation (is he writing his own poems or hearing them somewhere else? It ultimately doesn\u2019t matter).</p> <p>It\u2019s worth watching the film for Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance alone \u2013 in its best moments (at a poetry reading in Manhattan, when Jimmy reveals his primary inspiration, or bargaining with Jimmy\u2019s father), she\u2019s a live wire, a heady mix of yearning and increasingly untenable self-control. But I found viewing The Kindergarten Teacher during an international shutdown to be enlivening. Lisa is unethical, yes, selfish and absolutely delusional, but also readable \u2013 you\u2019re right there with her, understanding without condoning, as she crosses over the line. At a time when most of my human interactions come from FaceTime, to sit with one complicated, well-intentioned but deeply misguided person feels like the opposite of the \u201clow battery\u201d sound my brain makes when I check the news or doom-scroll Twitter. As the stories outside get bigger and bigger \u2013 too massive to comprehend, too overwhelming to engage with \u2013 sometimes, it feels right to let one understated yet commanding portrait draw you in.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Kindergarten Teacher is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Let us deal with the most immediate and valid concern when presented with a new series entitled Home (Apple+ TV) that promises an in-depth look at the different and architecturally interesting ways various people of vision have chosen to build and live in theirs. Namely: is it <a href=\"https://www.granddesigns.tv/\">Grand Designs</a> with knobs on?</p> <p>The answer, I am very happy to tell you, is no. Or at least, just a tiny, tiny bit, just occasionally. A forgivable amount, I would say, and my tolerance threshold is low. People do, every now and then, say things such as \u201cLife itself should colonise the space\u201d, but the saving grace of Home is that a) there is no Kevin McCloud and b) unlike most of the genre, it looks outward rather than in.</p> <p>Instead of simply marvelling at Sequoia and Theodolite\u2019s bravery in building a six-storey poured-concrete and wickerwork habitational constructivation on a sand dune, it uses each individual home as a jumping off point for an examination of wider movements, issues and possibilities. This has the happy further advantage of fitting in rather than jarring with current \u2013 surely unanticipated by the makers \u2013 lockdown conditions. We are all at home trying to look outwards.</p> <p>Anupama Kundoo\u2019s home \u2013 the Listening House in Auroville, India \u2013 for example, is built using materials from within a 20km radius of the building. It is constructed using traditional skills as a repudiation of the western style and techniques that dominated the country for centuries under British rule, and a restoration of local industry and the status of craftsmen who have kept 4,000-year-old pre-colonial arts alive down the generations. It\u2019s a house very much embedded in the natural world around it \u2013 walls are perforated to let in light and air, plants cover a sweeping verandah and the handmade brick construction makes the whole thing look as if it has grown straight out of the earth.</p> <p>In Sweden, Anders Solvarm has given the back-to-nature idea the twist needed in a more intemperate climate by building his house within a giant greenhouse, creating a self-sustaining patch of Mediterranean greenery in the middle of snowy Scandinavia. His human terrarium \u2013 or <em>naturhus</em> \u2013 is at the forefront of a movement that seeks to minimise our ecological impact at every turn. Our own greenhouses, complete with vegetable plots, self-contained greywater systems or minimal heating requirements to minimise the global greenhouse effect, are a satisfying solution to consider.</p> <p>Theaster Gates is the son of a roofer who grew up on the west side of Chicago and \u2013 as a bright boy \u2013 was transported to school on the north side and watched through the bus windows every day as the landscape changed and improved with every mile further from home he got. He grew up to be an artist with a degree in urban planning. He has spent decades acquiring and transforming abandoned buildings near his adult south side Chicago home into community gathering places, endeavours and museums of local and wider black experience, to make the place feel like home in a wider sense to a growing number of citizens.</p> <p>\u201cI built things with what I had,\u201d he says. And now he has, in effect, a town of his own, scattered across another, but connected by his aesthetic and his urge to revivify a neglected place and its people. \u201cWhen you walk past an abandoned building,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s hard not to feel heavy.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most purely fascinating on its own terms is architect Gary Chang\u2019s 344 sq ft apartment in Hong Kong. He calls it the Domestic Transformer and is using it as a laboratory in which, and with which, to solve his overcrowded city\u2019sproblem of housing provision. Simply put, Chang lives in one room that he can transform into any other at will. Walls slide and reconfigure the space \u2013 a bench becomes a desk becomes a kitchen counter becomes a dining table. A cupboard opens to become a kitchen; everything else slides away to let down a Murphy bed, or to let the apartment become a home cinema or the bathroom or a walk-in closet \u2026</p> <p>It\u2019s completely astonishing, like a real-life Tardis but with an entirely tranquil doctor at its heart, in absolute control of everything and quite possibly set to change the world more than any time lord ever dreamed.</p> <p>So many different conceptions of home \u2013 what it can be when uncoupled from convention, how wide it can go philosophically, how much it can contract when practicality requires \u2013 make this a series that asks even greater questions about what of those things we once imagined immutable we can choose to accept or reject. It\u2019s a grand design indeed.</p>",

  "<p>Here is a gnarly action-thriller from France with the kind of heavy artillery and paramilitary display that director Julien Leclercq loves.

Its owner is Sa\u00efd (Sami Bouajila) who lives there with his teen daughter Sarah (Sofia Lesaffre). Perhaps against his better judgement, he has given a job to Yanis (Samy Seghir), a troubled young guy on parole for a minor offence. But Yanis hides a huge stash of cocaine at the mill, that was recently stolen by his half-brother, and soon the implacably ruthless gang boss Adama (Eriq Ebouaney) shows up with his heavily armed crew, wanting his merchandise back.</p> <p>Now, just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chekhov\">Chekhov</a> said that a gun produced in act one has to be fired in act two \u2026 well, what must happen with a lethally sharp rotating sawmill blade produced in act one of an action thriller?

The characters are sketched in too quickly for us to make any real investment in them: the movie stands and falls by its action, and for me it doesn\u2019t have the firepower, despite the deafening gunplay.

  "<h2>Top story: Chinese economy shrinks 6.8%</h2> \n<p>Friday is here and I\u2019m Warren Murray, ready to lead you through what\u2019s on offer in terms of news.</p> \n<p>Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-economy-shrinks-record-wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-rises-50-percent\">revised the city\u2019s death toll upwards by 50%</a> from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported toll. Meanwhile in the last few hours the business world has begun absorbing the news that the Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020. The first such contraction on record for China comes after months of paralysis from the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s biggest companies handed out almost half a trillion pounds in dividends and share buybacks in the years before the coronavirus crisis, according to a report calling for tough conditions on any taxpayer-funded bailouts. Burgeoning dividend payouts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/400bn-paid-in-dividends-by-uk-companies-before-coronavirus-crisis\">left companies weak going into the Covid-19 crash</a>, as well as fuelling inequality, says the Common Wealth thinktank. It says the government needs to take an equity stake in firms receiving financial support, while job security guarantees should be made, and ministers could also impose bans on dividends and share buybacks, insist on maximum pay caps for top executives, and get assurances that companies will pay their taxes fairly.</p> \n<p>After attempting to lord it over state governors, Donald Trump has unveiled guidelines for reopening the economy that ultimately defer to them on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">when and how restrictions should be eased within their borders</a>. The first phase allows for work but only essential travel; the second would allow for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel; the third allows for schools and organised youth activities to open up as well as large venues under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d and bars on the basis of reduced occupancy. David Smith writes that the guidelines are supposedly science-based but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trumps-science-based-reopening-strategy-is-still-full-of-unanswered-questions\">fail to set out critical elements</a> like a national testing strategy \u2013 something that has proven vital in other countries.</p> \n<p>Dominic Raab has warned the British public that lockdown measures could last into June and any relaxation now would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms\">\u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d</a>. He set out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections but also pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to turn the tide of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said.

The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported death toll, as other countries have seen fatalities reach more than 10,000.</p> <h2><strong>China\u2019s GDP shrinks 6.8% in March quarter</strong></h2> <p>China has reported its first ever quarterly contraction at 6.8%, its slowest pace on record. China\u2019s economy has not recorded a contraction since 1992 when the country began publishing quarterly GDP data. In 2019, China already posted its slowest growth in almost 30 years. Human Rights Watch meanwhile warned of the \u201ctremendous danger\u201d of virus resurgence in China due to Beijing\u2019s censorship and suppression during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <h2><strong>Trump issues state guidelines for reopening US</strong></h2> <p>The US president has unveiled a roadmap to reopening the economy but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">ultimately deferred to governors</a> on when and how to return their states to normal. The \u201cGuidelines for Opening Up America Again\u201d involve three phases, each dependent on states meeting certain criteria. Trump said states that meet phase one criteria can reopen on Friday, and that 29 states will reopen \u201crelatively soon\u201d. The guidelines do not include a firm target date. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trumps-science-based-reopening-strategy-is-still-full-of-unanswered-questions\">Trump\u2019s strategy leaves many unanswered questions.</a></p> <h2><strong>Global coronavirus cases pass 2.1 million</strong></h2> <p>The total number of coronavirus cases across the world has reached at least 2,158,250, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>. The number of cases registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April. Deaths have passed 144,000.</p> <h2><strong>The IMF predicts zero growth in Latin America and Caribbean for decade to 2025</strong></h2> <p>The International Monetary Fund on Thursday said the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, combined with other problems in recent years, meant Latin America and the Caribbean would likely see \u201cno growth\u201d in the decade from 2015 to 2025. The projection comes after the organisation said economies in Asia will see zero growth this year for the first time in 60 years.</p> <h2><strong>Pandemic turning into a \u2018child-rights crisis\u2019, UN warns</strong></h2> <p>The social and economic impact is potentially catastrophic for millions of children, according to a UN report launched on Thursday. It said Covid-19 was turning into a broader child-rights crisis that could lead to hundreds of thousands additional child deaths in 2020, in effect reversing the past two to three years of progress</p> <h2>Myanmar to release 25,000 prisoners amid virus fears</h2> <p>More than a quarter of Myanmar\u2019s prison population is to be released, the president\u2019s office announced on Friday, as calls grow to ease pressure on overcrowded jails with coronavirus fears gripping the country.</p> <h2><strong>Third Japanese cabinet official tests positive</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s cabinet said on Friday an official had tested positive, making him the third case among officials at the cabinet office.

  "<p>Precisely when political leaders of certain countries grasped how much of a threat coronavirus really would be is a debatable issue. But for many members of the public, a precise date can be put on when the truth properly struck home: 13 March. That was when Tom Hanks <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9qBEyjJu4B/\">announced</a> on Instagram that he and his wife, the actor and singer Rita Wilson, a couple who are universally agreed to be Two of the Nicest Celebrities in the World, had tested positive for the virus in Australia, where Hanks had been shooting Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic. (Hanks, truly cast against type, is playing the notorious bully, Colonel Tom Parker.) On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/13/trevor-noah-tom-hanks-daily-show-recap-coronavirus\">said</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like coronavirus chose Tom Hanks just to send a message to the rest of us. Like prison rules: \u2018If I can get Hanks, I can get to anyone.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Plenty of famous people have since been diagnosed with coronavirus, from Idris Elba to Placido Domingo, yet only Hanks and Wilson made newspaper front pages. And whereas other celebrity diagnoses have prompted debate about why certain people have access to tests while the masses don\u2019t, the news about Hanks and Wilson, both 63, sparked only anxiety on their behalf. \u201cHow dare coronavirus hurt my father!\u201d was the general online reaction, reflecting Hanks\u2019s longstanding status as the United States\u2019 parental figure. Hanks and Wilson occupy a near unique sweet spot of seeming both normal and gobstoppingly famous, making their diagnoses seem all too relatable and totally bizarre.</p> <p>And their normality is not a pose, judging from the several times I have spotted them out and about in Los Angeles. Once, during Oscars week, I was hanging out in a Beverly Hills hotel where designers had taken over several suites to dress celebrities. Every other person who came in and out of the hotel was a stylist, their heels sky high, their Botox impeccable. Except one: Wilson arrived and left quietly, sporting what looked a lot like a tracksuit and an endearing lack of makeup, never mind Botox. \u201cPicking up one\u2019s own Oscars outfit\u201d might be a very relative kind of normality, but in Hollywood \u201cthe real world\u201d exists on a sliding scale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5941e9f8867c1b1be5f68e1930b5c9a18547ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5941e9f8867c1b1be5f68e1930b5c9a18547ef/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilson and Hanks at the Oscars in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson and Hanks at the Oscars in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thankfully for Hanks and Wilson, but also the morale of mankind, they are now fully recovered from coronavirus and back home in Los Angeles, where they are \u201cstaying inside and watching a lot of old movies,\u201d Wilson tells me on the phone. \u201cLike <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050105/\">An Affair to Remember</a>?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking. Wilson has been acting since she was 14, but her most famous scene is probably in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/sleepless-in-seattle-review\">Sleepless in Seattle</a>, where her character <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77JrXbqqV0\">gushes</a> about the Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr 1957 film. She has regained enough of her strength to just about suppress her weariness with the reference: \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good idea, for sure!\u201d she says with only the faintest hint of rolled eyes.</p> <p>Wilson and Hanks first developed symptoms on 9 March, and were tested the following day. Doctors told them that they were probably exposed to the virus by the same person at the same time, but no one else they know has tested positive and it\u2019s still a mystery as to how they caught it. Wilson, in particular, had tried to be hyper-vigilant: \u201cIt was early March, so people weren\u2019t social distancing yet. But I was already doing no handshakes, no hugging, trying to take my own measures. Then on the plane to Australia, I was like Lady Macbeth \u2013 I couldn\u2019t clean everything enough! The flight attendants were like: \u2018What is with this lady?\u2019 I had wipes, sanitiser, I wiped down <em>everything</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Their symptoms were severe enough for them to be hospitalised: \u201cWe both had a high fever and were extremely achey. I lost my sense of taste and smell, had stomach issues and shivering like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Yeah, I was scared,\u201d she says. To try to bring her fever down, doctors gave her chloroquine \u2013 \u201cnot hydroxychloroquine,\u201d she stresses, referring to the unproven treatment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">President Trump has been promoting</a>. Her temperature did come down, but the side-effects of the drug were \u201cincredibly harsh\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cExtreme nausea, vertigo, my muscles felt like wet noodles, so I couldn\u2019t really stand,\u201d she says. They were unaware of the international reaction to their announcement because they hardly watched TV and stayed almost entirely offline, except to be in contact with close friends and family. \u201cWe were just trying to get through it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Back in 2015, Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. At the time, she told her husband what she wanted him and their two sons, Chet and Truman, to do should she die: \u201cI said: \u2018I want you to be sad for a really long time,\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd then I said: \u2018I want you all to throw me a party.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Did she and Hanks have those conversations again?</p> <p>\u201cNo, but we did have a different conversation before we were diagnosed. Before I had cancer, I would hear about other people having cancer. I said to him before all this: \u2018Once you\u2019ve had cancer you understand you <em>are</em> other people. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t get coronavirus \u2013 we could get it.\u2019 And we got it.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson and Hanks have been married for 32 years and famously have one of the most solid relationships in Hollywood. But going through all this, so far from home, and on their own, would have tested any couple. How did they not lose their minds?</p> <p>\u201cI think that having the virus at the same time made it that little bit easier,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were taking care of each other instead of having the pressure of taking care of one person and no one taking care of you or understanding that the person at home needs a break. We were fortunate we were in a place where we understood what the other was going through.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76ced8444b96771d2d95e787bb2f13f16cfc03dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76ced8444b96771d2d95e787bb2f13f16cfc03dc/0_0_5632_3380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it\u2019s just me\u2019 \u2026 Wilson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it\u2019s just me\u2019 \u2026 Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Jordan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wilson was born and raised in Hollywood, the daughter of a Greek mother and Bulgarian father. She started acting as a teenager, appearing on The Brady Bunch and then other US TV shows throughout her 20s. In 1981, when she was 25, she appeared on <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/bosom-buddies-the-1980s-sitcom-that-faked-nyc-terribly\">Bosom Buddies</a>, a sitcom that barely lasted two seasons but launched the career of Hanks. He was married at the time, and has two children from that marriage, including the actor, Colin Hanks. But the two of them reconnected in 1985 when they were both cast in the film, Volunteers, and married in 1988. Since then, Wilson has made a name for herself as a successful producer (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mamma Mia!) and a reliable team player; it is always a pleasure to see her pop up in supporting roles in films such as Runaway Bride and Sleepless in Seattle, as well as classy TV shows including The Good Wife and Girls.</p> <p>Last year, she produced and appeared in the film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4310022/\">Boy Genius</a>, \u201cwhich probably people never saw,\u201d Wilson says, alas, accurately. But something from that film stuck in her mind during her recovery: in the movie, her character performs Naughty by Nature\u2019s legendary anthem, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz1Xn1vzOM4\">Hip Hop Hooray</a>. After a couple of days in hospital, she and Hanks were allowed to return to their hotel to recover, where they played card games, watched the ubiquitous Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Tiger King</a> (\u201cYeah, pretty crazy, ha ha!\u201d) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/29/ken-burns-tv-documentaries-america-baseball-vietnam-country-music\">Ken Burns\u2019s</a> documentary about country music. But Wilson still felt \u201ckind of foggy\u201d, so to get her brain back in shape, she decided to re-learn Hip Hop Hooray. She then <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-BqChYnY6F/\">videoed</a> herself performing it and posted it on Instagram from isolation in Australia, \u201cto let people back home know I was OK, and maybe they could get a smile out of it.\u201d </p> <p>The video took off and currently has 2m likes with adoring comments from Barack Obama (\u201cDrop the mic, Rita!\u201d) to Kim Kardashian (\u201cThe best video EVER!!!!!!\u201d). But the comment that thrilled Wilson the most came from Naughty by Nature themselves, who loved her version. Wilson and the group have now remixed the single and are releasing it to raise money for <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/musicares/get-help/musicares-coronavirus-relief-fund\">MusiCares Covid-19 Relief Fund</a>, to support members of the music community.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my fans inboxed me and was like: \u2018Hey Vin! Have you seen this?\u2019 And I was like: \u2018What the, oh my Gahhhd,\u2019\u201d says NbN\u2019s Vin Rock with, one suspects, some understatement.</p> <p>Vin Rock was, he says, \u201caware of [Wilson] from her movies, and definitely her husband, Tom Hanks\u201d. (His favourite Hanks movie, for the record, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/23/forrest-gump-film-makes-me-cry\">Forrest Gump</a>: \u201cThe way they put him in all those historic scenarios!\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cFor us to be able to take this song and this moment and turn it into something positive, I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So he didn\u2019t mind one of his best-known songs being appropriated by an older, very wealthy white woman?</p> <p>\u201cNot at all! Hip-hop has always been inclusive. Rita\u2019s son Chet is a big hip-hop fan and he gets a lot of kickback from the hip-hop community who want to call him a poseur or culture vulture. But it\u2019s the multicultural people who participated in hip-hop who have made it the phenomenon it is today,\u201d he says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7K1mlEBb4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rn7K1mlEBb4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Chet Hanks \u2013 or Chet Haze, to use his rap name \u2013 has indeed been accused of those things and worse.

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Tom <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/movies/tom-hanks-mister-rogers.html\">said</a> of his children from his first marriage: \u201cThey remember when their dad was just a guy trying to, you know, make the rent. My other kids, they were born after I had established a beachhead in every way. And so their lives were just different.\u201d</p> <p>But Chet became a bit of a star during his parents\u2019 illness. He posted endearingly sensible video updates on their condition (\u201cThey\u2019re not tripping but they\u2019re going through the necessary precautions, obviously\u201d) and amusingly shot down the various conspiracy theories about Hanks being in the illuminati (\u201cIf somebody wrote it on the internet, you know it must be true\u201d). Instead of being mocked by the media, as he had been so often, Chet was now getting headlines <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-how-tom-hanks-and-rita-wilsons-son-chet-haze-became-a-soothing-voice-amid-covid-19\">such as</a> \u201cHow Tom Hanks\u2019 Son Chet Haze Became a Soothing Voice Amid Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>That must have made Wilson proud, I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very sweet of him. Of course, our entire family was concerned about us,\u201d she says, maintaining a protective discretion about her children.</p> <p>I tell her that the last time I interviewed her husband, he did the rap that he and Dan Aykroyd <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gdBoo1anxY\">performed</a> in the 1987 film Dragnet for me. So now I imagine them as a hip-hop family, all rapping to one another in the evening.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, we make so much fun of that rap, that\u2019s hilarious! People say to me: \u2018Chet must have gotten his rapping from you.\u2019 But we were introduced to it more from our son rather than him being introduced to it from me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Wilson is an accomplished musician in her own right and, since 2012, has put out four albums, three of which feature songs she wrote herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be1bfaa13044c8eb60c8db69ea166919fe06294\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be1bfaa13044c8eb60c8db69ea166919fe06294/0_0_2775_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanks and Wilson in Sleepless in Seattle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanks and Wilson in Sleepless in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/TRISTAR PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWriting and performing songs has become so much more satisfying, compared to what I was being offered in movies.

  "<p>It was only about an hour into Sophia\u2019s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia\u2019s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.</p> <p>On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/22/us-food-industry-factory-workers-coronavirus-podcast\">'If one of us gets sick, we all get sick': the food workers on the coronavirus front line \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling<em>, \u201cVamonos, vamonos!\u201d</em> Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia\u2019s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: \u201cGod save me, God save me.\u201d When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement.</p> <p>Springdale was ill-prepared for the scale of <a href=\"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jun/27/chlorine-leak-tyson-plant-hospitalizes-several/?latest\" title=\"\">the disaster</a>. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them.</p> <p>It was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson\u2019s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals.</p> <p>The Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme \u2013 one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant \u2013 has many local priests and preachers on its payroll.</p> <p>However, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-03/u-s-chicken-industry-accused-of-conspiring-to-keep-immigrant-wages-down\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit.</p> <p>Chicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-12\" title=\"\">according to a 2017 report</a> by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency\u2019s severe violator enforcement program, which targets \u201crecalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation\u201d after a worker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region7/12172013\" title=\"\">hand was severed</a> by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker\u2019s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region6/08162016\" title=\"\">a dozen violations</a>, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alabama-carlos-lynn-decapitated-chicken-processing-plant-a9381426.html\" title=\"\">Tyson chicken plant in Alabama</a> was decapitated in an accident.</p> <p>After the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/tyson-chemical-spill-worker-injury-plant-inspection-privatization-slaughter-line-speed-usda/\" title=\"\">were hospitalised</a> after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. \u201cA contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor\u2019s use,\u201d the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Sophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape.</p> <p>While Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. \u201cI\u2019m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Sophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed.</p> <p>On 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d and must \u201cshow up and do their job\u201d. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33/0_0_3600_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Walker IV/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. \u201cI am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,\u201d she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to be, where I can feel safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn\u2019t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn\u2019t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers\u2019 rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to \u201censure that the employees had effective hazard communications training\u201d, and \u201cnot all employees understood the labelling system in the facility\u201d, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html\" title=\"\">request</a>). Although the failure was categorised as \u201cserious\u201d, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 \u2013 or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised. </p> <p>The workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. \u201cThese stories changed me for life,\u201d Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions.</p> <p>In February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson\u2019s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of <a href=\"https://www.uusc.org/press/new-arkansas-poultry-industry-report/\" title=\"\">a damning report</a> based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state \u2013 a third of whom worked for Tyson \u2013 who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line.</p> <p>The report offered a rare window into workers\u2019 experiences in one of the state\u2019s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. \u201cWe were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,\u201d Licolli recalled. \u201cTalking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>That hostile culture became even harsher after Trump\u2019s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state\u2019s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having <a href=\"https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=645\" title=\"\">sent buses</a> to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"long read email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The day after the report came out, the workers\u2019 campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson\u2019s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson\u2019s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. \u201cThey were really mad that we were taking these actions,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like they were lecturing us.\u201d</p> <p>Executives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson\u2019s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. \u201cI felt like it was the beginning of something different,\u201d she said</p> <p>A few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/poultry-workers-wear-diapers-work-bathroom-breaks\" title=\"\">which claimed</a> that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation \u2013 wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind.</p> <p>The bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson\u2019s website expressed concern about \u201cthese anonymous claims\u201d in the Oxfam report, saying that \u201cwhile we currently have no evidence they\u2019re true\u201d, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed.</p> <p>For Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. \u201cIt felt like a relief for them to have our back,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe were stronger in that moment than ever before.\u201d The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson\u2019s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: \u201cWe\u2019ve told them that while we believe we\u2019re a caring, responsible company, we\u2019re always willing to consider ways we can do better.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson\u2019s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. \u201cThere was nothing explicit,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo \u2018we are going to do this by this time\u2019 \u2026 it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.\u201d Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks.</p> <p>While Oxfam <a href=\"https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/a-big-win-for-poultry-workers/\" title=\"\">hailed the agreement</a> as a \u201cbig win\u201d on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers\u2019 delegates had been left out of the discussion. \u201cIt was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: \u2018Good for you, good for me, let\u2019s say you are a good company,\u2019\u201d Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam\u2019s request to issue a statement. \u201cI do think the company wants to change, but we\u2019re also very cautious,\u201d she <a href=\"https://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2017/04/the-new-agreement-for-poultry-workers-is-not-the-end-its-just-the-beginning/\" title=\"\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>When we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: \u201cSince the beginning of Oxfam\u2019s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers \u2026 In non-union plants [including Berry Street], Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But Licolli\u2019s caution turned out to be prescient. The workers were soon fighting a dangerous new threat to their health.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the slowdown of 2017, Tyson and the rest of the poultry industry wasted no time trying to turbo-charge chicken production. That meant resuming an old battle over production line speeds. In the last half century, poultry processors have increased line speeds from less than 100 birds per minute to 140 \u2013 the legal maximum established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Even at that rate, according to the US Government Accountability Office, workers <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688294.pdf\" title=\"\">risked injury and pain</a>, but chicken factories were <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7734f5cf-05d9-4f89-a7eb-6d85037ad2a7/17-05-Petition-National-Chicken-Council-09012017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" title=\"\">lobbying aggressively</a> to get slaughter and evisceration lines moving faster.</p> <p>In late December 2017, Licolli travelled to Washington DC with injured workers, including Sophia, to challenge the line-speed proposals, and met with officials at the USDA. For Sophia, it was a revelation. \u201cI had a voice for the first time,\u201d she recalls. Working with Licolli she had found friendship and the courage to tell her story. The following month, in a surprise move, the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA accepted their arguments and those of other workers\u2019 right groups, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/01/31/581956147/usda-denies-poultry-industrys-request-to-speed-up-the-slaughter-line\" title=\"\">turned down</a> the request to speed up chicken processing lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Villafuerte/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the next battle followed quickly. The meat and poultry industry had begun using a new weapon against bacteria in greater volumes. Peracetic acid \u2013 an antimicrobial developed for sterilising medical equipment \u2013 was found, if sprayed on carcasses, to reliably kill bacteria without leaving residue, which meant the whole process could be sped up. But, while safe for consumers, research has shown that it may carry health risks for workers. Long exposure has been shown to cause eye, skin and nose <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article-abstract/69/4/294/5420724\" title=\"\">irritations</a> to medical workers, as well as <a href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/49/2/49_2_155/_article/-char/ja/\" title=\"\">asthma</a>.</p> <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/viewpoints/antibiotic-use\" title=\"\">Tyson</a> announced plans to stop feeding human antibiotics to chickens, and began relying more heavily on antimicrobials. Jenny Leigh Houlroyd, a certified industrial hygienist and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, has been studying the use of peracetic acid in the poultry industry for years, and worries that a disaster may be slowly unfolding inside the lungs of workers. In 2018 she led a team of researchers in a pilot study of peracetic acid at four chicken plants in Georgia. During her time in the plants, workers told her about eye irritation, sore throats, headaches and sinus infections. The use of peracetic acid has been approved by the USDA and there is still no legal limit on exposure levels. With 250,000 poultry workers in the US exposed to peracetic acid, Houlroyd adds: \u201cThe industry needs to be listening to their workers. In the absence of definitive data, that is where you have to go. You have to listen to workers.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On a warm Tuesday evening in October 2019, not far from the Berry Street plant, Sophia was among two dozen or so women rearranging folding chairs into a semi-circle inside a one-room church on a Springfield strip mall. Like Sophia, the women were Latina immigrants, all of whom have worked low-wage jobs in the city\u2019s chicken plants.</p> <p>\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cOxfam sold us out.\u201d Her voice, once strong and clear, was thin and soft, barely above a whisper, and punctuated by fits of coughing.</p> <p>The women had begun meeting quietly together for some time. The Oxfam agreement had created a major rift within what, at the time, was a growing movement among poultry workers. With little change in their daily working conditions, these women felt betrayed. They decided they wouldn\u2019t rely on outsiders to negotiate for them any more.</p> <p>The previous year, Licolli, along with Sophia and other workers, had made two visits down to Immokalee, Florida, known as the nation\u2019s tomato capital, where a worker-led movement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/business/in-florida-tomato-fields-a-penny-buys-progress.html?hpw&amp;rref=us#slideshow/100000002843921/100000002843938\" title=\"\">had transformed</a> the conditions and wages for field workers, mostly poor immigrants from Latin America. The trip had been transformative for Sophia, who told me it gave her hope, for the first time, that they could bring about change within a company as powerful as Tyson.</p> <p>The Florida campaign had put workers\u2019 voices at the centre of the conversation with the brands who sourced their tomatoes in Immokalee. Licolli wondered if she could bring that model to the poultry industry. Instead of protesting, they would bring their fight to the household brands that buy Tyson chicken, such as McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, Licolli said, \u201cby alerting consumers to the injustice behind their favourite foods\u201d. But in January 2019, when Licolli brought those ideas to the board of the Northwest Arkansas Workers\u2019 Justice Center, they were rejected. \u201cI was called a radical. And it\u2019s not that I am an extremist,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut even the minimum effort of organising, it has to be radical. There is no sugar-coating our message for people to feel comfortable working with us.\u201d</p> <p>The clash over appropriate action proved irreparable, and in March, Licolli was dismissed as director of the centre. Subsequently, dozens of women, including Sophia, left. A few months later, the centre shut down. It had taken months for the women\u2019s campaign to get going again, but here they were, with their folding chairs and a new banner with a crowing rooster on it. \u201cBecause we are fighters,\u201d Licolli explained, as she went to work hanging it on the wall. On the banner was the name of their new labour organisation, Venceremos \u2013 meaning \u201cwe will win\u201d. The women spent the evening planning the public launch of the new organisation, and shared their concerns about how they would overcome the fear other workers had about organising.</p> <p>A few days later, Licolli drove up to a Springdale shopping centre for the official launch of Venceremos, where poultry workers were already waiting, having finished their day shifts at the nearby plants. She pinned up her rooster banner. The showing was better than she had hoped. Before she started, she asked all plant workers to raise their hands, and asked no one to post photos on social media from the event, fearing that Tyson might target them for retaliation. A reporter from Univision Arkansas came by, and a three-worker delegation arrived from Immokalee, including Gerardo Reyes Chavez. He believes the new workers\u2019 movement has potential. \u201cDespite all the circumstances they\u2019ve had to confront,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are really strong people, and they are trying to leave the world a better place than how the world has treated them.\u201d</p> <p>In January, workers noted increased shipments of peracetic acid to the Berry Street plant. Many workers were experiencing coughing, nose irritation and breathing problems. In mid-February, a group of 16 Venceremos workers walked into the office of a supervisor to tell them about the symptoms they were experiencing. The supervisor dismissed the idea that the chemicals were causing the symptoms, saying they sounded like the flu. However, he agreed to improve ventilation in the plant. Tyson said all employees working with chemicals were required to have training, maintain personal protective equipment, and were \u201cinstructed to report any irritations immediately to their manager\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In mid-March, with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across Arkansas, Sophia, like hundreds of other workers at the Berry Street plant, was given \u201cessential employee verification\u201d papers and told to keep them with her at all times. Sophia was deemed one of the nation\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce\" title=\"\">essential critical infrastructure</a>\u201d workers. She would be exempt from curfews, shelter-in-place orders and other mobility restrictions, so she might \u201cprovide services essential to the production of food\u201d.</p> <p>Five days a week, Sophia kept going to work on the evisceration line. Some days she woke up and felt the phantom balloon in her chest. She went to work anyway, fearful of losing a day\u2019s pay. When we spoke in March, she said there was no way to practise social distancing at the plant.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all standing close together all the time. I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s not only about the line. When we finish our shift, or we come in to start, we all come in together through the same doors. If one of us gets sick, all of us get sick.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia read news reports of the virus with growing alarm. Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home.</p> <p>Workers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tyson-foods-demand-poultry-plants-to-provide-paid-sick-days-for-their-hourly-workers?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=73fcf380-f097-012f-fc86-4040aa777426\" title=\"\">an online petition</a> demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures.</p> <p>On 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn\u2019t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy\u2019s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don\u2019t have [health insurance] coverage.\u201d The company also said: \u201cIf a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they\u2019re out.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers\u2019 temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines.</p> <p>Workers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. \u201cIt only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">How much is an hour worth?

The code has been embroiled in a myriad of issues over the past few days; none of them have moved the sport closer to finding a solution.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s scathing broadside from Channel Nine \u2013 one of the game\u2019s major broadcast partner \u2013 fuelled speculation the station was not committed to a resuscitation of the 2020 season. In reality for the NRL, it was like one of Apollo\u2019s astronauts being left behind in space without a lifeline.</p> <p>V\u2019landys has now been charged with sweetening the apparent oversight of the game\u2019s broadcasters not being invited to the NRL table and striking a deal where a revised competition can be televised viably, in an environment where the appetite of advertisers has drastically waned.</p> <p>The message from V\u2019landys is set: 28 May is a target date. What is not clear, is how the NRL plans to execute the game\u2019s revival in the next six weeks.</p> <p>It is evident that is reliant on the continued deceleration of Covid-19 cases. Opponents cite the bold ambition of V\u2019landys and his innovation committee as arrogant and flying in the face of expert medical advice. How can one justify hundreds of adults breaking social distancing rules each weekend to smother each other in tackles while the rest of the country is told to remain a metre and a half away from everyone, including close friends and family?

It needs to rapidly unify its major stakeholders and create equality between the teams. It needs to harvest the support of its sponsors. And it needs to gain the green light of government.</p> <p>Meanwhile, its rival, the AFL, is due to announce plans for a restart at the end of April.

There are the international award-winners such as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke; there are the early masterpieces such as Laputa, Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro and Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind; there are even the quieter, oft-overlooked movies such as Only Yesterday, Porco Rosso and Whisper of the Heart.

Though I started watching mainly to practice my nascent Japanese, the gradual turn towards a slow-burn romance between high schoolers kept me compelled even as I was fumbling for my dictionary. Note that the first 2018 season is only available on Crunchyroll, while Netflix has the more recent 2019 season.</p> <p><strong>See also: </strong>The retro video game-focused Hi Score Girl (Netflix) and fast-paced absurdist comedy Kaguya-sama Love Is War (Crunchyroll, AnimeLab) are also great watches if you\u2019re in the mood for some light-hearted romance.</p> <h2><strong>Naruto: Shippuden</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Crunchyroll, AnimeLab</strong></em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVgKnfN9i34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zVgKnfN9i34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This wildly popular action series about a kid ninja and the various wars he gets into has been running since 2002 and was a staple of my schooldays, but I fell off watching thanks to its repetitive and often bloated nature.

Not everybody appreciates a series where entire episodes can be taken up by dramatic discussions of jurisprudence, enforcement, inequality, societal norms and high-stakes asset negotiation, but the first season\u2019s exploration of such weighty issues \u2013 dressed in the familiar clothing of late 00s online games like Runescape and World of Warcraft \u2013 is a delight, at least for me.</p> <h2><strong>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Crunchyroll</strong></em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-91y7BJ8QA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8-91y7BJ8QA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Director Masaaki Yuasa\u2019s latest series about a high-school animation club is bursting at the seams with an incredible love for the medium.

  "<p>A senior Saudi royal and granddaughter of the country\u2019s founding monarch has revealed she is being held in prison and demanded that the current ruler and her cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, release her and provide medical care.</p> <p>Princess Basmah bint Saud bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, an outspoken human rights advocate, claims she is being detained without charge in Riyadh with one of her daughters. She says neither have received explanations for their arrests, despite repeated pleas to the kingdom\u2019s royal court, and to her uncle King Salman.</p> <p>The princess, the last of King Saud\u2019s 108 children, took to Twitter to plead for freedom and claim her health had deteriorated to the point that it was now \u201cvery critical\u201d. She said she was being held in al-Ha\u2019ir prison, and claimed to have done no wrong.</p> <p>News of her detention surprised two senior royals who said she had not been heard from for close to a year, and was thought to be convalescing after a bout of illness. Other members of the extended family believed her to be under house arrest.</p> <p>It is understood that Princess Basmah and her daughter were detained as they tried to leave Saudi Arabia for Switzerland in March last year. She claimed then to be in urgent need of medical treatment. However her private jet was not allowed to depart.</p> <p>Relatives had since had fleeting conversations with the 52-year-old, with one claiming on Thursday that she had been guarded and appeared to be speaking under duress. Princess Basmah had been a frequent advocate of reform in the kingdom, and had advanced women\u2019s rights and humanitarian rights during a brief media career, and several years in London, where she developed a business career.</p> <p>She had called for Saudi Arabia to become a constitutional monarchy, a change that would have separated the position of monarch from the country\u2019s executive branch \u2013 a fundamental change to its current status of an absolute monarchy.</p> <p>She returned to the kingdom in late 2015, assuming a role of supporter of the royal family on one hand, but in-house critic on the other. She urged restraint in the Saudi-led war in Yemen and widespread reforms at home.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the arrest fitted a clear pattern of dissenters being ruthlessly silenced by Prince Mohammed, who has methodically consolidated power since ousting his uncle Mohammed bin Nayef nearly three years ago and giving himself a clear run to the throne.</p> <p>\u201cUnder Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s rampant repression of all forms of critics, including people he can extort money out of, the space for dissent has shrunk greatly,\u201d said Rothna Begum, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at HRW. \u201cThis is particularly the case for women, many of whom have been silenced, imprisoned, or are in exile right now.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is off limits to the crown prince. He really is after everyone and women have borne the brunt of this. We are seeing things that we never saw before in Saudi. There was a time when women of a powerful background could say things about women\u2019s rights and issues that matter. But under the crown prince, this important space has gone.\u201d</p> <p>In early March, Bin Nayef and the last remaining full brother of King Salman, Ahmad bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud were arrested in their homes and accused of plotting against the crown prince. They were the most senior royals yet to be arrested in a series of purges over the past two years that have included business leaders, senior military officers and members of the inner sanctum. Both men remain in detention. The Guardian revealed at the time that both men had been accused of discussing using a newly formed body, the allegiance council, to try to prevent Prince Mohammed from being named as king if his father dies.</p> <p>The arrests have sparked fear in senior circles and across large parts of Saudi society. Critics say they offset civic reforms that have been introduced in the same time, which give women a broader role in society and more power to shape their destinies, and have rescinded decades of rigid theocratic rule.</p> <p>Prince Mohammed has demanded total loyalty from family members and has shown himself willing to take on royals who were considered untouchable and tribes that were too influential to tangle with. He has been accused of ordering the killing of prominent critic Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in October 2018 \u2013 a gruesome assassination that battered his relations with former allies. Prince Mohammed\u2019s father, the 84-year-old monarch, has given him unfettered powers to put the kingdom on a new economic and social footing that could wean it off a dependency on oil, attract investors, and bring the country more into line culturally with neighbouring states, such as the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>An adviser to Mohammed bin Salman was approached for comment about the allegations. He declined to comment.</p>",

This is important, because the person who goes first begins the game in control, meaning they call a specific basket to make (the more heavily detailed the better). If they make it, the other player has to duplicate it or receive THEIR SCARLET LETTER (starting with H-, with the next being O-, and the one after that R- and so forth.). If the player in control misses the shot they just called, they don\u2019t get a letter BUT The other player is now in charge and can start bossing them around. As soon as a player gets their fifth letter, thus spelling out H-O-R-S-E, they are eliminated. </p> <p>Oh and there\u2019s no dunking. That\u2019s right out.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e98f2838f08ea7431f44581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T00:21:32.886Z\">1.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p> <p>Well, let\u2019s give ESPN another shot at this, shall we? In their attempt to come up with something sports-like, ESPN had the idea of pitting socially-distanced basketball players against one another in a H-O-R-S-E competition. It was a solid idea, the <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/4/12/21218710/the-nba-horse-superlatives-round-1\">execution was a bit lacking</a>. The network left the players to their own devices\u2014quite literally in many cases\u2014as far as how they would be filmed, ensuring that the quality of the broadcast was sub-public access in many spots.</p> <p>The basketball itself? Well, it took a while to heat up. It wasn\u2019t until the final match of the game, between Allie Quigley and Chris Paul, that the competition really heated up. The hope is that tonight\u2019s semi-finals and championship round will feature a bit more drama and maybe slightly better audio or video quality? If not, well, the good news about Sunday\u2019s attempt was that we all rallied together to make fun of the same sporting event airing on ESPN. And you know what it felt lik? It felt like a brief, glorious return to normality. </p> <p>Heck, we even had Paul Pierce spouting out nonsense on a basketball broadcast again! Just like the Before Times.</p> <p>So, however this manages to go, it should be a fun way to burn the next two hours.

The health department was prioritising testing in areas where there was a small number of cases of community transmission but the source had not been identified, the spokesman said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no test that can predict whether or not someone will become unwell after exposure to a confirmed case and therefore testing on people with no symptoms can often lead to false negative results,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-the-graphs-that-show-how-australia-is-containing-the-pandemic\">Coronavirus: the graphs that show how Australia is containing the pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor this reason, NSW Health only tests people with symptoms of Covid-19 such as fever, sore throat, a dry cough or other respiratory symptoms.

On Thursday the NSW Health Services Union supported the health worker after the state health minister Brad Hazzard accused her of \u201cnot doing the right thing\u201d. He made the comments despite the premier Gladys Berejiklian telling reporters: \u201cI feel for her and want to tell her directly she did nothing wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll of us empathise with her,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cShe did the right thing. As soon as she realised she could have been in contact with someone with the illness, she got tested.\u201d</p> <p>All residents in the home have been isolated in their rooms since Sunday.</p> <p>Matthew Fowler\u2019s 87 year old father is in Newmarch House and returned a negative test for Covid-19 earlier in the week.

He has made a complaint to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission.</p> <p>There have been 29 new cases of Covid-19 across NSW since Thursday, including the 15 additional cases identified from Newmarch House. A seven-week-old baby boy is among the new infections in the state. The total cases in NSW is 2,926, including 26 patients in intensive care, 19 of whom are ventilated.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cMake America great again\u201d was an election winning slogan with a bold and simple message. \u201cOpening up America again\u201d proved to be less clear cut and left questions in the air.</p> <p>On Thursday Donald Trump unveiled federal staggered guidelines for getting America back to business after the shutdown forced by the coronavirus pandemic. He had previously billed it as the most important decision of his presidency, but what he called \u201ca science-based reopening\u201d was messier and more ill-defined.</p> <p>First, the good news. The 18-page document explicitly used the word \u201cguidelines\u201d \u2013 a far cry from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">\u201ctotal authority\u201d</a> he claimed earlier this week. It delegates authority to state governors and city mayors to weigh the risk-to-reward ratio of opening businesses, churches and schools, which is the way it should be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/michigan-protest-coronavirus-rightwing-support\">Protests against US stay-at-home orders gain support from rightwing figures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also recognises the need to move gradually with baby steps, and the fact that America is vast \u2013 roughly the same size as Europe \u2013 with different needs in different places. \u201cWe are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time, and some states, they will be able to open up sooner than others,\u201d the president said.</p> <p>Even Trump, who has turned his briefings into mini-campaign rallies, seemed relatively disciplined and focused at the White House on Thursday. He was broadly in step with his experts, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci. For all his wild words in recent weeks, including calling for the country to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\">reopen at Easter</a>, Trump has at least heeded the professionals when it came to extending physical distancing guidelines and now seeking to wind them down.</p> <p>The document proposes that, before reopening, states should see a decrease in confirmed Covid-19 cases over a 14-day period, have a \u201crobust testing system in place for at-risk healthcare workers\u201d, and hospitals should be able to \u201ctreat all patients without crisis care\u201d.</p> <p>But there are plenty of ambiguities. The guidelines do not give a firm target date. Trump said some states could reopen \u201ctomorrow\u201d but declined to name them. The guidelines emphasise the need for testing but do not make clear how many tests will be enough, nor set out a national testing strategy. Yet testing and contact tracing have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">key to the relative success of countries</a> such as Germany and South Korea.</p> <p>House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the guidelines lack of clarity on a national testing strategy, saying in statement: \u201cTesting is the key to opening our country to resume our lives. The White House\u2019s vague and inconsistent document does nothing to make up for the president\u2019s failure to listen to the scientists and produce and distribute national rapid testing.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of that secure knowledge, the public may not respond to Trump\u2019s summons. More than four in five people say Americans should \u201ccontinue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy\u201d, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday.</p> <p>And even on one of his more restrained days, Trump made some worrying statements. He kept referring to the virus in the past tense, even as thousands of people continue to die every day. \u201cNow that we are past the peak in new cases, we are starting life again,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/santa-monica-nurses-suspended-n95-masks-coronavirus\">Ten nurses suspended for refusing to work without N95 masks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf the virus returns in the fall as some scientists think it may, possibly, these guidelines will ensure the country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, tweeted: \u201cThat briefing had everything but the \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 banner. Now let\u2019s start ignoring the president and concentrate on where the power is: the states and cities.\u201d</p> <p>In the week that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">halted funding to the World Health Organization</a>, Trump made reference to \u201ca cruel virus from a distant land\u201d and said border control and travel restrictions are more important than ever. He reflected: \u201cIn 1917, they went through something that was similar\u201d, \u2013 he was off by a year, as the Spanish flu was in 1918.</p> <p>And he told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a new normal. Normal is going to be if a restaurant had 158 seats filled before, they are going to have 158 seats filled again.\u201d Experts have warned such a prospect is still a very long way off.</p> <p>The political benefit of asking individual states to call the shots is that, if things go wrong, Trump will claim he is shielded from blame. He said: \u201cWe have some states that got too much credit for what they\u2019ve done, frankly. I could name you a couple of those.\u201d</p> <p>Trump described himself as a healer and claimed that partisan politics should be put aside. \u201cI don\u2019t care about campaigning,\u201d he said. But it will not be long, perhaps, before he is back on the trail.</p>",

Just saying those words is likely to send a chill down the spine of anyone who has played the game. Even now, years later, I\u2019m still haunted by how difficult it was to beat. It\u2019s so hard that a decade after the game was released, Zelda\u2019s director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/25/eiji-aonuma-legend-zelda-interview\">actually issued an apology</a>.</p> <p>My parents were out that night and I was being looked after by a babysitter. She had spent the night on the computer, presumably browsing through the poorly designed Geocities websites that dominated the internet in the 90s.</p> <p>Eventually, my failed attempts to best the Water Temple broke me and I flung my Nintendo 64 controller on the ground in frustration. That drew my babysitter\u2019s attention. She asked me why I was so agitated and if she could help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72e330c83203f2e89f06d38b08368590b750c7b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72e330c83203f2e89f06d38b08368590b750c7b9/0_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screenshot from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t know what combination of magic and weighted boots I needed to solve the Water Temple\u2019s complex puzzles, but she did propose a solution: internet chat rooms. My sitter explained that there were people who decided to spend most of their night staring into a screen, talking to strangers on the internet. Crazy, I know.</p> <p>We ended up finding a chatroom innovatively titled \u201cGames\u201d on some long-defunct portal. She asked me to describe my dilemma to her as she typed it all out. We were inundated with people offering to help and sharing tips. (We were probably aided by the fact that someone describing themselves as a 17-year-old girl was in a video game themed chat room on a Friday night).</p> <p>With the help of my sitter, and online strangers, I managed to beat the Water Temple that night. The experience left me with a deeper appreciation for two things: the challenging, yet satisfying, open world gameplay of the Zelda games, and the ability of the internet to build supportive communities.</p> <p>Two decades later, and I\u2019ve found myself admiring exactly the same things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3fab33cc5dadf71efa0dda1787442012990e52cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fab33cc5dadf71efa0dda1787442012990e52cd/0_0_3000_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When this period of isolation kicked off a few weeks ago I went through the same thought process as most middle-class professionals lucky enough to have the security of a house and a stable income.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to be OK!

I\u2019ll write a book!\u201d</p> <p>That bout of inspiration faded quickly: isolating while simultaneously trying to make sense of the chaos of the world around you is actually quite emotionally and mentally draining. The lofty goals you set yourself quickly morph into a more mundane challenge: getting through the long, slow days.</p> <p>But the internet had a solution for me, just like it did 20 years ago: gaming.</p> <p>Social media, the modern equivalent of the chatrooms of yore, has been flooded with photos and stories of people, some of whom had never played games before, buying new consoles so they make the time go faster, stimulate themselves, or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/09/40-something-dad-is-trying-reconnect-with-zelda-its-not-going-well/\">create new bonds with their family</a>.</p> <p>The pandemic-induced isolation has seen a particularly intense run on Nintendo Switches, the contemporary equivalent of my old Nintendo 64. It makes sense. Nintendo has a reputation for making the most accessible and family-oriented gaming devices.</p> <p>Bright, light-hearted games with an emphasis on community-building are a much more attractive option in these times than the bleak world of first-person shooters that tend to dominate consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3935c1e0335774f4c113d6ced9caf8ee04efed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3935c1e0335774f4c113d6ced9caf8ee04efed/0_0_1799_1080/1000.png\" alt=\"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2013 within a few seconds of starting the game I was overwhelmed with nostalgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately for me, the Switch\u2019s popularity meant it was sold out across the world and manufacturing delays mean new stock won\u2019t arrive for months.</p> <p>But I couldn\u2019t wait, so I bought the cheaper, portable version: the Switch Lite. The first game I got? The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Released in 2017, it\u2019s the latest instalment in Nintendo\u2019s long running Zelda franchise. It turns out I had bought the perfect game for our current moment.</p> <p>Within a few seconds of starting the game I was overwhelmed with nostalgia. It was intensely familiar: the characters were the same, the core gameplay mechanics were the same (you run around an open-world medieval landscape killing monsters and fulfilling quests) but 20 years worth of technological development meant the visuals were stunning, and the gameworld more immersive and interactive than ever.</p> <p>With so much uncertainty and anxiety dominating our lives at the moment, there\u2019s something deeply comforting about being reminded of the simple pleasures of our youth.

It\u2019s like the game was designed to allow us to live out heightened versions of what we\u2019re all craving: exploring the outdoors, mystery, adventure, and even mundane conversations with people you don\u2019t know.</p> <p>There\u2019s a plot to follow, sure, but what I\u2019m finding most rewarding is the basics: roaming around the open world, gathering wild fruit, hunting animals, trading with villagers, slaying monsters.
