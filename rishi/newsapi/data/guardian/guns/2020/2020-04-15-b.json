Closed airports, bonded labour, or other forms of unbreakable employment contracts, and little access to funds, have made it close to impossible for those who want to leave to do so.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>Lebanon</strong>, where an economic meltdown had already shattered household incomes before the coronavirus lockdown, both Amnesty International and the International Labour Organisation fear that many domestic workers are no longer being paid. There are concerns that with families confined to homes, workers have been forced into more intensive and dangerous work, facing obsessive demands to clean inside the house, and dangerous xenophobia on rare trips outside. </p> \n  <p>Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As one of the most marginalised groups in Lebanon, the government needs to clearly warn that it will prosecute employers who exploit or abuse migrant domestic workers. It should also ensure they are granted access to health care during the pandemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Lebanon, the 250,000 strong migrant workforce consists primarily of domestic workers who usually live in the homes of their employers.</p> \n  <p>In the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), where foreign workers make up 90% of the population of the <strong>UAE</strong>, 60% in <strong>Kuwait</strong>, 50% in <strong>Bahrain</strong>, and 33% in <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, large numbers of migrant workers are instead housed in labor camps. Many have been stood down since the corona outbreak, and can neither depart for their home countries or leave their compounds. Social distancing is very difficult and access to advanced health care is often limited.</p> \n  <p>While official coronavirus numbers in the Gulf states are relatively low, compared with the region\u2019s most seriously affected state, Iran, there are concerns that migrant camps are dangerous incubators for the virus, and are not adequately checked by authorities who give precedence to citizens and expatriate residents.</p> \n  <p>When the region\u2019s airports eventually open, potentially by the end of Ramadan in late May, some GCC countries are expecting many laid off skilled and unskilled workers \u2013 who can still afford to leave \u2013 to attempt to do so. In the meantime, several million others face what NGOs believe to be a heightened risk and increasing uncertainty</p> \n  <p>The coronavirus crisis has crippled employment across the Gulf and could spell ruin for construction, retail and other sectors. The upshot could threaten the very future of migrant labour in all countries \u2013 and in turn threaten the viability of some of the world\u2019s richest economies.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:31:17.639Z\">at 12.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e96ea678f082a2cd32a7171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:07:42.335Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>EU</strong>\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has slammed the US decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF/status/1250356625803599875\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WHO</a>.

  "<p>Judges will be able to impose tougher punishments on anyone convicted of assaulting emergency workers or threatening to transmit diseases under sentencing guidelines proposals published on Thursday.</p> <p>The Independent Sentencing Council recommendations implement changes introduced under the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018, in which a higher statutory maximum of 12 months in prison was introduced.</p> <p>During the first nine months of last year, the consultation notes, 6,400 offenders were sentenced under this offence.</p> <p>Emergency workers include police officers, prison officers, firefighters, search and rescue personnel, NHS medical and support staff as well as doctors\u2019 receptionists and NHS administrative staff whose activities involve contact with the public.</p> <p>The council this month published <a href=\"https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/magistrates-court/item/common-assault-racially-religiously-aggravated-common-assault/\">interim guidance</a> on dealing with cases involving attempts to spread coronavirus. It states: \u201cWhere sentencing common assault offences involving threats or activity relating to transmission of Covid-19 the court should treat this as an aggravating feature of the offence.\u201d</p> <p>The courts are taking such assaults more seriously. In Manchester on Wednesday, a man was sentenced to a year in jail for spitting at three police officers in Greater Manchester.</p> <p>In its consultation, the sentencing council states: \u201cThe legislation has not increased maximum sentences for these more serious offences, but instead makes the commission of an ABH [actual bodily harm] or GBH [grievous bodily harm] against an emergency worker a statutory aggravating factor, to provide for an uplift to be applied to the sentence in the same way in which other statutory aggravating factors, such as previous convictions of an offender, provide for an increased sentence.\u201d</p> <p>The council said its proposed changes reflected \u201cthe clear intention of parliament to increase sentences for assaults on those designated as emergency workers. All but one offence category therefore provides for a custodial sentence to be imposed, and half of the categories include custodial starting points.</p> <p>\u201cThe most serious offence category provides for a sentence of up to the full statutory maximum sentence of 12 months\u2019 custody to be imposed. While parliament may yet consider if this maximum sentence should be increased further, the guideline reflects the current statutory provisions.\u201d</p> <p>The consultation also introduces an additional aggravating factor relating to \u201cemergency workers who may be isolated and unable to escape an assault\u201d. This would include offences where medical staff are assaulted when isolated while treating an individual. Spitting or coughing has also been included as an aggravating factor.</p> <p>The sentencing council proposals cover seven different types of assault including attempted murder. The council spokesperson, Mr Justice Julian Goose, said: \u201cAssault offences can be very personal crimes. It is important that sentences should be appropriate and proportionate, and reflect the harm caused to victims.</p> <p>\u201cThese guidelines will provide the courts with a framework for sentencing a range of offences, from high-volume common assault to attempted murder. When in force, they will provide protection in the years ahead for the public and the people who serve them by providing public services or as emergency workers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Commenting on the proposals, the justice minister Chris Philp said: \u201cNever has the debt of gratitude we owe our emergency workers been greater \u2013 they are heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe.</p> <p>\u201cThese guidelines send a clear message that those who seek to harm them will feel the full force of the law.\u201d</p>",

LoCoco always had the biggest smile, no matter how busy the pediatric units were. She was loved by all.\u201d</p> <p>Susan Sisgundo, 51, was a neonatal intensive care nurse at Bellevue hospital, the city\u2019s flagship public hospital, before she started treating Covid-19 patients. She was being treated at Queens hospital, where she died on 8 April. Sisgundo was an immigrant, originally from the Philippines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-health-care-worker-death-toll-higher-official-data-suggests\">Coronavirus is killing far more US health workers than official data suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sisgundo \u201cwent out of her way to greet people\u201d, her colleagues said, in a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-loving-memory-of-susan-sisgundo-our-nurse-hero\">GoFundMe</a> page set up to collect money for her cremation and repatriation to the Philippines.

He had previously cared for New York City inmates. He left behind a wife and three adult children, including a daughter and twin sons.</p> <p>Aleyamma John, who died on 7 April, was a 43-year member of the NYSNA, the group said. She had worked at the Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation and moved to the NYC Health + Hospitals system in 2003.</p> <p>Though the number of people visiting hospital emergency departments in the city has slowed, the case load inside intensive care units remains high, and nurses still face shortages of masks and gowns.</p> <p>Rose said nurses were facing intense pressure to work with severely ill Covid-19 patients, even when they might not be trained in intensive care, and that in some cases that pressure had turned into abuse. \u201cYou\u2019re getting managers who call people selfish, and stupid, and maybe they\u2019re not \u2018real nurses\u2019,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThis is all the while people have inadequate protective equipment.\u201d</p> <p>All five of the NYSNA nurses who died worked for public hospitals operated by New York City Health + Hospitals, the city\u2019s public health corporation, the union said.<strong> </strong>Public hospitals have been swamped by the crisis, as the 11 hospitals operated by NYCH+H disproportionately serve people hardest-hit by the pandemic \u2013 low-income and minority New Yorkers.</p> <p>One such example is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/new-york-coronavirus-elmhurst-hospital\">Elmhurst hospital</a> in Queens, one of the most inundated by the crisis.

  "<p>The New Zealand government and prime minister deserve the plaudits they are receiving for their handling of the Covid-19 crisis. At this stage, their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/ardern-optimistic-as-new-zealand-records-lowest-number-of-covid-19-cases-for-two-weeks\">elimination strategy appears to be working</a>.</p> <p>But any political system is bigger than those making decisions at the top. In truth, the government\u2019s decision to take the country into lockdown was made after pressure was applied by civil society, the opposition, and the media, which channelled epidemiologists and other experts making the case that the government\u2019s containment strategy wasn\u2019t working, and insisted New Zealand urgently needed to change tack.</p> <p>The political system worked. But one of the ironies of putting the country into lockdown is we now have a system in which democracy is being debased. Civil liberties have been significantly curtailed, parliament adjourned, and the normal operations of the media are greatly restricted, meaning less public access to information.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/jacinda-ardern-and-ministers-take-20-pay-cut-in-solidarity-with-those-hit-by-covid-19\">Jacinda Ardern and ministers take 20% pay cut in solidarity with those hit by Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That means the combination of civil society, media and the parliamentary system that normally keeps a check on government and authorities is now seriously weakened. This may be necessary given the dire threat posed by Covid-19, but it\u2019s also dangerous for democracy and decision-making while the crisis is unresolved.</p> <p>There were already serious democratic deficits in New Zealand \u2013 most notably, a concentration of political power, access for vested interests and a lack of public participation in politics. These have been accelerated.</p> <p>The state of the media is especially troubling. The business models of most media companies were already in crisis. Journalism is being steadily downsized, with former journalists moving to lobbying and PR roles. Covid-19 has only made the situation worse, with more media layoffs and closures during the lockdown, and likely more to come. The imbalance between those with power, and those trying to hold them to account, is getting worse.</p> <p>Senior journalists complain that under the new crisis conditions, authorities and politicians no longer provide the public with adequate information. Although there are daily public media briefings \u2013 usually given by Jacinda Ardern and the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield \u2013 these do not satisfy journalists wanting to question and test the official statements of politicians and public servants.</p> <p>Investigative journalist Michael Morrah alleges authorities are using the sole daily press conference <a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/04/michael-morrah-is-the-ashley-bloomfield-show-as-transparent-as-kiwis-think.html\">to avoid transparency</a>. He argues there \u201cappears to be a massive disconnect with what the public is being told, and what is actually happening on the ground\u201d, there is not enough time allocated for questions, and \u201cgetting clear, timely answers to questions has frequently been an arduous and deeply frustrating process\u201d.</p> <p>Another senior journalist, Andrea Vance, also suggests the <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/120959519/coronavirus-how-jacinda-ardern-is-using-soft-propaganda-to-beat-covid19\">daily briefings are inadequate</a>: \u201c\u2026 it\u2019s unsatisfactory because, at present, it\u2019s really our only chance to ask questions. They can\u2019t be detailed, they can\u2019t contain specific answers, and they are rarely allowed to be followed up. They concentrate all newsgathering from official sources into one narrow time slot, and into the hands of a few figure heads.\u201d</p> <p>This concentration of power in the prime minister\u2019s office is coming under increasing criticism, and our parliamentary system of government has quickly become more presidential. The PM is essentially running the health portfolio from Wellington while the minister of health, David Clark, has been locked down at his home in the far south of the country. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/new-zealand-health-minister-demoted-after-beach-visit-broke-lockdown-rules\">Clark\u2019s lockdown-breaking trip to the beach</a>, which led to his demotion and being stripped of other cabinet roles, concentrated her power even further.</p> <p>Of course, the intense consolidation of power within the government is hardly surprising in a crisis of this magnitude. The dominance of the prime minister and her few trusted advisers and colleagues \u2013 the minister of finance, Grant Robertson, in particular \u2013 was already established well before the crisis emerged. And with continued questions about the performance of other government ministers, it\u2019s natural that the powers of Ardern should be elevated further. </p> <p>This approach is working \u2013 a new poll shows that 88% of the public trust that the government is making the right decisions. This figure compares well with the other countries \u2013 the average poll rating for G7 countries is only 59%.</p> <p>Yet in times of crisis we need more scrutiny, not less. The country\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog, Transparency International New Zealand, has warned that billions of dollars are vulnerable to being diverted for personal gain as some people take advantage of the crisis. </p> <p>The organisation has welcomed the establishment of a select committee chaired by the leader of the opposition, but warns it needs to be much more than a rubber stamp on the government and must prioritise scrutiny and monitoring that Parliament would normally provide.</p> <p>The committee is only a partial replacement for scrutiny by parliament. It does not have its full powers to scrutinise urgent government regulations, and it lacks any way to recall the House to act if it thinks it necessary.</p> <p>Attention needs to be given to fixing this political malady. Otherwise we might well fight off the health crisis, and end up with a political system that is much less democratic, with the likelihood of even more suffering as result.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Dr Bryce Edwards is political analyst in residence at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand</em></p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>You know how it is.

We\u2019ve all been there.</p> <p>And now, so has the brilliant Russian coder Sergei (Karl Glusman) in Devs (BBC Two). He is an artificial intelligence specialist working for Amaya \u2013 a fictional amalgamation of all the tech companies whose overt and covert tentacular reach currently control our lives to a degree that would terrify us if we could bear to think about it. After his nematodal success, he is recruited by the company\u2019s enigmatic, all-powerful founder and CEO Forrest (Nick Offerman, putting his enormous, ambiguous presence and capacity for stillness to terrifying rather than comedic use this time). Sergei is a touch apprehensive about the move, but his girlfriend, Lily, is delighted for him. Sergei\u2019s attitude turns out to be the wiser one.</p> <p>So horrified is he by what he learns on his first day of the job that he attempts to leave with evidence of what he has seen in order to blow the whistle.

Lily is shown CCTV footage of her boyfriend self-immolating at the foot of the (sidebar \u2013 extraordinarily kitsch) commemorative statue of Forrest\u2019s dead daughter, after whom the company is named. But Sergei\u2019s lack of any kind of suicidal ideation before he disappeared and a suspicious locked app on his phone starts her off on a quest to discover What Really Happened. The game \u2013 replete with hackers, retro Russian handlers, icily malevolent blondes, hand-to-hand combat between opposing sides in underground car parks, questions of free will in deterministic universes and much more \u2013 is afoot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/14/nick-offerman-interview-devs\">Nick Offerman: 'Trump is about to be presented with a gory butcher's bill'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Devs is a rare beast \u2013 a drama with ideas rather than people at its heart. Which is not to say that the characters are underdeveloped. Most of them are quite as rounded as is generally considered necessary for a spy thriller (which is in essence what this is, albeit with the most modern espionage-worthy material as coveted prize), although it\u2019s a shame that the lead actor (Sonoya Mizuno as Lily) doesn\u2019t seem able to bring much more to the part than is exactly written.

That we\u2019re just puppets on causality strings. How do you live? Or how do you harness it, and to what end? Too much knowledge is far more dangerous than too little.</p> <p>The show doesn\u2019t entirely lose touch with what we might call the ordinary, current state of humanity \u2013 a paltry, threadbare thing though it might suddenly seem to be. There is Lily\u2019s shock at Sergei\u2019s death and, more convincingly, Forrest\u2019s deep-seated grief and yearning for his lost child (it\u2019s hard not to suspect even at this early stage that at least part of his obsessive work is aimed at finding some way to bring her back or alleviate his pain in some hitherto impossible way) and a twisted form of workplace banter among those in the temple set to change, if not unmake, the world.</p> <p>It\u2019s a deep, dark, wild ride.

WHAT A GOAL!!! Holland 2-1 Argentina (Bergkamp, 90 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Diego Maradona against England in 1986 multiplied by Marco Van Basten against USSR in 1988 divided by Michael Owen against Argentina this week = this goal, one of the greatest that will ever be scored in any football match at any time in any place. It all started with an Argentina attack, Lopez\u2019s cross from the left drifting over the unmarked Batistuta in the middle. With no other Argentina players about, Frank De Boer was able to stroll out of defence, bringing the ball up towards the halfway line. Assessing his options, he looked to release the ball, before spotting Bergkamp making a run in the corner of his eye. With that wand of a left foot, he hit a magnificent 70-yard diagonal pass to Bergkamp, who had advanced into the right side of Argentina\u2018s area. He let the ball drop over his shoulder and what followed were three touches of genius, each with his right foot. The first saw him pluck the ball out of the sky with astonishing elan. With Ayala marking him tightly, he poked the ball inside to wrongfoot the defender, who goes screeching off into the distance like Road Runner, and then, with his third, with greatness beckoning, he toepoked the ball as it bounced up into the top left corner of Roa\u2019s goal from the right corner of the six-yard box. The stadium erupts, Argentina collapse and Bergkamp races away to be mobbed by jubilant, disbelieving team-mates.. He did it so many times for Arsenal last season, but this is the winner <em>in the last minute of a World Cup quarter-final against Argentina</em>. Barring a minor miracle, Holland are through. It\u2019s Rob Rensenbrink in reverse!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a96a430a83c4bf550d25fbcc4453811715be6a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a96a430a83c4bf550d25fbcc4453811715be6a7/0_0_1864_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland\u2019s Dennis Bergkamp controls the ball before firing in the winning goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Bergkamp controls the ball ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"467dfab6aec6610b752ccf896222886a4e659388\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/467dfab6aec6610b752ccf896222886a4e659388/0_359_5904_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Bergkamp fire the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa for the Netherland\u2019s last minute winner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Bergkamp fire the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa for the Netherland\u2019s last minute winner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VI-Images via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d503badbcde6390417e0a292e7d643a301f3f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d503badbcde6390417e0a292e7d643a301f3f6/0_0_2000_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland\u2019s Dennis Bergkamp, left, is congratulated by teammates Wim Jonk, right, and Marc Overmars after scoring the winning goal against Argentina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bergkamp, left, is congratulated by teammates Wim Jonk, right, and Marc Overmars after scoring his stupendous goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Mazal\u00e1n/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:33:31.948Z\">at 9.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e976de18f08ea7431f43924\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:26:56.857Z\">9.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">OH MY WORD!

For such a brainy player, it\u2019s as if someone just flicked off the switch in his head. In the great pantheon of moronic red cards, this one\u2019s right up there. It was just so pointless. With Argentina pressing, Ortega had the ball on the right of Holland\u2019s area. Faced by Stam, he cut inside, before swiftly jinking outside. Stam hung out his left leg, which was the cue for Ortega to take a preposterous tumble. The referee blew - momentarily it seemed for a penalty - but he then flashed a yellow card in Ortega\u2019s direction. Van der Sar then ran over to remonstrate with the Argentinian for diving. Ortega was still on the floor but having been provoked, he bounced up, intentionally crashing the top of his head against Van der Sar\u2019s chin in the process. Right in front of the referee, who immediately shows him red. Ortega has lost Argentina their numerical advantage.

A penny for David Beckham\u2019s thoughts right now. To be fair, Holland can have few complaints about this and it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s come from another Argentina counterattack. Numan might blame Davids for the referee\u2019s decision though, because just before he made his tackle, the midfielder had clattered into Veron on the halfway line. Advantage was played, but once Simeone got to the loose ball, Numan chopped him down, his victim flying through the air and writhing in agony. He\u2019s probably not hurt but it was a cynical foul, despite Holland\u2019s protestations.

With Holland\u2019s defence completely exposed, a superb first touch with his right foot takes him into the area and past Frank De Boer. His second isn\u2019t too shabby either, an absolute piledriver with his left foot that screams on to the inside of the left post.

Holland 1-1 Argentina (Lopez, 17 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The reprieve was only temporary. Just seconds after that Veron chance, Argentina draw level with the slickest of goals. Remarkably it came straight from Holland\u2019s clearance and this has been the game in microcosm, with the Dutch simply incapable of holding on to possession for more than a few seconds. Van der Sar hoofed the ball to Bergkamp on the halfway line but he was swiftly engulfed by three Argentina defenders. Veron was left unattended in space between the midfield and the back four, and had ample time to slide a simple through ball straight down the middle for Lopez, beating an awful offside trap with ease. What followed was one of the coolest goals you could hope to see, Lopez opening up his body to put the ball on to his left, before producing roughly 73 dummies and feints in a bid to dupe Van der Sar. Just as one was about to scream at him to shoot, Van der Sar, simply unable to wait any longer, took the bait and collapsed on his backside, and Lopez, looking like a man supping a cocktail on the beach, rolled the ball through his legs and into the net. That was so infuriatingly calm - he could have done anything he wanted once Van der Sar had fallen - and it could only have been more insulting if he\u2019d walked the ball to the line, stooped down to his knees and nodded it in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"856b5ea148f168957c1a3b57be217f837d3a2a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/856b5ea148f168957c1a3b57be217f837d3a2a6e/0_0_1988_1462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Lopez, left,slots the ball past Netherland\u2019s goalie Edwin Van Der Sar to get Argentina back on level terms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudio Lopez, left,slots the ball past Netherland\u2019s goalie Edwin Van Der Sar to get Argentina back on level terms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08b8135c56f5462538ebbb868fce1637829d0269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b8135c56f5462538ebbb868fce1637829d0269/0_0_2416_1448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Lopez celebrates his goal with Gabriel Batistuta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lopez celebrates his goal with Gabriel Batistuta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T19:20:30.245Z\">at 8.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9759a08f08cf571cdb1b5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T19:02:14.502Z\">8.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>17 min:</strong> Whoops! Holland are their own worst enemies at times. Davids wonks a wayward pass to Numan out on the left. It\u2019s so firmly hit and in his attempt to keep the ball from going out for a throw-in, Numan miscontrols the ball into the path of Ortega, who\u2019s on it in a flash. Suddenly realising that Ortega has a free run at his defence, Numan cynically brings him down, conceding a free-kick and injuring himself in the process. As he lies prone on the turf, a yellow card is flashed in his direction. How heartless. He\u2019s hurt himself, in case you didn\u2019t see! From the resulting free-kick, Argentina nearly find the equaliser. It was taken short and the sublime Veron loped ominously into Dutch territory. Upon reaching the area, he played a lovely wall pass with Batistuta, Holland carved open like a biology student dissecting a frog, but was just unable to reach the return on the stretch and Van der Sar plunges on the ball. Veron holds his head in his hands, but it\u2019s coming. Argentina know it.

They\u2019ve been well below par in midfield, but Ronald De Boer has taken the game by the scruff of the neck here, dodging Almeyda\u2019s challenge and gliding supremely through a centre as soft as mushy peas. Twenty-five yards from goal, it looked for a moment as if he would shoot, but instead he disguised his intentions and chipped a delightful pass towards Bergkamp, who had edged to the left. Showing typically wonderful awareness, Bergkamp sliced open Argentina\u2019s dizzy defence, coaxing the ball into the path of Kluivert with a gorgeously cushioned header, allowing the striker to stroll through the middle and coolly clip the ball over the onrushing Roa from 15 yards out. That was a sublime team goal. And yet so crushingly simple.

After all Glenn Hoddle\u2019s side were magnificent on Tuesday night. Only, nothing went their way, Paul Scholes missing a glorious chance to make it 3-1 and lights out in the first half, David Beckham having a wee meltdown, Diego Simeone being Diego Simeone, Alan Shearer foolishly elbowing Carlos Roa as Sol Campbell \u2018scored\u2019, a curiously-placed divot denying Michael Owen when he went on another of those engrossing runs of his, a blatant handball in the area by Jose Chamot going unpunished during extra-time, David Seaman somehow letting in Roberto Ayala\u2019s atrocious penalty in the shoot-out and Kevin Keegan predicting that David Batty would score his. Oh Kevin! You make your own luck and all that, but still. If that match proved anything, it is that Argentina, for all their exquisite talent, are very much there for the taking.</p> <p><strong>Then again, Argentina might say the same about Holland. </strong>And with good reason too. The Dutch drew two of their group games, only managing a win against South Korea, and were then downright shabby against Yugoslavia in their second-round match. With the match poised at 1-1 in the second half, they were let off the hook when Predrag Mijatovic plonked a penalty against the bar, before Edgar Davids won it for Holland with a hit-and-hope effort from the edge of the area in the last minute. Again, there\u2019s terrific flair in that side, but it\u2019s yet to really catch fire. But what do I know? Both sides are still unbeaten.

He was the man who could have altered history, who could have defined a generation. Instead he was the man who missed \u2013 in the last minute of the World Cup final. </p> <p> With the match against the hosts Argentina delicately poised at 1-1, Holland had a free-kick just inside their half. From the centre circle, it was sent long into the Argentina area by Ruud Krol. The defending was poor, Argentina\u2019s right-back allowing the pass to bounce through to Rensenbrink, whose run had gone unnoticed by his supposed marker. The attacker reached the ball before the goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol, stuck out his left leg and poked a shot goalwards from the left side of the six-yard box. <br>  As he made contact with the ball, Fillol clattered into him, which would hardly have made a difference to Rensenbrink if his effort had rolled into the empty goal. How could it have? With the last kick of the match, he would have won the World Cup for Holland, for the first time, four years after they had lost in the final to West Germany. But the ball took one final bounce on its journey and that was all it required to alter the shot\u2019s trajectory, kick fatefully away from goal, on to the near post and back out into the area. It was hacked clear, and moments later the full-time whistle blew. </p> <p>Needless to say, Argentina scored twice in extra-time to secure a 3-1 victory. They, not Holland, had their name on the trophy for the first time. Eight years later, they won it for the second time. Twenty years later, Holland have not gone closer. Today they have a chance for revenge, an opportunity to reach the last four at Argentina\u2019s expense.

  "<p>Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Or perhaps not. Matt Hancock had been expected to give the previous day\u2019s Downing Street press briefing but got pulled in favour of Rishi Sunak, following the publication of Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s report suggesting GDP was set to tank by 35% over the next three months.</p> <p>So you might have thought the health secretary would have used the extra 24 hours to fine-tune his announcements on social care.</p> <p>Not so much. Over the past few weeks Hancock has been one of the few cabinet ministers to look even vaguely competent, but today he let his department down, he let his country down, but worst of all he let himself down. And there\u2019s nothing worse than a Tigger who lets a Tigger down. The best he can do now is go home to watch a replay of his press conference and cry himself to sleep.</p> <p>Hancock began by praising 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore for raising \u00a37m for the NHS by walking round his garden. As well he might. For that \u00a37m probably represents roughly the sum of what the Conservative government has taken out of the NHS each day over the past 10 years or so. Certainly, the legendary Chris Grayling has managed to waste twice that in a single visit to the despatch box in the Commons.</p> <p>Thereafter it was all downhill. I am here to tell you the next steps in our social care package, Tigger bounced. Which was news to everyone as up till now even the first baby steps had been kept a closely guarded secret.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson became prime minister he assured the country he had a social care package ready and waiting to go. To go precisely nowhere, as ever since we\u2019ve heard precisely zilch. Nada. Social care for the elderly still appeared to be the government\u2019s lowest priority even during a coronavirus pandemic that disproportionately affected old people.</p> <p>So here was the deal. More workers and care home residents would be getting tested and there would definitely be more personal protection equipment available. Though starting from a baseline of near zero this wasn\u2019t quite the earth-shattering announcement that Hancock had led everyone to expect.</p> <p>But luckily, Tigger was planning on saving the best till last. Because he knew that what social care workers really wanted wasn\u2019t testing, PPE, more money or a home secretary who dismissed them all as low-skilled. It was a shiny new green badge, saying CARE, that he was proud to model.</p> <p>A badge. A sodding badge. Even the writers of the TV series The Thick of It wouldn\u2019t have dared come up with something as crass as this. Especially as it was a badge that had already been launched a year previously to the general indifference of everyone in the care home sector.</p> <p>This was Tigger\u2019s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire moment. He was sorry that no social care workers had won the jackpot this week; the producers were withholding the \u00a31m top prize because they suspected cheating had taken place as there had been a lot of background coughing during the recording of the show \u2013 but as a gesture of goodwill, and to make sure no one went home empty-handed, he would be giving every contestant a badge. And a Tigger cuddly toy.</p> <p>Hard to believe, but the badges really were the high point of the entire 45-minute briefing. Hancock looked genuinely dismayed that the media weren\u2019t quite as wowed by them as he was \u2013 Fighting Corona, a Badge at a Time \u2013 and he rather went into meltdown during the question and answer session.</p> <p>First he made out that the reason testing levels had actually fallen in recent days was because NHS workers were far too busy sunning themselves in the park during the Easter Bank holiday weekend and they couldn\u2019t be arsed to come in for a test. You can only imagine the conversations that must have been taking place all over the UK. \u201cShall I go and get the test for which I\u2019ve been begging for for weeks? Or shall I just not bother and top up the tan?\u201d</p> <p>Hancock also appeared to be clueless as to why the government was seemingly unable to give even a hint of what criteria it would be using when considering a possible relaxation of the lockdown rules. There was no strategy to have a strategy. The best he could come up with was that different governments were at different stages of preparation so it would be wrong to make any comparisons.</p> <p>The strong implication was that our government was still at the \u201ccompletely hopeless\u201d stage of preparation so we shouldn\u2019t be holding our breath for any news any time soon. This is a decision that appears to be well above everyone\u2019s pay grade, including the prime minister\u2019s.</p> <p>Even that wasn\u2019t the nadir. Matt can\u2019t go out to meet the press without having a plan of action involving numbers. Last time out he had a five-pillar plan, almost none of which had yet to happen. So why should anyone believe a word he said now?</p> <p>Laura Hughes, of the Financial Times, gently pointed out that he had promised 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April and we were still down in the 16,000s. Which made the 100,000 promise in two weeks\u2019 time look totally unrealistic.</p> <p>Here Tigger lost the plot. It was all a big lie. A conspiracy. He had never said 25,000 tests by the middle of April. FAKE NEWS. He had said 25,000 by the end of April which he had then increased to 100K. So just wait and see. He believed he could fly. He believed he could touch the sky. Mystic Tigger. Unaccountably, Hughes was the only journalist not granted a supplementary question in which she could nail the inconsistencies in his memory. Instead, he bounced out the room, kissing the badge in triumph. And there we all were thinking it was the bear who had the little brain.</p>",

He also announced a further $150m donation towards the hunt for a vaccine, for which the foundation plans to build factories and therapeutics.</p> \n<p>The UK government\u2019s response was lukewarm. Asked about Trump\u2019s decision, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cOur position is that the UK has no plans to stop funding the WHO, which has an important role to play in leading the global health response.

  "<p>A commitment to completing the season before the start of July is among the options being considered by Premier League clubs, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>The clubs are due to meet on Friday in the latest attempt to pick a way through the Covid-19 crisis. A resolution to consign the 2019-20 campaign to history by 30 June, whether or not the entire schedule of games has been completed, will be among the proposals put to the league.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/arsenal-players-reject-pay-cut-demand-wage-deferral\">Arsenal players reject pay cut to aid club and demand wage deferral or bust</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to some reports, one of the most significant factors driving the idea to finish by that point \u2013 favoured by a large number of the league\u2019s members \u2013 is the expiry of numerous player and staff contracts by the end of June. One executive from a leading club told the Guardian he was relatively relaxed, with Fifa having issued guidelines last week stating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/07/fifa-approves-extended-player-contracts-and-later-transfer-windows\" title=\"\">contracts can be extended</a> until such time as the season ends. But he admitted the subject was on the table, with other clubs worried that English contractual law would render the governing body\u2019s stipulations irrelevant. That would lead to hundreds of potentially unresolved situations should fixtures be honoured into July. In theory, an out-of-contract player could then stand himself down from action even if still relied upon by his club for its remaining games.</p> <p>If the proposal to settle the season by 30 June is put to a vote, the Premier League would require a 14-club majority to approve any decision. Should it go through, the chances of completing a 38-game schedule would appear distinctly remote. Most teams have nine games left to play while four \u2013 Manchester City, Sheffield United, Arsenal and Aston Villa \u2013 must play 10. While clubs in Germany have returned to training, that scenario is still some way off in England. Then there would be the issue of getting players match-fit ahead of what, even if the league was cleared to resume behind closed doors at the start of June, would be an intense schedule.</p> <p>Curtailing the campaign along the proposed lines would not equate to voiding it if some fixtures remain unplayed, although it is unclear what efforts would be required to land upon a final league table that broadly satisfied everyone. Redoubling efforts to draw a line under 2019-20 would, the clubs believe, mean planning for 2020-21 could take place under less of a cloud and reduce the extent to which two seasons are hampered by the crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/newcastle-expect-green-light-saudi-takeover-despite-amnesty-misgivings\">Newcastle expect green light for Saudi takeover despite Amnesty misgivings</a> </p> </aside>",

  "<p>Emmanuel Macron called for clinical trials of a controversial coronavirus \u201ccure\u201d as he hailed the French infection specialist who promoted it as a great scientist. </p> <p>The French president said on Wednesday that he would like the treatment, which was backed by Didier Raoult, tested rigorously as soon as possible.</p> <p>The treatment is a combination of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s comments are likely to ignite fresh controversy over Raoult, whose research has been boosted by populist leaders, such as Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, but which is regarded with scepticism by other members of the medical establishment.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m convinced that he\u2019s a great scientist, and I\u2019m passionate about what he explained,\u201d Macron told RFI radio.</p> <p>Macron, who last week visited Raoult at his workplace, Marseille University hospital, qualified his praise with an admission that he remained \u201cwary\u201d about the treatment\u2019s efficacy.</p> <p>The president said: \u201cIt\u2019s not for the president of the French republic to say what treatment is good and what isn\u2019t. What I did in going to Prof Raoult\u2019s office \u2013 and he is one of the leading experts in this area \u2013 was to make sure that what he is working on is within the framework of a clinical trial protocol. It\u2019s not a question of belief, it\u2019s a question of science.\u201d</p> <p>Macron\u2019s closed-door visit to Raoult\u2019s hospital on Thursday came after <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/ephilippepm-traitement-covid19-ne-perdons-plus-de-temps-neperdonsplusdetemps\">an online petition</a> calling for wider distribution of the treatment appeared to be drawing support across France.</p> <p>Raoult\u2019s supporters had accused the French government of ignoring his research, which have been widely boosted on social media despite not having been proven to work under strict clinical trial conditions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-chloroquine-study-stopped-early.html\">A small study</a> using chloroquine on Covid-19 patients in Brazil was halted this week after some patients experienced heart rhythm problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump\u2019s coronavirus 'miracle cure'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rony_Brauman\">Rony Brauman</a>, a doctor specialising in tropical diseases and epidemiology and a former president of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, said: \u201cThe way in which Didier Raoult has presented chloroquine as a miracle drug is more like a prophet than a health specialist.\u201d</p> <p>Raoult, born in 1952 in Dakar, Senegal, is a specialist in infections and tropical diseases and a professor of microbiology. He studied at the Marseille medical faculty. </p> <p>After the Sars outbreak in 2003 he was commissioned by the French government to compile a report on the risks of biological terrorism, and he wrote a paper on the French medical system\u2019s lack of preparation for dealing with a pandemic. He recommended a new political approach to health.</p> <p>In 2010 Raoult won one of France\u2019s highest scientific distinctions, the INSERM Grand Prix, which is awarded to a scientists who have made \u201cremarkable progress in the field of human physiology\u201d.</p> <p>Known for his unusual appearance \u2013 long hair and a chunky ring \u2013 and reputed to be a blunt speaker, before the Covid-19 outbreak Raoult was recognised internationally for his research into the previously unexplored \u201cgirus\u201d or giant viruses.</p> <p>At the start of the current health crisis he was invited to take part in the French government\u2019s Covid-19 advisory committee but pulled out before attending any meetings in opposition to the strict lockdown. </p> <p>After two studies involving 24 and 80 patients, Raoult presented Macron with a third study carried out on 1,061 patients, but with no control group, of whom he claimed 973 were cured in 10 days. Experts said the lack of a control group meant the results were meaningless.</p> <p>Xavier Lescure, an infection specialist at Bichat hospital, in Paris, told France 2: \u201cAny study without a control group does not show anything at all.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://blogs.mediapart.fr/olivierbelli/blog/220320/pr-raoult-and-chloroquine-beware-lone-wolf\">blogpost</a> on the Mediapart site, <a href=\"https://blogs.mediapart.fr/olivierbelli\">Olivier Belli</a>, a specialist in molecular biology working in Zurich, wrote: \u201cIt is possible that hydroxychloroquine is a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of Covid-19 infections, especially since it has recently shown promising in vitro activity. However, the evidence that we currently have is too weak to justify an important resources shift in this direction.</p> <p>\u201cProper science communication is a difficult exercise and research progresses are often slow and sometimes counter-intuitive. Even if we enjoy \u2018lone genius vs the system\u2019 narratives that Raoult has been using during the past week, let us collectively remember that consensus is what makes scientific research so powerful.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Raoult has won support from across France\u2019s political spectrum, from Jean-Luc Melenchon on the hard left, to Marine Le Pen on the far right. His research was described by Trump as \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d and has been repeatedly boosted by Brazil\u2019s right-wing president, Bolsonaro.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what others think,\u201d he told his local newspaper La Provence. \u201cI\u2019m not an outsider, I\u2019m the one who is the furthest ahead.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When a resident dies in a Hallmark care home, they aren\u2019t alone \u2013 even if they have Covid-19. Hallmark is one of a number of care homes determined not to condemn their residents to virtual goodbyes or farewells through a window.</p> <p>It takes effort and innovation but Julie Rayner, compliance director and infection control lead at the medium-sized chain with homes across England and Wales, is determined that no family needs to be separated at the moment of death.</p> <p>\u201cWe ensure that families are supported to continue to visit if a resident is at the end of their life, no matter what their cause of death will be,\u201d she said. \u201cInfection control risks can be safely managed by identifying the safest route in and out of the home, checking the temperatures of those entering the home, handwashing and provision of PPE.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInfection control precautions are key,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have family members one at a time. They put on PPE equipment as soon as they enter the home and wash their hands. They\u2019re then escorted through the home and can stay with their loved one for 15 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cThey then change out of their PPE equipment and wash their hands in the resident\u2019s room. The old PPE equipment is left in the resident\u2019s room and a new set is put on. The new set is worn only until they reach the front door of the home, then they take it off and wash their hands again. We then go back along the route they took and clean everything, from the buttons to handrails to the inside of the lift, if they took it.\u201d</p> <p>Her comments came as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/families-to-be-allowed-to-say-goodbye-to-dying-relatives-in-care-homes\">proposals to allow people to be with relatives in care homes who are seriously ill with coronavirus</a> before they die so they can fulfil their \u201cright to say goodbye\u201d.</p> <p>Rayner isn\u2019t alone in her determination to take whatever meticulous care is needed to enable families to say a proper goodbye. Adam Purnell, the manager at Kepplegate, an independent home, has set aside a room near the entrance of the building for those needing end-of-life care to reduce traffic around the home. \u201cWe fill the room with all their personal items and photos,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSomething else we do is offer [to let] relatives move in. We are currently taking things on a person-by-person basis.\u201d</p> <p>But the quality director at a large UK chain said while they were \u201cworking hard to enable loved ones to keep in close contact with residents living with us\u201d, they increasingly found themselves \u201cpoliced by some family members and members of the local community when it comes to visits and PPE\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging time and so we focus, as we always do, on getting the balance right,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Raina Summerson, the chief executive of Agincare, a medium-sized care home provider, also finds the balance hard: \u201cLetting family to the bedside of residents is an incredibly difficult call to make for managers. They\u2019re scared of being accused of creating an outbreak or not managing it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have incorporated family members into the care home as part of our volunteer teams: they move into the home and care for their loved one as well as others in the home,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere possible, we have an end-of-life room by the front door, so family can visit without going through the rest of the home. Or we use ground-floor rooms with patios, so family don\u2019t have to go through the home at all to get to their relative\u2019s room.\u201d</p> <p>But she added: \u201cWe have found ourselves criticised by public and staff from other services and primary care for aiding people to come into the homes to spend time at end of life. One complaint, for example, was that it was a waste of PPE.\u201d</p> <p>Romaine Lawson, the operations manager at Apple House Care, a learning disability specialist group, said: \u201cWe have a general \u2018no visitors\u2019 idea across our homes but we operate by looking at each case on its own.</p> <p>\u201cWe involve the loved one, their family and the whole multidisciplinary team in any decision we make, which means we take the full responsibilities of decisions away from one single person. We all work together to protect each other, putting safety and their commitment to the work we do above personal needs.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Police have said crime has fallen by 28% since Britain was locked down to battle the coronavirus.</p> <p>Young people have been the biggest flouters of tough restrictions on gatherings, as the hot weather has led to defiance of emergency laws.</p> <p>In their most detailed picture yet of crime since laws came in to keep Britons apart, police also revealed that drug supply might be falling, with criminals posing as key workers to deal and targeting long supermarket queues to push drugs.</p> <p>The government rushed in emergency powers three weeks ago to enforce the lockdown, restricting when people could leave their homes and limiting gatherings to two people.</p> <p>Some mistakes have emerged as officers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/14/man-wrongly-convicted-under-coronavirus-law-met-police-admit\">struggled to apply the new laws</a>. Police on Wednesday admitted that 39 children had been wrongly fined for violations of restrictions. Police said those fines had been rescinded because the emergency laws do not allow them to fine those aged under 18.</p> <p>Falls in crime recorded by police in the four weeks up until 12 April included a 37% drop in burglary, a 27% drop in vehicle crime, serious assault and personal robbery. Reported rape offences fell by 37% and shoplifting fell by 54%, with non-essential stores closed.</p> <p>The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), which issued the figures, said forces in England and Wales had seen a 3% increase in reports of domestic violence and were braced for further rises. The rise picked up so far by police is smaller than that detected by charities.</p> <p>Police said there had been a 59% rise in reports of antisocial behaviour, which they believed was linked to reports about alleged breaches of the emergency laws.</p> <p>Enforcing the lockdown rules had led to more than 3,203 fines being issued, with one given to a person aged 100, but it was clear that most fines were being issued to the young.</p> <p>One-third of fines were issued to those aged 18-24, with another third to those aged 25-34.</p> <p>Deputy chief constable Sara Glen, from the NPCC team working on the coronavirus, said younger Britons were the group struggling most to stick to the lockdown rules: \u201cIf we have good weather people naturally want to be outside. So, this is something which is a real challenge to us with our demographics in counties where they\u2019ve got a younger population who want to party, who want to have barbecues, who want to be outside when it\u2019s good weather.\u201d</p> <p>Police stressed that the vast majority were obeying laws in the first place and that they had had more than 100,000 \u201cchats\u201d with people they suspected were breaking them, with the vast majority complying or not needing to have the emergency laws used against them.</p> <p>Some police forces appeared from data issued by the NPCC to be issuing fines more frequently than others. Lancashire issued 380 fines, possibly linked to having popular sites such as Blackpool, while Humberside only issued two fines. Hot weather played a part, police believe, in 424 fines being issued last Saturday to those flouting the rules to enjoy the sunshine over the long Easter bank holiday. But by Monday, as the weather cooled, only 177 fines were issued.</p> <p>Serious and organised crime was also adapting, said Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency.</p> <p>She said a van driver had been caught on Tuesday near Calais with face masks concealing 14kg of cocaine. With British streets empty, drug dealers were posing as key workers to offer their commodities and even targeting long queues snaking around supermarket car parks to try to deal drugs, the woman in charge of fighting serious and organised crime said.</p> <p>\u201cThey are having to find new ways of working and new networks,\u201d Owens said.</p> <p>\u201cDrug dealers moving illicit drugs are concerned about greater scrutiny as they recognise that, with less people on the streets, they are more visible.<br> Of course, they will be looking at different opportunities, wearing high-vis clothing so they start to look like key workers, deploying or dealing from supermarket car parks where there may be more people around.\u201d</p> <p>The NPCC chair, Martin Hewitt, said some mistakes had been made, but they were few and understandable given that officers were under pressure, trying to enact laws restricting people\u2019s usually lawful behaviour in a way they had never had to before: \u201cOf course there have been mistakes and I think we have been very quick to come forward when we have made mistakes.</p> <p>\u201cBut I would like to think that the public would have some recognition of the fact that this is legislation that came in at high speed a few weeks ago, is highly, highly unusual and we are having to adapt to that across the whole of the service.\u201d</p>",

Forsyth writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The thinking is that a delay would not solve the fundamental policy problems and that a deal is either possible or not. Another factor, I understand, is that the government worries about the cost of any extension. There is concern that extending could drag the UK into the arguments about who pays for the various EU schemes designed to protect the European economy and preserve the eurozone. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Government sources are saying this afternoon that, when <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser, spoke to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier today about the next round of the Brexit talks, he stressed that the UK does not intend to ask for an extension.</p> \n  <p>However, Forsyth also floats the possibility that the EU could request an extension, not the UK. \u201cIf the EU did ask for more time, it would put the government in a difficult position,\u201d Forsyth writes. \u201cRejecting the request would sit ill with the idea that the UK wants to be a good neighbour to the EU.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under the withdrawal agreement the transition can be extended for one year or two years if both sides agree before 1 July. However the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act says UK ministers are not allowed to agree to an extension. For the government to allow an extension, it would have to pass legislation amending the act.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344/473_20_2298_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Frost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Frost.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e971f448f0895d83068e8f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T15:13:42.826Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Turning away from coronavirus for a moment, <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary, has used <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/04/unite-behind-keir-starmer-to-cleanse-labours-shame/\">an article for LabourList</a> to urge Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, to publish a redacted version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/labour-leader-sir-kier-starmer-orders-urgent-review-leaked-antisemitism-report\">the internal party report leaked at the weekend</a> that showed how hostile some party officials were to Jeremy Corbyn.

With the help of his reckless buddy Gerry (Frederick Lau), and Gerry\u2019s unscrupulous schoolfriend Nicole (Janina Uhse), who works in a bank, Viktor figures out a way to scam the Berlin property market. He will buy derelict flats at auction and sell them on, illegally, in the 10-day grace period before the debt becomes due, to people to whom Nicole (also illegally) can offer cheap mortgages. Inevitably, they become very rich, very quickly. Viktor and Nicole get married, and there are the traditional slo-mo party montages of champagne, cocaine, sex workers and generally letting the good times roll.</p> <p>As the law begins to catch up with them, Viktor doubles down on the problem by borrowing more and more, and eventually establishes his own private bank in Malta. It\u2019s a bit like a Brit geezer-caper film in some ways, and, like so many of those, sounds as though it is based on a hundred urban myths and friend-of-a-friend anecdotes. What makes it more than just that is Kross, whose face is getting more interesting as he ages: with his close-set eyes and chiselled jawline, there is something faintly unsettling about his boyish good looks.He is also rather good at suggesting the specious charm and compulsive behaviour of the addict. The film\u2019s plausibility-level isn\u2019t perhaps as high as all that (it really works best as a period piece from the pre-2008 crash) but Kross brings to it a jaded, corrupted glamour.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81058432\">Rising High</a> is available on Netflix on 17 April.</p>",

  "<p>Matt Hancock has announced new proposals to allow people to be with relatives in care homes who are gravely ill with coronavirus before they die, so that they can fulfil their \u201cright to say goodbye\u201d.</p> <p>But the care sector responded with caution to the promise, saying that far more PPE (personal protective equipment) than is currently available would be needed to make the health secretary\u2019s pledge possible.</p> <p>Revised guidance for the care home sector, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879639/covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan.pdf\">published on Wednesday</a>, says that while homes should limit unnecessary visits, \u201cwe are clear that visits at the end of life are important both for the individual and their loved ones and should continue\u201d.</p> <p>The initiative follows a long series of reports about care homes going into effective lockdown, with relatives forced to say goodbye to loved ones through windows, by phone, or by letters read out by a care worker in protective clothing.</p> <p>In one care home in Buckinghamshire, the wife of a dying man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/we-havent-had-time-to-grieve-care-homes-struggle-as-covid-19-deaths-rise\">passed some of her perfume through to a care worker</a> to place under her husband\u2019s chin to evoke a final memory.

Some sites will have to make the decision about whether there is a risk to others in the home. If they provide much higher levels of PPE, that should make it possible.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Hancock said the revised guidelines had been drawn up with Public Health England and the care sector \u201cso we can limit the risk of infection while, wherever possible, giving people\u2019s closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye\u201d.</p> <p>The new guidelines relate only to care homes. For hospitals, <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/C0030_Visitor-Guidance_8-April-2020.pdf\">existing NHS England guidance</a>, last updated a week ago, says that during the pandemic, one immediate family member or carer can visit if the person \u201cis receiving end-of-life care\u201d, a category which includes patients who are critically ill with the coronavirus.</p> <p>The health secretary used the press conference to repeatedly praise carers for the role they had played in the crisis and showed a carers\u2019 badge, intended to provide the same discounts and advantages given by some businesses to NHS staff.</p> <p>He praised the work of care home staff in providing occupants with \u201cdignity at end of lives\u201d, but said this work had been hampered by the coronavirus. Hancock said this would be changed so that, \u201cwherever possible\u201d, loved ones could say goodbye.</p> <p>\u201cWanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts and it\u2019s a moment that will be with you forever,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cDone right, it can help those left behind to cope and it brings comfort to those who are dying.</p> <p>\u201cCoronavirus, of course, has made this much more difficult, and I\u2019ve been really moved and upset by some of the heartbreaking stories of people dying without a loved one nearby.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock cited the example of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\">Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab</a>, a 13-year-old boy who died in hospital without any family members present.</p> <p>\u201cAs a father of a 13-year-old myself, the reports of Ismail, dying aged 13 without a parent at his bedside, made me weep,\u201d Hancock said.</p> <p>Hancock also pledged an end to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/uk-healthcare-regulator-brands-resuscitation-strategy-unacceptable\">the occasional practice</a> of older care home residents being categorised as a group as not requiring resuscitation, without consultation with their families.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019re making it crystal clear that it is unacceptable for advanced care plans, including \u2018do not attempt to resuscitate\u2019 orders, to be applied in a blanket fashion to any group of people. This must always be a personalised process.\u201d</p> <p>The updated 34-page guidance for care homes stresses this message on mass do-not-resuscitate orders, also covering areas such as how to limit infection, caring for staff and funding options.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universities\">university</a> students have signed up to a rent strike in protest at having to pay thousands of pounds for accommodation where they have become trapped as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Many have complained they are stuck on near-deserted campuses where facilities and services have closed. Others say they cannot afford to pay because they have lost jobs vital to fund their living costs during their studies.</p> <p>Among those caught up in the lockdown are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/internationalstudents\">international students</a> from countries across the globe, including China, Japan, Pakistan, India and the US, who are stranded thousands of miles away from their families.</p> <p>\u201cWe are stuck between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Jamsheed Cooper, a 27-year-old masters student, who is stranded in his \u00a3650-a-month student accommodation on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofsussex\">Sussex University</a> campus, unable to get home to Dubai.

We hope that our students know we will continue to do everything we can to respond to their needs.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, students living in privately owned accommodation are finding themselves tied into tenancy agreements costing thousands of pounds, even though many have travelled home to be with their families during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>Students at the University of Warwick have also started a rent strike. While the university has waived rent and cancelled contracts for students renting on campus, many of those renting off-campus from private landlords are still obliged to pay, though many of the rentals will have been arranged via the university\u2019s property management agency.

The transition period \u2013 which keeps the UK in the EU single market and customs union without voting rights \u2013 can be prolonged for up to two years, but only once.</p> <p>As the clock ticks down, EU diplomats are dismayed the UK has failed to produce a draft legal text on fisheries, despite a goal to agree on fishing rights covering 100 shared species by 1 July.</p> <p>The absence of a UK text is perceived as an attempt by the British to gain the upper hand by attempting to delay difficult issues until the last minute. EU sources insist there will be no agreement on anything without a deal on fish.</p> <p>The two sides have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/01/brexit-what-are-the-key-flashpoints-as-eu-uk-trade-talks-begin\">not narrowed their differences on any of the major sticking points</a>, such as agreement on common environmental, social and competition law standards for free trade, or the role of the European court of justice.</p> <p>Last Friday the UK handed two legal texts to the EU, covering energy and law enforcement, adding to previous documents sent to Brussels, which cover trade, air safety, air transport and civil nuclear.</p> <p>The British have irritated EU diplomats by denying Barnier permission to share these texts with national capitals. That means the 27 EU member states, who will make the ultimate decision on the terms of the future relationship, are relying on analysis and summaries from Barnier and his negotiating team, rather than the original documents.</p> <p>The commission has <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/200318-draft-agreement-gen.pdf\">published its 440-page draft legal text online</a>, reflecting its longstanding Brexit transparency policy \u2013 and the reality that documents rarely remain secret for long in Brussels.</p>",

She intends to allege that audio evidence may have been altered before it was presented to the jury.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking to them and meeting them, I just know that they did not do it,\u201d said Friedman, confirming the paperwork associated with the case will be filed this summer with hopes for a hearing at the end of the year. \u201cI just feel very sorry for them.\u201d</p> <p>The couple, portrayed on ITV\u2019s hit mini-series Quiz which aired this week, achieved infamy in 2003 after they were found guilty of conning their way to win \u00a31m on what was one of the country\u2019s most popular gameshows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c420f814ff1e0150b6764cf45016c91466198c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c420f814ff1e0150b6764cf45016c91466198c1/26_39_1023_613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tecwen Whittock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tecwen Whittock arriving at Southwark crown court in London in March 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Green/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The programme\u2019s producers were immediately suspicious of how the serving army major won the prize and reported him to the police. The prosecution successfully argued that they \u201cprocured the execution of a valuable security by deception\u201d by colluding with Welsh lecturer Tecwen Whittock, who coughed at crucial moments to guide Charles Ingram to the enormous cash prize.</p> <p>Friedman described Ingram as an intense, emotional man whose \u201cwild and eccentric\u201d character could have been mistaken by the show\u2019s producers for suspicious behaviour: \u201cThe performance he gave that everyone found remarkable is pretty much how I experienced Charles.\u201d</p> <p>Friedman, co-founder of<a href=\"http://www.commons.legal/\"> Commons, the not-for-profit criminal law firm</a>, took on the case after being approached by the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/may/11/bob-woffinden-obituary\">investigative journalist Bob Woffinden</a>, who dedicated his life to overturning miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>She said modern improvements in audio analysis mean it was possible to identify individual coughs from the audience, which cast doubt on the idea Whittock\u2019s wheezing helped win the competition \u2013 and encouraged fans of the TV show to sign up to a <a href=\"http://ingramsappeal.org/\">new site for those following the case</a>.</p> <p>The couple\u2019s appeal will also claim that audio on the recording played to the jury was edited, giving the \u201copportunity to question the integrity of the evidence\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThere are some really weird anomalies. There are some glaring omissions. You\u2019ve got different microphones picking up different people. There are inconsistencies between what is on one tape and another.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea is that Charles was primed to appear on TV for the first time ever, in front of millions of people, knowing that he was going to be cheating, with a guy sitting behind him that he hasn\u2019t met coughing to indicate an answer, without giving any reaction. It would have been the performance of a lifetime and he\u2019s not capable of it.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to his public image as an aloof former British Army officer, Charles Ingram now maintains a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gallantfive\">vocal Twitter account</a> which he has used to campaign against Brexit, criticise the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and talked about his hope that Keir Starmer can revive the fortunes of the Labour party.</p> <p>In recent days he has shared his reminiscences about the show, saying that Diana has taken to calling him \u201cMatthew\u201d in reference to actor Matthew Macfadyen who plays him in Quiz.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> has endorsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, the third major endorsement for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in as many days as the party comes together in the run-up to the November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">general election</a>.</p> \n<p>Warren <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/05/elizabeth-warren-quitting-2020-democratic-presidential-race\">exited</a> the race last month after a disappointing showing on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday\">Super Tuesday</a>, where she finished third in primary voting in her home state of Massachusetts. As other former rivals quickly aligned behind Biden, most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a>, Warren waited, declining to immediately throw her support behind him or Bernie Sanders, an ideological ally.</p> \n<p>Sanders ended his campaign last week and endorsed Biden on Monday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>, who remained publicly neutral during the primary, endorsed Biden on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cJoe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence, and heart will save lives and save livelihoods,\u201d Warren wrote in a fundraising email sent to donors on Biden\u2019s behalf.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American,\u201d she added, in a strong statement amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>Warren was the last of Biden\u2019s major opponents to endorse him and her support helps the party present a united front against Trump as it prepares for what will probably be a historically divisive general election.</p> \n<p>Unlike in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a>, when the Democratic primary race extended late into the summer, the process of choosing the party\u2019s nominee was relatively short, despite a record field. Though Biden likely won\u2019t accumulate enough delegates to officially claim the nomination until June, he started to build an insurmountable lead in early March and within weeks was the party\u2019s presumptive standard-bearer.</p> \n<p>The swift backing of his rivals will help ease the often-fraught process of bringing the party together after a hard-fought primary.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/democratic-primary-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020\">The Democratic primary was a wild, unpredictable ride \u2013 except the result</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Her endorsement comes as speculation builds around who Biden will choose as a running mate. Biden has been unusually forthcoming in discussing his search, vowing to choose a woman and many party leaders are urging him to consider his former rivals, Warren among them.</p> \n<p>Warren was the last major female candidate in a historic field of Democratic women and her demise led to vocal calls for Biden to choose a woman. Some of the party\u2019s more liberal members believe choosing Warren would help Biden appeal to progressives and young voters who remain deeply skeptical of his campaign.</p> \n<p>In her endorsement, Warren sought notes of unity, assuring liberal supporters that Biden is listening.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you disagree, he\u2019ll listen \u2013 not just listen, but really hear you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd treat you with respect, no matter where you\u2019re coming from. And he has shown throughout this campaign that when you come with new facts or a good argument, he\u2019s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a email to her supporters, Biden said bluntly: \u201cYou\u2019re needed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former vice president assured them that he, too, intended to fight for the \u201cbig, structural change\u201d that Warren championed and insisted that he is looking forward and \u201cnot trying to take us back to a country that never existed.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI know, for some of you, that you might be skeptical of me or my campaign. I understand that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I intend to earn your votes. And I intend to earn your trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an early overture to progressive voters, Biden adopted Warren\u2019s plan to overhaul the bankruptcy system, an issue over which they had clashed more than a decade ago, when she was a Harvard law professor and he was a senator from Delaware. The plan would roll back key provisions of a 2005 bankruptcy law Biden supported and Warren vocally opposed, even testifying against it before his committee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec64ff6d-a5cb-4878-828d-bd6da8ce367e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4yCY232AZ_8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the email to donors, Warren recalled being sworn in to the Senate in 2013. As vice-president, he presided over the swearing in ceremony.</p> \n<p>\u201cJoe Biden was there the very moment I became a senator \u2013 he swore me in,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd when he did, he said, \u201cYou gave me hell! And you\u2019re gonna do a great job.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden, 77, said he would create a committee to help him vet possible running mates by the end of the month. The selection process, which is typically shrouded in secrecy, will include between six and a dozen candidates, all women, and he will make his choice before the Democratic convention in Milwaukee, which was postponed to August because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>If elected, Biden\u2019s running mate would be the first female vice-president in history. Only two women have ever been chosen as running mates: the Alaska governor Sarah Palin in 2008 and the New York congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.</p> \n<p>Biden has spoken on several occasions about the partnership that he shared with Obama as his vice-president and has told donors and voters that he is seeking a similar dynamic with his future running mate, who he believes should complement his experience.</p> \n<p>At a virtual fundraising event earlier this month, Biden said: \u201cI\u2019m going to need a woman vice-president who has capacities, has strengths where I have weaknesses.\u201d</p>",

She added: \u201cThe move to testing all symptomatic cases is not going to change clinical management, but we recognise that there is a feeling from families and staff that they wanted that certainty.\u201d</p> <p>Amid concerns about the virus spreading from hospitals to care settings, Sturgeon admitted that not all patients discharged to care homes are currently tested for Covid-19, citing the danger of false negative tests, while her health secretary, Jeane Freeman, was unable to give figures on those discharged to care homes at the start of the outbreak to free up hospital bed capacity.</p> <p>Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, the main umbrella body for the sector, described the death figures as \u201cimmensely sad and distressing\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Macaskill launched a bereavement charter, offering principles and support with the express aim of helping Scotland grieve during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Planned before the outbreak, the charter emphasises that bereavement and grieving can be experienced by the whole community and not just individuals, and calls for an \u201copen culture \u2026 where grief and death are recognised as a natural part of life\u201d.</p> <p>Macaskill said that those working closely with the sick and the vulnerable would require particular support. \u201cI do have great concerns about the mental health of care staff, who often have very close relationships with those they care for.

And now, all three men, along with several others freed by the organization and its network chapters, are reflecting on their stories in the Innocence Files, a new Netflix series which weaves individual cases of wrongful conviction into a damning portrait of America\u2019s unforgiving, corrupt and frighteningly unreliable criminal justice system.</p> <p>The series is broken into three sections, according to the three predominant causes of wrongful incarceration: misuse of forensic evidence (or, more simply: junk science), false eyewitness testimony and prosecutorial misconduct. Over nine hours, the series illustrates through a pattern of individual cases how false convictions are not an aberration but a natural result of the system as designed; since 1989, there have been <a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/Exonerations-in-the-United-States-Map.aspx\">2,578 exonerations in the US</a>. \u201cBy and large, we have an adversarial legal system where the whole idea is to win, and each side stepping up the plate against each other,\u201d said Alex Gibney, an executive producer who directed an episode on prosecutorial misconduct. \u201cThe problem becomes that it becomes all about winning rather than finding the truth or real justice.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdvy14fdjj8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cdvy14fdjj8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The first section of episodes focuses on junk science and the so-called \u201cCSI effect\u201d \u2013 the mistaken belief that forensic sciences, such as bite-mark analysis and blood-spatter projections are airtight rather than unproven hobbies. Nearly half of the Innocence Project\u2019s cases involve misapplied forensics, says Neufeld in the series. This includes Brewer, who was convicted for rape and murder of a three-year-old just two years after a near identical crime in the same county sent another innocent black man, Levon Brooks, to prison, based almost solely on bite-mark evidence. Roger Ross Williams, the director of these three episodes (and also an executive producer), traveled to Noxubee county, Mississippi, to interview the \u201cexpert witness\u201d who put Brewer on death row: Dr Michael West, a self-proclaimed \u201cforensic odontologist\u201d with a penchant for Confederate flag shot glasses.</p> <p>Brooks and Brewer\u2019s cases were among the first to alert the Innocence Project, back in the mid-2000s, to the prevalence of life-sentence convictions based on junk science (the \u201cbite marks\u201d that sent both prison, it turns out, were likely made from crayfish, as both victims were left in bodies of water). And yet, according to the series, bite-mark evidence is still admissible in all 50 states. \u201cHow can something be debunked and still admissible?\u201d asked Williams. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a can of worms. If states actually had to throw out bite-mark evidence, then they would have a duty to correct, and that would be a huge problem for these criminal justice systems.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eee3f475072e0b7b0b8de67efdcc76ab574a739e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eee3f475072e0b7b0b8de67efdcc76ab574a739e/0_0_3840_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Gibney: \u2018By and large, we have an adversarial legal system where the whole idea is to win, and each side stepping up the plate against each other.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Gibney: \u2018By and large, we have an adversarial legal system where the whole idea is to win, and each side stepping up the plate against each other.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even more entrenched in America\u2019s criminal justice machine is the use of witness testimony, despite ever-mounting <a href=\"https://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/resources/Documents/Scientific_Review_Paper/APLS%20Scientific%20Review%20Paper%20initial%20draft%20July%2030%202018.pdf\">evidence of human memory\u2019s fallibility.</a> \u201cIt\u2019s so counterintuitive for people to wrap their heads around,\u201d said Liz Garbus, an executive producer who directed the eyewitness episode titled Making Memory. \u201cEven the most well-intentioned, conscientious witness or victim can end up believing something so surely, down to their core, that is in fact not true.\u201d</p> <p>Garbus focused on the case of <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/cases/thomas-haynesworth/\">Thomas Haynesworth</a>, who was arrested in 1984 at age 18 while walking to the store because a sexual assault victim identified him; other victims confirmed his identity when presented with a leading photo lineup. The faith in the victims\u2019 eyewitness testimony overcame other inconsistencies in the case \u2013 there was no forensic evidence, and Haynesworth was several inches shorter than the attacker\u2019s description \u2013 and he was <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/cases/thomas-haynesworth/\">sentenced to 74 years in prison.</a> He served 27 years before DNA evidence fully exonerated him in 2011.</p> <p>Like Haynesworth, Carrillo was convicted for his \u201ccrime\u201d \u2013 a drive-by shooting of a beloved father in January 1991 \u2013 based solely on witness testimony. The Innocence Files traces how Carrillo\u2019s case epitomizes another fallibility of witness testimony: its ability to be manipulated by law enforcement with ulterior motives. Carrillo, then 16, was a de facto member of the Young Crowd, a Latino LA gang at odds with the majority-black gang to which witnesses of the crime belonged. The sheriff\u2019s department, eager to stem gang violence and make arrests (and, as the series explains, involved in inter-law enforcement gang-like activity, as well) led one witness to pick Carrillo as the shooter, who then convinced his four friends. Even when the original witness recanted on the eve of Carrillo\u2019s second trial, the prosecution proceeded. Carrillo served 22 years before all four remaining witnesses, forced to revisit their assumptions by a lawyer from the Innocence Project, recanted their testimony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0644947c3eb45416d2c87cc63b1b6c814d1b3184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0644947c3eb45416d2c87cc63b1b6c814d1b3184/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Innocence Files\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Garbus: \u2018Even the most well-intentioned, conscientious witness or victim can end up believing something so surely, down to their core, that is in fact not true.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Carrillo\u2019s case, prosecutors and sheriffs fought until the end to uphold their conviction \u2013 a theme running throughout most of the cases that all three producers pointed to as indicative of system that incentivizes winning over truth and justice. \u201cWhen the end justifies the means, it can lead to terrible things, because you assume that you\u2019ve got the bad guy somehow, and so you\u2019re going to use whatever dirty means you can in order to get there,\u201d said Gibney.</p> <p>Gibney focused on Hollman\u2019s case, in which prosecutors withheld evidence \u2013 the relevant criminal history of the one witness to identify him \u2013 that could have proven his innocence. Coerced confession, withheld evidence and witness coaching are staples of prosecutorial misconduct, that \u201ccan\u2019t be corrected because the system doesn\u2019t allow for them to be corrected\u201d, said Gibney. A recanted confession, for example, will can a witness\u2019s credibility, thus prosecutors uphold the conviction. \u201cIt\u2019s an ironclad example of how corruption is engendered by the system,\u201d said Gibney.</p> <p>Ultimately, the series depicts a vindictive, intransigent system resistant to corrections, oriented more toward the performance of an argument and the need to secure blame thorough convictions. The pace of change is agonizingly slow; the average time it takes for one Innocence Project case, according to one lawyer in the series, is five years. Through first-person testimony and effective use of photos and memories, the show attempts to explained the lost-years experience of exonerated people, though the prospect of spending even a month, let alone decades, behind bars for a false conviction feels impossible to imagine.</p> <p>Less impossible are the fixes proposed by the series <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/reform/\">and the Innocence Project</a> to ensure fewer miscarriages of justice, such as: <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/lasting-impact-of-2009-nas-report/\">stricter standards for forensic evidence</a>, decreased reliance on witness testimony alone, and accountability measures for prosecutors for withholding evidence and other misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the hope lies in the fact that we understand how to fix it,\u201d said Garbus. \u201cWe know how to do good lineups, we know that there should be prosecutorial oversight, we know good and bad science. We have the means to fix it; it\u2019s about the will.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The Innocence Project is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Lockdown <em>could</em> have seen us wallowing in some pretty unusual hermetic behaviour. Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.</p> <p>Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us <em>more</em> connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we\u2019re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent <a href=\"https://www.channelmum.com/a/the-positive-side-of-coronavirus\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.</p> <p>Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it\u2019s quarantine quizzes, online <em>aperitivo</em> or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we\u2019re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here\u2019s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.</p> <h2><strong>Have cyber happy hour with your friends</strong></h2> <p>The shutters might be closed on the nation\u2019s pubs, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of cr\u00e8me de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there\u2019s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.</p> <p><strong>Online rendezvous:</strong> <a href=\"http://theredonlion.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Red (On)Lion</a>: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

  "<p>With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we\u2019re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from \u201cnice to have\u201d to the lifeline between us and the outside world.</p> <p>For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar \u2026</p> <p><strong>Rosie: \u2018I haven\u2019t seen my son in four weeks\u2019 </strong><br>\u201cDropping my son off with his father without knowing when I\u2019m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn\u2019t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old; he\u2019s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment \u2013 to hell with it all.</p> <p>\u201cI have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I\u2019ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been four weeks already, which is the longest I\u2019ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well \u2013 I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he\u2019ll hug the phone he\u2019s using.</p> <p>\u201cHe recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he\u2019s being \u2018independent\u2019. He\u2019s learned quite a few new words \u2013 I\u2019m really proud of him. He\u2019s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we\u2019re reunited.</p> <p>\u201cWe talk at breakfast and dinner \u2013 it\u2019s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve also had some family group calls \u2013 we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!\u201d<br><br><strong>Leo: \u2018I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill\u2019<br></strong>\u201cWhen I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.</p> <p>\u201cAs the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn\u2019t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I\u2019m used to seeing her every few days.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.</p> <p>\u201cMy symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it\u2019s best that she stays at her mum\u2019s until I\u2019m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don\u2019t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn\u2019t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been very hard to be away from her; especially because we don\u2019t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven\u2019t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.</p> <p>\u201cLoneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.</p> <p>\u201cWe chat about what we\u2019re doing, laugh about how mad we\u2019re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mark: \u2018We haven\u2019t told my daughter I\u2019m back in the UK yet\u2019<br></strong>\u201cI travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family \u2013 but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn\u2019t be stranded.</p> <p>\u201cAfter discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn\u2019t come straight back to the family home and \u2013 as a precaution \u2013 I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/apr/15/need-help-with-home-schooling-12-of-the-best-apps-if-youre-teaching-kids-in-lockdown\">Need help with home schooling? 12 of the best apps if you\u2019re teaching kids in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHowever, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn\u2019t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she\u2019s been scared of things she\u2019s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn\u2019t want to worry her even more.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I\u2019m away, and it\u2019s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she\u2019s coping and reassure her that I\u2019ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we\u2019ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnected<br></strong>We know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.</em></p> <p><em>That\u2019s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

  "<h2><strong>What is the World Health Organi</strong><strong>zation\u2019s remit?</strong></h2> \n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded as the UN global health body in 1948 in the aftermath of the second world war with a mandate to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/what-we-do\">promote global health,</a> protect against infectious disease and to serve the vulnerable. It was inspired by the international sanitary conferences of the 19th century set up to combat communicable diseases such as cholera, yellow fever and plague.</p> \n<p>Its current programme envisages expanding universal healthcare to a billion more people, protecting another billion from health emergencies and providing a further billion people with better health and wellbeing. </p> \n<h2><strong>What does that involve?</strong></h2> \n<p>In practical terms, the badly underfunded WHO acts as a clearing house for investigation, data and technical recommendations on emerging disease threats such as the coronavirus and Ebola. It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.</p> \n<p>While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world with its more resilient healthcare systems, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes. Its 2018-9 budget was $4.8bn, which became $5.7bn when emergencies were included.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is the WHO under fire from Trump?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump has presented the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/against-humanity-trump-condemned-for-who-funding-freeze\">freezing of US funding to the WHO</a> as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. But the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/10/trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus-state-department-usaid-budget-cuts/\">when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution,</a> about $400m annually, by half as part of $3bn cuts to US global health funding across the board.</p> \n<p>The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b547ab04-9a4f-4f6c-8c17-c8f14a632205\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6JIA8iBw1-w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The allegation by Trump and his supporters that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. WHO technical guidance issued in early January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\">was warning of the risk of human-to-human transmission</a> and the organisation declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern a day before Trump announced his partial ban on flights from China.</p> \n<p>Instead, it appears Trump is following a familiar playbook: finding others to blame amid his own handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has included calling it the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d, blaming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/donald-trump-obama-administration-coronavirus\">the previous Obama administration</a> and taking aim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/trump-states-governors-clashes\">at state governors</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How does the WHO\u2019s performance in the coronavirus crisis compare </strong><strong>with the </strong><strong>2014</strong><strong>-15 Ebola outbreak?</strong></h2> \n<p>The WHO, under the then-director general, Margaret Chan, was savaged from all sides for responding so slowly to an Ebola outbreak that began in a remote forested part of Guinea where the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia were virtually non-existent. By the time the WHO acted, six months late, it had reached the dense cities.</p> \n<p>The fallout for the WHO was serious and undermined its credibility. US critics suggested scrapping it and setting up a new global public health body, although the idea did not take off and President Obama did not support it. An independent report commissioned by Chan said the WHO\u2019s funding was inadequate and governments had not increased their contributions in years. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the current director general, and all other candidates for the role after Chan stood down pledged to reform its governance and funding.</p> \n<p>Most health experts agree the organisation under Tedros has performed much better over the coronavirus.</p> \n<h2><br><strong>How big an impact will the US funding cuts have?</strong></h2> \n<p>While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 the potential for a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.</p> \n<p>Even before the Trump announcement, the organisation was looking at potential cuts to already underfunded programming. Such impacts could be felt in programmes already complicated by the coronavirus, such as vaccination for communicable diseases and in building up early warning systems and resilience to deal with diseases such as Ebola in African countries.</p> \n<p>Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, called Trump\u2019s decision extremely problematic, noting that the WHO was leading efforts to help developing countries fight the spread of Covid-19. \u201cThis is the agency that\u2019s looking out for other countries and leading efforts to stop the pandemic. This is exactly the time when they need more funding, not less,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2><strong>What other impacts will there be?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump\u2019s assault on the reliability of WHO data and early warning systems, in pursuit of his own agenda against China, threatens its leadership role. While global health diplomacy is a balancing act when dealing with countries like China, which have a poor record on freedom of speech, transparency and human rights, the information provided to health officials by the WHO is designed to be scientifically and clinically useful in the control of the spread of disease.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street has distanced the UK from Donald Trump\u2019s targeting of China over the coronavirus outbreak, amid wider government concern that a focus on accusations that Beijing covered up the start of the pandemic could hamper international cooperation to bring it under control.</p> <p>It comes after Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/against-humanity-trump-condemned-for-who-funding-freeze\">prompted international condemnation</a> by suspending US funding for the World Health Organization over what he said was a \u201cChina-centric\u201d failure by the body to investigate reports about the outbreak of the virus in Wuhan.</p> <p>While support for Trump\u2019s actions in the UK have been limited to habitual supporters of the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1250196021612875776\">such as Nigel Farage</a>, on Wednesday both Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, and Sir John Sawyers, the former diplomat and MI6 chief, said there should be an assessment of whether China concealed information.</p> <p>Asked about Trump\u2019s decision, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cOur position is that the UK has no plans to stop funding the WHO, which has an important role to play in leading the global health response. Coronavirus is a global challenge and it\u2019s essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if this meant No 10 was disappointed by the president\u2019s move, the spokesman said: \u201cI can only set out the UK\u2019s position and that is we have no plans to stop funding the WHO.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking earlier to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February, said that while he did not endorse Trump\u2019s actions over the WHO \u2013 \u201cNow is not the time,\u201d he said \u2013 there was a need to consider China\u2019s role in the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cI think one of the lessons to learn from this, when we are past the worst of the crisis, is that we are going to have to look carefully into \u2026 was China providing the right information to us, and to the WHO, and to others,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cChina, for example, didn\u2019t even admit to human-to-human transmission until some time in January, which was very late in the day. I think it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask, what they knew, when, and how that could have made a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Also speaking to Today, Sawers, who was also the UK representative to the UN, said there was \u201cdeep anger in America at what they see as having been inflicted on us all by China\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cChina is evading a good deal of responsibility for the origin of the virus, for failing to deal with it initially. At the same time we can\u2019t find a way out of this without working with China. So it\u2019s going to be a complex set of issues we\u2019re going to have to work with, and the world will not be the same after the virus as it was before.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Ministers are understood to be keeping an open mind over the Chinese government\u2019s actions at the start of the pandemic, and Downing Street has repeatedly called for \u201ctransparency\u201d from all countries facing the virus, a clear nod towards the fact that Beijing has been far from open about both the origin of coronavirus and its spread in the country.</p> <p>However, there is a keenness to avoid any tensions that could jeopardise international cooperation over efforts to tackle the pandemic, with an emphasis on pragmatic politics for now.</p> <p>A government source said: \u201cWe have one overriding focus now, which is getting a grip of the crisis and defeating the virus. Even if they hold very strong views on what might or might not have happened, the people who are calling for action have to explain: why now, and what will it achieve?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIt will take time to emerge from the challenges we all face,\u201d the BBC\u2019s director general Tony Hall <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fmediacentre%2Flatestnews%2F2020%2Fbbc-keeping-nation-informed-educated-entertained&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ct.mills%40aston.ac.uk%7Cae77e6b1255d40c40caf08d7e0692d92%7Ca085950c4c2544d5945ab852fa44a221%7C0%7C0%7C637224614668358420&amp;sdata=1Zf3gIwwOeHz0Ku6M02tODMQM7AzFR4azaXrtGfFo%2Fw%3D&amp;reserved=0\">said</a> last month, \u201cbut the BBC will be there for the public all the way through \u2026 As the national broadcaster, the BBC has a special role to play at this time of national need.\u201d But what kind of role should and does such an organisation play during a public health crisis? </p> <p>The term used by Hall to describe the BBC \u2013 the \u201cnational broadcaster\u201d \u2013 appears nowhere in its editorial guidelines or its royal charter, both of which appeal to the public rather than the nation. Yet it has featured in a number of the director general\u2019s statements in recent years. He has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2017/tony-hall-roscoe\">compared</a> the BBC to the military, the monarchy and the NHS, emphasising its indispensability to political and cultural life. These appeals didn\u2019t seem to win the BBC many friends in the corridors of power, but the Covid-19 pandemic has given the broadcaster a renewed sense of purpose, just as its legitimacy crisis was deepening and its relationship with the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/16/no-10-launches-attack-on-bbc-as-licence-fee-comes-under-threat\">reached a nadir</a>.</p> <p>Hall\u2019s soft nationalism is well suited to crisis management, resonating with popular ideas of British people keeping calm and carrying on. It is also ingrained in the BBC\u2019s history and institutional DNA, and is arguably inherent in the very medium of mass broadcasting that the BBC pioneered. Scholars of broadcasting, and indeed executives of the BBC, have noted the way in which the organisation has acted as \u201csocial cement\u201d since the 1920s, fostering a shared sense of communality through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/royal-wedding-confirmed-as-years-biggest-uk-tv-event\">royal occasions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48912587\">sporting events</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35225240\">popular dramas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/15/bridget-christie-last-night-of-the-proms-jamie-barton-laura-mvula\">concerts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/01/glastonbury-bbc-6music\">festivals</a>.</p> <p>Digital competitors may have eroded some of this, but it still comes naturally enough to the BBC. In response to the television production standstill, the BBC recently <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fmediacentre%2Flatestnews%2F2020%2Fcoronavirus-sport&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ct.mills%40aston.ac.uk%7Cae77e6b1255d40c40caf08d7e0692d92%7Ca085950c4c2544d5945ab852fa44a221%7C0%7C0%7C637224614668368419&amp;sdata=tnoCUsG9pn5v7Euvr0SpDkS95S4WXDQAV2Kb97p4IPI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">announced</a> a package of sporting events from the archive intended to \u201cunite the nation\u201d, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">2012 London Olympics</a>, with its famous opening ceremony (\u201ca spectacle that celebrated all that is great about Great Britain\u201d).</p> <p>This might seem harmless enough under the circumstances, but the rhetoric of \u201cthe national broadcaster\u201d also implies, however obliquely, a responsibility to display reverence towards authority and maintain a close relationship with officialdom and the state. Such an approach has historical precedent. Ever since the general strike of 1926 \u2013 when the BBC maintained its \u201cindependence\u201d in return for making no genuine effort to exercise impartiality, taking the side of the government over the workers \u2013 there has been no clear line drawn between it being a state, national or public broadcaster. The BBC has occupied a grey area between authentic independence and direct state control.</p> <p>Today, there is <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137499721\">empirical</a> <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1464884916648094\">evidence</a> that the BBC\u2019s output reflects the perspectives of Westminster and Whitehall, along with experts, thinktanks and pundits who operate in or close to that world. In mundane terms, this means that social and geographical proximity to the largely London-based elite significantly increases your chances of being in a BBC editor\u2019s phonebook. But the rather narrow range of opinion that appears in routine BBC reporting is further narrowed during periods of crisis, when governments seek to control information more tightly in accordance with their political strategies.</p> <p>Our present situation is different to industrial disputes or wars that have tested the BBC in the past, including the situation of total war to which it has been compared. During the second world war, the BBC was brought under the authority of the Ministry of Information, which for a time was headed by its founding father, John Reith. No such arrangements are in place today, and there is no national unity government. However, parliament is shut down and the main party of opposition is in a period of transition, meaning that a key source of criticism is muted.</p> <p>Just as significant is that, in response to the health crisis, state-sanctioned medical and scientific experts have in effect been incorporated into the state, blurring the line between independent expertise and government policy. Scientific experts and elected politicians are speaking in one voice through managed briefings, which are arguably allowing politicians to escape scrutiny via appeals to scientific authority.</p> <p>All this makes independent scrutiny of the government\u2019s response to Covid-19 more difficult, and the situation is compounded by the sense of responsibility felt by a self-described national broadcaster that during this crisis is a key medium for government communications. According to its editorial guidelines, the BBC should be delivering essential information in the interests of public safety, but maintaining independence from the government. This should mean ensuring a clear distinction between public service information and independent journalism. The BBC has offered some limited space to criticisms of the government\u2019s slow response to the pandemic and its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52112483\">failure to introduce large-scale testing</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52254745\">provide personal protective equipment</a>, but it has too readily been co-opted into the government\u2019s communication strategy.</p> <p>Obvious questions are <a href=\"https://www.mediareform.org.uk/blog/burning-questions-in-the-lap-of-power\">not being raised</a> in daily briefings and obvious international comparisons are not being made. Recently, as the UK daily death toll rose to a level not seen before in Europe, BBC News led on the government\u2019s \u201cHerculean effort\u201d to provide PPE to NHS staff. It then spent the next few days reporting closely on the improving health of the prime minister and on Easter Sunday, as the UK approached 10,000 deaths, the lead story on its its homepage bore the headline: \u201cBoris Johnson hails NHS staff.\u201d This is PR, not journalism, and the lack of scrutiny of policy at such a crucial time will not make the public any safer.</p> <p>In exceptional circumstances, people tend to turn to governments for guidance and to official sources for information. This is not merely a frightened response, it is also a rational reaction to a situation that requires the authority and coordinating capacities of the state. But these crucial powers also require independent media to scrutinise and challenge the policies, and to provide a range of opinion, expert opinion in particular. As an organisation occupying an awkward position somewhere between an official instrument of the state and an institution of civil society, the BBC is struggling to perform that role.</p> <p>\u2022 Tom Mills is lecturer in sociology at Aston University.

  "<p>A few weeks ago, I found myself standing in the apartment of Matthias, a Berlin biker who was selling his leather jacket on a local classifieds website. The jacket wasn\u2019t for me, but I left with stories about when the Cramps played the 90s, and tips for German surf bands.</p> <p>Almost 12 months ago, I signed up to <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/event/fashion-costs-the-earth-xr52-boycott-new-clothing/\">Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Fashion Boycott</a>, a year-long pledge to buy only secondhand \u2013 which is how I ended up chatting rock\u2019n\u2019roll in a stranger\u2019s apartment.

If you\u2019re not a natural-born thrifter, it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend hours on resell apps and in secondhand shops unless you are going to find something you will hold on to. Think smart \u2013 what do you need and where\u2019s the best place to find it?<br><br>You need to know your measurements, too. I built a spreadsheet with measurements of the garments that fit me, as well as the ones that don\u2019t. So now I know that I like my jumpers with a 55-62cm chest. More than that and it\u2019s too baggy. Any less and it\u2019s not baggy enough. No more worries about finding something that fits online, where most sellers provide measurements, or will if you ask for them.<br><br>Once you know what you are after, it\u2019s about being patient. Setting alerts and saving filters on apps helps narrow down the odds, as does <a href=\"https://gem.app/\">Gem, an app and search engine just for secondhand</a>. There\u2019s a thriving ecosystem of expertly curated shops on Instagram that do the hard work for you, too.<br><br>My best finds came from classifieds. On Kleinanzeigen, a German version of Gumtree, I found a man giving away a high-end suit because it had a few minuscule moth holes in it. I paid him \u20ac5 (\u00a34.50) to post it to me. Plus, of course, Matthias and his almost-perfect jacket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Alec Leach\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

  "<p>\u201cPsychologically, it\u2019s been terrible,\u201d says Dr Dawn Liu, of the coronavirus wedding ban. \u201cThere\u2019s been this absolute sense of insecurity, this threat that in the middle of a pandemic I might be told to leave my fiance and take a flight, which is really risky. That fear won\u2019t leave at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Liu, 31, from Colchester, was due to marry her fiance, Dr Angus Holford, 33, on 6 April 2020. Both are academics at the University of Essex: they met on OkCupid in June 2018, before getting engaged the following year. Liu is originally from Singapore, and is on a tier 2 working visa, which grants her the right to live and work in the UK. Under normal circumstances, Liu would have had plenty of time after her April wedding to apply for a spouse visa before her tier 2 visa expired on 14 July, enabling her to continue working and living in the UK.</p> \n<p>But after the government banned weddings on 23 March, to prevent the coronavirus pandemic spreading, Liu and Holford have found themselves in immigration limbo. They are one of a number of couples due to marry before the coronavirus wedding ban now wondering how the pandemic will affect their immigration status.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship</li>\n     <li>Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public \u2013 excluding people you live with</li>\n     <li>Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Under existing immigration law, Liu can still apply to switch her tier 2 working visa to a spouse visa, which would permit her to remain legally in the UK. However, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa/partner-spouse\">engaged people</a> are not allowed to work on spouse visas \u2013 meaning that Liu would have to quit her job if she wanted to remain in the UK with Holford. And although the government has automatically extended all visas that were set to expire during the lockdown to 31 May, this won\u2019t help Liu, as her visa expires after then. \u201cIt\u2019s a circular legal nightmare for us,\u201d says Holford. </p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cUnder the immigration rules, anyone on a work visa who was granted leave for more than six months can apply to switch to a spouse visa. This applies to married and unmarried couples and was the case before the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d They did not comment on whether visas would be extended beyond the 31 May cut-off date, to help people such as Liu.</p> \n<p>Unlike funerals, which are still ongoing during the coronavirus lockdown, albeit with only immediate family in attendance, all wedding ceremonies and registrations have been put on hold.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we register the wedding in a room with just the registrar, the couple, and two witnesses, all spread out in a room according to social distancing guidelines?\u201d says Holford.</p> \n<p>The coronavirus wedding lockdown is also proving unexpectedly costly for the couples reliant on marriage to certify their immigration status. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rack up,\u201d says Mariah Abshire, who is 23 and lives in Arnos Grove.</p> \n<p>Abshire, a US citizen, was meant to marry her fiance, Nikolay Bogdev, 24, on 23 March \u2013 the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. The day before her wedding, Abshire got a phone call from her registry office. \u201cIt was insane!\u201d she says. \u201cWe got the call literally the day before saying they were locking it down.\u201d She has asked her council when she may be able to reschedule her wedding, but they weren\u2019t able to give her any concrete answers.</p> \n<p>Abshire\u2019s fiance visa is set to expire on 9 July. She will most likely have to apply to extend it, at the cost of \u00a31,033. \u201cIt would be great if they did waive those extension charges, given that this is unprecedented,\u201d says Abshire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a personal issue that came up needing us to get an extension. It\u2019s a national emergency that is causing everything to go on pause. It would be helpful if the government could bear that in mind, seeing as how people aren\u2019t allowed to work here legally and need to fork out a lot of money to stay here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Holford and Liu would like further clarity from the government on whether they will automatically extend visas beyond the 31 May date, particularly now that it looks likely the coronavirus lockdown will go on for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has been vague in their promises,\u201d says immigration specialist Robin Molyneux of Global Immigration Solutions. \u201cThey should look at having a provision for anyone whose visa was expiring by a later date being automatically extended, without fees being payable for people having to renew them.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Liu and Holford are waiting anxiously. \u201cWhen we tell people that we had to postpone our wedding, they say: \u2018Oh it must be hard to have to postpone!\u2019 But they are missing the point. Marriage isn\u2019t just a piece of paper. So much depends on it. Weddings are important for legal reasons.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For many in the live music industry, 2020 is over.

London\u2019s month-long <a href=\"https://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/227253/9\">Meltdown </a>festival has shifted to 2021 and the entire lineup \u2013 featuring hard-to-obtain stars such as Solange and also its curator Grace Jones \u2013 has shifted with it. Arena tours are being moved, repurposing some: David Gray\u2019s 20th anniversary play-through of White Ladder will become a 21st birthday tour next year instead.</p> <p>But other large events, keen not to lose a year\u2019s worth of planning, are applying a best-case reading of the crisis. They hope to reschedule for after the pandemic has passed its peak in summer, but before a potential second wave of infection in winter.</p> <p>In the UK, the large-scale Newcastle indie festival This Is Tomorrow has been moved from May to August. In the US, August\u2019s desert gathering Burning Man has been scrapped, but in September and October there are revised dates for Detroit\u2019s Movement, Tennessee\u2019s Bonnaroo, EDC in Las Vegas and both legs of Coachella in California \u2013 all important income for touring musicians and the local economy alike. In Ibiza, <a href=\"https://theibizan.com/autumn-is-the-new-spring-campaign/\">a marketing blitz</a> is under way to move spring events to autumn, beseeching islanders and would-be tourists alike \u201cto celebrate the end of this bad dream\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4db09975ccf57f2f692773b5087034d080ee343f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4db09975ccf57f2f692773b5087034d080ee343f/0_0_3232_2328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Festivalgoers at Coachella, which has been postponed to October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Festivalgoers at Coachella, which has been postponed to October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One problem is that postponements, rather than cancellations, are leaving ticketholders out of pocket. Ticketmaster quietly changed its terms <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/04/10/ticketmaster-quietly-changes-refund-policy/\">last week</a> so that it would only deem cancelled events eligible for refunds. And even if rearranged festivals take place, there will be logistical difficulties for artists, vendors and fans. New dates in late August and early September for Primavera Sound in Barcelona, NOS Primavera in Porto and Kala in Albania are now wedged into the same time already occupied by \u2013 in the UK alone \u2013 End of the Road, Reading and Leeds, Lost Village and Notting Hill carnival, not to mention countless smaller promoters who hope to juice whatever they can from a summer in suspension.</p> <p>For Judy Miller Silverman, owner of US publicity firm Motormouth Media, whose roster of electronic artists includes Caribou, Thundercat and Floating Points, this makeshift approach seems untenable. \u201cMy glass is half empty,\u201d Silverman says of salvaging the festival season, adding that any in-person promotion by artists is almost impossible: \u201cWe have no idea what individual territories will do with travel restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>Mat Schulz, the artistic director of Krak\u00f3w\u2019s Unsound, says the experimental arts festival is still set to run in October, but will take a hybrid form. \u201cWe can\u2019t simply plough ahead as per usual,\u201d Schulz says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to consider what form Unsound could take in practical terms, as well as consider how we can respond to the current crisis conceptually.\u201d</p> <p>The role of live music at this year\u2019s festival will be diminished, he says, supplanted by an edition that probes existential quandaries generated by the pandemic, via talks and other ideas in development: \u201cWhat does local mean now? Globalisation? Closeness? Isolation? These are the questions that we are asking ourselves.\u201d He is in contact with other independent promoters through EU-funded platforms such as Shape, looking for ways to mitigate the effects of the crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc5e29ae2f4029923a5a27c6126b83a1771fcb7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc5e29ae2f4029923a5a27c6126b83a1771fcb7c/0_0_1024_683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unsound festival in Krak\u00f3w.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unsound festival in Krak\u00f3w.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Spsyz/Unsound festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barcelona\u2019s wide-ranging Primavera Sound, which begins each year at the end of May, is the starting gun for the European festival season. It has been postponed until the end of August, with an announcement that generated anger for its lack of refund options. Comparisons were made by fans to the troubled All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties, the 2000s festival that became a byword for opacity and incompetence after numerous events were cancelled and refunds became difficult to secure \u2013 admittedly in less grave circumstances to the ones Primavera find themselves in.</p> <p>Primavera initially wouldn\u2019t comment beyond their official statement \u2013 \u201cUntil the state of alarm is over we won\u2019t reactivate the ticket sales, nor are we allowed to give more information about the ticket policy\u201d\u2013 but have now stated to the Guardian that they do intend to make refunds.</p> <p>Organisers said they were \u201ccontemplating various solutions for this edition\u2019s ticketholders, which will be announced after the state of alarm decreed by the Spanish government. One of these solutions, among others, will be the refund. We have never said that we wouldn\u2019t offer them.\u201d They said they were \u201cwaiting for the legal framework on this matter to be defined\u201d across Spanish, Catalonian and European law before announcing details, adding: \u201cWe must be patient and wait for these new extraordinary measures to be fully defined. If we were to do so before, we would not be guaranteeing legal certainty either for our festival or for our ticketholders. We want to inform our buyers on the basis of certainties, not speculations.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, prolonged the country\u2019s state of emergency \u2013 which prohibits events, as well as restricting business activity and people travelling to work in non-essential sectors such as entertainment \u2013 until 26 April. S\u00e1nchez suggested that he seek a further extension until 10 May (the head of the regional government in Catalonia said he would not comply with any premature easing of the lockdown anyway).</p> <p>Dice, a ticketing partner, confirmed in emails that \u201cemergency regulations have been introduced in Spain to help promoters through this crisis\u201d, with the government suspending the need for festivals to process refunds until the state of alarm is over. This could be another month, or more. In previous Spanish cases, a clause has sometimes been invoked that has allowed insurers to modify contracts rather than see them cancelled \u2013 though as Primavera address in their statement, Spanish legislation is newly in flux during Covid-19 and it is not clear if they could find themselves in a similar situation. Either way, international ticketholders, who make up a substantial proportion of its audience, have been low on empathy.</p> <p>In the past few days, Dr Zeke Emanuel, a prominent US health policy expert, created fresh jitters with his prediction that autumn 2021 is the soonest large gatherings are likely to be permitted. The psychology of how we interact in communal spaces is another hurdle \u2013 <a href=\"https://metalinjection.net/news/health-expert-warns-concerts-wont-return-until-fall-2021-at-the-earliest\">a poll held by Metal Injection</a>, a website catering to a particularly hardy subset of rockers, revealed that less than 50% would feel comfortable returning to concerts even if restrictions were lifted and fast testing was available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9af9976b800936b82dfac0858033982ba6385759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9af9976b800936b82dfac0858033982ba6385759/0_0_2048_1370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nuit Sonores in Lyon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuit Sonores in Lyon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a real risk of reputational damage for those tripped up by overly optimistic reshuffles. Lyon\u2019s Nuits Sonores festival organisers will have watched Emmanuel Macron\u2019s speech on Monday night with distress \u2013 the premier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/macron-france-remain-strict-lockdown-for-another-month\">extended France\u2019s lockdown</a> until 11 May, but added that public events would be the last to return as the country \u201cprogressively opened\u201d, and that this could be later than July. The festival, which had already moved from May to July, is thus back in the red zone. A similar case befell Copenhagen\u2019s Distortion, which was rescheduled from June to August but is now cancelled because Denmark has extended until September its ban on events involving more than 1,000 people.</p> <p>These cases speak to the wider predicament facing live events: a global industry has been broken into national components and absorbed into mechanisms of the state. When musicians and audiences are penned in by land borders, infrastructure based around interlocking tour schedules and interchangeable headliners collapses.</p> <p>Some of the events industry\u2019s more pernicious restrictions, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_clause\">the radius clause</a> that dictates booked artists can\u2019t play within a certain distance of the festival or event within a certain time period, might be abandoned. The bubble of sky-high DJ fees is sure to burst, and local music scenes could wind up flourishing. One Hong Kong club told me that it was preparing to reopen by mid-May, but initially with a \u201cregionalisation\u201d of its programming.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge craving for live music after this,\u201d reckons Schulz. \u201cThe experience of collectively listening or dancing together \u2013 how that need is met will change in ways we can\u2019t yet predict.\u201d The reckoning with coronavirus\u2019s impact seems to be moving from the bargaining stage to something approaching acceptance. Whether or not 2020 is a total write-off, music communities will need to meet these new challenges with creativity, says Schulz. \u201cIf ever there was a time to think outside the box, this is it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on Thursday 16 April after Primavera made a statement to say they do intend to make refunds. It was also updated to clarify their position regarding insurance and Spanish law.</p>",

While still making Silicon Valley, Judge created the first series of Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus, released in 2017.

I didn\u2019t go in thinking of any of the musicians as one-dimensional, but I also didn\u2019t know the depths of their problems.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary stories of superstars might seem an unlikely project for Judge, someone best known for writing about ordinary people and their ordinary workplace frustrations. Yet Tour Bus becomes exactly that: the episodes about Rick James and Morris Day are about their rivalries with a work colleague, who just happens to be Prince; the episode about Bootsy Collins shows him laughing at his tyrannical boss, who just happens to be James Brown. \u201cThat\u2019s the stuff that jumped out at me. These people \u2013 I grew up thinking of them as mythical superhuman rock stars.

  "<p>At least 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the UK have been identified by campaigners since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed, far higher than the average rate for the time of year, it has emerged.</p> <p>Karen Ingala Smith, the founder of Counting Dead Women, a pioneering project that records the killing of women by men in the UK, has identified at least 16 killings between 23 March and 12 April, including those of children.</p> <p>Looking at the same period over the last 10 years, Smith\u2019s data records an average of five deaths.</p> <p>Her findings for 2020, which are collated from internet searches and people contacting over social media, were raised during evidence to the home affairs select ommittee on Wednesday.</p> <p>Dame Vera Baird QC, the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, told MPs at the remote session: \u201cCounting Dead Women has got to a total of 16 domestic abuse killings in the last three weeks. We usually say there are two a week, that looks to me like five a week, that\u2019s the size of this crisis.\u201d</p> <p> A number of domestic abuse charities and campaigners have reported a surge in calls to helplines and online services since the lockdown conditions were imposed, reflecting experiences in other countries.</p> <p>Smith, who is also chief executive of a domestic abuse charity, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe coronavirus creates violent men. What we\u2019re seeing is a window into the levels of abuse that women live with all the time. Coronavirus may exacerbate triggers, though I might prefer to call them excuses. Lockdown may restrict some women\u2019s access to support or escape and it may even curtail measures some men take to keep their own violence under control.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be cautious about how we talk about increases in men killing women. Over the last 10 years, in the UK, a woman has been killed by a man every three days, by a partner or ex-partner, every four days. So if this was averaged out, we might expect to see seven women killed in 21 days. In reality, there are always times when the numbers are higher or lower.</p> <p>\u201cBut we can say that the number of women killed by men over the first three weeks since lockdown is the highest it\u2019s been for at least 11 years and is double that of an average 21 days over the last 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s research shows at least seven people have been allegedly killed by partners or former partners during the period, while three people have been allegedly killed by their father.</p> <p>The committee also heard evidence from Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales.

  "<p>What the UK is most afraid of has come from overseas, taking our jobs and making it unsafe to walk the streets. This is the opening message of a widely shared video on coronavirus that subverts racist language often directed at immigrants, showing that those who have experienced discrimination are now key workers, trying to keep people safe.</p> \n<p>The clip \u2013 which has gone viral worldwide \u2013 features UK residents, immigrants and people of foreign heritage who are medics, delivery drivers and teachers working hard amid the Covid-19 outbreak. They read a poem, penned by Darren James Smith, entitled You Clap for Me Now.</p> \n<p>The video\u2019s producer, Sachini Imbuldeniya, said: \u201cThe United Nations released a global brief to all creatives to spread messages of positivity, kindness and solidarity during these uncertain times. The brief was very open in terms of what content was created. My good friend and colleague Darren Smith wrote the poem. We both work together at Bridge Studio.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe previously interviewed my mum, a retired nurse, for an article that ran in the Sunday Times magazine about the Windrush scandal and feels very passionately about the subject, as do I. When I read the poem I knew the message needed to be spread as widely as possible, so we decided to turn it into a short and shareable video featuring a mixture of first-, second- and third-generation immigrants living in the UK.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She said the biggest restriction to making the film was the UK lockdown. \u201cI messaged lots of people on Instagram and also friends and family to see if they would be interested in taking part and each filming themselves reciting one line from the poem that I allocated to them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The video was edited by Ruben Alvarado. It features Tez Ilyas, a British standup comedian of Pakistani descent, as well as others including doctors Kiran Rahim and Mehwish Sharif.<br><br> Smith said: \u201cI only wrote a poem 10 days ago and it came together very quickly but I wrote it and showed it to Sachini Imbuldeniya and she loved it and wanted to make a film out of it. The original idea was really hers and she created the film and worked out the logistics of it and how we can film when people are in their homes. She coordinated it from there, bringing people together.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith said of first meeting Imbuldeniya, when he interviewed her mother: \u201cIt was really interesting talking to her mum about how we really valued immigrants coming over to help the NHS. Windrush was all about bringing people over to help due to labour shortage after world war two. They were doing us a huge favour as well as building a new life.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat was the background to it and then with the pandemic we are all going outside to clap for carers, which is a lovely thing. It struck me how quickly it had changed from these people being unskilled to being essential key workers and reframed how we think about them. That is brilliant, but her mum\u2019s story came to me and I thought, let\u2019s just make sure when this all ends and we emerge into a light that we don\u2019t allow the narrative to slip back to immigrants taking our jobs and xenophobic language that you read everywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he realised the parallel between far-right rhetoric, \u201cthem taking our jobs and making us feel trapped\u201d, and how it was a good description of how \u201cwe feel now thanks to the virus\u201d.</p> \n<p>The poem reads: \u201cSo, it\u2019s finally happened. That thing you were afraid of. Something has come from overseas. And taken your jobs. Made it unsafe to walk the streets. Kept you trapped in your home. A dirty disease. Your proud nation gone. But not me. Or me. Or me. No you clap for me now. You cheer as I toil. Bringing food to your family. Bringing food from your soil. Propping up your hospitals. Not some foreign invader. Delivery driver. Teacher. Life saver.\u201d</p> \n<p>Imbuldeniya said: \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t expecting it [the video] to go viral, but am so glad that it has as I feel like it\u2019s such an important message to send out. Not just for the UK, but globally. Comedian and actor Tez Ilyas has been truly amazing. He took part in the video and also shared it on all of his social channels, which helped massively.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith said they had been overwhelmed by the response, with #YouClapForMeNow trending on UK Twitter on Wednesday morning. \u201cThe great thing is the vast majority of responses have been positive and very rare for Twitter, I think.

  "<p>How will the Covid-19 pandemic end? According to conventional wisdom, the crisis may ease in a few months, when some of the antiviral medicines on trial succeed. In a few years\u2019 time, when a vaccine becomes available, we may eradicate the virus altogether.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s unlikely that this is how the pandemic will actually play out. Although there is every indication that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/19/prospects-treatment-coronavirus-drugs-vaccines\">treatments for coronavirus</a> may soon emerge, the mere fact of their existence is no guarantee that people will be able to access them. In fact, Covid-19 is more likely to end in the same way that every pandemic ends: treatments and vaccines will be buried in a thicket of patents \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-vaccine-big-pharma-data\">pharmaceutical companies</a> will ultimately make the decisions about who lives and who dies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-vaccine-big-pharma-data\">The race to find a coronavirus treatment has one major obstacle: big pharma  | Ara Darzi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We typically think of monopolies, where companies exert exclusive control over a commodity, as market failures that can be corrected with antitrust laws. Medical patents are the equivalent of legalised monopolies. In theory, patents are supposed to grant pharmaceutical companies a reward for investing in research and development. Crucially, they\u2019re supposed to be temporary, lasting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/09/why-do-new-medicines-cost-so-much-and-what-can-we-do-about-it\">20 years</a>. But in practice, patenting minor tweaks to a formula can extend this term considerably, foreclosing market competition and granting pharmaceutical companies the power to set prices.</p> <p>In 1996, a treatment for HIV/Aids was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2071936/\">brought to market</a> in the US by a clutch of pharmaceutical companies. The treatment, a combination of antiretroviral medicines, turned a virus that was a death sentence into a chronic condition. It<strong> </strong>was priced annually at \u00a36,500 per person \u2013 in most parts of the world, this price was the same in practice as having no treatment at all. It took until 2004, after millions of people had died from the illness, for India and South Africa to afford the treatment.</p> <p>Already we\u2019ve seen how medical monopolies have restricted access to coronavirus treatments. We know, for example, that health workers don\u2019t have enough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/us-blocks-face-masks-canada-n95-protection-equipment\">N95 respirator masks</a>; less well known is that 3M holds more than 400 patents for respiratory protection, severely restricting who can produce and supply them in the US. Politicians have called on <a href=\"https://eu.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/04/03/beshear-calls-3-m-release-patent-n-95-respirator-amid-pandemic/5112729002/\">3M to release its patents</a> during the pandemic so production can be increased. Amidst an acute shortage of tests for Covid-19, a French diagnostic manufacturer submitted a test kit to the US FDA for emergency approval to sell it in the country<strong>, </strong>and was <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/307741-patent-troll-sues-to-pull-covid-19-tests-off-market-over-alleged-infringement\">sued for patent infringement</a> by a subsidiary of Softbank (this was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/17/softbank-owned-patent-firm-backtracks-lawsuit-targeting-coronavirus/\">later withdrawn</a>).</p> <p>And most of the promising treatments for coronavirus that are being tested in clinical trials have patents attached to them. Some of these, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/japanese-flu-drug-clearly-effective-in-treating-coronavirus-says-china\">favipiravir</a>, which is used to treat influenza, and the combination of Iopinavir and ritonavir, sold under the brand name <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/03/23/abbvie-hiv-kaletra-generics-coronavirus-covid19/\">Kaletra</a> to treat HIV/Aids, have short-term patents in force. <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gileads-experimental-covid-19-drug-shows-promise-but-analysts-remain-cautious-2020-04-13\">Remdesivir</a>, a medicine developed for Ebola by the biotechnology company Gilead, has major patents across the world that last until 2038. Last month, Gilead rushed to secure \u201corphan drug\u201d status in the US for Remdesivir\u2019s potential use against Covid-19. Orphan status grants companies government incentives to to develop medicines for rare diseases that would otherwise be unprofitable, yet Covid-19 is quite the opposite of a rare disease. The company later <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gilead-asks-fda-to-rescind-remdesivir-orphan-drug-tag-after-public-backlash\">backtracked</a>.</p> <p>There is every possibility that a Covid-19 vaccine will be encumbered with multiple patents.<strong> </strong>Vaccines are now a big business. Take infant mortality caused by pneumonia, for example. The two vaccines in use today are buried in a thicket of patents belonging to Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. India uses the <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/india-grants-pfizer-patent-for-blockbuster-brand-prevenar-13/articleshow/60174991.cms?from=md\">Pfizer vaccine</a>, which retails at $250 for a full course but is available to the government at a discounted rate of \u00a38 through GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance funding. But given that demand in India runs into the tens of millions, even the subsidised cost is unaffordable, and only a small fraction of babies end up getting the vaccine. And so, 40 years after a vaccine for pneumonia was developed, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/health/pneumonia-kills-one-child-every-39-seconds-127-000-died-in-india-2018-pneumonia-cause-data-119111300489_1.html\">127,000 Indian babies</a> continue to die from it every year, while the vaccine they can\u2019t afford continues to generate \u00a34.5bn for Pfizer annually.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that countries are taking pre-emptive measures to deal with monopoly control over medical treatments.<strong> </strong>Compulsory licensing of patents \u2013 a legal measure by which countries can suspend patents on a product \u2013 is gaining popularity. Last month, Chile declared that the pandemic justifies the use of compulsory licensing; others soon followed. Israel issued compulsory licenses for lopinavir and ritonavir, Ecuador approved a resolution that asks the minister of health to issue compulsory licences over all patents related to Covid-19, Canada and Germany amended their patent laws to enable the swift grant of a compulsory licence, and Brazil is in the process of amending its patent law to make compulsory licensing easier.</p> <p>These measures are useful, but they require each country to go it alone. And patents are not the only thing preventing access to coronavirus treatments. Costa Rica recently <a href=\"https://www.presidencia.go.cr/comunicados/2020/03/costa-rica-submits-proposal-for-who-to-facilitate-access-to-technologies-to-combat-covid-19/\">submitted a proposal</a> to the World Health Organization for a global Covid-19 technology pool \u2013 a place where all the necessary intellectual property, such as patents, designs, trade secrets and software could be brought together. The pool would encourage governments to share innovations and make them available globally. The Covid-19 technology pool is far from a done deal, but support for it is growing.

There is suspicion and fear still.\u201d</p> <p>Ethiopia\u2019s campus wars have a long history. Ever since the late 60s, when what was then the sole university, Haile Selassie I (now Addis Ababa University), became a hotbed of anti-government activity, student unrest has had an ethnic and sometimes violent edge. In 1967, for instance, there was a riot at the faculty of education between Tigrayan and Amhara students that went on for several days. Serious ethnic clashes took place at Bahir Dar polytechnic two years later.</p> <p>But they are becoming more frequent and more deadly. A <a href=\"https://www.cardeth.org/universities-as-contested-terrain-making-sense-of-violent-conflicts-in-ethiopian-universities/\">report</a> by the Centre for Advancement of Rights and Democracy (Card), a local NGO, documented at least nine rounds of university-based conflict since December 2017, many flaring up on more than one campus at a time.</p> <p>The unrest is partly the result of Ethiopia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/16/uneasy-peace-ethiopia-three-flags-fly-oromia-somali-states-tension-ethnic-federalism\">distinct model of ethnically-based federalism</a>, established in 1994, which has ensured the recognition of minority groups but also hardened ethnic identities. In the past two years alone, <a href=\"https://www.internal-displacement.org/countries/ethiopia\">about 3 million Ethiopians</a> have been displaced and hundreds killed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/14/shadow-falls-over-ethiopia-reforms-warnings-of-crisis-ignored-abiy-ahmed\">waves of ethnic and regional violence</a>.</p> <p>Troubles on campus are also in part a consequence of failings in the federal system. Universities, as federal institutions with mixed populations, <a href=\"https://www.atiner.gr/papers/EDU2013-0644.pdf\">are much more diverse</a> places than most schools and workplaces. But they have grown increasingly homogenous in recent years, following a shift away from the old pattern of posting students and academics to universities far from their home region.</p> <p>Today, each university is the de facto property of an ethnic group, according to Yonas Ashine, author of the Card report. Most staff and management are locals, and the leadership of student unions is drawn mostly from the indigenous ethnicity. This can aggravate tensions between students.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1767c4fe62d5ba694815151deb51e43c0c6124e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1767c4fe62d5ba694815151deb51e43c0c6124e9/0_0_6265_4271/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Students in Ambo University\u2019s male dormitories, situated on the main campus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students in Ambo University\u2019s male dormitories, situated on the main campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Gardner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe whole idea of establishing campuses all over the country was to bring federal institutions closer to the people, to promote national cohesion,\u201d said Zemelak Ayele of Addis Ababa University\u2019s centre for federal studies. \u201cBut over time all universities have become more and more ethnically homogeneous. That is where the problem is.\u201d</p> <p>Card\u2019s director, Bekefadu Haile, said: \u201cThe ethnicisation of administrations is itself a factor. Almost all heads, deans and presidents are from the same ethnic group, so you don\u2019t even have a place to complain about your marginalisation.\u201d</p> <p>Language also undermines cohesion. According to national law, all universities are expected to teach in \u201cneutral\u201d English, but many lecturers are not fluent. In universities in Oromia, in particular, teaching is often in the local language \u2013 one consequence of the failure of the federal system to promote a common tongue.</p> <p>Amara Mitiko, an economics lecturer at Wollo University, was initially sent to Wollega University in western Oromia after graduating. \u201cThe whole campus spoke only Afaan Oromo \u2013 few people spoke English,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they couldn\u2019t understand me and I couldn\u2019t understand them.\u201d</p> <p>Campus life is hyper-politicised. Political parties have close links to universities, with many lecturers doubling as party members. Two of the leaders of the Oromo Federalist Congress, one of the main opposition parties, are employed at Addis Ababa University. Two of the founders of the radical ethno-nationalist National Movement of Amhara are staff in Wollo University\u2019s law department.

  "<p>In mid-February a colleague mentioned that for the first time in his life he was more concerned than his mother, who had been relatively blase about the risks of Covid-19. It felt odd for him to be telling her to take care. We are both professors in a department of infectious disease epidemiology, and we were worried.</p> \n<p>Two months on, that anxiety has not gone,<strong> </strong>although it\u2019s also been joined by a sense of sadness. It\u2019s now clear that so many people have died, and so many more are desperately ill, simply because our politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/deadly-virus-britain-failed-prepare-mers-sars-ebola-coronavirus\">refused to listen to and act on advice</a>. Scientists like us said lock down earlier; we said test, trace, isolate. But they decided they knew better.</p> \n<p>Am I being unfair? The government assures us that its decisions and timing are based on science, as if it is a neutral, value-free process resulting in a specific set of instructions. In reality, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/five-months-on-what-scientists-now-know-about-the-coronavirus\">science around coronavirus</a> is in its infancy and developing daily, with researchers across the world trying to understand how the virus spreads, how the body responds \u2013 and how to treat it and control it. The speed at which our knowledge has increased is impressive, from the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200131114748.htm\">sequencing of the virus</a> in January through to having <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/195055/imperial-researchers-race-develop-coronavirus-vaccine/\">candidate vaccines</a> in early February.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis\">Mathematical models</a> are being refined to predict the extent and speed of spread and estimate the impact of control methods. My own group is studying the response of communities, showing how the epidemic is amplifying existing <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050039v1\">social inequalities</a>. People with the lowest household income are far less likely, but no less willing, to be able to work from home or to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>But while scientists carry out observations and experiments, testing, iterating and discovering new knowledge, it is the role of policymakers to act on the best available evidence. In the context of a rapidly growing threat, that means listening to experts with experience of responding to previous epidemics.</p> \n<p>When I say that politicians \u201crefused to listen\u201d, I am referring to the advice and recommendations coming from the World Health Organization, from China and from Italy. The WHO advice, based on decades of experience and widely accepted by public health leaders and scientists around the world was clear \u2013 use every possible tool to suppress transmission. That meant testing and isolating cases, tracing and quarantining contacts, and ramping up hygiene efforts.</p> \n<p>The UK did well in the early phase, but then, on 12 March, the government alarmed many public health experts by abruptly abandoning containment and announcing that community case-finding and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">contact-tracing would stop</a>. The aim was no longer to stop people getting it, but to slow it down while protecting the vulnerable.</p> \n<p>The evidence underpinning the government\u2019s decision appears in a report from 9 March summarising the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874290/05-potential-impact-of-behavioural-social-interventions-on-an-epidemic-of-covid-19-in-uk-1.pdf\">potential impact of behavioural and social interventions</a>. The report did not consider the impact of case-finding and contact-tracing, but it did suggest that the biggest impact on cases and deaths would come from social distancing and the protection of vulnerable groups.</p> \n<p>And yet social distancing was not recommended then. That day, 12 March, after hearing with disbelief the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\">government announcement</a> that didn\u2019t include widespread social distancing, I recommended to my team at Imperial that they should work from home for the foreseeable future. Indeed, I have not been to my office since.</p> \n<p>Neither the advice nor the science were followed that week. My colleagues, led by Neil Ferguson, <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">published </a><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">a report</a> on 16 March estimating that without strong suppression, 250,000 people could die in the UK. The government responded that day with a recommendation for social distancing, avoiding pubs and working from home if possible. But there was still no enforcement, and it was left up to individuals and employers to decide what to do. Many people were willing but unable to comply as we showed <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-10-population-survey-covid-19/\">in a report on 20 March</a>. It was only on 23 March that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">more stringent lockdown</a> and economic support was announced.</p> \n<p>Between 12 and 23 March, tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of people will have been infected. Boris Johnson himself may well have been infected that week, and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">stay in the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">intensive care unit</a> may have been avoided if the government had shifted to remote working on 12 March. The current best estimate is that around 1% of those infected will die.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So where to now? Once again, public health experience, including modelling, leads to some very clear recommendations. First, find cases in the community as well as hospitals and care homes; isolate them, and trace their contacts using a combination of local public health teams and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-live-news-nhs-staff-deaths-boris-johnson-latest-updates\">digital tools</a>.</p> \n<p>Second, know your epidemic. Track the epidemic nationally and locally using NHS, public health and digital surveillance to see where cases are continuing to spread. This will be essential so that we can start to lift the lockdown while shielding the population from hotspots of transmission. Build community resilience by providing local support for vulnerable people affected by the virus and the negative impact of the control measures.</p> \n<p>Third, ensure transmission is suppressed in hospitals, care homes and workplaces through the right protective equipment, testing, distancing and hygiene. Investigate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\">differential effects on black and minority ethnic groups</a>, and provide appropriate protection.</p> \n<p>Fourth, ensure that the most vulnerable, socially and medically, are fully protected through simple access to a basic income, rights for migrants, and safety for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/14/fiona-dwyer-2m-for-coronavirus-domestic-abuse-victims-its-pitiful\">those affected by domestic violence</a>.</p> \n<p>Many, including the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, say that now is not the time for blame. I am not looking to blame \u2013 but for scrutiny so that lessons can be learned to guide our response. We need to avoid further mistakes, and ensure that the government is hearing, and acting on, the best advice.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Helen Ward is professor of public health at Imperial College London</p> \n<p><br></p>",

Mainstream success, however, still eluded him. In desperation, his record label awarded the then 25-year-old a colossal budget to make a third album. The responsibility of such investment and expectation weighed heavily on Springsteen; he spent 14 months on the record \u2013 including six months on the title track alone, refining, redrafting, trying desperately to replicate the sounds he heard so clearly in his head.</p> <p>The result was not only a resounding success, it was a lesson, too, in musical craftsmanship, from the wall of sound-style production and arrangements to the immaculate structure; its ebullient songs of escape (Thunder Road, Born to Run) tempered by admissions of defeat (Jungleland, Backstreets). And he had opened up as a lyricist: his previous records had documented the nitty-gritty of Springsteen\u2019s own New Jersey scene, but now he moved away from the specific toward the universal. There were still screen doors and porches and Chevrolets, and Mary and Magic Rat and Maximum Lawmen, but it was a broader, blue-collar sensibility that could resonate anywhere; one that looked beyond the giddy distractions of young manhood and found disillusionment and complexity. Born to Run was \u201cthe album where I left behind my adolescent definitions of love and freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the dividing line.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The three albums to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8HXvt-v5v0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P8HXvt-v5v0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bruce Springsteen: Darkness on the Edge of Town (live in Houston, 1978) \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The deluge of success that followed Born to Run (and a considerable stretch of legal wrangling with his former manager) meant that Springsteen began its successor in a state of retreat. Again, his approach to recording was laborious: a year in the making, 70 songs written, 10 tracks chosen. As on Born to Run, he weighted exuberance against muted reflection; the eagerness of Badlands or The Promised Land balanced by more contemplative numbers such as Factory, or the drowsy and dejected Racing in the Street. The record culminates in the title track; still one of the finest songs of his career.</p> <p>It was this album that truly established Springsteen as the great storyteller of American heartland rock. Again, there are automobiles and interstates, girls won, money lost, but here it is raw rather than romanticised; tender, lusty, spirited, these are tales of hard work and hard luck, of resignation and resolution. Musically, it differed enormously from Born to Run\u2019s wall of sound effect. Here, each instrument seems to enjoy its own moment: there comes the staggering force of its drums, a flash of guitar, tremor of organ, the wild flourish of piano and saxophone. It\u2019s a quality that perhaps contributes to the sense of individual struggle, isolation and desire that runs through these stories, the sense that each of us dreams for something greater. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vHXuXnqCys\">The Promise</a>, a 2010 film documenting the album\u2019s making, gives extraordinary insight into Springsteen\u2019s exacting working methods.</p> <p><strong>The River (1980)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc6F47Z6PI4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lc6F47Z6PI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bruce Springsteen: The River (live in Tempe, 1978) \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>To understand The River, its mingling of the blithe and the bitter, it helps to consider the way Springsteen once described it in an interview: \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll has always been this joy, this certain happiness that is in its way the most beautiful thing in life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut rock is also about hardness and coldness and being alone.\u201d At first listen, that combination might make for a strange record. How could an album kick off with the jangle and street swagger of The Ties That Bind, parade on through the raucous Sherry Darling, the snarling Jackson Cage, the chart-pleasing Hungry Heart, and come to rest some while later on the devastating quietness of the title track, with its depiction of a shotgun wedding and a life curtailed?</p> <p>With continued listening, however, it is that precise marriage of joy and coldness that brings The River its fully fleshed plausibility. A double album, several of its songs had been discarded from the Darkness sessions, while others were crafted over the many months of another extended recording session. While its emotional heart undeniably lies in its title track, along with Stolen Car, Point Blank and Independence Day, the album also carries great gusts of romance, such as the unwavering devotion of Drive All Night.</p> <p><strong>Born in the USA (1984)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPhWR4d3FJQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EPhWR4d3FJQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bruce Springsteen: Born in the USA \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Arriving in the flush of Reagan\u2019s America, Springsteen\u2019s seventh album could easily be taken for an act of patriotism: its title a statement of national cocksuredness, its songs an exercise in scale and volume and bullishness, its cover, depicting a blue-jeaned, white-teed Springsteen before a star-spangled banner, suggesting a certain kind of brash, imperialist, bombastic Americanness. Many of the Springsteen songs sewn into our collective consciousness hail from this album, and are perhaps the reason why so many still regard him as a grease monkey writing singalong ditties about cars and girls. But Born in the USA is in fact a vastly more complicated album than this, and precisely the reason why it\u2019s worth listening to Born to Run, Darkness and The River before returning to its run of familiar tunes.</p> <p>Far from an operation in braggadocio, its 12 tracks are in fact an unlikely marriage of rousing rock\u2019n\u2019roll hooks and progressive politics, born in an era of welfare cuts and hawkishness. Later, Springsteen would describe the title track as a kind of blues, an antiwar song mourning the effects of the conflict in Vietnam.

  "<p>The first alarming symptoms were spotted by nursing assistants three weeks ago, and word of the coughing patient sent a ripple of fear through the Detroit nursing home.</p> <p>The staff had been on alert since a Washington state care home was engulfed by coronavirus, killing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/wash-nursing-home-faces-611000-fine-over-lapses-during-fatal-coronavirus-outbreak/2020/04/02/757cee76-7498-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html\">at least 35 people</a> in the first major outbreak of Covid-19 in the US.</p> <p>The virus has since swept from one nursing home to another across the country, leaping between patients and staff. Carers at the Ambassador nursing and rehabilitation center in Detroit, home to about 150 long-term elderly residents, were disturbed as the symptoms spread.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any protective gear,\u201d a nursing assistant, who did not wish to be publicly identified out of concern over losing her job, told the Guardian. \u201cWe had residents with symptoms and nothing to protect ourselves with \u2026 The management didn\u2019t seem like they really cared.\u201d</p> <p>Patients with symptoms were given masks but otherwise left sharing rooms with other elderly residents. A week ago, the nursing assistant tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard because I\u2019m at home and I\u2019m worried about the patients when I should be worried about myself right now \u2026 I\u2019m frightened we are going to lose a lot of them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>With about 1 million elderly residents, long-term care homes have emerged as incubators for Covid-19 outbreaks across the US. It is not a coincidence that the industry is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/health/home-care-aides-wages.html\">already notorious</a> for creaming profits off while pleading poverty in order to pay low wages to a workforce overwhelmingly of women, usually African American, Hispanic or immigrant. Too often, they are forced to take more than one job to make a living, a factor that has helped spread the virus between care centers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"79762f6f9faee31c00e1c6ced22de7318d0027ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79762f6f9faee31c00e1c6ced22de7318d0027ba/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Belmont Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Belmont, Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Belmont Manor nursing and rehabilitation center in Belmont, Massachusetts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Nissen/Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Europe, about half of coronavirus-related deaths in some countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/half-of-coronavirus-deaths-happen-in-care-homes-data-from-eu-suggests\">have occurred in care homes</a>.

If they fell sick, they wouldn\u2019t be able to work and most lived close to hand to mouth. Others were concerned that they were the ones carrying Covid-19 into the nursing home and endangering the very people they spent their days caring for.</p> <p>Through it all, some staff said the management was not taking the threat seriously enough, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/in-depth/news/local/michigan/2020/04/12/coronavirus-covid-19-michigan-nursing-homes/2966437001/\">at least eight confirmed infections and three deaths to date</a>.</p> <p>In a complaint against the Ambassador home to Detroit officials, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) included statements from nursing staff who said they spent weeks making repeated requests for masks, gowns and gloves to protect themselves and the people in their care.</p> <p>The staff said equipment suddenly appeared hours before Detroit health officials arrived to inspect the home on Wednesday last week.</p> <p>\u201cApparently, Ambassador had been hoarding all of this equipment in their storage, but forcing us employees to work without it. This makes me angry! Why would they put our lives at risk, simply because they want to save a few bucks? Even still, we still don\u2019t have enough because we only have two masks and one of the other items,\u201d said one of the nursing assistants in a written submission to city officials.</p> <p>Several other carers at the home said the management refused to tell them when a patient tested positive for Covid-19 or was suspected of having the virus. Neither, they said, did the company limit exposure to those showing symptoms by putting them into isolation. Some continue to share rooms with other patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"979f3f5d944a66a4eaf4844ec04a68e7bd447cee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979f3f5d944a66a4eaf4844ec04a68e7bd447cee/0_0_3200_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A healthcare worker attends to Susan Hailey, who has tested positive for coronavirus, at the Life Care Center of Kirkland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A healthcare worker attends to Susan Hailey, who has tested positive for coronavirus, at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ryder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor those people testing positive, Ambassador should have made sure that people who interacted with those patients were warned that they have been exposed, and given some safety protocols. Otherwise, we will unknowingly take this virus to our homes and neighborhoods,\u201d a nursing assistant wrote in a complaint to the city.</p> <p>The Ambassador is part owned and managed by Villa Healthcare which runs 34 nursing homes across the midwest. In response, the company accused critics of seeking \u201cto impugn our Villa Heroes based on the false allegations of biased parties\u201d, including the union.</p> <p>It said the first confirmed case of coronavirus at the Ambassador home was not until 6 April and that since then a total of eight residents have tested positive, including four who are now in hospital.</p> <p>The company denied that staff had been deprived of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment (PPE), saying that they were available to carers who asked for them. \u201cAt no time during this pandemic has Ambassador not had adequate PPE for the use and protection of its staff and residents,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The company said that none of the deaths of residents since the Covid-19 outbreak had been shown to be attributable to the virus.</p> <p>But workers at nursing homes across the country are making similar complaints. Dale Ewart, an SEIU official in Florida, said that even care homes trying to do the right thing struggle to find protective equipment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>You have this every man for himself situation where every healthcare company, every hospital, every state, is in this free market system</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou have this every man for himself situation where every healthcare company, every hospital, every state, is in this free market system where scammers and fraudsters and profiteers are charging five, six, seven, eight times the normal cost and nursing homes are always going to be losing out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged in a science experiment that\u2019s putting at risk the health of our entire population but first our healthcare workforce, and then the elderly and sick people that they take care of.\u201d</p> <p>Ewart said that more than 70 staff in the 75 nursing homes where the union has members in Florida are now in quarantine, many without sick pay which he called \u201ca disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>Mayors in Tennessee and Texas have even blamed care workers for exacerbating the danger by moving between jobs in different nursing homes or going to work despite showing Covid-19 symptoms. But care home staff are often paid minimum wage or close to it, and say they have had little choice but to carry on just to survive.</p> <p>They also say that many nursing home owners refuse to pay sick leave without a confirmed coronavirus diagnosis. The nursing assistant who spoke to the Guardian said that she works at the Ambassador home and also for a second firm seeing individual patients.</p> <p>\u201cNursing staff are living in fear.

More than 80 patients, nearly half of them coronavirus positive, were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/09/california-nursing-home-coronavirus/\">evacuated from a Riverside, California, nursing home</a> last week after most of the nursing assistants stayed away.</p> <p>Ewart said falling numbers of carers to look after patients will become a growing problem.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t figure out a way to make workers feel like their basic health is being protected \u2026 then I would expect that they are going to be people who are going to ask themselves whether they really should be doing this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nursing home owners blame low pay and poor working conditions on the economics of the industry. About 70% of long-term care homes in the US are run for profit. They rely on the Medicaid public health scheme paying for care for the bulk of their income. Nursing home owners complain that the reimbursements, which vary by state, barely cover costs. That, according to the industry trade group, the American Health Care Association, drives down staffing levels and pay, the availability of equipment and the quality of care.</p> <p>But while the accounts of many nursing homes show slim profit margins, that obscures a widespread practice in the industry of bleeding income into the owners\u2019 pockets through management contracts and other fees.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/care-suffers-as-more-nursing-homes-feed-money-into-corporate-webs/\">Kaiser Health News investigation</a> in 2017 found that nearly three-quarters of nursing homes use financial arrangements intended to suck profits out of the businesses and make it look like costs by paying fees to firms in which their owners have an interest or control. It said the arrangements ranged from renting premises owned by a sister corporation to contracting out basic functions such as management.</p> <p>The Ambassador home is part-owned by the Olympia Group which is in turn is part-owned by Villa Healthcare. Ambassador said it pays Villa for \u201cconsulting services\u201d including providing staff.</p> <p>Ewart said the industry used the claim of lack of money to weaken regulations on staffing levels in Florida, further endangering patients. The American Health Care Association has pressed the Trump administration to reduce \u201cextremely burdensome\u201d regulation including an Obama-era requirement for increased measures to prevent infections, a recurring problem in nursing homes.</p> <p>The risk of contracting Covid-19 in care homes is now so great that in California, the public health director for Los Angeles county advised families to take their loved ones out of them. But many residents don\u2019t have anywhere to go or anyone to look after them.</p> <p>\u201cMost of them, we are the only family that they have,\u201d said the nursing assistant. \u201cThey depend on us. They look forward to seeing us. They don\u2019t have access to talk to the people in the outside world. We\u2019re all that they have.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Most easy recipes are not easy. Achieving simplicity is never actually that simple, but in the kitchen it is usually also contingent on a well-trained hand and a very well-stocked pantry. This makes the genuinely easy three-ingredient recipe a holy grail of sorts.</p> <p>Here, then, the mother lode: 50 three-ingredient beauties. Some are meals in themselves. Some are a good base to build upon. Others still are a sweet something for afters. They run the gamut from \u201cblink and it\u2019s ready\u201d to a long, slow cook, but none will break the bank.

Beat 5-10 room-temperature eggs (depending on pan size) with whichever grated cheese you have (parmesan, pecorino, feta \u2026), then stir the hot veg into the eggs, and reheat the pan over a medium-high flame.</p> <p>Run a dash of oil round the edge of the pan and add the mixture, lower the heat and cook for eight minutes or so, until half set. Turn out on to a plate (this takes confidence and grace), reheat the pan to medium-high, slide the frittata back in and tuck in the edges with a spoon. Reduce the heat to low and cook for a further eight minutes, until just firm, or you have a hunch it might have just a little seductive ooze in the centre.

Bake for 30-35 minutes, until puffed up \u2013 cover with a piece of foil if it browns too quickly on the edges.</p> <h2>Berry \u2018ice-cream\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Claire Thom</strong><strong>son, cookbook author, <a href=\"http://5oclockapron.com/about\">fiveoclockapron</a><br></strong>Put 400g of frozen berries (or any frozen soft fruit, such as kiwi, mango, banana), two tablespoons of runny honey (or more to taste) and 200g of full-fat Greek yoghurt (or creme fraiche) in a blender and puree until smooth. Serve immediately.</p> <h2><strong>Almond nougat</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ciccio Sultano, Duomo, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cicciosultano1/?hl=en\">@cicciosultano1</a><br></strong>In a saucepan, melt 300g of granulated sugar and 100g of honey. In another pan, toast 100g of almonds. Once the almonds are golden, add to the sugar and caramelise for about 5-10 minutes. Remove from the heat and spread across an oiled chopping board, levelling the surface. With a long, sharp knife, cut into cubes, then leave to cool. Preserve in a glass jar.</p> <h2><strong>Roasted rhubarb with vanilla</strong></h2> <p><strong>Luisa Weiss, cookbook author, @wednesdaychef<br></strong>Heat the oven to 180C/160c fan/350F/gas mark 4. Cut 500g of rhubarb into 2-3-inch chunks and place in a baking dish. Slit one vanilla pod lengthways and scrape the seeds on to the rhubarb (or use one teaspoon of vanilla essence). Add 50g of sugar and toss gently to coat (push the bean under the rhubarb if using). Bake for 15-20 minutes, then set aside to cool (dry the bean, if used, and grind with more sugar for future use as vanilla sugar). Serve with cream or yoghurt, if you have any.</p> <h2><strong>Apple \u2018crumble\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jessica Stanley, @dailydoseofjess<br></strong>Grate an apple and sprinkle with granola. Serve with yoghurt</p> <h2>Quick crumble topping</h2> <p><strong>Henrietta Inman, cookbook author, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/henriettainman/?hl=en\">@henriettainman</a><br></strong>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4 and line a tray with parchment paper. Mix 300g of any flour (wholemeal, white, spelt, rye, gluten-free, ground nuts, desiccated coconut, oats, buckwheat \u2026) with 150g-200g of unsalted butter and 80-100g of whatever sweetness you have (any sugar, honey, maple syrup \u2026) in a free-standing mixer or with your fingertips, until it resembles breadcrumbs. Spread over the tray and bake for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Remove from the oven, chop up a little and return to the oven and bake for a further 10 minutes or until golden. Serve as is, or with fresh fruit and yoghurt, compote and cream, creme fraiche, honey and orange zest, ice cream and chocolate sauce \u2026 (You can also add anything from lemon or orange zest, vanilla, a pinch of salt, a handful of nuts or seeds, a few tsp cocoa powder, or whatever you think might work to the crumble mix).</p> <h2>Berries with chocolate mousse</h2> <p><strong>Cori Pim-Keirle, @coriandercooks<br></strong>Arrange 150g of pitted cherries, raspberries or strawberries in the bottom of of serving dishes. Melt 100g of dark chocolate in a bain marie, then set aside to cool. Pour 170ml of aquafaba (the liquid drained from a can of chickpeas) into the bowl of a stand mixer and whip on full speed until firm peaks form (This will take quite a lot longer than it would with egg whites.) Stir a large dollop of this into the cooled, melted chocolate to lighten it before very carefully folding in the rest. Be as gentle as possible to minimise any loss of air. Divide the mousse evenly over the fruit and chill for several hours to set.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2020 because an earlier version gave incorrect instructions for the feta-filled potato pops recipe.</p>",

The entry, search and seizure which occurred on 4 June 2019 were therefore unlawful. Having made this finding, it was not necessary for the Court to consider whether the warrant was invalid on the ground that s 79(3) of the Crimes Act, as it stood on 29 April 2018, infringed the implied freedom of political communication. Nor was it necessary to consider the validity of the order that had been made under s 3LA of the Crimes Act requiring Ms Smethurst to give assistance to enable a constable to access, copy or convert data on a computer or data storage device. <strong>The Court unanimously ordered that the warrant be quashed. A majority of the Court declined to grant the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs, pointing to the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to identify a sufficient right or interest that required protection by way of a mandatory injunction.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That\u2019s the key bit \u2013 Smethurst has won, but the court has not ordered the material to be deleted.

  "<p>In August 1965, thousands of young Black people in Watts set fire to the illusion that Los Angeles was a youth paradise.</p> <p>Since the debut of the TV show 77 Sunset Strip<em> </em>in 1958, followed by the first of the Gidget<em> </em>romance films in 1959 and then the Beach Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s4slliAtQU\">Surfin\u2019 USA</a> in 1963, teenagers in the rest of the country had become intoxicated with images of the endless summer that supposedly defined adolescence in southern California.</p> <p>Edited out of utopia was the existence of a rapidly growing population of more than 1 million people of African, Asian, and Mexican ancestry. Their kids were restricted to a handful of beaches; everywhere else, they risked arrest by local cops or beatings by white gangs. As a result, Black surfers were almost as rare in LA as unicorns. Economic opportunity was also rationed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47685023498aa523f06daa87ab21f6703bbcb646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47685023498aa523f06daa87ab21f6703bbcb646/0_0_3668_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surfers in Malibu, 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surfers in Malibu, 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Blair/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the first half of the 60s, hundreds of brand-new college classrooms beckoned to white kids with an offer of free higher education, while factories and construction sites begged for more workers. But failing inner-city high schools with extreme dropout rates reduced the college admissions of Black and brown youth to a small trickle. Despite virtually full employment for whites, Black youth joblessness dramatically increased, as did the index of residential segregation. If these were truly golden years of opportunity for white teenagers, their counterparts in South Central and East LA faced bleak, ultimately unendurable futures.</p> <p>But LA\u2019s streets and campuses in the 60s also provided stages for many other groups to assert demands for free speech, equality, peace and justice. Initially these protests tended to be one-issue campaigns, but the grinding forces of repression \u2013 above all the Vietnam draft and the LAPD \u2013 drew them together in formal and informal alliances.</p> <p>Thus LGBT activists coordinated actions with youth activists in protest of police and sheriffs\u2019 dragnets on Sunset Strip, in turn making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_P._Newton#%22Free_Huey!%22_Campaign\">\u201cFree Huey\u201d</a> one of their demands. When Black and Chicano high school kids \u201cblew out\u201d their campuses in 1968\u201369, several thousand white students walked out in solidarity. A brutal LAPD attack on thousands of middle-class antiwar protesters at the Century Plaza Hotel in 1967 hastened the development of a biracial coalition supporting Tom Bradley, a liberal Black council member, in his crusade to wrest City Hall from rightwing populist Sam Yorty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be714d5402da29a56d2ced56e25976f9c88c8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be714d5402da29a56d2ced56e25976f9c88c8d8/0_0_6030_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A air of Black Panther party buttons, one reading \u201cFree Huey\u201d in reference to Huey P Newton, co-founder of the party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A air of Black Panther party buttons, one reading \u2018Free Huey\u2019 in reference to Huey P Newton, co-founder of the party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Frent Collection/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the same period, the antiwar movement joined hands with the Black Panthers to form California\u2019s unique Peace and Freedom Party.

Historians of 60s protests have rarely studied the reciprocal influences and interactions across such broad spectrum of constituencies, and these linkages are too often neglected in memoirs, but they provide a principal terrain of our analysis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=true&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F3a3182a9cad601511154c87df0d0d8ffcbac505a%3Fcrop%3D0_18_665_831&amp;title=Set%20the%20Night%20on%20Fire%3A%20LA%20in%20the%20Sixties&amp;author=Mike%20Davis%20and%20Jon%20Wiener&amp;publisher=Verso&amp;link=\" data-alt=\"extract embed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&is-extract=true&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F3a3182a9cad601511154c87df0d0d8ffcbac505a%3Fcrop%3D0_18_665_831&title=Set%20the%20Night%20on%20Fire%3A%20LA%20in%20the%20Sixties&author=Mike%20Davis%20and%20Jon%20Wiener&publisher=Verso&link=\">extract embed</a> </figure>  <p>The 60s in LA have obvious bookends. The year 1960 saw the appearance of social forces that would coalesce into the movements of the era, along with the emergence of a new agenda for social change, especially around what might be called the \u201cissue of issues\u201d: racial segregation. In LA, those developments overlapped with the beginning of the regime of Sam Yorty, elected mayor in 1961. 1973, on the other hand, marked not only the end of protest in the streets but also the defeat of Yorty and the advent of the efficient, pro-business administration of Tom Bradley.</p> <p>There were also three important turning points that subdivide the long decade. 1963 was a rollercoaster year that witnessed the first: the rise and fall of the United Civil Rights Committee, the most important attempt to integrate housing, schools and jobs in LA through non-violent protest and negotiation. (Only Detroit produced a larger and more ambitious civil rights united front during what contemporaries called \u201cBirmingham Summer\u201d.) In California it brought passage of the state\u2019s first Fair Housing Act \u2013 repealed by referendum the following year in an outburst of white backlash.</p> <p>1965, of course, saw the second turning point, the so-called Watts Riots. The third, 1969, began as a year of hope with a strong coalition of white liberals, Blacks and newly minted Chicanos supporting Bradley for mayor. He led the polls until election eve, when Yorty counterattacked with a vicious barrage of racist and red-baiting appeals to white voters. Bradley\u2019s defeat foreclosed, at least for the foreseeable future, any concessions to the city\u2019s minorities or liberal voters. Moreover, it was immediately followed by sinister campaigns, involving the FBI, the district attorney\u2019s office, and both the LAPD and LA county sheriffs, to destroy the Panthers, Brown Berets and other radical groups.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a83d602c182aeffbdde33daf023237aa1bcb5d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a83d602c182aeffbdde33daf023237aa1bcb5d21/0_0_2676_1606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Didion evoked a sense of dread in her essay collection The White Album.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joan Didion evoked a sense of dread in her essay collection The White Album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Wasser/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the true context underlying the creeping sense of dread and imminent chaos famously evoked by Joan Didion in her 1979 essay collection, The White Album. If \u201chelter skelter\u201d was unleashed after 1970, the Manson gang were bit players compared to the institutions of law and order. For the past half century, a number of stereotypes have framed our recollections of this age of revolt, but the Los Angeles experience confounds most cliches. In the standard narrative, for instance, college students, organized as Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and the Free Speech Movement (FSM) in Berkeley, were the principal social actors, and the great engine rooms of protest were found at huge public university campuses in places like Berkeley, Madison, Ann Arbor, and Kent. (The exceptions, according to this narrative, were some historical Black colleges and Ivy League Columbia.)</p> <p>In Los Angeles, however, it was junior and senior high schools that were the principal battlefields, and the majority of protesters were Black and brown. Indeed, as many as 20,000 inner-city teenagers and their white Westside allies participated in walkouts and demonstrations between 1967 and 1970. Members of college radical groups as well as the Black Panther party played significant roles as advisers to these protests, but the \u201cindigenous\u201d teenage leadership was most important. These struggles recruited hundreds of kids to groups like the Panthers and Brown Berets and gave birth to a unique high school New Left formation, the \u201cRed Tide\u201d.</p> <p>The terrain of college protest in Los Angeles also differed from that of the mainstream. Of the two flagship local universities, the University of Southern California was a citadel of campus Republicanism, birthplace of Nixon\u2019s so-called \u201cUSC Mafia\u201d (and, as it turned out, the alma mater of several Watergate conspirators). UCLA, for its part, saw only episodic mass protests, most notably during Nixon\u2019s invasion of Cambodia in spring 1970. The real homes of sustained student activism were the three inner-city community colleges (LA City College, Southwest College and East LA College), along with Cal State LA and Valley State (later Cal State, Northridge).</p> <p>The latter was the site of a 1969\u201370 uprising by the Black Student Union and SDS that was quelled by police batons, mass arrests, and a staggering 1,730 felony charges against Black students: repression on a scale that rivaled or exceeded the more famous battles at San Francisco State.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b750cc5fbed2188e1af4df5c06881a2f1f198b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b750cc5fbed2188e1af4df5c06881a2f1f198b0/0_0_3656_2439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Panther minister of information, Eldridge Cleaver, addresses an estimated 7,500 students at UCLA in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Black Panther minister of information, Eldridge Cleaver, addresses an estimated 7,500 students at UCLA in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Historians and political scientists have generally conceded that the one hundred or so ghetto insurrections of the 1960s should be regarded as genuine protests, but they have usually described them as leading to mere chaos and demoralization.

This does not describe events in Los Angeles.</p> <p>The 1965 explosion unified and energized a generation of young Black people, ended gang conflict for a number of years, and catalyzed the extraordinary \u201cWatts Renaissance\u201d, the city\u2019s most important arts and literary movement of the decade. \u201cBlack Power\u201d became an aspiration shared by thousands, and in 1967 this grassroots unity found expression in the emergence of LA\u2019s Black Congress \u2013 the more radical successor to the United Civil Rights Committee. It included SNCC, the Black Student Alliance, the Che-Lumumba Club of the Communist Party, the Black Panthers, and the powerful Us organization (or Organization Us) led by Ron Karenga. (The congress would later be destroyed by a violent conflict between Us and the Panthers, instigated and fueled by the FBI\u2019s secret Cointelpro program.)</p> <p>Contests over public space were also extraordinarily important in Los Angeles. In part this was the legacy of earlier decades when the LAPD\u2019s notorious Red Squad had been the enforcer of the anti-union \u201copen shop\u201d doctrine, and when city hall supplied draconian anti-picketing and anti\u2013free speech ordinances. The 60s saw a renewal of this unsavory tradition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f57d83beee36261aa6b584cbeb09b74f02ec69a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f57d83beee36261aa6b584cbeb09b74f02ec69a/0_0_2992_2078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police search African American youths in 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police search African American youths in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The LAPD, aided by the LA county sheriffs, conducted an unending siege of bohemian Venice, tried to drive \u201cteenyboppers\u201d and hippies off Sunset Strip, regularly broke up peaceful \u201clove-ins\u201d and rallies in Griffith and Elysian Parks, suppressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/12/lowrider-the-diy-car-mag-that-became-a-chicano-voice-of-resistance\">lowriders</a> on Whittier Boulevard, harassed kids selling the \u201cunderground\u201d LA Free Press, raided coffeehouses and folk clubs, and invoked \u201cobscenity\u201d as an excuse to crack down on artists, poets and theater groups. No other major city outside of the deep south was subjected to such a fanatic and all-encompassing campaign to police space and control the night. Along with minorities, many young whites were also routinely victimized, leading hatred of the LAPD to grow into a common culture of resistance.</p> <p>The cops, however, had a formidable opponent in the ACLU of Southern California, the national organization\u2019s most hard-charging and activist affiliate. When national ACLU director Roger Baldwin and a majority of the national leadership publicly embraced anti-communism in the late 1940s, AL Wirin, ACLU SoCal\u2019s legendary chief counsel, pointedly challenged the ban on representing Communist party members in trial proceedings, taking on several cases in private practice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/black-panther-party-oakland-free-breakfast-50th-anniversary\">'One of the biggest, baddest things we did': Black Panthers' free breakfasts, 50 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moreover, in 1952, the local branch chose as its new director Eason Monroe, a state college professor from San Francisco who had been fired for refusing to sign a loyalty oath. A decade later, Monroe charted a novel course for the affiliate by not only defending the local civil rights coalition in court but also joining in its leadership. Significantly, it was an ACLU team, led by UCLA professor John Caughey and his wife LaRee, that launched the legendary 1963 lawsuit to force integration of LA\u2019s de facto Jim Crow school system \u2013 an effort that would reverberate for three decades. No other ACLU branch claimed such a large role in the decade\u2019s protest movements.</p> <p>Understanding Los Angeles in the 60s also requires rewriting the histories of gay liberation and the women\u2019s movement. Indeed, New York City was not the origin and center of everything. Los Angeles had the first gay street protest in America \u2013 over police raids on the Black Cat Bar in Silver Lake, two years before the Stonewall uprising; it had the first gay church \u2013 the Metropolitan community church, now the largest gay institution in the world; and it had the first officially recognized gay pride parade \u2013 on Hollywood Boulevard in 1970. LA also witnessed the nation\u2019s first police raid on a women\u2019s health clinic, following which the organizers were tried for \u201cpracticing medicine without a license\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, the course of events in Los Angeles challenged the myth that the \u201cOld Left\u201d was irrelevant in the 60s and that the New Left had invented itself ex nihilo. The Communist party, for its part, never appears in the standard narrative except as an unattractive corpse. But in Los Angeles its most unruly and dissident branch remained very much alive under the charismatic and eventually heretical leadership of Dorothy Healey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af41ea60a95dcce6e21807383b41dd0aab864153\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af41ea60a95dcce6e21807383b41dd0aab864153/0_0_1280_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two young Chicano men during a protest in Los Angeles, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two young Chicano men during a protest in Los Angeles, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/David Fenton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the party\u2019s devastating losses following Soviet secretary Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s 1956 Crimes of Stalin speech, Healey was determined to resurrect what she could of the 1940s Popular Front and to reach out to the new radicals on campus, in the ghettos and in the barrios. Still under the threat of a prison sentence, she found a niche at KPFK, the new 75,000-watt Pacifica Radio FM station, in 1959, where her Communist Commentary<em> </em>impressed even hostile listeners with its intelligence and wit \u2013 although it almost cost the station its license. In 1966 she ran in the primary for county tax assessor and received a staggering 85,000 votes. By then the local Communist party had confidentially rebuilt many of its links with progressives in the Democratic party and had assumed an important role in the Peace Action Council. Its youth members, relatively unconstrained by a party line or adult control, played innovative roles in the early 60s, including participation in Southern Freedom Rides, and later, more influentially, as the Che-Lumumba Club \u2013 which would become the political base of Angela Davis. For two generations Healey defined radicalism in the public eye.</p> <p>This is a \u201cmovement history\u201d of Los Angeles that looks at the city from the vantage points of its flatland neighborhoods and bohemian beaches where the young heroes of this story lived. We have tried to give human faces to social forces, to understand rebellion as a constant debate about goals and tactics, and to recall the passions of struggle, especially the power of love. It was also important to describe in some detail the machinery of racial oppression that kept good schools, well-paid jobs and suburban homes out of the reach of people living inside the city\u2019s ghettos and barrios.</p> <p>At epic moments in the long decade \u2013 the United Civil Rights campaign in 1963, the Watts uprising in 1965, and the wave of high school revolts from 1966 to 1969 \u2013 the movement tried mightily to break through to the other side, only to face the batons and drawn guns of the LAPD. By 1973, repression had dug nearly 100 graves and put more than 10,000 protesters in jail or prison. An enormous effort has been made to trivialize the 60s and to bury its dreams in a pauper\u2019s grave. But its unruly ghost, like that of the 1930s, still shakes its chains in the nightmares of elites.</p> <ul> <li><p>Set the Night on Fire: LA in the Sixties, by Mike Davis and Jon Wiener (Verso), is out now</p></li> </ul>",

Now I am the one telling everyone else to hurry up and read it. Check this out: a missionary takes his wife and daughters from Georgia to the Belgian Congo, and within months the family tragically unravels. Told in multiple voices over three decades, we chart their reconstruction, as individuals and as a family, against the backdrop of a changing Africa. I tell you, this book burn my heart. Plus, the writing is glorious.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/commonwealth-9781408880364.html\">Commonwealth by Ann Patchett</a></strong><br>Some people does go looking for trouble. In Commonwealth it started with a kiss, and next thing two marriages mash up and children blending in a new setup. Old folks like me will remember television\u2019s perfect blended family \u2013 The Brady Bunch. This is no Brady Bunch. The children of the Keating-Cousins family pass through neglect, death and everything in between. Nonetheless, memory, duty and affection weave through this imperfect family, and we long for them to find peace.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-lonely-londoners-9780141188416.html\">The Lonely Londoners by Sam Selvon</a></strong><br>When rain fall, sheep and goat does have to mix. That was how the Windrush generation of Caribbean immigrants survived and thrived while navigating an unwelcoming, racist London. Follow the antics of unforgettable characters such as Moses, Cap, Sir Galahad and Tanty who, with humour and grit, form a family of sorts. Selvon was a boss. What he was doing in his writing in the 1950s remains profoundly inspiring.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/one-hundred-years-of-solitude-9781857152234.html\">One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez</a></strong><br>I didn\u2019t know that playing the fool in Se\u00f1ora Yamin-Ali\u2019s Spanish classes would come back to bite my tail.

Adebayo explores this with empathy and humour. After years of pain and betrayal, Yejide and Akin have children, but it comes at a steep price. Remember, it takes two fingers to kill a louse, and two people being honest for a family to survive.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-argonauts-9780993414916.html\">The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson</a><br></strong>Another memoir and I ain\u2019t go lie \u2013 this is a difficult read, layering theory and the author\u2019s life with the artist <a href=\"http://harrydodge.com/works/sculptures/\">Harry Dodge</a>.

  "<p>If you\u2019re attempting to work from home, a conundrum has probably presented itself: how can you get anything done in a distracting environment amid unsettled times?</p> <p>Your streaming service or record collection may hold the answer. Beyond providing background noise, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4197792/\">music has been shown</a> to improve both productivity and cognitive performance, especially in adults. Listening to music can help people manage anxiety, become motivated and stay productive. You just need to know how to make the right playlist.</p> <h2><strong>Start off slow</strong></h2> <p>Kick off the day with a trick from music therapy. The concept is known as the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mtp/article-abstract/33/1/45/1134120\">iso principle</a>, which is a technique therapists use to alter the mood of a patient. The therapist will match music to how the patient is feeling, and then gradually alter the songs to achieve the desired mood state.</p> <p>The songs at the beginning of the playlist shouldn\u2019t force you into a state of productivity, but they should gradually bring you there. While song choice will vary by person, Kirsten Nelson, a music therapist at the University of Iowa Stead family children\u2019s hospital, suggests tracks like Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles and Ooh Child, by the Five Stairsteps as places to start.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling really down in the morning, then find something peaceful to start with,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cFrom there, you can bring yourself into a more motivating song to achieve the state you want.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Transition into a \u2018</strong><strong>power song</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Researchers have found that a faster track speed can result in increased performance. In <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793214\">one study</a> that examined the relationship between music tempo and productivity, most test subjects performed best while listening to songs paced at <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.00948.x\">around 121bpm</a>. This is about as fast as tracks like Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Call Me Maybe, Whitney Houston\u2019s I Wanna Dance with Somebody, and I Will Survive, by Diana Ross.</p> <p>Nelson refers to this phenomenon as finding the \u201cpower song\u201d, which can used to motivate the listener to be productive. \u201cI think that music can activate people in a way that other things cannot,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking to get into a place where we might have some more energy and motivation, a power song can be very helpful.\u201d Nelson says that adding power songs at strategic points in a work playlist, such as right when the day starts, while transitioning between tasks, and as the day ends, can help maintain motivation.</p> <h2><strong>Rethink your lyrics</strong></h2> <p>Nelson says that the choice to include lyrical tracks in a playlist should depend on individual preference. While <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/music-and-productivity/\">research suggests</a> that listening to upbeat, complex music can help workers stay alert and motivated while performing repetitive tasks, narrative lyrics can be distracting to those trying to do cognitive work. The bulk of a work playlist should include songs with innocuous or subtlely performed lyrics, such as those by artists like Grouper, Brian Eno and Jenny Hval. For those who prefer non-lyrical music, music by Dawn of Midi, Steve Reich and John Adams are great places to start.</p> <p>And, while lyrics can be a powerful motivator, don\u2019t automatically reach for your favorite tracks. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0305735611422672?journalCode=poma&amp;utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier\">One study</a> found a decrease in performance while listening to songs characterized as \u201cfamiliar vocal music\u201d. The research suggests that, while it is <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0305735610387777?journalCode=poma&amp;utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier\">important to listen to enjoyable music</a>, songs that are very familiar can be distracting.</p> <h2><strong>Be flexible with yourself</strong></h2> <p>Creating a work-from-home playlist should never feel like a chore. Rather, it can be something that accretes over time. \u201cIf you hear a song and know that it makes you feel good, pop it into a playlist,\u201d says Nelson. As the playlist grows, arrange tracks in the order that makes sense for the way you work. \u201cAllow yourself permission to listen to new music, try out new things, take things out, bring things in,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cAllow yourself that flexibility.\u201d If you don\u2019t feel like listening to your playlist, you don\u2019t have to.</p> <h2>Suggested productivity playlist</h2> <p>Tracks 1-4 are for transitioning into work. Tracks 5-16 are good tracks for when you\u2019re in the flow. Tracks 17-20 are for transitioning back out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/40QljUm3zCYLyAuyokMzJa?si=RMHMBfeMQkKqpJuZdNe17g\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/40QljUm3zCYLyAuyokMzJa\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p>\n    <p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigour to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhoea.

  "<p>The UK government\u2019s urgent efforts to ramp up coronavirus testing are being led by a hereditary peer and former corporate lobbyist who gave money to health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s failed Conservative party leadership campaign.</p> <p>Lord Bethell, a Tory party donor with limited ministerial experience, was hastily appointed last month as an unpaid minister at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) where he is understood to have been made \u201clead minister\u201d for testing.</p> <p>Bethell, who until June 2018 ran an influential lobbying firm in Westminster, chaired Hancock\u2019s unsuccessful leadership bid last year and donated \u00a35,000 to the campaign, according to Electoral Commission data. He made a separate donation to the Conservatives later in 2019.</p> <p>The peer, who now works directly for Hancock, has one of the most important ministerial portfolios in the government\u2019s response to Covid-19 as it races to meet its target of conducting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. Testing is seen as critical to stopping the spread of the deadly virus and easing lockdown conditions.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Bethell has steered emergency legislation through the House of Lords, headed the DHSC\u2019s emergency procurement efforts, and held discussions with senior US and Chinese government officials.</p> <p>The new minister, otherwise known as the fifth Baron Bethell, entered the Lords in 2018 after winning a hereditary peers\u2019 byelection, decided by an electorate of 47 Conservative hereditary peers. Bethell\u2019s peerage was originally bestowed on his great-grandfather in 1922.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. But no reliable national database exists to track their deaths. As of 14 April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 deaths among health workers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-health-care-worker-death-toll-higher-official-data-suggests\">but our reporting shows that is likely a vast undercount</a>. </p> <p>Some of these deaths are preventable. Across the world, healthcare workers face a disproportionate risk of severe infection from coronavirus due to their high exposure to sick patients. But in the US, a lack of preparedness for the pandemic increased that risk. Inadequate access to testing among the general population, a nationwide shortage of protective gear such as N95 masks, and lack of basic supplies like hand sanitizer are driving up the death toll among health workers.</p> <p>Collectively, our healthcare workforce has already saved thousands of lives. And in the face of a pandemic so dangerous that families can\u2019t visit sick relatives, these workers are often the last people to comfort the dying. But some won\u2019t make it themselves. While we can\u2019t profile everyone in depth, our goal is to mark every death that we can confirm. The nationwide database we create will allow us to identify patterns and find new stories about the unfolding pandemic and its impact on healthcare workers, shedding light on the workings, and failings, of the healthcare system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Lost%20on%20the%20frontline&amp;description=This%20story%20is%20part%20of%20Lost%20on%20the%20frontline%2C%20a%20project%20from%20the%20Guardian%20and%20Kaiser%20Health%20News%20that%20aims%20to%20document%20the%20life%20of%20every%20healthcare%20worker%20in%20America%20who%20dies%20from%20Covid-19%20during%20the%20pandemic.%20&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Flost-on-the-frontline&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=Nurses%2C%20surgeons%2C%20janitors%3A%20the%20first%20US%20health%20workers%20to%20die%20from%20Covid-19&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F15%2Fnurses-surgeons-janitors-first-us-health-workers-to-die-covid-19&amp;link-2-headline=Help%20us%20document%20the%20US%20healthcare%20workers%20who%20die%20fighting%20coronavirus&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F15%2Fnurses-surgeons-janitors-first-us-health-workers-to-die-covid-19&amp;link-3-headline=Coronavirus%20is%20killing%20far%20more%20US%20health%20workers%20than%20official%20data%20suggests&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F15%2Fcoronavirus-us-health-care-worker-death-toll-higher-official-data-suggests\" data-alt=\"embed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Lost%20on%20the%20frontline&description=This%20story%20is%20part%20of%20Lost%20on%20the%20frontline%2C%20a%20project%20from%20the%20Guardian%20and%20Kaiser%20Health%20News%20that%20aims%20to%20document%20the%20life%20of%20every%20healthcare%20worker%20in%20America%20who%20dies%20from%20Covid-19%20during%20the%20pandemic.%20&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Flost-on-the-frontline&links=true&link-1-headline=Nurses%2C%20surgeons%2C%20janitors%3A%20the%20first%20US%20health%20workers%20to%20die%20from%20Covid-19&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F15%2Fnurses-surgeons-janitors-first-us-health-workers-to-die-covid-19&link-2-headline=Help%20us%20document%20the%20US%20healthcare%20workers%20who%20die%20fighting%20coronavirus&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F15%2Fnurses-surgeons-janitors-first-us-health-workers-to-die-covid-19&link-3-headline=Coronavirus%20is%20killing%20far%20more%20US%20health%20workers%20than%20official%20data%20suggests&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F15%2Fcoronavirus-us-health-care-worker-death-toll-higher-official-data-suggests\">embed</a> </figure>  <p>Our count will include any healthcare worker who was likely exposed while helping patients with Covid-19 during the pandemic.

Rambo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe, more accurately, it was Rambo that stopped me watching Rocky. But I blame President Reagan for Rambo. He began office invoking a vigorous America <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpPt7xGx4Xo\">armed with the weapon of freedom</a>. The movie industry interpreted his vision by arming itself with jingoism. Let\u2019s call it Hollywood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZLLKwFpFG4\">Red Dawn</a>.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t some out-of-touch pinko lefty. No. I had surfed Thatcher\u2019s economic revolution: my student house had a rented video recorder. We watched Escape to Victory, the patriotic tale of a simple goalkeeper (Stallone) who defeats the Nazis with cunning, Bobby Moore and Pel\u00e9. We searched the video shop for his other sporting picture, which he wrote and starred in, about an underdog boxer from Philadelphia who unexpectedly gets a shot at the world title. But it was out that day, so we rented First Blood instead, in which a troubled Vietnam vet and his hunting knife defiantly resist bent, rule-breaking lawmen in a forest. It was impressively watchable.</p> <p>That summer, however, a cinema trailer came out for its sequel, Rambo \u2013 with the vet back in the Vietnamese jungle, blasting the People\u2019s Army to hell with a helicopter gunship. There had, I couldn\u2019t help but notice, been a tonal shift.</p> <p>By the time the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_rUNg_eNwE\">Rocky IV trailer</a> appeared soon after, with its stars-and-stripes shorts and Drago the cartoon doped-up Soviet villain, I felt the die was cast. Stallone\u2019s canon was no longer for me \u2013 as if I had fallen on the wrong side of a cultural divide (not unlike Brexiters and Remoaners in 2019) \u2013 and Rocky\u2019s back story got slung out along with it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2zFQmHWVCI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2zFQmHWVCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ding, ding. Round two. My teenage sons wanted to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/17/creed-review-life-in-the-old-punchbag-yet-sylvester-stallone-rocky-balboa-michael-b-jordan-adonis\">Creed</a>, and I caved because The Wire had given me a soft spot for Michael B Jordan. It barrelled along with verve, Stallone punched his weight (also, big up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tony-bellew\">Tony Bellew</a>), but I got the distinct feeling I was watching an old story being rehashed \u2013 what cinema psychologists call \u201cStar Wars trilogy syndrome\u201d. I began to feel it was time to settle my score with the original. Lockdown made it happen. I have a Philadelphian friend in the next street. By state law, he is required to own a complete six-film box set of the Rocky saga. I offered to be neighbourly and save him from having to watch it all again. We arranged a safe-distance handover on his doorstep \u2013 and I threw my arms in the air.</p> <p>Of course I did. It\u2019s the most famous scene from the movie, the journeyman boxer\u2019s mazy training run \u2013 set to a stirring theme \u2013 that ends on the steps of the art museum imagining being crowned champion. Tourists, spoofers and comics copy it every week (Rob Brydon did it in The Trip to Greece just the other day). I\u2019d seen it replayed a thousand times. But I wasn\u2019t expecting the film that was wrapped around it.</p> <p>Rocky\u2019s America is bleak \u2013 kitchen-sink drama bleak. He lives in a grimy brown apartment, with just a tankful of turtles, a hi-fi and a colander for company. Outdoors, it\u2019s all trains, postindustrial wastelands and biting cold. The only warmth to be found is at the pet shop, where there are cute puppies and a shy assistant he nurses a passion for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c262b12d4ad42ace1626cd0cc13fd2e727dbf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c262b12d4ad42ace1626cd0cc13fd2e727dbf9/0_0_2576_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warmth \u2026 Rocky takes his girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), to the ice rink.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warmth \u2026 Rocky takes his girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), to the ice rink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aquarius/Allstar/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also comes across as real: working-class lives with small horizons, harsh words and dead-end jobs at the meatpacking factory. It has heart: the boxing promoter who sets up Rocky\u2019s title fight, when a contender drops out, does so with good grace not cynicism; the loan shark Rocky works for gives him cash to spend on training without demanding a return. The fight, when it comes, fills Rocky with self-doubt \u2013 and the outcome is not a sugary victory but a personal triumph. He goes the distance, proves something to himself, and wins the girl. Good on you, Italian Stallion.</p> <p>I\u2019m not surprised it won a sentimental Academy Award. Even though it\u2019s hard and grubby, it\u2019s a more heartening vision of America than the ones on show in its best picture Oscar rivals, Network and All the President\u2019s Men (or, indeed, Carrie and Taxi Driver, which tussled for prizes that year, too). I\u2019m not surprised, either, that Americans ended up demanding a more colourful future.</p> <p>Since I had the box set \u2026 I watched Rocky IV as well. It is truly terrible. In a world no longer just brown and grey, Rocky\u2019s house is a Greek-columned mansion with a Lamborghini on the drive, a robot butler and an immigrant housekeeper to manage the colanders. He wears Hugo Boss sweatshirts. The story unfolds in one synthpop-video montage after another. And, of course, he beats the commie who\u2019s nine feet taller than him and could knock a rhino out cold, because Rocky is an American filled with the power of freedom.</p> <p>One last thing: in the fascinating <a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sreference/films-viewed-by-president-and-mrs-reagan\">official list of films</a> Ronald and Nancy Reagan watched during his office on their weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/movie-night-with-the-reagans\">movie nights</a>, Rambo does not appear. They watched Rocky III, though, and Rocky IV (followed the night after by Hannah and Her Sisters). In a divided world, even hyper-nationalists need some light relief.</p>",

  "<p>There are parts of Mrs America, a nine-episode mini-series for FX on Hulu, in which it flexes its full-budget cable bona fides: good bouffant wigs, expensive 70s-styled sets, a megawatt cast. It has not one, but two character-cementing power walks for its star, Cate Blanchett, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/obituaries/phyllis-schlafly-conservative-leader-and-foe-of-era-dies-at-92.html\">Phyllis Schlafly</a>, the anti-feminist conservative activist <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12817756/phyllis-schlafly-dies-started-war-on-women\">justifiably loathed</a> by many Americans. In the first, she silently saunters down a pageant runway in a patriotic swimsuit, game to put looks ahead of intellect. In the second, halfway through the first episode, she marches into the Capitol soundtracked by Steppenwolf\u2019s Magic Carpet Ride, a pink tweed dress walking against feminist protesters outside and blue-suited men within. It\u2019s a bold proposal, to ride through the 1970s\u2019 women\u2019s movement and counter-revolution with an icon of the religious right, and in Blanchett\u2019s hands, it\u2019s electric.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/05/devs-tv-review-alex-garland\">Devs review \u2013 Alex Garland's elegant but flawed big tech thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s also a splashy contrast to the show\u2019s strength: thorny conversations and the personal moments which form movements, for better or for worse. Though it can at times wade into wonky thickets (primary delegates, how do those work?), Mrs America is a punchy disco-ball of a show, a full portrait of Schlafly\u2019s root in the women\u2019s campaign against women and such second-wave feminist icons as Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba) and Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman).</p> <p>It\u2019s a tricky move to base a show around the fight over the Equal Rights Amendment, a piece of legislation first introduced in 1923 to enshrine protection from discrimination by sex in the constitution. Trickier still to make the linchpin Schlafly, the anti-feminist, anti-gay \u201cfamily values\u201d crusader whose coalition of conservatives tanked the ERA, once a bipartisan surefire, in the course of a decade. But Mrs America, created by Mad Men writer Dahvi Waller, mines the past for conflicts and contradictions with contemporary relevance, splicing warm-hued archival footage with deeply researched scripts with a roving structure. Each episode focuses on one woman (as go the titles \u2013 Gloria, Shirley, Betty etc) as she navigates the public fight for equal rights amid the personal struggles for opportunity, unity and political coherence in one\u2019s private life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIpTIPKTOkU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OIpTIPKTOkU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a common and familiar theme of principles versus practicality in these stories. Byrne, in particular, is excellent as Steinem, the media darling of independent womanhood grappling with her role as a leader who instinctively attracts publicity. Aduba\u2019s Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president in 1972, is a deep well of unfathomable confidence and frustration at the compromises made for progress. Margo Martindale takes no prisoners as Representative Bella Abzug, an organizer of the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, and Elizabeth Banks pinch-hits as Jill Ruckelshaus, a Republican feminist alarmed by the rise of Schlafly\u2019s far-right strain in her party. Feminist-focusing moments speak to contemporary struggles at coalition building, such as how a space like Steinem\u2019s Ms Magazine is less amenable to black feminists like editor Margaret Sloan (Bria Henderson) than its utopian vision admits.</p> <p>And punch for punch there\u2019s Schlafly, the focus of the first episode and, for lack of a better term, humanized anti-hero of the show\u2019s feminist vision. Mrs America takes pains to color in the black-and-white dichotomy \u2013 Schlafly and her Eagle Forum bad, feminists good \u2013 with which most viewers will probably enter. In Washington, Schlafly is cut off from her missile strategy spiel by a congressman who wants her to take notes; the men continue without her as she fetches a pen. She comes home to her husband Fred (John Slattery) weary; he wants to have sex, she doesn\u2019t.

Elements of this work into series subplots: Schlafly\u2019s anti-gay agenda traps her beloved eldest son in the closet, and her home is run by black women on staff and her spinster sister. But I\u2019d argue that like The Americans, another prestige FX project set in late cold-war America, Mrs America burrows into the loyalties, betrayals and motivations of \u201cthem\u201d without condoning the implications of their actions; Schlafly\u2019s abetting of the Klan in her coalition, though presented here as a tactical move for numbers, says volumes about her politics.</p> <p>Schlafly ultimately won the battle \u2013 the ERA died in 1982 three states short of ratification, and the election of her dream candidate, Ronald Reagan, ends the series. But the war continues. Waller <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tvs-top-5-inside-star-studded-world-mrs-america-1289706\">has said</a> she began the project before the 2016 election, before the #MeToo movement, before a widespread state-level crackdown on abortion access, before select states <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805647054/house-votes-to-revive-equal-rights-amendment-removing-ratification-deadline\">revived the fight</a> to ratify the ERA by rescinding the deadline. Whether or not you see prestige anti-hero treatment as illuminating or obfuscating the connections between Schlafly\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d values and Make America Great Again is, I suppose, a matter of how you fill the void behind Schlafly\u2019s steely composure in a flawlessly executed series. But there\u2019s no doubt an intoxicating thrill in tracing how, exactly, we got here.</p> <ul> <li><p>Mrs America begins on Hulu on 15 April with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>At the press of a button on my mobile phone the camera swings left and a breathless voice explains that we are looking at T\u00edndholmur, a jagged sliver of rock in the sea channel off the Faroese village of B\u00f8ur. I can press a button to go left or right, and up or down. Rather cruelly, the on-screen controls also allow me to make the guide \u201crun\u201d and, bizarrely, \u201cjump\u201d on the spot. I can\u2019t resist as the camera pans down onto a black sand beach and the disembodied voice declares (even more breathlessly) that he really enjoys running on sand. The highlight of this atavistic performance is when an anonymous user makes the guide head for slippery rocks and an incoming wave swamps his legs and feet, prompting a shout of \u201cOh God, I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d</p> <p>An hour passes quickly in the online company of Levi, my guide, a former player for the Faroe Islands\u2019 national football team, who is still very fit. Though it\u2019s fair to say that at the end of it I have seen rather too much of the half-dozen alleyways of B\u00f8ur, which is home to only about 70 people. However, as the camera is propelled up and down the quiet roads and in between turf-roofed houses, I am immersed in the sounds and sights of the Faroes, rugged hills, misty sea-scapes and colourful grazing sheep.</p> <p>In fact, this is not a computer game but an experience provided by a camera being worn by a real person \u2013 a \u201ctour guide\u201d \u2013 who responds to commands from anonymous people anywhere in the world. I feel like I\u2019ve been back in the islands enjoying the fresh Atlantic breeze.

Coronavirus has ended that ambition, but to combat at least some of those losses and keep the destination fresh in people\u2019s minds, a new interactive online guide service has been launched. According to Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 H\u00f8jgaard, director of <a href=\"http://www.visitfaroeislands.com/\">Visit Faroe Islands</a>, the remotely operated guide is \u201ca unique platform to allow people in isolation to take a walk across our wild landscapes and regain a sense of freedom\u201d.</p> <p>The guides may be in kayaks, on horseback or hiking around the mountain villages. Being halfway between Shetland and Iceland has always meant that the Faroese have had to rely on their wits to survive. Scaling the cliffs to catch seabirds, herding sheep in the mountains or braving the North Atlantic in small fishing boats have, until very recently, all been an essential part of survival for the islands\u2019 50,000 people. And they have relied on their wits to market their islands, too. H\u00f8jgaard was tasked with doubling Faroes tourist revenues over the past five years, and 2019 saw more than 100,000 visitors to the 18 islands.</p> <p>She has overseen a number of innovative marketing schemes in the past few years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/nov/02/faroe-islands-added-to-google-street-view-sheep-cameras\">In 2017 it was Sheep View</a>, where cameras were attached to some of the islands\u2019 80,000 sheep in a spoof version of Google Street View, and last year it was announced that for one weekend the country was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/feb/20/faroe-islands-closed-for-maintenance-voluntourism-sustainability\">Closed for Maintenance</a>, and open only to 100 foreign volunteers who could travel to the islands to help maintain paths, erect signposts and landscape viewpoints at some of the most well trammelled beauty spots.</p> <p>The remotely steered Faroese tours will be online twice daily at 2pm and 5pm (BST) for a period of 10 days initially. Users will have two minutes of control over the guide, who all speak English, but can rejoin the queue any number of times. The ability to operate a live streaming service smoothly is dependent on the islands\u2019 super-fast broadband connections, which cover almost all of the territory and mean that, in spite of the remote location, internet download speeds are faster than in London, and second only to South Korea.</p> <p>Having invested heavily in tourism marketing over the past few years, the current crisis has hit just when two 200-room hotels were about to open in the capital, T\u00f3rshavn, and the capital\u2019s prestigious Hotel F\u00f8royar is halfway through an ambitious building programme to double its room capacity. This was the year that should have seen bed-nights double to a total of 200,000 \u2013 excluding an unspecified number of Airnbnb rooms.</p> <p><strong>Tim Ecott\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://www.rcwlitagency.com/books/the-land-of-maybe-a-faroe-islands-year/\">The Land of Maybe: A Faroe Islands Year</a> (Short Books, \u00a314.99)</strong></p>",
  "<p>Midway through Dima Wannous\u2019s novel, the narrator recalls a neighbour who fell sick during a dire shortage of doctors and medicine. The woman\u2019s daughter had to take time off work to hunt for a hospital bed. \u201cSo, silently, I begged my own mother not to fall ill,\u201d she says, to \u201cnot contract a virus or other disease.\u201d</p> <p>As well as having a chilling resonance today, the anecdote offers a glimpse of daily life for millions of Syrians since the 2011 revolution. Almost five years after the uprising began, many doctors have left a country mired in civil war, where the price of medicines has sky-rocketed. Yet in Wannous\u2019s ambitious, multilayered second novel \u2013 which was shortlisted for the 2018 International prize for Arabic fiction \u2013 the threat of disease is just one of many reasons to live in fear.</p> <p>The novel opens in a psychotherapist\u2019s waiting room in Damascus where, years earlier, the narrator Suleima met her lover, Naseem. She is an artist with anorexia who has panic attacks, while Naseem, a doctor and writer, slaps his face compulsively. After the uprising begins, he leaves for Germany \u2013 a loss that compounds her grief over the deaths of men in her family. Naseem sends her a novel manuscript from his new country with a narrator, Salma, whose life closely resembles her own: \u201cNaseem stole me and wrote me into his novel.\u201d This manuscript\u2019s first-person chapters alternate with Suleima\u2019s.</p> <p>Fleeing to Beirut, Suleima returns periodically to her analyst Kamil\u2019s couch in the Syrian capital. As she moves between \u201cbrutal\u201d Damascus, with its checkpoints and Mukhabarat spies, and the \u201cdark loneliness\u201d of exile, the sources of the couple\u2019s anxiety are revealed. Suleima ceased painting in 2012, when her brother disappeared after taking part in the protests. Naseem\u2019s family was killed in the shelling of Homs. Being from that city is enough to get him detained in a hellishly overcrowded cell and beaten with a metal hose. Though his deepest fear is the sea, his only escape is via the Mediterranean.</p> <p>A complex tale of revolution, displacement, delusional love and the psychoanalyst\u2019s couch, <em>The Frightened Ones</em> explores the psychological fallout from living under a brutal dictatorship in a bitterly riven society. It deploys dreams and Freudian interpretation in the context of a police state where torture is an instrument of control, and fear is anything but irrational. The name of the \u201ceternal leader\u201d<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jun/15/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1\"> Hafez al-Assad</a> \u2013 whose 1970 coup founded the 50-year dynasty his son Bashir now heads \u2013 is first invoked by a madman urinating from a window on passers-by.</p> <p>The revolution and crackdown stir suppressed memories of one of the regime\u2019s worst atrocities, the 1982 massacre that ended a Sunni uprising in Hama, which Suleima\u2019s family fled. While her late father never spoke of it, her mother blamed him for cowardice. Fear, the novel suggests, can be both inherited and indoctrinated. Suleima recalls pressure at school to spout the party line on Hama (\u201cOur Father the Leader has bloodied his hands for the whole Syrian people\u201d), and being terrified by the instructor\u2019s \u201ccryptic smile\u201d. As sectarian vitriol erupts, family rifts mirror fissures in the nation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0d257c340322967b642baa783e675610929c4cb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d257c340322967b642baa783e675610929c4cb4/87_62_1017_610/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Power and subtlety \u2026 Dima Wannous\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power and subtlety \u2026 Dima Wannous</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Damascus-born Wannous, who studied French literature at the Sorbonne, can write powerfully and subtly. Yet the twin narratives (in distinct typefaces) are a sometimes confusing device. Suleima\u2019s nuanced psychological interiority contrasts with Naseem\u2019s crude glossing in his novel for a foreign readership \u2013 a difference well rendered in Elisabeth Jaquette\u2019s translation. This contrast might hint at the dilemmas of writing from exile, and the violence done to women\u2019s stories by men who purloin them. But the novel\u2019s movement towards psychoanalytic resolution seems overcomplicated by its doppelganger theme (\u201cHad I lost my memory and borrowed hers?\u201d Suleima wonders). It is most memorable in surreal details and glancing tales: a woman sprawled on the pavement with a snorkel, \u201csearching\u201d for her drowned son; an overprivileged student, whose father is an intelligence officer, who has his rival in love tortured and broken.</p> <p>The analyst Kamil emerges as the novel\u2019s quiet hero \u2013 strangely reminiscent, to me at this time, of Dr Rieux in Camus\u2019s <em>The Plague</em>. \u201cLines etched by exhaustion\u201d on his face, he was \u201cexperiencing the same things we were: we the crushed, unnerved and frightened ones\u201d. Humane and indefatigable, he remains in Damascus doing his job, treating the torturers and tortured alike who fill his waiting room, in a society yet to come to terms with its traumatic history. As Suleima imagines him saying: \u201cEither we all stood together or we\u2019d all lose our minds at once!\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Frightened Ones by Dima Wannous, translated by Elisabeth Jaquette, is published by Harvill Secker.</em></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Lynne Reback developed a rote routine while trying to file for unemployment in her home state of Florida: log into the system, watch the loading bar slowly inch across the screen, get kicked out.

The state at least has her application. Hundreds of thousands of unemployed people in Florida have been unable to file their unemployment claims because the state\u2019s system has been so clogged.</p> <p>Residents in the state are reporting a meltdown in its safety net just as the US\u2019s unemployment figures rise to unprecedented levels. Nearly 17 million people have lost their jobs across the US.

The true number, thanks to failing Connect, is much higher. And in this swing state the mess has handed the Trump administration a giant headache ahead of November\u2019s elections.</p> <p>Florida residents who successfully file for unemployment are eligible for a maximum $275 weekly benefit to compensate for the loss in pay. Congress, in its recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-bailout-what-you-need-to-know\">stimulus package</a>, also guaranteed an additional $600 a week starting whenever a person filed their claim.</p> <p>But a person cannot get either payout unless they have been processed and approved by the state\u2019s system.

I could try at three o\u2019clock, four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I\u2019ve been trying different times, and it\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d said Cruz.</p> <p>A delay in payments hurts many families, like Cruz, who have little to no savings.</p> <p>Cruz is particularly worried about the mortgage on her house. Her mortgage company told her that payment can be delayed for the next three months, but she will need to pay those months in full once those three months have passed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair for me to wait so long ... because their system is overwhelmed and not up to date. They should have known that this situation they\u2019ll be in was going to get crazy,\u201d Cruz said.</p> <p>The loss in income, with no relief, has also put a strain on Reback and her family as they eat into their savings, which will last the family about a month. They cancelled cable and Netflix and are having to cut back on other expenses, like groceries.</p> <p>\u201cI have five children that we\u2019re responsible for. I\u2019ve had to call every one of my creditors. I\u2019ve had to call my mortgage company.

In a state like Hawaii, a person can get 55% of their paycheck each week if they successfully file a claim.

  "<p>In recent weeks, face masks have become an unremarkable sight in streets and supermarkets.</p> \n<p>Many people are choosing to cover their mouth and nose with online-bought or homemade masks or scarves, in spite of the advice of the World Health Organization and, in the UK, from Public Health England, that they are no protection against coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Yet one country after another has decided to depart from the WHO guidance and rule that masks should be worn \u2013 most notably the US.</p> \n<p>To add to the confusion, on Monday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said the UK position on masks was under review and would change if the scientific evidence warranted it.</p> \n<p>This followed remarks by David Nabarro, a UN special envoy on Covid-19, who appeared to depart from the WHO\u2019s line by suggesting the UK would have to get used to wearing masks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe virus isn\u2019t going to go away and we don\u2019t know if people who have had the virus stay immune afterwards,\u201d he told the BBC, adding: \u201cYes, we will have to wear masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite the mixed messages, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">WHO guidance updated a week ago</a>, has remained consistent.</p> \n<p>It has stuck to the line that masks are for<em> </em>healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.</p> \n<p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d it stated.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

But the virus particles are thought to pass through other types of mask.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected by the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bde155c3-43e7-4929-8506-bb043a798a88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JsWf-2nN1Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is accepted that they can block the transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.</p> \n<p>In the US, Donald Trump has advised people to wear masks whenever they go out, while stressing it is not compulsory, citing advice from the Centers for Disease Control. In France, the Academy of Medicine has recommended the use of a \u201cgeneral public\u201d mask \u2013 to differentiate it from the mask used by healthcare workers.</p> \n<p>There is now increasing pressure for the UK stance on masks to change. Even marginal gains could make a difference is at the heart of the argument.</p> \n<p>Prof Trisha Greenhalgh from the Nuffield department of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, and colleagues wrote a paper published by the British Medical Journal last week that argued in favour of \u201cthe precautionary principle\u201d.</p> \n<p>The standard level of scientific evidence is no good in this issue, she told the Guardian. Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard in drug development, but not appropriate to face masks in a pandemic, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe point is we have now got a hugely complex issue going on.

  "<p>The most popular book in the makeshift library at the Tarsao prisoner of war camp was a bible, the second a copy of the 1939 Wisden Almanack.

Swanton repaired it over and again, bound it with rice paste and recovered it with rubber. He used it to invent pretend radio commentaries for the other internees and as the basis for a lecture on \u201cThe Life of Bradman\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/13/unease-resounds-across-cricket-without-the-comforting-hum-of-county-game\">Unease resounds across cricket without the comforting hum of county game | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lost in Wisden, Swanton wrote, \u201cour minds were strangely at peace\u201d. There wasn\u2019t any first-class cricket being played, even if they had had a way to follow it, but there was solace in the thought of the game, in the memory of what it had been before it all started and the promise of what it would be once it was all over. During the English summer the County Championship runs like a clock, the tick-tock of runs and wickets unbroken through the season. You notice it most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/13/unease-resounds-across-cricket-without-the-comforting-hum-of-county-game\" title=\"\">when it\u2019s stopped</a>.</p> <p>In that \u201939 Wisden, among the reports of <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17544/scorecard/62652/england-vs-australia-5th-test-australia-tour-of-england-1938\" title=\"\">Len Hutton\u2019s 364</a> against Australia at the Oval, an obituary of Lord Hawke and a tribute to Frank Woolley, there\u2019s an article by Bradman, which he called Cricket at the Crossroads. \u201cNo matter how much we love cricket,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe cannot possibly disassociate its future from the cold, hard facts of finance. Nor can we blind ourselves to the fact that at this very moment public support for cricket suggests either that cricket is becoming less attractive or other forms of entertainment are gaining ground.</p> <p>\u201cWith the quickening of modern tempo, the more Americanised trend which is demanding speed, action and entertainment value, it behoves all of us to realise we are the custodians of the welfare of cricket and must guard its future even more zealously than its present.\u201d Bradman argued for better pitches, a change to the lbw law, and more modern scoreboards. \u201cI am quite sure the administrators of England and Australia are more closely united now than ever before. To me, therefore, it seems an appropriate time to try and achieve a greater measure of uniformity of opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Bradman\u2019s words echo in both directions. You find similar when the County Championship was suspended for the first time, in 1914, and they still sound familiar now when it has been suspended again, for the first time since its postwar resumption in 1946. Either cricket mirrors life so closely that its crises are synchronised with everyone else\u2019s or it is a game in perpetual ill health. But either way, on both previous occasions when play stopped in the County Championship, the break was used as an opportunity to debate what was wrong with the game and how best to try to fix it.</p> <p>During the first world war the game was in a fret, again, about its waning popularity with the public, worried that its slow tempo was out of touch with the fast times. \u201cIt occurred to some peculiar people that cricket stood in need of drastic alterations,\u201d the Wisden editor, Sydney Pardon, wrote in 1919. So the authorities decided to cut county matches down to two days and play longer each day. They considered scrapping the tea break, shortening boundaries and penalising the batting side for maiden overs. The Times even floated a plan to ban left-handers to save time altering the field between deliveries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/county-cricketeers-waive-1m-prize-money-coronavirus-cricket-premiership-rugby-union\">County cricketers to waive \u00a31m in prize money over coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pardon felt the authorities blundered by tinkering too much. The two-day matches were scrapped the following season, when games were played over the old length of three days. \u201cI trust,\u201d he wrote in that year\u2019s Wisden, \u201cwe shall hear no more about the need for drastic alterations in the game.\u201d His trust was misplaced. By 1939, the game was going through it all over again.</p> <p>During the war years, large crowds had turned out for exhibition one-day games at Lord\u2019s. Sir Home Gordon wrote: \u201cOne wartime development is that spectators have become thrilled over close finishes.\u201d There was a drive, in the mid-1940s, to introduce a one-day knockout cup, to be played on Sundays, to scrap the distinction between amateurs and professionals \u2013 all proposals that would come to pass, decades later, but were rejected at the time by authorities who, Swanton wrote, \u201ccondemned without hesitation all proposals to tamper with the fundamentals of the game\u201d.</p> <p>They wanted also to cut county matches back from three days to two, but that plan was rejected as well. This time they erred the other way and the upshot was that they postponed reform so long they ended up performing emergency surgery on the game in the late 1950s and early 1960s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And in 2020 the game is in the throes of a similar debate, as it weighs the competing needs of 18 counties and four separate formats. The most recent of these, the Hundred, is wildly unpopular with a lot of the people who love the others. Its few supporters argue, however, that it is the best way to sustain cricket in the long term. The ECB has said economic necessity dictates it will prioritise the T20 Blast if and when play resumes this summer, with the Hundred in the balance.</p> <p>Beyond that, there\u2019s the bigger question of how it all fits together, of what it is we\u2019re all pining for here: the game as it was or the game as we want it to be?

  "<p>Care home leaders have accused the government of vastly underestimating the deaths of elderly people from coronavirus, as they warned the disease may be circulating in more than 50% of nursing homes and mortality is significantly higher than official figures.</p> \n<p>Operators of several large care providers accused the government of not paying enough attention to the tragedy unfolding in residential setting across England, as figures from three of the largest chains show 620 deaths from Covid-19 in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>Official figures released on Tuesday showed just 237 people died from coronavirus in care homes in two weeks, suggesting government figures are failing to keep up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/care-homes-coronavirus-why-we-dont-know-true-uk-death-toll\">rising numbers of deaths outside hospitals</a>.</p> \n<p> Four Seasons Health Care, MHA and HC-One operate almost 700 homes between them, but still account for less than 5% of facilities in England, suggesting the overall death toll in care is likely to be well in excess of 1,000. Numerous other homes are reporting deaths in double digits as concerns grow about shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), with care home operators pleading for more government bulk buying.</p> \n<p>There is also concern about the impact of Covid-19 patients being discharged by hospitals into care homes filled with the frail and elderly in order to free up beds. Questions are being asked about why this is happening, when the Nightingale hospital in Docklands has received only a small number of patients \u2013 reported to be just 19 at the weekend \u2013 when it has capacity for up to 2,900 intensive care beds.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, joined calls on Tuesday for the government to start publishing daily death tolls from care homes, as it does from NHS hospitals.</p> \n<p>Care leaders said up to date figures that reflect the reality on ground were increasingly essential amid signs that deaths in care are starting to accelerate as the virus spreads rapidly in homes under lockdown. Under pressure to explain why care home deaths were not being given the prominence of those in NHS hospitals, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, told a Downing Street briefing the government was now \u201cworking with the ONS to speed up the publication of that data\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no desire not to respect what is happening in care homes,\u201d Sunak said. But no timetable has been given for the data to be provided.</p> \n<p>In the face of mounting criticism of their response to the spread of Covid-19 in care homes, the government has unveiled a significant expansion of testing in the sector. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced overnight that everyone in a care setting who was symptomatic would get a test in future and patients discharged from hospital to residential care homes would get a routine test.</p> \n<p>Currently only the first five symptomatic patients in a care home are tested.</p> \n<p>Hancock said all care providers would be contacted in the coming days to offer tests to their staff with symptoms.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cI am deeply conscious that people in residential care are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus. We are doing everything we can to keep workers, residents and their families safe, and I am determined to ensure that everyone who needs a coronavirus test should be able to have access to one.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fbb96cc0-be99-47f0-8544-bb0a39f4fbe1\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

The government has only been reporting deaths in hospitals so the numbers being reported now are not accurate, at best there is a significant time lag. The number of people passing away from confirmed or suspected Covid-19 is substantially under-reported in care homes.\u201d</p> \n<p>The order of St John Care Trust, which operates 84 care schemes in Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Lincolnshire and Gloucestershire said on Tuesday it is anticipating \u201ca significant step up in deaths\u201d. Dan Hayes, chief executive, said there are now two or more cases of Covid-19 in 30% of its facilities and that deaths in the week ending 6 April were almost double the normal rate.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is clear [ministers] have underestimated what the impact on care homes would be,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been paying attention to it. They are probably waiting for a degree of accuracy [about who died from Covid] they are never going to get.\u201d</p> \n<p>Downing Street defended its figures on care homes saying it was being \u201ccompletely transparent\u201d and that there was a time lag in collating figures from death certificates to establish causes of deaths.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe publish daily figures on hospitals to give up to date figures on a consistent basis,\u201d said a spokesman for Boris Johnson. \u201cThe ONS publishes separately deaths registered in a given week including deaths outside hospital. That information obviously takes a longer time to collate. But we are absolutely clear about what is and what is not included.\u201d</p> \n<p>Care homes also voiced growing concern that Covid-19 patients being discharged to them from hospitals could further increase deaths. The Order of St John Care Trust has written to ministers calling for the practice to be used only as a last resort unless it can be guaranteed that individuals are no longer infectious. It said current directives \u201cwill be knowingly placing those most vulnerable to dying from this virus, directly in its path\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The family of a 70-year-old resident of a care home in Poole told the Guardian that after the NHS asked the home to take a Covid-19 patient, the patient died while two other residents were now displaying symptoms .</p> \n<p>\u201cPoor people like my brother are sitting ducks in relation to this,\u201d a relative said, requesting anonymity.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile care homes are calling for urgent action to speed the supply of protective equipment to care homes amid reports from workers that in some cases they are being denied access to kit and that managers are having to drive hundreds of miles to buy supplies.</p> \n<p>Richardson called for the government to seize control of the supply chain for PPE by buying in bulk and distributing it through trusted providers to avoid care homes having to deal with profiteering start-up suppliers some of whom were charging 200% of normal rates.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Geoff Crocker, chairman of Bristol Care Homes, said the government and council had together supplied 300 masks, but it needed over 500 per day across the group.</p> \n<p>\u201cI had to drive to Birmingham last week to obtain 1,200,\u201d he said. \u201cWe managed to buy 2,000 in the UK.

  "<p><strong>I have a break booked this month with <a href=\"https://www.sykescottages.co.uk/\">Sykes Holiday Cottages</a>, which has confirmed that it will not be going ahead. Sykes is allowing people to rearrange holidays due before June, but the rescheduling must be to the same property. There are limited dates available for next year to rebook, and the prices are significantly higher for those that are available. Sykes is insisting that my contract does not allow refunds. <br></strong><em><strong>RS, Sheffield</strong></em></p> <p><strong>After the government ordered people to stay at home I wanted to cancel the holiday I\u2019d booked for early April with Sykes Holiday Cottages, but was told that my only option was to amend the date. However, there\u2019s only one week available for the property this year, and none in 2021 or 2022. Sykes told me that the owner has blocked bookings from September, possibly because they will no longer be letting it out, but are refusing to refund the \u00a31,805 that we have paid. <br></strong><em><strong>AJ, Reading</strong></em></p> <p><br>Holiday home agencies seem to be ripping up the rule books with more gusto than the rest of the travel industry.</p> <p>While many airlines, hotels and tour operators are approving refunds, albeit reluctantly, for customers who can\u2019t amend their booking, some rental companies appear to be heaping the costs onto holidaymakers. Sykes has aroused particular ire with two populous Facebook groups dedicated to its behaviour.</p> <p>The agent\u2019s argument is that customers\u2019 contracts are with the individual property owner, rendering it helpless. Initially, it told me that holidaymakers whose reservations had been cancelled could merely amend their booking at the same property to a later date, and it would waive its amendment fee as \u201cgoodwill\u201d.</p> <p>Then it decided to allow those unable to do this to request a refund, but a \u201crefund\u201d in Sykes\u2019 lexicon has a singular definition. If the owners agreed to pay out, Sykes would pocket the money and issue a credit note to the customer valid on any property for up to two years.</p> <p>In RS\u2019s case, the owner did agree to repay the money via Sykes, but Sykes merely offered RS a credit note. The firm has finally agreed to refund payments for rentals up to 30 April, minus its service fee which it will hold as a credit note against future bookings. Provided owners cooperate. \u201cThings are ever-changing and Sykes is constantly working with its owners and customers to adjust and evolve as we all learn more,\u201d it says.</p> <p>RS has now received his funds, minus a 25% service charge worth \u00a3435 which Sykes is withholding as a credit against a future booking. This, too, is a goodwill gesture, it says, since it says the fee is for services already rendered.</p> <p>As for AJ, it told me the owner has now decided to continue listing the property so more dates are available, and if the new booking proves more expensive it will \u201csee what it can do to help\u201d.</p> <p>Hospital consultant <em><strong>RS of Hereford</strong></em> turned to the <em>Observer</em> when a holiday rental booked for his 40th birthday this month was cancelled.</p> <p>\u201cCottages.com has offered a credit note not a refund,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will now be working in the hospital on my birthday, on call for 48 hours over the Easter bank holiday and on 12-hour night shifts after that,\u201d he said. Cottages.com declined to answer whether it was requesting refunds from owners when customers couldn\u2019t reschedule.</p> <p>\u201cWe are doing everything we can to help customers rebook their breaks, including offering price-matched breaks for the same or equivalent date in 2021,\u201d it says. However, RS was quietly refunded after I highlighted his key-worker status.</p> <p>Aman Johal, director of consumer law firm, Your Lawyer, advises holidaymakers to check the terms and conditions of their contract. \u201cIt seems that some agencies may be trying to create loopholes which contravene consumer rights,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, it is the responsibility of the contracting party to resolve it so it might be the holiday cottage owner who needs to sort it.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, UK holiday rentals are not protected by the Package Travel Regulations which entitle customers to refunds if their holiday is cancelled and, deep within the small print of Sykes and Cottages.com, is a clause excluding the agents and owners of liability if a contract is frustrated because of events beyond their control.

  "<p>Apple-owned Beats is moving into the on-ear noise-cancelling world with the Solo Pro, using the same chips that make the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/19/beats-powerbeats-pro-review-apple-fitness-airpods-rock\">PowerBeats Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/09/airpods-pro-review-a-touch-of-apple-magic\">AirPods</a> so good.</p> <p>The \u00a3269.95 Beats Solo Pro blends the design of the firm\u2019s existing Solo with the wired EP headphones for an attractive, modern and fairly sleek design.</p> <p>On-ear headphones sit with the cushions pressing against the ear, as opposed to the larger over-ear headphones that enclose your ear and sit against the side of your head. The Solo Pro are fairly large for on-ear headphones, with the cushions covering my ears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8a66165157a5c6851cc1b8a362754013b316c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8a66165157a5c6851cc1b8a362754013b316c5/943_563_3454_2072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beats Solo Pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The headphones fold up for travel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The leatherette ear cups are well-padded and the soft-touch silicone headband stays in place on your dome. The ear cups articulate to fit as flat and as firmly on your ears as possible, while the metal arms slide into the headband for size adjustment.</p> <p>Despite a firm grip, the Solo Pro are among the most comfortable on-ear headphones I have tried. Over-ear headphones are definitely best for extended listening sessions but the Solo Pro stayed comfortable for up to a couple of hours before my ears needed a break.</p> <p>At 267g, the Solo Pro are about mid-weight for headphones. The arms fold into thirds to collapse down but the thick ear cups means they do not get quite as small as I would like for travelling. They ship with a soft recycled-felt case for protection but they feel robust enough to just toss in a bag.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 267g</p></li> <li><p><strong>Drivers:</strong> 40mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Apple H1 chip, Bluetooth 5.0, Lightning charging</p></li> <li><p><strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> SBC, AAC</p></li> <li><p><strong>Battery life:</strong> 22 hours ANC on, 40 hours ANC off</p></li> </ul> <h2>Connectivity and controls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"913a9067a0b4f6a8475e558472faacd22e109495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/913a9067a0b4f6a8475e558472faacd22e109495/0_47_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beats Solo Pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The big Beats disc handles playback and volume controls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple\u2019s H1 wireless chip handles Bluetooth connectivity, the same system built into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/19/beats-powerbeats-pro-review-apple-fitness-airpods-rock\">PowerBeats Pro</a>, AirPods 2 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/09/airpods-pro-review-a-touch-of-apple-magic\">AirPods Pro</a>. It enables instant-pairing and multi-device switching with all Apple-made smartphones, tablets and computers, plus hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d support for the firm\u2019s voice assistant and audio sharing on iPhones and iPads.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.bnd\">Beats app on Android</a> also provides some of the same functionality. You can pair your headphones using the app \u2013 it will show battery level when you turn them on in a little on-screen pop-up and manage various settings.</p> <p>The Bluetooth connection to a variety of devices including an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/07/iphone-11-pro-the-best-small-phone-available\">iPhone 11 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/19/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-back-to-the-folding-flip-phone-future\">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/16/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-windows-10-tablet\">Microsoft Surface Pro 6</a> was rock solid.

Press it up or down to adjust volume. Press the logo in once for pause/play, twice to skip forward and thrice to skip back. Press and hold it to activate Siri on an iPhone, iPad or Mac, or Google Assistant on an Android phone.</p> <p>A small button on the bottom of the left ear cup swaps between noise cancelling on, off and a transparency setting, which pipes the sounds from the outside world into the headphones. Press and hold the button to pair another device.</p> <p>The headphones turn off and on by folding and unfolding them but taking them off does not pause the music, as has become common with high-end headphones.</p> <h2>Sound and noise cancelling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a107e5cdd66de527eccc1d02eb5ec068ca20f52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a107e5cdd66de527eccc1d02eb5ec068ca20f52/0_224_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beats Solo Pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ear cups do a good job of passively blocking out sound, even if you don\u2019t want to use noise cancelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Solo Pro have some of the more effective noise cancelling I have tried with on-ear headphones, which typically struggle to compete with a large set of over-ear noise cancellers.</p> <p>Road noise, engine drone and background office noise was reduced, while noisy commuters were slightly quietened. The headphones do a fairly good job of passively blocking out noise without noise cancelling active, too.

They produce clear, precise sound that is almost clinical at times, with well-controlled and punchy bass, pleasing mids and crisp highs.</p> <p>You can hear every note in complex tracks such as the Who\u2019s Baba O\u2019Riley. Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong sounded particularly good in Summertime, while they handled classical music well, too.</p> <p>Dr Dre sounds good, so does high-energy electronica such as Edge by Cicada. But they sound best with punchy rock and pop. Play Highly Suspicious by My Morning Jacket and they really come alive.</p> <p>The Solo Pro sound best with active noise cancelling turned off, producing deeper, richer bass including the pulsating low tones in Crystallize by Lindsey Stirling.</p> <h2>Battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"904573bb3860127c592a3d2d634ac8f41e4002e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/904573bb3860127c592a3d2d634ac8f41e4002e1/712_0_4136_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beats Solo Pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lightning port takes care of charging and can be used for wired listening with an optional cable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Solo Pro last just over 22 hours between charges using noise cancelling. They are rated to last up to 40 hours with noise cancelling switched off.</p> <p>Charging is via Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning cable, including those supplied with iPhones. A USB-A to Lightning cable is included in the box.

  "<p>It\u2019s almost a decade since David Cameron scrapped Labour plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/27/theresa-may-scrapping-id-cards\">national ID card</a>, and 13 years since fears about the government tracking all our movements helped <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6349027.stm\">kill off</a> pay-as-you-go road pricing.</p> <p>The idea of a \u201cblack box\u201d in the car, logging every mile driven, was deemed too creepy, even though in hindsight it could have lowered carbon emissions years ago by discouraging drivers from making unnecessary trips. But Britons guard their privacy jealously, at least outside wartime. It\u2019s surprising, then, how little debate there has been about the electronic surveillance culture this epidemic threatens to bring with it.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about police sending up drones to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/26/police-drone-video-shames-people-using-national-park-during-uk-lockdown-video\">shame</a> Peak District ramblers, or threatening to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52245937\">snoop</a> through supermarket shoppers\u2019 trolleys to check their trips were really necessary, but about what happens after lockdown is over. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/uk-app-to-track-coronavirus-spread-to-be-launched\">confirmed</a> at the weekend that the government is seeking to develop a phone app allowing people to record their own symptoms, and receive alerts if other users they\u2019ve been in contact with have fallen ill. Well, of course he did: this is the man who once invented the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt\">Matt Hancock app</a>, for everyone desperate to keep up with all the Matt Hancock news. But what if this is more about Matt Hancock keeping up with you?</p> <p>Any future tracing app would almost certainly be voluntary in Britain, with strict confidentiality promised to protect users\u2019 privacy. It could be a godsend for people with vulnerable relatives, giving early warning of any brush with the virus that would help them to avoid unwittingly passing it on. True, we\u2019d be meekly handing over intimate details of our movements and social circles to an alliance of government and tech companies, but arguably that\u2019s no more information than we blithely give away by opening Google Maps or Facebook. Like staying home to save lives, getting the app could become seen as the socially responsible thing to do, helping save jobs by allowing a gradual return to normal while lowering the risk of reigniting infection. But, given that this could be a far longer lasting change to everyday life than lockdown, it\u2019s staggering how little we have been prepared for it.</p> <p>In authoritarian states such as Russia or China, the fear is surely that tracking systems could be abused. When Chinese citizens with a green code (for low infection risk) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/growth-in-surveillance-may-be-hard-to-scale-back-after-coronavirus-pandemic-experts-say\">can go out</a>, while a yellow or red code (denoting contact with an infected person, or confirmed infections) means restrictions, how easy would it be to punish political dissidents by tampering with their codes to keep them under effective house arrest?</p> <p>In Britain, the worry is more that everyday life could swiftly become difficult for those unwilling to sign up. Even if it\u2019s strictly voluntary, are we so sure that unscrupulous employers wouldn\u2019t demand applicants install the app as a condition of hiring, that rogue landlords won\u2019t try to discriminate against tenants who can\u2019t show they have it, that insurers won\u2019t seek to restrict health cover accordingly? Could airlines insist you get it before you fly, to protect fellow passengers? The risk is of creating another kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a> for those who resist. And that\u2019s to say nothing of questions about what access the security services might eventually seek to the data, or whether electronic tracking could become a habit that sticks once the epidemic is over. (Maybe road pricing isn\u2019t so dead after all.)</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see why government doesn\u2019t want to have this conversation now, arguing that talk of exit strategies risks distracting from core messages about staying home. Although Dominic Raab is expected to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-lockdown/britain-to-remain-in-lockdown-till-at-least-may-7-the-times-idUSKCN21V257\">announce</a> on Thursday that lockdown won\u2019t be lifted until after 7 May, that\u2019s simply the earliest date for review; there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t drag on longer.</p> <p>Yet the implications of something like this need to be thoroughly explored before we move from blanket lockdown into what could be a more fluid and personalised version, where we might get something like our lives back but have to live with knowing they could be snatched away again. Ironically, it\u2019s probably those libertarians howling loudest for an end to lockdown now who\u2019d naturally hate the idea, while for others it will sound like a price worth paying for escape. Right now, I\u2019d probably download it like a shot. But until some basic questions are answered, we just don\u2019t know what we might be sacrificing for freedom.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

One thing is clear: the only predictable feature of history is its unpredictability.</p> <p>The political scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ivan-krastev\">Ivan Krastev</a> claims that the coronavirus crisis will strengthen nationalism in Europe. It doesn\u2019t seem such a reckless theory: the big crises of the last two centuries have certainly had that effect. The reason for this phenomenon is obvious: a catastrophe generates fear, and nationalism presents itself as the ideal antidote, inasmuch as it forms, in the face of uncertainty, the refuge of a community bound by ties of blood. The problem is that this refuge offers us much less protection than citizenship, a refuge grounded in rationality and bound by the ties of law.</p> <p>Historically, there is glaring evidence of this problem in Europe, where a strengthening of nationalism has unleashed conflict, crisis on a far greater scale. This happened with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/04/crash-1929-wall-street-what-the-great-depression-reveals-about-our-future\">Wall Street crash of 1929</a>, which led to the second world war. It has not happened since the 2008 crash because the European Union has kept the resurgence of nationalism in check, which is what it was created to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The EU's response to the pandemic has been depressingly slow, hesitant, stingy and unsupportive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Will it still be able to do so? If the coronavirus crisis takes on the economic dimensions of the 2008 crisis (or worse), as Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, fears it will, could the EU withstand two consecutive crises of such gravity? Bearing in mind that the last crisis was on the brink of wiping out the euro, this is the crucial question. There is no doubt that our big problems, as this crisis highlights once again, are transnational ones, but we have almost exclusively national instruments at our disposal to resolve them. It is a bit like trying to open a safe with a headbutt. On top of all that, politicians are making depressing use of our scant transnational instruments, as the slow, hesitant, stingy, unsupportive and fearful reaction of the EU to the pandemic has demonstrated.</p> <p>Walter Benjamin wrote that to be happy is to be able to live without fear. Since the outbreak was declared a pandemic, we have not been able to live without fear in Spain, across Europe, or anywhere else \u2013 at least, not without fearing for the lives of many people. Nor should we: bravery does not mean having no fear \u2013 that is temerity \u2013 but overcoming it, doing what must be done and carrying on.

Most of us dismiss the phenomenon as an irritating but unavoidable feature of modern life. But Proctor is the director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/eu-brings-in-right-to-repair-rules-for-phones-and-tablets\">Right to Repair</a> campaign spawned by the US\u2019s <a href=\"https://uspirg.org/feature/usp/about-us\">Public Interest Research Group</a> (founded in 1971 by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/22/uselections2004.usa\">celebrated activist Ralph Nader</a>), and he wants us to see things very differently.</p> <p>As we throw away machines and devices damned as out of date, the result is a growing mountain of e-waste. Last year alone, it was reckoned that more than 50m tonnes of it were generated globally, with only around 20% of it officially recycled. Half of the 50m tonnes represented large household appliances, and heating and cooling equipment. The remainder was TVs, computers, smartphones and tablets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d32633cee1a15a606396e2157210f9e4a165f387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d32633cee1a15a606396e2157210f9e4a165f387/0_0_5000_3750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broken CellphonesClose-up of a large number of broken cellphones, including cracked cellphone screens with exposed wiring, on a white surface, suggesting E Waste recycling, hacking or cybersecurity, December 7, 2018.

In the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/02/apple-iphone-slow-throttling-lawsuit-settlement\">Apple has recently agreed to pay up to $500m in settlements</a> related to allegations that software updates caused older iPhones \u2013 such as the iPhone 6, 6s Plus, 7 and 7 Plus \u2013 to slow down (the company denied any wrongdoing, and insisted the technique prevented older devices from shutting down altogether). In France, the same issue resulted in a fine of \u20ac25m (\u00a321m).</p> <p>In Norway, the supreme court is deciding on the battle between <a href=\"https://repair.eu/news/support-henrik-huseby-in-his-battle-with-apple/\">Apple and Henrik Huseby</a>, the owner of a small phone-repair shop, and the company\u2019s pursuit of claims about \u201ccounterfeit\u201d replacement screens that he insists were taken from old Apple devices. Meanwhile, the European commission has recently announced plans aimed at ensuring that a range of products will be \u201crecyclable, repairable and designed to last longer\u201d as part of a plan to halve waste across the EU by 2030.</p> <p>Different consumer choices might also be part of the answer, and Proctor\u2019s life as a tech consumer offers examples. The computer he is using to talk to me, he explains, is a Frankenstein PC \u2013 custom-built from parts of different computers, some of which were bought in the early 1990s. His iPhone dates from 2013. But he emphasises that what we choose to buy is much less important than the actions of governments and companies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The companies that make millions of smartphones should just not make them to break</p> <footer> <cite>Nathan Proctor, Right to Repair</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to fix this problem person by person, changing how we treat smartphones. The companies that make millions of smartphones should just not make them to break.\u201d A few computer companies do better (\u201cHP and Dell provide access to firmware, spare parts and tutorials \u2013 they\u2019re really good, as far as we can tell\u201d), but their actions heighten his exasperation that many tech corporations are reluctant to follow suit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the coronavirus crisis has brought our need for greater resilience and sustainability into sharp focus. Proctor noticed this from the start. \u201cA lot of new equipment \u2013 whether it\u2019s your electric fan or iPhone or networking equipment for your school or office \u2013 comes from China,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because Chinese manufacturing was affected first, a lot of wholesalers saw a pretty significant increase in the demand for used equipment \u2013 whether that was laptops that schools were trying to redistribute so that kids could do homework, or hardware so that people could handle more remote operations.\u201d</p> <p>But wholesalers and refurbishers found much of the equipment was locked against reuse because of manufacturers\u2019 systems. \u201cYou can buy the hardware, but you don\u2019t have the permissions to use it without getting some kind of new service agreement. So that\u2019s another problem.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of planned or built-in obsolescence is certainly not new \u2013 it was first written about in 1928 by the American marketing pioneer Justus George Frederick. In the words of one subsequent account: \u201cHe stated that it was necessary to induce people to buy an ever-increasing variety of things, not in order to use them but to activate commerce and discard them after a short period of time.\u201d The concept even has its own film \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/16/man-white-suit-french-studiocanal\">The Man in the White Suit </a>(made in 1951, and recently screened as part of a BBC Two Ealing comedies series sparked by the lockdown), a chemist falls foul of textile producers and trade unions for creating a material that never needs replacing.</p> <p>Nearly a century on from Frederick\u2019s description, it seems his idea is everywhere, and it sometimes feels as if we are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence. The average time an individual keeps a smartphone is reckoned to be between two and three years. Astonishingly, according to EU research, the average lifetime of desktop printers is a mere five hours and four minutes of actual printing time. Ever-changing software spells the demise of fully functioning devices \u2013 which is why so many of us have household drawers filled with old ones, left behind \u2013 and often bricked \u2013 by the same companies that made them.</p> <p>Symbols of the extent to which companies make user repairs of their devices either impossible or extremely difficult are everywhere. iPhones are partly held together by Pentalobe screws, which are immune to standard screwdrivers. Some Amazon Kindles are constructed using glued plastic casing that is all but impossible to prise open. The reluctance of big companies to release information about the workings of their products is a constant source of frustration. </p> <p>All this is being closely watched by a Brussels-based organisation called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/21/domestic-appliances-guzzle-far-more-energy-than-advertised-eu-survey\">European Environmental Bureau</a>. One of the groups\u2019s key staff members, 28-year-old Jean-Pierre Schweitzer, tells me the EU\u2019s plans for digital devices promise to extend the rules that apply to such household objects as fridges and washing machines to laptops, tablets and smartphones. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about really serious requirements, which include things about spare parts and product information,\u201d he says. Yet this prospect is still five or six years away, while Brexit means that even such belated moves may not apply in the UK, and our own mound of discarded electronic stuff could just carry on growing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24252350268b7b23b1c86e202b5e455a6c2c4868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24252350268b7b23b1c86e202b5e455a6c2c4868/0_173_4908_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Use it to lose it ...

The problem with lots of them is that you can\u2019t replace the batteries. As soon as they run out, that\u2019s it. Anything where you have an issue with the battery is really problematic, because they are all lithium-ion. Those are really rare, valuable resources. But because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/23/apple-airpods-pro-wireless-earbuds-price\">head-headphones</a> are so small, people just throw them in their waste bins.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasingly, I\u2019m hearing a lot of complaints about products from Amazon. All of their stuff: Kindles, the hardware connected with Amazon Prime \u2013 apparently it has a very short lifespan. We\u2019re just getting to see that now.\u201d</p> <p>When I contact Apple, I get an email about its use of recycled materials: \u201cApple is using recycled cobalt from iPhone batteries recovered by its disassembly robot Daisy combined with scrap from final assembly sites for brand-new Apple batteries.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds impressive, yet Proctor points out that recycling is only a small part of any solution: \u201cRecycling is an incredibly destructive process that doesn\u2019t really get that much raw material back. Say your phone is kinda old and buggy. A refurbisher could switch the battery out, maybe reinstall the operating system and get another two years. If you scrap that phone for its commodity value \u2013 the plastic, glass, aluminium and copper \u2013 you\u2019re probably not recycling more than 20% of it.\u201d</p> <p>I then get a second email, which points to an announcement from last year, about \u201ca new repair programme, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.</p> <p>\u201cApple will provide more independent repair businesses \u2013 large or small \u2013 with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers.\u201d This sounds like a modest victory for Right to Repair campaigners, but the announcement also contains a warning about using counterfeit parts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of our products are still in use after five years</p> <footer> <cite>Amazon</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I contact Amazon, a spokesperson says it is committed to sustainability. \u201cWe have built a refurbishment and trade-in programme that kept millions of devices from ending up in landfills in 2019 alone.

It is starting to build up a stock of information about the maintenance and repair of hospital equipment, including ventilators.</p> <p>iFixit has two HQs, one in Stuttgart, the other in San Luis Obispo, California, where about 150 people work. Its origin dates back to the early 2000s, when one of its founders broke his MacBook and, on finding no helpful information online, created his own repair guide. Now the site has an estimated 10 million visitors a month \u2013 thanks to the refusal of large swathes of the tech industry to help people to do their own repairs.</p> <p>iFixit is a private company, but Webb also works on advocacy for the <a href=\"https://repair.eu/\">Right to Repair</a>, which is now focused on lobbying the US government. \u201cWe were doing really well this year until the coronavirus happened,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had got legislation introduced in 21 states.

  "<p>Spring arrived in New York City almost unnoticed amid empty streets and shuttered restaurants. But the ecosystem of the city stops for no virus. Buds still bloom along brownstone-lined blocks and kitten season is still upon us, marking the yearly arrival of <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/about-us/press-releases/kitten-season-sweeps-us-creating-tremendous-need-life-saving-foster-homes\">thousands of stray newborns </a><a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/about-us/press-releases/kitten-season-sweeps-us-creating-tremendous-need-life-saving-foster-homes\">in New York</a>. With the ASPCA and the Animal Care Centers of NYC (ACC) offering only emergency services due to Covid-19, smaller volunteer-run rescue groups find themselves knee-deep in cats.</p> <p>Instagram, surprisingly, has been a huge help \u2013 the platform has drastically changed the way rescue groups operate. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/flatbushcats/?hl=en\">Flatbush Cats</a>, with 130,000 followers and an active <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTl8bLnzuZzID1kIhpbS5vQ\">YouTube channel</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/littlewanderersnyc/\">Little Wanderers</a>, with 68,300 followers, are among the most successful in crowdsourcing rescue efforts. With <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-pv-GcB8XC/\">tear-jerking posts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-eVW6mDkI3/\">heartfelt requests</a> and calls for donations, the organizations are able to gain funding and find transportation to vet appointments as well as foster and permanent homes for rescues. \u201cWhat we do is inspire people to realize that they can be the person that rescues that cat,\u201d Will Zweigart, founder of Flatbush Cats, said.</p> <p>Lisa Scroggins, founder of Little Wanderers, has been involved in cat rescue for more than a decade. \u201cIt just seemed like I was constantly seeing kittens with infected eyes that couldn\u2019t see get squashed by cars, or cats seeking shelter from raw winters go inside car engines and be shocked to death,\u201d the Bronx native told me.</p> <p>Little Wanderers receives more than 100 Instagram direct messages pleading for help every day. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-2KpXfD4eQ/\">A recent post</a> chronicled the group\u2019s rescue efforts \u2013 they saved seven dozen litters of kittens in just four days, including four soaked and scared kittens from a backyard in the Bronx. \u201cWe ended one cycle of generational suffering,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-wkwsyg0N5/\">Instagram caption</a> reads. \u201cWe are exhausted just writing this.\u201d</p> <p>Cat rescue and population control in New York depend on a delicate balance of not-for-profit groups, humane societies, animal shelters and independent volunteer rescuers. And with half of that machine on hiatus due to Covid-19, the future looks dire. If this pandemic bleeds into summer and fall, hundreds of kittens will grow into cats and potential breeders (breeding can start at four months). While we attempt to flatten the coronavirus curve, decades of work fighting rampant cat overpopulation is being reversed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to stop doing anything else and just care for hundreds and hundreds of kittens,\u201d Zweigart says, forecasting his organization\u2019s workload in the next few months. \u201cThat is a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>One female cat and her offspring will produce, on average, <a href=\"http://www.feralcatproject.org/myths-controversies\">100 cats in seven years</a>. And current feral population estimates for New York City hover in the <a href=\"https://www.infinitehope.org/tnr\">tens of thousands</a>. Each year, over a million cats nationwide are euthanized and thousands more die, unable to survive cold winters and competitive cat colonies.</p> <p>\u201cIt actually mirrors our healthcare problem,\u201d Zweigart says of the city\u2019s response to the feral crisis. \u201cWe have unnecessary suffering and high costs because we\u2019re not providing basic services.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe944e91bc034eb32f5ce20326d5f75c71afec79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe944e91bc034eb32f5ce20326d5f75c71afec79/0_0_4599_2759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"cat in carrier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Animal shelters have closed as coronavirus spreads.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The basic service he\u2019s referring to is TNR (trap, neuter, return) \u2013 the vast majority of which, along with rescues and adoptions, is performed by small, not-for-profit organizations. TNR often involves <a href=\"http://animalalliancenyc.org/feralcats/tnr-colony-care-resources/tnr-workshops-webinars/tnr-certification-workshops/\">certified experts</a> and months of planning. Feral cats are generally hostile towards or scared of humans and thus extremely difficult to trap. Rescuers will coordinate with neighbors to withhold food \u2013 a hungry cat is more easily trapped. Still, according to Scroggins, about 30% of trapping missions fail. If they are trapped, rescuers will take them in batches to high-volume spay and neuter clinics and, once they are healed, return them to their homes outside.</p> <p>One positive side-effect of the coronavirus pandemic is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/foster-pets-coronavirus-animal-shelters-adoption\">influx of foster and adoption </a>applications. But with the closure of public and private shelters, the number of cats continues to outpace the number of foster homes. To fill the gap, one Little Wanderers volunteer shares her home with 11 cats, and Scroggins is reaching capacity as well. \u201cWe have five cats and seven dogs already, you know? We live in a studio apartment in Manhattan!\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Little Wanderers and Flatbush Cats rely on donations for everything from cat food to emergency amputations, but they are down while Little Wanderers\u2019 veterinary bills have increased by 57%. Typically, Flatbush Cats partners with a fellow not-for-profit group, the Toby Project, to operate a mobile spay-and-neuter clinic each month. Little Wanderers relies on the ASPCA to spay and neuter rescues and community cats \u2013 the procedures are free for rescue groups. But both the ASPCA and ACC have been forced to halt spay and neuter services. Although organizations protecting animal welfare have been deemed \u201cessential\u201d, new regulations, staff and medical supply shortages, and social distancing protocol make it impossible for them to function normally. Considering the ASPCA provides \u201ctens of thousands of spay/neuter surgeries for owned, homeless and community cats each year\u201d, the impact of the closure will be explosive.</p> <p>I asked Scroggins how her life had changed since New Yorkers were ordered to shelter in place, and she explained how climbing unemployment rates were affecting even owned animals. Pet owners who previously visited low-cost facilities can no longer afford pet care and shelters that take owner surrenders are closed. Little Wanderers is taking in more owned animals than ever and Scroggins\u2019 agitation is palpable through the phone. \u201cBut,\u201d she sighed, \u201cwe can\u2019t say no. It\u2019s hard to say no.\u201d</p> <p>Max, a Little Wanderers volunteer, has been feeding about 80 feral cats for the past 15 years. In response to dense New York living, feral cats form social colonies around available food sources. To support population control efforts, invested citizens can volunteer to become designated feeders, providing the colony a daily meal. \u201cThere could be rain, snow or zero degrees and I go outside every single night. It\u2019s just something I cannot stop,\u201d Max said. Feeders also work with rescue groups to help sick or injured colony members and support spay-and-neuter efforts. There are more than <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodcats.org/tnr-in-nyc/colony-database\">3,100 registered colonies</a> in New York and Max tends to six of them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/01/worlds-worst-cat-perdita-north-carolina\">'World's worst cat' Perdita finds new home after purrfect publicity campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the real heroes, he insisted, were the founders of Little Wanderers, whom he affectionately referred to as <em>the ladies</em>: \u201cThose ladies are incredible.\u201d After he lost his maintenance job at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts due to coronavirus closures, <em>the ladies</em> were able to get him a steady supply of cat food through Instagram requests and PayPal donations.

  "<p>It\u2019s floating in the mangroves, waiting for hard-bitten detective Jay Swan (Aaron Pedersen) to find it: a headless corpse caught in fishing nets. This gruesome discovery is made early in the first episode of Mystery Road season two, marking the arrival of a new case for the franchise\u2019s Akubra-wearing outback sleuth to solve.</p> <p>Across a long narrative arc encompassing the 2018 six-part series directed by Rachel Perkins and two earlier feature films directed by Ivan Sen (2013\u2019s Mystery Road and 2016\u2019s Goldstone), Jay\u2019s investigations have ventured into some very dark places \u2013 including homicide and missing person cases, political corruption, people trafficking and drug syndicates.</p> <p>The new series is directed by two highly distinguished Indigenous Australian film-makers: Warwick Thornton (Samson and Delilah, Sweet Country) and Wayne Blair (The Sapphires, Cleverman). It is set in the fictitious coastal town of Gideon, captured by Thornton \u2013 also the cinematographer \u2013 in the real-world locations of Broome and Western Australia\u2019s scenic Dampier Peninsula. Thornton and Blair depict Gideon as a place on the edge of existence, populated by broken souls: people who are hiding; people who are starting again. One of them is Jay\u2019s ex-wife, Mary (Tasma Walton), who is dating a semi-retired police officer, Simon (Callan Mulvey).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/01/the-golden-age-of-indigenous-television-is-here-and-its-changed-australia-forever\">The golden age of Indigenous television is here \u2013 and it's changed Australia forever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Law needs to be followed here, as the snitchy senior cop Owen (Mark Mitchinson) stresses to Jay, their fractious relationship drawn from the familiar interplay between the stop-at-nothing investigator and the weary, harrumphing superior. But there is also <em>lore</em>: traditional knowledge, beliefs and stories drawing a longer line across history.</p> <p>The screenwriters (Steven McGregor, Blake Ayshford, Timothy Lee, Kodie Bedford and Danielle MacLean) explore this in a subplot involving a Swedish archaeologist Sandra (Sofia Helin), who visits Gideon to dig up ancient artefacts, to the chagrin of some locals. Jay\u2019s new partner, Fran (Jada Alberts), is called to the dig site to address a conflict involving an angry protester \u2013 her sister, Leonie (Ngaire Pigram).</p> <p>Leonie dismisses Sandra\u2019s argument that she is rewriting history. \u201cI know my history,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t need you or anyone else to dig it up.\u201d She then turns to Fran and says: \u201cThis is your country too.

This series reflects on aspects of the national ethos in ways no other detective serial can, reinvigorating tried-and-tested genre templates with fresh Indigenous Australian perspectives. The core of the show reflects through fiction what SBS\u2019s recent, thrillingly revitalised view of Australian history, <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/05/australia-in-colour-review-hugo-weaving-narrates-a-thrilling-revitalisation-of-history\">Australia in Colour</a>, captured in documentary: the idea that this country is only just beginning to come to terms with its past.</p> <p>The idea of unearthing neglected truths is made literal at the dig site, which has ancient as well as immediate significance when a gruesome discovery is made there too. It is connected, like the headless corpse, to what appears to be a large-scale drug manufacturing operation, potentially involving a local pearl farmer and former special forces soldier (Gary Sweet).</p> <p>Mystery Road was at its most politically charged and polemical in its second film, <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/film/2016/jun/09/goldstone-review-a-masterpiece-of-outback-noir-that-packs-a-political-punch\">Goldstone</a>, which opened with a montage of sepia-toned photographs taken from the gold rush, juxtaposing images of Aboriginal people in the dirt and mud while white folk eat large meals around dinner tables and go on camel expeditions \u2013 one sitting with his hand on an Indigenous man\u2019s head, as if it were an armrest. The centring of Indigenous Australians in both narrative and above-the-line creative roles has brought to it an authenticity and urgency unmatched by any other Australian crime series; perhaps any Australian series full stop. The genre format makes it palatable for the masses, the previous season even <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/01/tom-gleeson-wins-gold-logie-after-ruthless-campaign-of-mockery\">winning a Logie award</a> for most popular drama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db7b785402e86eabef6b1570b17cebcbbcda584e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db7b785402e86eabef6b1570b17cebcbbcda584e/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Pedersen as Jay and Jada Alberts as Fran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Pedersen as Jay and Jada Alberts as Fran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dare Parker/ABC TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mystery Road season two is less direct than Goldstone in its interrogation of colonialism. It contemplates the profoundly difficult question of how to reconcile Indigenous heritage with a modern, white person-oriented society, with its Judeo-Christian foundations and genocidal past. This has emerged as a fascinating recurring theme in 21st century Australian film and television, memorably explored \u2013 using the enigmatic language of contemporary dance \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/19/spear-review-a-weird-wonderful-milestone-of-a-dance-movie\">Spear</a>, the 2015 feature film in which Pedersen delivered another high-impact performance. He played Suicide Man, a desperate, sweat-drenched homeless person who yells at passers-by in an underground train station. This character was inspired by the tragic story of a real-life person the film\u2019s director, Stephen Page, described, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/its-no-samson-and-delilah-stephen-page-on-the-film-adaptation-of-spear\">an interview with Guardian Australia</a>, as having \u201chad a foot in talking lingo to his mob, and a foot in talking to the corporate people in Perth. The front of him was a business suit, the back of him just a painted back of ochre.\u201d</p> <p>We see this notion of dual identity explored in a less abstract way in the penultimate episode of this new season of Mystery Road, when Jay confronts the formidable senior lore man Jimmy Two, played with menacing charisma by Stan Yarramunua. In a rousing monologue that channels what the academic Marcia Langton once described as \u201cties that inscribe self in place and place in self\u201d, Jimmy points a large stick into the distance and says: \u201cYou see them trees out there? See them rocks? That water? That\u2019s me. We\u2019re one. Where\u2019s your tree? You poor thing. You think that badge is your law, ay?\u201d Later Jimmy adds: \u201cI\u2019ll answer to my law, my people. White law means nothing.\u201d</p> <p>There is no way of knowing, given the dialogue is delivered orally, whether he is speaking about <em>law</em>, or <em>lore</em>, or both. Jimmy is grappling with a philosophical conundrum that has long confronted Jay \u2013 presumably since he initially entertained the idea of working for the police. He has much to contemplate and many crosses to bear. Like in the previous season, family matters also challenge the protagonist and complicate the case, with Mary becoming increasingly entangled in the investigation into the drug ring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/12/aaron-pedersen-is-the-mystery-road-star-one-of-the-greatest-actors-of-his-generation\">Aaron Pedersen: is the Mystery Road star one of the greatest actors of his generation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The detective genre is filled with stories about morally conflicted people embroiled in tricky situations. For Jay, moral and philosophical conflicts don\u2019t come and go when cases open and close; they are intrinsic to his sense of self. As a police officer discriminated against because he is black, and as an Indigenous man distrusted within the Aboriginal community because he enforces white law, he is caught between traditions, between worldviews, between <em>laws</em> and <em>lores</em>. In one sense Jay\u2019s character is tied to genre heritage \u2013 from a long line of obstinate gumshoes \u2013 but he is also light years from celluloid ancestors such as old school Bogart-like types, wooing dames and dry-gulching cronies.</p> <p>Pedersen\u2019s performance radiates gravitas, simultaneously projecting great strength and great sorrow. Emotional stoicism occasionally gives way to outbursts of rage and indignation, suggesting a deep-seated conflict simmering in his psyche and at the heart of Mystery Road\u2019s narrative. The escalating arc of that conflict can be felt throughout the new series, which begins with Jay as crotchety as ever, then slowly, skilfully, patiently ratchets up<strong> </strong>the tension, pairing the growing intensity of his feeling with the increasing danger of his circumstances.</p> <p>There are shock twists, car chases and confrontations with villains. The action scenes have a real kick to them \u2013 but it\u2019s the depth and scope of the script that keeps you thinking long after the credits roll.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Mystery Road season two premieres on Sunday 19 April at 8.30pm on ABC and will be available to stream on iView</em></p>",

That could be a year. Or even longer. Either way, it would be a disaster for ballet.</p> <p>The company is preparing for every possibility, McAllister says.</p> <p>\u201cOur aim at the moment is just to keep a level of fitness so when we are allowed back in the studio we can start rehearsing the repertoire again.\u201d He estimates it would take the company at least five weeks to return to performance level.</p> <p>\u201cWorking on a two-metre square piece of floor is not a lot of room so a lot of the dancers are a going into parks \u2013 practising social distancing \u2013 to do some grand jet\u00e9s, the big ballet leaps, to get that sense of moving through space,\u201d McAllister says. \u201cA dancer needs to feel that they are moving.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9489a9630a0fae11f8246c9253771026cd2d933f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9489a9630a0fae11f8246c9253771026cd2d933f/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda McGuigan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanda McGuigan uses a park railing as a barre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theatres closed for a year or more is the company\u2019s current worst-case scenario; on Tuesday night the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra announced it would \u201chibernate\u201d 85 full-time musicians and 12 administrative staff. Those eligible will receive the federal government\u2019s jobkeeper wage subsidy.</p> <p>It\u2019s a reminder of the precariousness of the industry and the financial pressures<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/as-we-crave-the-return-of-our-cultural-life-arts-workers-and-organisations-are-being-left-behind\"> every Australian performing arts organisation faces</a>. The Australian Ballet company\u2019s dancers and staff are being paid, though it\u2019s unclear how long this arrangement can be maintained.</p> <p>The company is in a solid financial position, compared with many smaller arts organisations, with a diverse revenue stream that includes ticket sales, income from its properties and car park, merchandise, ballet classes and significant donations and bequests. Some donations are held for specific purposes and can\u2019t be drawn on, though, and it still faces the same devastating box office losses in 2020 as other arts companies.</p> <p>\u201cApart from the amount of performing we are missing out on, we need to keep the company solvent,\u201d McAllister says. \u201cThe board has been very clear about wanting to look after the people first but ultimately we need to make sure there is a company to come back to. We have a lot of things to balance.</p> <p>\u201cBut at this stage, we are guided by what the government is telling us to do. We are rolling with the punches and staying positive. We are taking this one month at a time.\u201d</p> <p>To stay in touch with audiences, the Australian Ballet has launched a free, watch-from-home <a href=\"https://australianballet.com.au/the-ballets/digital-season\">digital season</a> with a new full-length ballet online every two weeks. The Sleeping Beauty is streaming until 17 April, followed by Cinderella and Romeo &amp; Juliet. The company is also offering <a href=\"https://australianballet.com.au/event/studios\">free adult online ballet classes</a> for all levels.</p> <p>On Instagram you can watch the dancers practising in their kitchens, using the bench or a high stool as a barre.

Staff call every dancer each day to monitor their physical and mental wellbeing.</p> <p>Amanda McGuigan, 32, a coryph\u00e9e in the company, has returned to Sydney to support her mother and grandparents. They all live in the same house in the inner west.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m using the mantlepiece in the lounge room as a barre, so I\u2019m just dancing around the fireplace,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cI wanted to come home so I can be a help to people who might be most affected by the virus. I wanted to do my part to support them and just be around to help out.\u201d</p> <p>McGuigan maintains her fitness with a morning yoga class on Instagram live video, followed by a video chat with six of her fellow dancers, and a two-hour company class on Teams. In the afternoons she runs in the local park.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c95855def2a8610588f12747579f0e69e39ecb8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c95855def2a8610588f12747579f0e69e39ecb8a/0_0_5565_3710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda McGuigan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanda McGuigan: \u2018We have put the big jet\u00e9s in the cupboard for now.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn class, we are still doing pirouettes and small jumps, so that keeps our legs going, but we have put the big jet\u00e9s in the cupboard for now,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling good. The honest truth is I\u2019m trying to stay positive for the people around me as I know how, as an individual, you can affect other people.\u201d</p> <p>McGuigan\u2019s dog frequently gets involved in her class. So does her grandmother. \u201cShe comes into the room and does the final 20 minutes of class with me. It\u2019s a beautiful moment for me each day \u2013 she makes me realise who I am doing this for.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t think about how long this lockdown will last, or how long it will be before she gets back on stage. \u201cI\u2019m not worried at all about getting my performance level back. The dancing is in all of us, it is innate \u2026</p> <p>\u201cBut I do miss my friends. I miss seeing everyone\u2019s smiles and working with people who push you and inspire you. We all want to get back on stage and see the audiences. And hugging. I just want to sit next to someone and put my arm around them and just get back to normal life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-JEl3CA4_9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIV/AIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>WHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia\u2019s minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country\u2019s health system.</p>\n    <p>WHO's handling of the global pandemic has been criticised by US president Donald Trump, who announced in April that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">the US will no longer contribute to funding the agency</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>Grace Mainwaring </b><i>and</i><b> Martin Belam</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO first raised the alert over the Wuhan outbreak on 5 January, and beginning on 7 January it was briefing public health officials from the US and other national governments on the outbreak in regular teleconference calls. On 9 January the <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/69650/timeline-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-and-u-s-response/\">WHO distributed guidance</a> to member states for their own risk assessment and planning.</p> \n<p>Trump and his supporters have focused on a 14 January WHO tweet reporting the findings of preliminary Chinese studies suggesting \u201cno clear evidence\u201d of human-to-human transmission.</p> \n<p>While the WHO was obliged to report on the latest findings of a member state at the source of the outbreak, its officials told their counterparts in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\"> technical briefings on 10 and 11 January</a>, and briefed the press on 14 January, that human-to-human transmission was still a strong possibility given the experience of past coronavirus epidemics and urged suitable precautions.</p> \n<p>Yamey said it was ridiculous to point to a single tweet early in the pandemic as the fixed position of the WHO. \u201cThe whole point of science is that we have initial hypotheses and initial ideas, and we update those ideas as more and more data emerges,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On 23 January the WHO updated its account of the coronavirus threat, confirming human-to-human transmission and warning that the global risk was high. One week later it formally declared a global emergency.</p> \n<p>Announcing the cut in funding on Tuesday, Trump accused the WHO of failing to send its experts to the source of the outbreak to gather samples. That failure decisively set back the effect to contain the pandemic, he claimed.</p> \n<p>In fact Beijing blocked a WHO delegation from visiting Wuhan in the first weeks of the outbreak. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had to <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1737014.shtml\">fly to Beijing</a> to meet Xi Jinping on 29 January to negotiate entry and information sharing. A WHO team was allowed to visit Wuhan on 22 February. Tedros has been criticised for his flattery of Xi and the Chinese response, in the face of Beijing\u2019s obstructionism and cover-up attempts. His defenders said that such diplomacy was the price for entry.</p> \n<p>Trump did more than his own fair share of Xi flattery. On 24 January, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1220818115354923009?lang=en\">president tweeted</a> \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus \u2026 The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The claim that the delay in the WHO acquiring samples crippled the international response is also false. Chinese scientists publicly released the genetic sequence of Covid-19 on 11 January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By early February the WHO was in a position to distribute a Covid-19 test worldwide, but the US government opted not to have it fast-tracked through approval. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) instead produced its own test at about the same time, but it was flawed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">had to be recalled</a>. US testing would be set back more than six weeks compared to the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>While virtually no testing was under way in the US throughout February, Trump assumed the consequently low number of confirmed US cases meant that his country had somehow escaped. \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1232058127740174339?lang=en\">boasted on 24 February</a>, nearly a month after the WHO declaration of emergency. \u201cWe are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health [Organisation] have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s turn against the WHO only gathered pace over the past week, as more and more reports emerged of the administration\u2019s own complacent and dysfunctional response.</p> \n<p>The impact of a block on US funds is likely to mitigated by other countries, who have almost unanimously expressed confidence in the WHO, stepping up their own financial backing. The UK, for example, has announced \u00a3200m in new funding for international efforts to contain and combat the pandemic, of which \u00a365m is earmarked for the WHO.</p> \n<p>How well Trump\u2019s scapegoating of the WHO will play in the US election is impossible to predict, but on the world stage it will undoubtedly be seen as yet another step in an accelerating US abdication of global leadership.</p>",

Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt.

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.

We don\u2019t have to wait until 1 May.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s the date by which Trump, the panjandrum of the White House podium, has said he would like to start reopening the shuttered US economy.</p> \n  <p>White House experts including the notably not-yet-fired Dr Anthony Fauci have cast doubt on that goal and said moving too swiftly to lift social restrictions <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/trump-fauci-hahn-reopening-who-virus-stalk-human-race\">could cause a resurgence in Covid-19 cases</a></strong>.

  "<p>The News Corporation journalist Annika Smethurst has won a high court case challenging the legality of the police raid on her home seeking the source of leaked classified material on plans to expand powers to spy on Australians.</p> <p>But in a mixed result for Smethurst, the court quashed the raid warrant but did not order police to destroy the material seized, exposing the reporter and her source to possible prosecution.</p> <p>Police may keep the material, opening the possibility a future court could exercise its discretion to allow it to be admitted into evidence if a prosecution is commenced, notwithstanding the illegality of the raid.</p> <p>The Australian Federal Police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told reporters in Canberra the material was \u201cquarantined\u201d while police obtained legal advice.</p> <p>In November the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, told the high court the AFP\u2019s undertaking not to use the material would expire at the end of the case.</p> <p>Asked if the material could be used against Smethurst in court, Kershaw replied it was a legal question that required speculation but noted \u201cthere\u2019s a difference between \u2026 illegally obtaining evidence and admissible evidence, and that\u2019s a question we have asked our in-house legal team\u201d.</p> <p>Kershaw confirmed the police matter regarding former intelligence officer Cameron Gill was \u201cstill current\u201d.

state the offence to which the warrant related with sufficient precision.</p> <p>But a majority of the court declined to grant an injunction to delete the material, pointing to <a
