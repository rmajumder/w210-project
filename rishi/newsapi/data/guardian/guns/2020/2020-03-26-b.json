  "<p><em>In our new series Stream Team, Guardian Australia\u2019s arts writers dig out their favourite hidden gems of streaming to help you while away some isolated hours.</em></p> <p>High Maintenance isn\u2019t the most obvious Covid-19 comfort watch. As an anthology series about varying New York stoners, its episodes laugh (and yes, sometimes cry) at the largely unknowable ways the city\u2019s millions are all interconnected \u2013 and right now, that idea is much more terrifying than it is funny.</p> <p>But after catching up on the show\u2019s fourth season \u2013 currently airing on Foxtel Go, direct from HBO \u2013 I was surprised to find it radiates more warmth than ever before.</p> <p>Created by now ex-husband and wife duo Ben Sinclair and Katja Blichfeld, High Maintenance began as a minuscule budget web series in 2012, before moving over to cable in 2016. Loosely based off Sinclair\u2019s own experiences, it sees a happy-go-lucky dealer (played by Sinclair) cycle through Brooklyn and Manhattan, weaving in and out of people\u2019s lives, known only as \u201cThe Guy\u201d \u2013 ie, \u201cCan you text the guy?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duGwZSnbLcs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/duGwZSnbLcs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Each episode focuses on different clients, ranging from overworked single mothers to insufferable Brooklynite creatives, as well as agoraphobics and an American Sign Language interpreter who is deep into a multi-level marketing scam.</p> <p>Every client is united by their use of weed as some form of self-medication, and High Maintenance explores why without imposing a moral in the process. Occasionally characters \u2013 or nods to past episodes \u2013 will pop up again, though it\u2019s far-flung from the Marvel crossovers we\u2019re used to. Instead, they\u2019re often unsubstantial yet memorable.</p> <p>Wherever we land, The Guy\u2019s endearingly awkward kindness remains at the heart of the show: he and High Maintenance both have a natural empathy for each person they meet, willing to follow them down the rabbit hole even if there\u2019s little resolution.</p> <p>In one scene, for instance, The Guy struggles to lie about liking a portrait his dentist painted of his one-eyed dog, offering free weed as forgiveness. If that sounds overly twee, the show balances out the cute moments with careful character studies, resisting an all-out parody of its Brooklynite bubble while still twisting the knife.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/26/new-girl-screwball-comedy-gets-funnier-and-smarter-and-is-best-when-binged\">New Girl: screwball comedy gets funnier and smarter \u2013 and is best when binged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even after it moved to the first home of prestige TV, High Maintenance has, ironically, stayed grounded. Originally filmed on a $1,000-an-episode budget, the show continues to favour indie-naturalism and deceptively simple dialogue. Even the odd cameo from the likes of Lena Dunham or Ira Glass come off as just another part of the absurdity of everyday life rather than HBO pulling strings.</p> <p>Sure, Martha Stewart\u2019s sudden appearance was jaw-dropping. But the show shares her spotlight with the episode\u2019s other plot line, about an ill, debt-ridden woman taking socialist redistribution into her own hands by stealing nice packages from her husband\u2019s work. Without labouring the point, the episode makes clear that both celebrity and poverty are ridiculous (and compromising) realities.</p> <p>High Maintenance isn\u2019t the typical binge watch. There\u2019s no overarching plot to encourage churning through episodes, or gorgeous cast to obsess or pine over as they love, hate and have sex with each other. But it\u2019s become a great comfort while I\u2019ve been locked inside because it exists in a different world from our own, and champions the kinds of connections we\u2019re devoid of right now: the usually ephemeral traces of each other that land as a byproduct from squeezing millions into a city.</p> <p>Right now, we\u2019ve cut that mundane magic by necessity. High Maintenance reminds us that those sometimes serendipitous, sometimes embarrassing moments will return. For better or worse; they\u2019re out of our control.</p> <p><em>\u2022&nbsp;High Maintenance streams on Foxtel Go, with seasons one to three also available to rent on iTunes.

About $250bn in federal funds would go to expanding these benefits, Sanders said.</p> \n<p>For many workers, the $600 added to their weekly state unemployment checks would mean that the checks would come close to matching their original salaries, labor experts said, and the measure would increase most unemployment payments to around the median weekly income of <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf\">$936</a>.</p> \n<p>A worker who files for unemployment in New York, for example, would typically get just $435 a week. Under the new emergency relief bill, that amount would increase to $1,035 a week, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive thinktank. This was a \u201cmajor boost of benefits\u201d, he said, and would ensure that most workers filing for unemployment during the pandemic \u201cdon\u2019t experience an economic catastrophe\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are, by historic standards, probably the most generous unemployment benefits we\u2019ve given,\u201d said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal thinktank.</p> \n<p>So generous, in fact, that a<strong> </strong>small group of Republican senators made a last-minute effort to try to change the benefits Wednesday night, arguing that the bill as written would temporarily give some laid-off workers benefits larger than their pay on the job.</p> \n<p>Senators Lindsey Graham, Ben Sasse, and Tim Scott called this a \u201cstrong incentive for employees to be laid off rather than going to work\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sanders lambasted his Republican colleagues for trying to reduce unemployment benefits, an attempt which failed in the senate late Wednesday night.</p> \n<p>During \u201can unprecedented economic crisis\u201d, Sanders said, \u201cthey\u2019re very upset that someone who is making $10, $12 an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow absurd and wrong is that?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cadefc22-6bff-4cf8-adce-c413778f0d4b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qCyyfquAJgU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The boost in unemployment insurance comes as<strong> </strong>the US labor department announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">3.3 million</a> Americans filed unemployment claims last week, the largest number the department had ever recorded. Millions more are expected to file for unemployment in the coming weeks. In California alone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/california-coronavirus-unemployment-newsom\">more than a million </a>people filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>The relief bill offers other lifelines to workers, including $367bn to help small businesses cover their employees\u2019 salaries and keep afloat. An estimated <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/cares-act-senate-coronavirus-bill-economic-relief-plan/\">94% of Americans who file taxes</a> will also get the one-time emergency payment: $1,200 for most individuals, $2,400 for couples, plus $500 per child in the household, with the payments reduced or eliminated for people at higher income levels.</p> \n<p>Most Americans will be able to receive these emergency payments through direct deposit in their bank accounts, and the payments will go out \u201cwithin three weeks\u201d, the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Wednesday.</p> \n<h2><strong>Many </strong><strong>could be left out</strong></h2> \n<p>Experts said that allowing self-employed and gig workers to receive unemployment checks was a crucial step forward, since these workers make up growing portion of the national workforce and have not previously been eligible for federal unemployment insurance.</p> \n<p>But the emergency relief bill still threatens to leave many people out, they said, including domestic workers paid in cash, undocumented workers, homeless Americans, people who do not have bank accounts, and some people who have not filed taxes recently.</p> \n<p>Even people who are eligible for unemployment may face delays in actually getting their checks. State unemployment systems have been overwhelmed by an unprecedented number of applicants. New York\u2019s online unemployment application website reportedly crashed multiple times this week. So did Oregon\u2019s.</p> \n<p>In addition, people who do not have direct deposit accounts on file, or who have moved since last filing their taxes, may face delays in getting their emergency payments. Some Americans who have not filed taxes recently may be entirely left out. The <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/16rpsaeztabulations.pdf\">Internal Revenue Service estimates</a> that about 30 to 40 million American adults, or about 15% of the population, do not file tax returns, Garrett Watson, an analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, said.</p> \n<p>Some experts said there was also a more fundamental problem: even though the senate\u2019s $2tn coronavirus package is being hailed as the largest emergency relief bill in American history, it may still not be enough to match the scale of the problem.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-economy-health-lives-trump\">The economy v our lives?

The current bill is \u201cjust not doing enough for state and local government\u201d, she said.

  "<p>As clubs across Europe move to reduce or defer their footballers\u2019 salaries, one thing is crystal clear. There will be no comfortable, one size fits all solution to an issue that faces almost everyone: the need to save money during the coronavirus crisis in an industry that, taking the continent as a whole, pays out 64% of its revenue in wages.</p> \n<p>That figure, Uefa\u2019s latest, is accurate up to 2018 and will certainly have risen. It is no wonder that, with income streams compromised indefinitely, clubs at all levels are seeking new arrangements. Goodwill \u2013 and an understanding that no two situations are the same when dealing with governments, leagues, clubs and even individuals \u2013 is essential and the positive stories are offset by examples of clubs being, at best, ham-fisted in their attempts to force through cuts.</p> \n<p>It is a precarious enough state of affairs to concern Fifpro, the global players\u2019 union, although it is aware every league has its unique challenges and a particular level of recourse to state support. Two cases provide a glimpse into how fraught things may become without compromise.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/premier-league-players-wage-deferrals-coronavirus\">Premier League players likely to accept wage deferrals to ease pressure on clubs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At Sion, in Switzerland, nine players \u2013 including the former Arsenal pair Alex Song and Johan Djourou \u2013 were sacked last week after refusing a proposal that would, according to one source close to the squad, have seen the highest earners take a reduction of up to 80%. A raft of legal cases is inevitable. The club claim just cause but the players\u2019 stance is that the deal involved a government support package for \u201cpartial unemployment\u201d that had not been put into law for footballers at that point.</p> \n<p>The players are believed to be happy to enter into individual negotiations. Sion have emphasised that the dismissed players were asked for their agreement in the event that the government\u2019s deal, which subsequently came into force, was passed and that they were not fired for rejecting a wage cut per se.</p> \n<p>The standoff at Dinamo Zagreb, whose players have refused the imposition of a six-month package that would see a third of their wages paid, a third deferred and a third cut entirely, risks becoming similarly drawn out. The Croatian footballers\u2019 association said that, even though the squad want to help, it is too early for such decisions and that the measure seems drastic given the low matchday and TV revenues in the local league. It claims the players were not consulted. Dinamo are yet to respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the Guardian has learned of clubs in Scandinavia that have told foreign players to take cuts of between 25% and 50% if they wish to spent the Covid-19 shutdown in their homelands. There is an acknowledgement at all levels below the very top that the issue is an existential one, but the balance between clubs\u2019 financial needs and those of their players is highly delicate and may prove impossible to strike.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are concerned that a significant number of clubs are acting to unilaterally reduce the salaries of players,\u201d the Fifpro general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, told the Guardian. \u201cWe are aware of such situations in more than half a dozen countries. In one case, within days of the suspension of the national league, players had their salaries immediately and arbitrarily decreased by two-thirds for a period of six months. While we fully understand the economic pressure employers are facing, we cannot accept unilateral actions that are based neither on individual consent nor collective agreements. As is already happening in other countries, clubs and leagues with cashflow difficulties should meet with national player unions to discuss and negotiate fair and proportionate arrangements.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24b9a91f492cbbbeda6e92e006dd59901c362f2c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b9a91f492cbbbeda6e92e006dd59901c362f2c/0_0_7686_4611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dortmund are among the top German clubs whose players have all taken temporary cuts of varying degrees to help lower-paid employees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dortmund are among the top German clubs whose players have all taken temporary cuts of varying degrees to help lower-paid employees.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The willingness of some clubs to take such firm action has led, in certain quarters, to a growing sense that the decks are being cleared for a universal termination of the 2019-20 campaign. But others are keener to bide their time before making demands of their players. The president of a club dominant in its nation\u2019s top flight said he accepted \u201cnothing will be like it was before\u201d when coronavirus has subsided, expecting sponsorship deals to take a particularly punishing hit. But he did not want to rush into a decision about passing any costs on to his team, particularly when football\u2019s legal status in the economy of that country remains unclear.</p> \n<p>One agent describes wage cuts or deferrals as essentially a two-tier issue, with leading Premier League sides operating in a different sphere to everyone else. Top-flight clubs are understood to be monitoring the subject closely although, in many cases, requests to forego money would be viewed dimly unless they were with the express intention of assisting support staff. While the players and staff at Championship club Leeds have taken a wage deferral for that reason, it is pointed out that a second-tier player in the autumn of a time-limited career who has \u2013 for example \u2013 a year left on his contract is not as financially secure as most might assume. The implication from many in the game is that livelihoods may be severely damaged if cases are not viewed one by one, as grinding a process as that might be.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30dbd695-69dc-431e-8426-c53b535d1a5e\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>English chief executives will have noted the examples of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, whose players have taken temporary cuts of varying degrees to help lower-paid employees. Barcelona\u2019s situation, while caught up in a tangle of complex Spanish employment regulations and existing tensions between squad and board, will also not have escaped attention. Their players are yet to agree reductions of up to 70%. The problem with imposing a blanket decrease within a single club is highlighted by the fact that, as currently proposed, the Barcelona deal could see staff from lesser-remunerated areas \u2013 such as the women\u2019s operation or handball team \u2013 take the same percentage cut as the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez.</p> \n<p>The number of players across Europe whose contracts expire in June, or in some cases sooner, brings a further layer of difficulty. As another player representative puts it, most of those trying to pick a way through this situation feel completely in the dark. The worry is that, for all the attempts to meet in the middle, good intentions may not be enough for an industry that has never faced challenges like these.</p>",
  "<p>Self-testing at home to find out whether somebody has had Covid-19 is an efficient way to find out if they are safe to return to work, a senior health official has said.</p> <p>Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, told the health select committee that finger-prick home tests would be available very soon. \u201cWe expect that to come within a couple of weeks, but I wouldn\u2019t want to promise on that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>It was \u201ccritical to understand what is going on and allow people to return to work\u201d she said. Self-testing was not new and was well understood by the public, with routine tests available such as the pregnancy test. \u201cThe intention is to allow people to do as much of this as they validly can. It is by far the most efficient way, if the technology will support it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On Wednesday Prof Sharon Peacock, from Public Health England, told MPs on the science and technology committee that a home test to detect antibodies indicating somebody has had Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days\">was being evaluated this week</a> in Oxford to make sure it worked as well as is claimed and would be available next week. Government advisers later cautioned that the test might not be ready so quickly.</p> <p>But the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has bought 3.5m antibody tests and will buy more.</p> <p>Governments around the world are all seeking better and faster tests to show whether people have the disease or have had had it and recovered.</p> <p>Singapore developed an antibody test as early as February. The US Covid-19 co-ordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has said the US government is interested in it, and private US companies are also developing antibody tests. They include California-based Biomerica, which is selling to Europe and the Middle East, and New York-based Chembio Diagnostics, which is selling to Brazil.</p> <p>\u201cSome are developed now. We are looking at the ones in Singapore,\u201d Birx said on Monday at a White House press briefing. \u201cWe are very quality-oriented. We don\u2019t want false positives.\u201d</p> <p>UK firms and academics have also developed self-test kits for Covid-19 that are expected to be available to buy in the coming weeks or months.</p> <p>One cheap test is made by Mologic, a diagnostic test firm based in Bedford. Another kit has been developed by researchers at three UK universities led by Brunel University.</p> <p>Mologic has produced the first prototypes of an antibody test for Covid-19, building on its experience of developing a rapid test kit for Ebola. Assessment and validation of the test began this week at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St George\u2019s, University of London.</p> <p>The company said it would take three to four months before the test is available in the UK and other countries. It will cost \u00a31 in the UK and will be as simple to use as a home pregnancy test but will use saliva or blood rather than urine, with results ready in 10 minutes. </p> <p>Mologic, which <a href=\"https://mologic.co.uk/mologic-and-partners-begin-validation-process-for-covid-19-point-of-need-diagnostic-test/\">received \u00a31m from the UK government</a> to develop the test, will be able to make 8m kits a year at facilities in the UK and Senegal. In Senegal it will be sold for less than $1.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>These tests could be a game-changer for diagnosis and follow-up of patients both in hospital and in the community, allowing us to detect cases early and isolate patients and their families rapidly,\u201d said Dr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer in diagnostics for infectious disease at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.</p> <p>The test kit <a href=\"https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Manufacturers-needed-for-rapid-roll-out-of-Coronavirus-test\">developed by researchers at Brunel University London</a>, Lancaster University and the University of Surrey is based on science evaluated in the Philippines to check chickens for viral infections.</p> <p>The battery-operated handheld device processes nasal or throat swabs that are inserted into it, and delivers the results within 30 to 45 minutes via a smartphone app. The team has approached UK, US and European regulators for approval and is in talks with 60 manufacturers. It could be available to the public within a few weeks.</p> <p>The device will be priced at \u00a3100 and can test six people at once. The test can detect the virus in individuals who show no symptoms because it recognises the DNA structure of the virus in the samples.</p>",
  "<p>We may be fighting the deadly spread of a tiny foe, but this is not a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5945c61a-6dc7-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\" title=\"\">wartime economy</a>. In war, governments try to increase economic activity to produce weapons and are forced to tamp down inflation. Today governments deliberately want to lower economic activity to cut the risk of a virus transmission. Many Conservatives\u2019 key belief in free-market societies is that they reward the industrious and punish the idle. Yet the mass joblessness, income shortfalls and business failures we hear about are not because of any human flaw, but because of a government-led shutdown and the fear coursing through the economy. The upshot is that GDP will fall. However, we must not let this situation spiral out of control. Letting a shutdown that lowers aggregate demand lead to unemployment that further cuts demand could put the economy into a tailspin. What is needed is for people and firms to maintain cashflow and help with bills, until some semblance of normality returns.</p> <p>While businesses have been bailed out, there has been a slower move to put money in the pockets of people. Last week the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government would pay 80% of the wages of the UK\u2019s 28 million private sector employees. It was not until on Thursday that he did the same for the nation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18334915.rishi-sunak-set-aid-package-5m-self-employed-workers-help-survive-pandemic/\" title=\"\">5 million self-employed</a>. This is in part because to help these workers meant dealing with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fissuredworkplace.net/\" title=\"\">fissuring</a>\u201d of the workplace, where people doing the same job in many sectors have increasingly different pay, benefits and privileges. While the complexity and precarious nature of the labour market has helped companies, especially those who can skilfully navigate lightly regulated employment rules, these fissures undermine the safety net which depends crucially on employment status.</p> <p>The support scheme for self-employed workers announced by the chancellor, at a cost of around \u00a310bn, is welcome. But he has not gone far enough for the lowest-paid. The self-employed <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/two-million-self-employed-adults-earn-less-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">earn about half</a> the amount of those in employment. Covering 80% of poverty wages is just another form of financial destitution. And the money doesn\u2019t come until June. The chancellor did not address the gig economy\u2019s precarious nature \u2013 or offer to help those whose hours have been cut during this crisis. If he wants them to pay national insurance at the same rate as employees then he must also make their work secure enough so that they cannot be pressured into working when sick during a pandemic. Workers can have flexible work without denying them basic rights.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has exposed the holes in the UK\u2019s social security net. These were well known to the growing ranks of poor, but unfamiliar territory to many people who will encounter the hostile environment of the benefits system in the coming months. In the last nine days more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/universal-credit-claims-almost-impossible-as-more-than-500000-apply\" title=\"\">500,000</a> people, mainly employees who lost their jobs, have applied for universal credit. A system designed for welfare recipients politically denigrated as shifty is now being swamped by \u201cupstanding citizens\u201d. It will have to be reshaped and resized. The five-week wait for universal credit will have to disappear. The rate of sick pay \u2013 \u00a394.25 a week \u2013 is not enough to live on.</p> <p><a href=\"http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/CASE/_new/events/event/?index=7401\" title=\"\">John Hills at the LSE</a> suggests using child benefit to get money straight to struggling households. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14771\" title=\"\">total bill will run to \u00a3120bn</a>. Conservatives appear to accept the need for generous benefits reluctantly and without much conviction, aware that perhaps they will be hard to reverse. But to defeat coronavirus there will probably have to be many more converts to the gospel of big government.</p>",

It also includes nearly $500bn in lending authority that one environment group, <a href=\"https://foe.org/home/\">Friends of the Earth</a>, called a \u201ccorporate slush fund with insufficient guardrails to protect workers, taxpayers and the climate\u201d.</p> <p>Congressional Republicans have accused Democrats of taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue climate policy. The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said this week that Democrats were \u201cbargaining as usual\u201d with \u201ccounter-offers that demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar panels\u201d. Multiple Republican politicians tweeted accusing Democrats of trying to usher in a Green New Deal with massive climate spending during a crisis.</p> <p>In the end, the stimulus package focused on direct aid to individuals and the worst-hit industries, while setting climate considerations aside.</p> <p>Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/\">Environmental Defense Fund</a>, said that while the situation for airlines and their workers was dire, the industry should have had to commit to slashing emissions as a condition of the aid.</p> <p>\u201cThe provisions we were focused on simply would hold the airlines to what they already said they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Petsonk said. \u201cPeople do not want to solve one crisis by making another crisis worse.\u201d The 2008 auto industry bailout, in comparison, led to stricter rules for pollution from vehicle tailpipes.</p> <p>The bill, the third in a series of stimulus packages, offers virtually nothing to climate advocates, but it is not the last word. Scott Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist with the firm Bracewell LLC, which represents energy industry clients, said a fourth stimulus deal was likely to involve \u201csignificant discussions of green objectives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWas this a missed opportunity for climate? I think the answer to that is no,\u201d Segal said. \u201cThis stimulus package was primarily about getting money into the hands of individual households and workers and in some service sectors that were particularly hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, said: \u201cCongress is going to be making more deals, and as long as there is a deal to be made, Democrats have made clear what they want.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats negotiated multiple measures meant to prevent abuse of the $500bn available in lending, including an oversight board, a special inspector general and provisions aimed at limiting Donald Trump\u2019s businesses from benefiting \u2013 an issue that has already come <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/virus-fineprint-stimulus-bill.html\">under scrutiny.</a></p> <p>But climate hawks said those stipulations were not strong enough. \u201cWhat makes this so frightening is that there are very few binding restrictions on how this money can be used that the secretary of treasury cannot waive,\u201d said Lukas Ross, a senior policy analyst with Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that [Trump\u2019s son-in-law ] Jared Kushner isn\u2019t going to get a subsidised line of credit. It\u2019s much more worrying in human terms that Chevron, Exxon and every other polluter you can imagine is eligible to be propped up in terms of the stimulus package.\u201d</p> <p>The bill also does not include specific assistance to the renewable energy industry, although trade associations and lobbyists expect to revisit that possibility as discussions continue about more targeted aid for at-risk sectors of the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.awea.org/\">American Wind Energy Association</a> (AWEA) projects that the US wind industry could lose 35,000 jobs and $35bn in investment. Those losses could lead to lease payment and tax revenue reductions for local and state governments. No tax credit extensions have been granted for the solar and wind industries, meaning they may lose access to credits if they miss deadlines.</p> <p>\u201cObviously of primary importance is the public health and keeping the economy moving. We applaud that big effort,\u201d said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the AWEA, adding that his group would continue to push for tax provisions to stem industry losses.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.seia.org/\">Solar Energy Industries Association</a> said the solar sector could lose half its jobs, meaning \u201c125,000 families who will no longer receive a paycheck\u201d.</p> <p>Abigail Ross Hopper, its president and CEO, said: \u201cLegislators were really focused on industry-wide protections and assistance, like the unemployment insurance, like the loans for which our companies are eligible, and did not include industry-specific solutions for a couple of particularly hard hit ones.\u201d</p> <p>In one climate win for Democrats, the bill does not include a discussed $3bn to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to lift global oil prices.</p>",

This is because the self-employed are much more likely to work in personal services (eg cleaning and hairdressing), arts and leisure (eg performing arts or fitness instruction) and passenger transport (eg taxi services).</p> \n   <p>In total, nearly a million (0.9 million) self-employed people work in sectors that will be mostly shut down during the crisis period. If restrictions are tightened further, the 0.8 million self-employed workers in the construction sector may also be affected (if they haven\u2019t been already).

As PA Media reports, in an email to staff, the inventor said his eponymous company designed the \u201cCoVent\u201d at the request of Boris Johnson, and promised to donate 5,000 to the international relief effort. Dyson said teams of engineers had been working solidly on the design since receiving the call from PM 10 days ago, and the UK government had placed an initial order of 10,000 units. He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have received an initial order of 10,000 units from the UK government, which we will supply on an open-book basis.</p> \n   <p>We are also looking at ways of making it available internationally.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The company is now waiting for the design to receive regulatory approval so manufacturing can commence.</p> \n  <p>Created in partnership with Cambridge-based science engineering firm TTP, the new ventilator had to be safe, effective, efficient in conserving oxygen and portable, Dyson said. It also had to be bed-mounted, easy to use and not require a fixed air supply. The battery-powered machine has been designed for use in different settings, including field hospitals and when patients are being transported, PA reports.</p> \n  <p>In his email Dyson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The core challenge was how to design and deliver a new, sophisticated medical product in volume and in an extremely short space of time.

  "<p>Here\u2019s how the government\u2019s \u00a3330bn loan package for British businesses could become very messy: if the state ends up supporting the likes of Intu Properties, the deeply debt-laden shopping centre landlord that failed to fix its balance sheet in happier times.</p> <p>At first glance, taxpayer-backed assistance for Intu should be out of the question. The Covid Corporate Finance Facility (CCFF), which is the relevant Treasury-backed scheme for large companies, \u201cis open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the [coronavirus] shock\u201d, say the rules.</p> <p>Intu, to state the obvious, was not healthy. The owner of the Lakeside centre in Essex and the Trafford centre near Manchester has \u00a34.5bn of borrowings; the stock market values the equity at just \u00a350m; and the company last month failed to land a \u00a31.5bn refinancing from its shareholders, thereby creating a \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over its future.</p> <p>Yet here\u2019s a line from Intu\u2019s trading update on Thursday: \u201cWe have an ongoing dialogue with the UK government and may look to access their \u00a3330bn support package.\u201d But how? The package is not meant for companies that were already teetering on the brink.</p> <p>Intu\u2019s argument, it seems, is that commercial landlords also deserve support because the government gave tenants permission to delay rental payments for three months. And it\u2019s true that tenants used the freedom: Intu received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-intu-warns-of-breach-in-debt-commitments-as-retail-rents-collapse\">only 29% of rents due this month</a>.</p> <p>Come on, though, there is a limit to what the government\u2019s bridging efforts can be expected to support. If the crisis lasts for months and months, then, yes, the short-term cashflow worries of commercial landlords could become a wider issue. But we\u2019re not there yet.</p> <p>British Land and almost every other large commercial landlord is able to absorb a temporary hit to rental income. Intu is less able to do the same because its capital structure was unstable long before coronavirus struck. Piling yet more debt onto the current huge pile would not be useful.</p> <p>Intu\u2019s crisis is one for its current lenders to tackle, as it always was. Thursday\u2019s statement also said the company is seeking waivers on loan covenants from its banks. Good: that is the right approach.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should stay well away. There are many more deserving cases than Intu to support.</p> <h2>Medium-sized companies may be too large for coronavirus support</h2> <p>In fact, the urgent problem with the Treasury package is the hole in the middle. Medium-sized companies are too large for the coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, where loans are up to \u00a35m, but many will feel the CCFF is not aimed at them.</p> <p>You can see their point. The CCFF language is all about public credit ratings, an unknown world for, say, a family-owned business with a turnover of \u00a3100m. Applicants are allowed to use a current lender\u2019s internal credit rating or get a rating agency to make an assessment, but those are also unfamiliar hurdles.</p> <p>The Treasury may have to show flexibility and imagination. It can lambast banks to lend more, but some of the red tape is of its own making.</p> <h2>Audit via drone at the time of coronavirus</h2> <p>What you need to be an auditor? Professional scepticism is the basic skill \u2013 and one lacking in too many cases in recent years. Now an ability to operate a drone could be handy.</p> <p>To be clear, drone-control is not yet a necessary requirement. It\u2019s just an example of what the Financial Reporting Council means by \u201calternative procedures\u201d that auditors can use to seek evidence to support an audit opinion. If a conventional stock-take is impossible because premises are locked down under coronavirus restrictions, send in a flying machine with a camera.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Regulatory encouragement of such lateral-thinking should be welcomed. When uncertainties lie in every direction, there is a risk that auditors become inclined to take too much on trust. It would be a disaster if the definition of \u201cfair and true\u201d becomes watered down at the moment when companies\u2019 \u201cgoing concern\u201d statements are about to become the most scrutinised part of the accounts.</p> <p>The authorities\u2019 bigger reform was to give companies six months after their financial year-end, instead of four, to publish audited numbers. That move seems sensible too: better to be accurate than fast.</p>",
  "<p>Israel\u2019s main opposition party has split after its leader, Benny Gantz, was elected as speaker of parliament with the support of his rivals, including Benjamin Netanyahu, in a stunning plot twist to a year-long political crisis.</p> <p>Gantz\u2019s move was widely interpreted as a precursor to a power-sharing deal with the prime minister to form an emergency government. The coronavirus pandemic, including more than 2,600 confirmed Israeli cases, has added urgency to efforts to break a stalemate between the two leaders.</p> <p>\u201cThese are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions. That\u2019s why I intend to explore the formation of a national emergency government,\u201d Gantz told the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament.</p> <p>While neither side confirmed that an agreement was already in place, suggested scenarios have included Gantz and Netanyahu taking turns as prime minister in a rotation system.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, Gantz took a risk by nominating himself for speaker, and he was accused of blindsiding allies and supporters in the process.</p> <p>Throughout three elections, the former head of the army has run campaigns squarely focused on promises to oust Netanyahu, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">faces criminal charges</a> for alleged corruption.</p> <p>Before the vote, Gantz\u2019s public plans were to elect a speaker from his party and push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment.</p> <p>That plan appears to have been abandoned by the opposition leader in favour of the complete opposite \u2013 he may now, as speaker, protect Netanyahu from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.</p> <p>However, in doing so, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party looks on the brink of disintegration, with factions within it refusing to back his candidacy for speaker, and several moving to break away.</p> <p>Both the Yesh Atid and Telem parties, which hold more than half of Blue and White\u2019s seats, filed to leave the alliance.</p> <p>Yair Lapid, Gantz\u2019s running mate and the head of Yesh Atid, accused the leader of surrendering \u201cwithout a fight\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBenny Gantz decided today to break apart Blue and White and crawl into Netanyahu\u2019s government,\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday evening. \u201cWe ran together because Benny Gantz looked me in the eye and said we would never sit in this bad government.\u201d</p> <p>Tamar Zandberg, a member of the leftwing Meretz party allied with Blue and White, accused Gantz of abandoning millions of voters who sought an alternative to Netanyahu.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll end up a rug under the feet of an alleged crook, an inciter and racist,\u201d she said in a speech to the session. \u201cWe are overwhelmed by the depth of the deceit and disgrace that has plagued today.\u201d</p> <p>In his speech, Gantz said he would \u201cnever compromise on the principles underpinning the votes of over a million Israelis who voted for Blue and White. I will never compromise on democracy. Netanyahu is well aware of that.\u201d</p> <p>While a unity government was not confirmed, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing bloc, the defence minister Naftali Bennett, publicly congratulated Gantz for what he said was \u201cthe brave step of entering into a unity government under Netanyahu\u201d.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s previous speaker, Yuli Edelstein, was a close ally of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu\">Netanyahu</a> and a member of Likud. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/netanyahu-ally-yuli-edelstein-resigns-speaker-israel-parliament\">resigned on Wednesday</a> following fierce criticism of his refusal to open parliament, which he suspended last week citing a ban of large gatherings while the country tackled the coronavirus.</p> <p>The suspension was decried as an anti-democratic attempt to shield his job and to protect Netanyahu from bills that could oust him.</p> <p>For the past year Israel has been in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/israel-limbo-third-election-twelve-months-netanyahu-gantz\">state of political paralysis</a> as a result of three inconclusive elections, the latest of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">was held on 2 March</a>. In that time both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister.</p> <p>Gantz was the latest to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">tasked with forming a government</a> after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy. However, it was not clear if he had the votes to build a solid, majority coalition by the mid-April deadline.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, has been urging the two leaders to form a unity deal.</p>",
  "<p>Since the engineering firm Dyson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/airbus-dyson-firms-waiting-uk-green-light-produce-ventilators-coronavirus\">unveiled a prototype ventilator</a> that it said could help arm the NHS for a surge in Covid-19 patients, there has been scepticism about its role.</p> <p>The billionaire entrepreneur Sir James Dyson is better known for his bagless vacuum cleaners, his backing for Brexit and more recently an attempt to build an electric car that he ultimately abandoned.</p> <p>One ventilator expert, whose company Penlon is working with the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium, speculated that designing a new device and producing thousands rapidly was unrealistic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">No 10 accused of putting 'Brexit over breathing' in Covid-19 ventilator row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government has ordered 10,000 ventilators from Dyson, which developed its CoVent prototype in under a fortnight and says it could start producing them within weeks. \u201cThe race is now on to get it into production,\u201d Dyson told staff in an emailed rallying cry.</p> <p>The company has no medical expertise but it does have some relevant experience, given that both ventilators and vacuum cleaners involve pumping air efficiently. Areas of crossover include digital motors, battery packs, airflow analysis and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.</p> <p>Nor has Dyson been working alone. It teamed up with the Technology Partnership, a Cambridge-based melting pot of scientists and innovators, some of whom have significant medical experience.</p> <p>The government\u2019s medical and healthcare products and regulatory agency has also been looking at Dyson\u2019s plans. It has yet to give final approval for the CoVent but it has been involved in testing.</p> <p>Not everyone is happy about the way Dyson has gone about trumpeting its role in the effort. Dozens of companies are working on separate efforts to produce ventilators and all have kept their plans relatively secret until the government is ready to give an official update.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the green light to start talking about it and Dyson jumping the gun wasn\u2019t helpful to anyone,\u201d said a source at one company.</p> <p>The fact that the government has placed firm orders for 10,000 CoVents pending regulatory approval indicates that the plan has legs. Dyson has also promised to donate another 5,000 to aid global efforts to fight Covid-19, with 1,000 of them reserved for the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe government will be looking at all options to make sure they have the right technology available to them,\u201d said Neil Campbell, whose company Inspiration Healthcare has a \u00a34m contract to import ventilators from overseas while the UK production effort gathers pace. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for an awful lot of ventilators and if someone has a plan you\u2019re going to look at it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Dyson is not a complete outlier in claiming it can design and build a ventilator \u2013 a complex and highly specialised piece of equipment \u2013 from scratch. The defence and engineering firm Babcock followed suit on Thursday, working in tandem with an unnamed company that already has expertise in the area.</p> <p>Sources in government and among industrial firms taking part in the effort say no one thinks of the various plans released by Dyson, Babcock and the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium as being in competition with one another.</p> <p>Rather, the government is adopting a blunderbuss approach, throwing as much ammunition as it can at a problem that cannot yet be quantified.</p>",

  "<p>MPs will no longer automatically get a vote on any future plans to redraw constituency boundaries.</p> <p>The government had planned to reduce the number of MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/12/number-of-mps-to-cut-from-650-to-600\">from 650 to 600 </a>but announced a U-turn on Wednesday, the last day before parliamentary recess, citing the increased workload expected because of Brexit.</p> <p>However, it has also emerged that among the many changes planned by the government is that any future decisions from the Boundary Commission would be implemented automatically. </p> <p>The Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said this would stop any \u201cinterference\u201d in the process. A set of boundary plans were voted down by opposition MPs in 2013.</p> <p>There has been criticism in the past that MPs have vested interests in the boundaries of their constituency, as any redrawing of the map can place into their patch new council wards that might typically vote for other parties, making the constituency more or less safe for their own party.</p> <p>In her written statement to the Commons, Smith said: \u201cThis change would provide certainty that the recommendations of the independent boundary commissions \u2013 developed through a robust and impartial process that is open to extensive consultation \u2013 would then be implemented without interference.\u201d</p> <p>The government has now changed the rules so that the new map would be implemented automatically by bringing it to parliament through a mechanism called an order in council.</p> <p>The latest boundary review process, the sixth one to take place since the 1940s, recommended in 2011 that the number of MPs should be reduced from 650 to 600, but the process has been beset with delays. Proposals laid out in 2013 that were backed by the Tories were defeated in parliament.</p> <p>The Boundary Commission released new proposals in 2018 recommending scrapping 32 seats in England, six in Scotland, 11 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The boundaries would have scrapped Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Islington North seat and made Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge less safe by bringing in typically Labour-voting wards in Ealing.</p> <p>A controversial \u201cDevonwall\u201d seat that crossed the counties of Devon and Cornwall was another unpopular proposal in the now-axed 2018 plan.</p> <p>Smith said the decision to abandon plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 was sensible in light of changed circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cSince that policy was established in the coalition agreement, the United Kingdom has now left the European Union,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK parliament will have a greater workload now we are taking back control and regaining our political and economic independence. It is therefore sensible for the number of parliamentary constituencies to remain at 650.\u201d</p>",

On the day Australia banned \u201cnon-essential\u201d gatherings of over 100 people, Patrick had two hours of phone calls, emails and Zoom video conferences in which his remaining wages for 2020 disappeared.</p> <p>What hurt more was that 2020 was to be the first year Patrick finally pulled off working full-time as an artist. When I ask if he\u2019s tallied up his lost earnings yet, he laughs grimly and says he\u2019d been avoiding it. But he\u2019s done the sums for me now. All up, he lost $32,000 in those two hours alone.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter what sector we work in and where we live: no human being will be left untouched by Covid-19 by the time it finishes boiling its way through our communities. In the meantime, we\u2019re in survival mode. After taking stock of whether we have enough toilet paper, groceries and medical supplies, our next instinct is to seek comfort \u2013 anything to settle our heart rate and combat the stultifying dread and silence of self-isolation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In our most dire hours, art keeps us sane, lights the dark and ensures we stay human</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And we always find that comfort in the arts.</p> <p>Video games?

Only last December, the Morrison government folded the arts department entirely and absorbed it into a portfolio that didn\u2019t even bear its name: the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications. That department also oversees road and rail.</p> <p>All world governments now are in a state of desperate triage, but some have immediately stepped up for the arts. New Zealand quickly announced multimillion-dollar help for artists. When Germany neared 1,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the culture minister immediately promised financial assistance. Canada budgeted to pay musicians $1,000 grants to livestream gigs.</p> <p>Australia is following suit, to a modest extent. <a href=\"https://www.artshub.com.au/news-article/news/covid-19/richard-watts/states-step-up-with-funding-aid-as-coronavirus-impact-spreads-260075\">Some state and territory governments have announced new initiatives to support artists and organisations</a>, but the federal government is still missing in action.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/18/australian-airline-industry-to-receive-715m-rescue-package\">Australian airlines are scheduled to receive a $715m bailout</a>. And while it\u2019s never fair to directly compare sectors, it\u2019s worth noting Australian airlines contribute an estimated $18.42bn to the Australian economy every year. According to the government\u2019s own figures, Australian arts and culture contributes $111.7bn over the same period.</p> <p>How we can best support artists and the arts will become clearer in the weeks and months ahead. Already it\u2019s likely your local independent bookshop offers free delivery within certain postcodes, with staff delivering books by bicycle. We should pay musicians directly for their music instead of streaming it.

  "<p>In a way I\u2019m glad that Kim Kardashian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/kim-kardashian-west-accuses-taylor-swift-of-lying-over-leaked-tape-kanye\">reignited a four-year-old feud with Taylor Swift</a> based on an 11-year-old feud with Taylor Swift that was all started by Kanye West, a man who has hardly been involved in it since about 2017. In a way, that\u2019s good.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to [<em>gestures at current reality</em>] be constantly thinking about, you know, rather more pressing matters. The cleanliness of door handles, for example. The intensity of other people\u2019s coughs, or how far to veer away from each other on the pavements while out on your government-mandated walk. Whether you have enough food in the cupboards to last two weeks. Whether daytime TV will ever go back to normal. How deeply we can possibly scrape the bottom of the Netflix barrel. How desperate for entertainment we will have to be to plunge ourselves into going on YouTube and watching a vlog. Right now, these are my worries. It\u2019s nice of Kim Kardashian to try to distract me with something totally and utterly facile and pointless at a time of global crisis.</p> <p>On the other hand, come on. To help you catch up, this all truly started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/14/kanye-west-taylor-swift-vmas\">at the VMAs in 2009</a>, when Swift was 20 and Kardashian was three years away from even dating Kanye, in fact was still at the \u201cCarl\u2019s Jr advert and a guest appearance at WrestleMania\u201d level of fame. In 2016, Kanye released the song Famous, featuring the eternally controversial lyric: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d Swift rightly took exception to having her career as one of the most successful singer-songwriters in global history getting reduced down to \u201cthat bitch\u201d.</p> <p>At which point Kardashian \u2013 now an ascendent, royalty-level celebrity, married in a palace \u2013 released a Snapchat video of Kanye on the phone to Swift before the song was even recorded, openly discussing the lyrical content. The intimation was: Swift knew about the lyric, she fully had the heads up, she can\u2019t be mad at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in one of the biggest songs of 2016, and by being in any way upset at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d she is somehow Playing The Game. This is the natural starting point of our feud.</p> <p>I have gone through some changing feelings about Swift over the years, because I don\u2019t really like her music \u2013 which is a fine and normal opinion to have. But something about the hugeness of Swift, and her ubiquity, makes \u201cnot really liking the sounds she makes\u201d become something close to political. Here\u2019s a rough Marmite analogy for you. Swift is the semi-popular yeast spread Marmite, in that if you love her, you love her with an intensity that blocks out the sun; if you don\u2019t, she leaves you utterly cold. But because her songs constantly loop on the A-list of society, you cannot escape Marmite, and now you\u2019re starting to really get rubbed up the wrong way by Marmite.</p> <p>Every Friday afternoon, all the people in the office take control of the shared kitchen and make you eat a slice of bread and Marmite. At every wedding you are at, there is a tangible point in the evening when everyone, fuzzy drunk and joyful, kicks their shoes off and loudly heaps an entire spoon of Marmite into your mouth. Every time you tell someone you don\u2019t like Marmite, they bore on at you for ages about how much umami her new album adds to stews and bologneses. At this point, you cannot avoid Marmite, because every advert is for Marmite and every time Marmite releases a new jar, every headline is about Marmite, and how Marmite \u201cdid that\u201d. Despite not even liking Marmite, you somehow know about Marmite\u2019s thing with Tom Hiddleston where he wore that vest.</p> <p>And now your feelings about Marmite aren\u2019t about Marmite any more. They are fixed towards the celebratory Marmite culture that has been built around it, one you are constantly on the outside of, looking in. </p> <p>Anyway, this week the full and explicit 25-minute video of Kanye\u2019s call to Taylor in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/kim-kardashian-west-accuses-taylor-swift-of-lying-over-leaked-tape-kanye\">got leaked</a>. It went a fair way to vindicating Swift and making it clear she was unprepared to be called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in the song. And Swift reacted to the leak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1242206240618446850\">by posting</a> on Instagram: \u201cInstead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that <em>somebody</em> edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years) \u2026 SWIPE up to see what really matters.\u201d And she added a link to various charity organisations supporting those on low income in the whole global pandemic thing. Kardashian responded by going on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1242299582136098821\">a Twitter rant</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s actually quite fascinating how badly Kardashian has played this one, because normally the dynasty is so good at upselling bad news in a way that just makes them richer and more adored. In the past few years they have managed to turn secret pregnancies, cheating scandals, Kanye\u2019s personal debt and the Kendall Jenner Pepsi advert into major PR wins. Each time, Kardashian somehow comes out of each one more regal and elegant and more on the cover of Vogue. </p> <p>But her feud with Swift has been a bum note from the off. What is it that Swift has been doing wrong, again? Being slightly too earnest in a hard-edged industry that clomps her around like a pair of shoes in a tumble dryer? Being gracefully tight-lipped in the face of years of provocation? Linking to a charity organisation on Instagram? Not liking being called a bitch? At this point, whatever your feelings about Marmite, it\u2019s really hard not to take its side in the face of relentless attempts by Nutella to reignite a feud with it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e62ee2d03d431b021a58f5a5c1f8044db91e9b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e62ee2d03d431b021a58f5a5c1f8044db91e9b0/591_67_1229_1786/688.jpg\" alt=\"Britney Spears\" width=\"688\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comrade Britney rocks a revolutionary-red off-the-shoulder number</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>We\u2019ll meet you on the barricades, Britney!</h2> <p>A word on Comrade Britney, now, to whose revolution I offer humbly my hands and heart. While Kim Kardashian has been holed up in a Calabasas mansion going on about arguments that happened an entire World Cup cycle ago, Britney Spears has been a sunbeam of support to her fans throughout this pandemic, offering aid to those who are struggling and reaching out to her via DM. And, in really quite an unexpected zig, she has amplified an artist\u2019s call for a general strike and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/25/comrade-britney-spears-star-calls-for-strike-and-wealth-redistribution\">redistribution of wealth in the US</a>. All right, Britney, let\u2019s \u2026 all right man. Let\u2019s do this. Drag them out by their hair.</p> <p>On Instagram, Britney <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FppKxAFxm/?utm_source=ig_embed\">shared</a> a quote from the writer Mimi Zhu, saying: \u201cDuring this time of isolation, we need connection now more than ever [\u2026] We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the waves of the web. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike. We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay. Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I\u2019m a little unsure how much of that Britney actually meant. Over the course of her long career, she has only touched on politics once or twice, endorsing the Iraq war, being registered in Louisiana as a Republican (in 2001) and, in 2017, encouraging her followers to support the Dream Act, which would have offered legal status to undocumented immigrants who went to school in the US. So, \u201ca mixed bag\u201d. But then, in a nice font and on an orange background, and talking so charmingly about reaching out to friends and family \u2026 it does sort of look like a generically wholesome Instagram quote, if you squint and look at it.</p> <p>Like \u2026 you really have to read down to see the bit about taking the wealth and striking hard. I still back her pivot to communism to the hilt. And who among us hasn\u2019t accidentally called for a revolution by sharing a meme they liked on Instagram? If she comes out of this with a Vegas show that calls for us to bring society crumbling down and rebuild it again from the rubble up, cool. And if she doesn\u2019t? That is also OK. Stay safe, Britney Spears. Stay golden.</p>",
  "<p>As Augie Lindmark, a resident physician at Yale University prepared for an onslaught of Covid-19 patients last week, he noticed something at his hospital: there were still patients without the virus, completely stable, in the beds.</p> \n<p>These patients, many of whom should have been moved to a rehab facility or released, were stuck waiting until their private health insurance company authorized the next steps, which can <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2019-02/prior-auth-2018.pdf\">take days</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/nurse-coronavirus-california-journal\">The ER Diaries: inside a California hospital, a sneeze can cause a panic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Usually, the prior authorization process is an expected inefficiency at Yale, and most other American hospitals. But with thousands of Covid-19 patients being admitted every day across the country, and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/upshot/hospital-bed-shortages-coronavirus.html\">critical shortage</a> of hospital beds, that red tape now carries much more weight.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny sort of slowing in the health system has dire consequences,\u201d Lindmark said.</p> \n<p>In the past two weeks the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the country. States and cities have been weighing public health measures, making changes to government health plans, and pushing sweeping changes to everyday life. Physicians have largely sought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/us-hospitals-coronavirus-pandemic-postpone-elective-surgery-procedures\">reschedule and cancel elective surgeries</a> and other patient visits deemed non-essential to free up resources to handle the virus.</p> \n<p>But with a history of restrictive and confusing policies, private health insurance companies have lagged behind: making incremental changes to plans even as health providers seek to change course.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing healthcare to make money, not to take care of people,\u201d said Dr Judd Hollander, an emergency medicine physician and associate dean at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Hollander has been instrumental in implementing Jefferson\u2019s telemedicine program, which allows patients to consult health providers through secure video, over the past few years.</p> \n<p>Telemedicine, most experts <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2003539\">agree</a>, is an impactful and low-cost tool in slowing the spread of the virus. Telemedicine eases the burden on hospitals and hospital beds by redirecting patients without in-person needs.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump recently <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet\">expanded telemedicine provisions</a> under the Medicare plan \u2013 a public insurance plan for senior Americans \u2013 allowing physicians to get paid equally for in-person or remote visits, and approving more devices and programs like Skype to be used to telemedicine.</p> \n<p>But private health companies do not have to follow the same rules.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe federal government never aligned incentives, most states never passed meaningful legislation, and many commercial payers didn\u2019t pay health systems for telemedicine,\u201d Hollander said. \u201cSo now we\u2019re left in this horrible scenario.\u201d</p> \n<p>Several private physicians the Guardian spoke to were struggling to implement the systems from scratch as Covid-19 cases started to flood their states. Some physicians said older patient populations didn\u2019t know how to use the technology. Others said the variations in private plans made it hard to make any new protocols without risking revenue, which could affect their employees.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the issue is that private insurances have not really made it clear that they will reimburse these visits and if so at what cost,\u201d said Dr Vipul Patel, an orthopedic surgeon in Brooklyn. </p> \n<p>Riddhi Shah, the director of operations at a mental health clinic in Michigan, said insurance companies are hard to contact right now, and while the plans have dropped the prior authorization restrictions, the clinic still has to navigate new billing codes and financial loss. </p> \n<p>For those who have already built telemedicine systems, the demand is clear.</p> \n<p>As NYU Langone absorbs some of the largest populations of Covid-19 patients in the country, the telemedicine system has gone from serving 1,500 patients a month to about 3,000 a day in the past week, said Dr Shabana Khan, a child psychiatrist at NYU Langone who has been helping build the hospital system\u2019s telemedicine capacity for the past few years.</p> \n<p>She said many private doctors, meanwhile, are burdened by the restrictions that insurance companies have placed in the past, which made it harder for them to set up a system like NYU. She pointed out that only 10 states have <a href=\"https://www.foley.com/-/media/files/insights/health-care-law-today/19mc21487-50state-survey-of-telehealth-commercial.pdf\">true telemedicine parity</a>, which means providers can treat and bill for telemedicine visits like in-person visits.</p> \n<p>With the bureaucracy standing in their way, some doctors are trying to work around private insurance altogether. Sas Ponnapalli, founder of Beam Health Group, a telemedicine platform that connects patients and providers, saw 400 new health providers sign on last week. While the platform does allow private insurance, Ponnapalli said doctors are choosing to set their own rates to make the transition faster.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoctors sometimes have to close their doors or quarantine themselves even if they\u2019re still able to practice,\u201d he said. \u201dThey want to get up and running as soon as possible because they\u2019re losing revenue so they\u2019re bypassing insurance completely and charging cash.\u201d</p> \n<p>Health insurance companies insist they have been adapting to the crisis.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson at Humana, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurance companies, told the Guardian it is not charging patients for Covid-19 testing, and a representative of the Association of Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) pointed to <a href=\"https://www.ahip.org/health-care-leaders-unite-against-covid-19/\">a letter</a> signed by various private payers about their commitment to fighting Covid-19. Aetna, another leading US insurer, has waived costs related to the illness <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/aetna-coronavirus-treatment/index.html\">for many members</a>.<strong> </strong>This is partly because the federal government is requiring the plans to cover all visits, virtual and not, related to testing, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research and advocacy firm, who tracks the private market.</p> \n<p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped insurers from charging patients for other Covid-related charges. AHIP confirmed that out-of-pocket expenses for the treatment would not be waived, and could cost patients thousands of dollars. The average amount for someone admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, a respiratory condition that many coronavirus patients are facing, was $20,000 in 2018 for patients covered by private insurance, according to an <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/potential-costs-of-coronavirus-treatment-for-people-with-employer-coverage/\">analysis</a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Peterson.</p> \n<p>That could leave many people falling back on the age-old American dilemma: get healthcare or lose all financial security. And it could leave physicians finding loopholes and workarounds to stay afloat.</p> \n<p>\u201cInsurance companies are not beholden to the patient, they are beholden to the shareholder,\u201d Hollander said.<br></p>",

  "<p>More than 250 million European citizens are in mandatory home confinement to help curb the spread of Covid 19. Yet while Swedes, Germans and Bulgarians still walk more or less freely around their cities, Italians, Spaniards and French people can\u2019t leave their homes. Swedish kids are still going to school, while most of their European peers are not. Shops are open in the Netherlands, Denmark and Hungary but closed elsewhere.</p> \n<p>How can we make sense of these conflicting realities when European citizens are all equally affected by the virus? How do we achieve the same aim: the containment of the disease in a shared continent, supposedly without borders, with such a range of different policies?</p> \n<p>For the vast majority of European citizens this emergency comes as close to an experience of war as they are likely to have. And as huge numbers of them look to the EU for protection and joint solutions, Brussels looks helpless.</p> \n<p>Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, delivered a reprimand to member governments for their failure to pull together on Thursday.

It can\u2019t close schools, suspend football matches or lock down European cities. It can\u2019t even close borders to curb the spread of the virus. Only its member governments can. And closing borders is what some governments have done \u2013 against WHO advice \u2013 suspending the Schengen passport-free travel zone for the first time.</p> \n<p>What the EU can do is to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, by offering its countries flexibility over EU deficit and state aid rules. Indeed, that\u2019s what it has done: in addition to a \u20ac37bn (\u00a333.7bn) investment fund to counter the effects of Covid-19 on the economy across the continent, it has launched a joint procurement operation covering, ventilators, masks and other vital medical equipment needed across the continent. EU leaders are also setting up a new permanent European crisis management centre.</p> \n<p>Yet there is more EU governments could do jointly to reassure their 500 million citizens at a time when their common destiny as a community has never looked so real.</p> \n<p>Despite the inherent limits of the union, the 27 EU health ministers could decide \u2013 on a voluntary basis \u2013 to pool their sovereign emergency powers. They could start coordinating \u2013 not necessarily harmonising \u2013 on data collection (currently there are <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sources-comparison\">three different sources</a>), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1242886260798218245?s=20)\">testing </a>(there is no single approach nor central database), as well as containment, quarantine and social distancing . The most obvious benefit of such an EU-wide methodological effort would be to render national comparisons suddenly meaningful.</p> \n<p>The other useful step would be to stop thinking purely in terms of the unitary state and instead think regionally. As the coronavirus outbreak concentrates in regions and infections don\u2019t spread equally within each country\u2019s territory, health containment measures would no longer be designed along jurisdictional lines but regional ones.</p> \n<p>This would work even when regional boundaries cut across national borders, such as the whole Basque territory, which crosses the Franco-Spanish border. Measures devised at this level would inherently be more tailored to the local circumstances, proportionate to the declared goals, and potentially better at preserving freedoms for the affected populations.</p> \n<p>A regional approach would also have the merit of fostering healthcare cooperation and solidarity across the territory of the union. It is happening already in a small-scale way: hospitals in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, are treating critically ill coronavirus patients from the neighbouring Alsace region in France, which is struggling to cope. And a small number of Covid patients from Bergamo in Italy have been transferred to Leipzig after authorities in <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/2020/14/sachsen-pflege-covid-19-patienten-italien?wt_zmc=sm.ext.zonaudev.twitter.ref.zeitde.share.link.x\">Saxony stepped in</a> to help.</p> \n<p>Given the different timing of the spread of the virus, a cross-border approach to hospital treatment could represent a game-changer. A coordinated EU-wide response would help to close the gap between the politics of the pandemic at national level and the harsh health realities on the ground.</p> \n<p>But there is more.</p> \n<p>The lack of a coherent EU-wide response to the pandemic is undermining one of the most extraordinary achievements of EU cooperation: the Schengen area has allowed people to move about freely without passports since the mid-1990s.</p> \n<p>But border controls have now been brought back by 12 of the 26 countries in the system. Although these controls offer no major health gain \u2014 but rather slow the free movement of key workers and supplies that might be urgently needed in this emergency \u2014 they are inevitable when member states lack any coordinated containment action plan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A coordinated EU-wide response would make these border restrictions unnecessary. What is more, containment measures would have more impact if they were the result of shared expert advice, shared perspectives and a much broader public debate than they currently receive in individual states.</p> \n<p>Most of the measures precipitously implemented at national level are exceptionally restrictive of individual and collective freedoms. As emergency powers are deployed daily to govern the coronavirus pandemic across the continent, there\u2019s a real risk that their exercise may be used to erode not only free movement rights, but also civil rights, and ultimately <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/secretary-general-writes-to-victor-orban-regarding-covid-19-state-of-emergency-in-hungary\">democracy</a>.</p> \n<p>The EU \u2013 as an ultimate guarantor of the rule of law \u2013 should not only oversee but also prevent these many repressive measures from infringing citizens\u2019 civil liberties, or, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/hungary-to-consider-bill-that-would-allow-orban-to-rule-by-decree\">as in the case of Hungary</a>, weakening institutions, under the auspices of tackling the corona crisis.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the European handling of Covid-19 has revealed an uncomfortable truth. Given the high level of socio-economic interdependence in Europe, nation-state solutions can do more harm than good, by offering an illusion of security and safety.</p> \n<p>It does not have to be this way. As each national approach against Covid-19 entails different trade-offs, and those spill over to other countries, there is a moral \u2014 albeit not yet legal \u2014 argument for our national leaders to work together within the European Union to coordinate their public health interventions as a matter of urgency and to do so within the law.</p> \n<p>This ongoing health emergency is a rare chance to demonstrate that the EU not only matters, but can also protect us, both from the virus and from our respective governments.</p>",
  "<p>Relaxing physical distancing and school closures in Wuhan too soon could fuel a second wave of Covid-19 infections later in the year, scientists have said.</p> \n<p>A study published in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30073-6/fulltext\">the Lancet</a> suggests lifting restrictions in March would lead to a surge in case numbers that would peak in August.

  "<p>Coronavirus testing checkpoints and isolation units could become features at grounds around the country this summer as English cricket explores the possibility of staging major matches behind closed doors.</p> <p>As it stands there will be no professional cricket in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/ecb-no-cricket-may-battles-save-season\" title=\"\">before 28 May at the earliest</a>, and the England and Wales Cricket Board is drafting possible schedules while it waits for the government to give sporting events the green light. There is no guarantee that crowds will be allowed in to grounds when this comes, however. When announcing the delay last week the ECB revealed it was looking into \u201cstarting the season behind closed doors\u201d and \u201cgiving sports fans the opportunity to watch live broadcast action\u201d.</p> <p>Steve Elworthy, the tournament director for last year\u2019s World Cup who has since become the ECB\u2019s director of events, is charged with exploring the logistics of this and has outlined the challenge. \u201cWe\u2019re mapping out what international matches would look like behind closed doors,\u201d Elworthy says.</p> <p>\u201cThe advice around mass gatherings [before the current period of lockdown] was 500 people or fewer. That was guided by the potential impact on critical services like paramedics and doctors.</p> <p>\u201cYou would likely have to work within that number, which includes teams, match officials, support staff, broadcasters and media, commercial partners, safety and security teams, third-party suppliers, replay screen operators, [the teams that control] the LED boards, ground staff, catering and more. </p> <p>\u201cThen you have to think about medical provisions, creating a safe and sterile environment around that venue, so that everyone who comes in is clear. So it\u2019s how you test them at the gate, the isolation units that you have to put in. These are all the considerations we are thinking about.\u201d</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s medical team is devising a protocol for how testing would work, as well as possible isolation booths for temporary use while anyone testing positive for Covid-19 waits to leave the ground. There can be around 1,500 people working on a normal major matchday, but it is believed this headcount can be shrunk to some 350 with no spectators, aided by the reduction in stewards and catering.</p> <p>However, Elworthy\u2019s events team must also consider transport and accommodation logistics for players, staff and officials in a way that ensures the desired \u201csterile\u201d bubble is not only upon arrival at the stadium. While operational manuals for staging domestic cricket behind closed doors will also be produced, internationals have the added complication of travel for the touring teams. Much hinges on the resumption of flights and the lifting of travel restrictions, such as quarantine periods.</p> <p>There are four sets of visitors scheduled in the men\u2019s game this year \u2013 West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland \u2013 each with scheduling issues to consider should fixtures need moving, while England\u2019s women are due to host South Africa and India.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re now thinking of all these things, the risks posed, and it just gets bigger and wider,\u201d Elworthy says. \u201cBut if that is the situation we are faced with then we will deliver on absolutely every single one of those to make sure it does happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"421a9db3d38ddce050051f32213a05e8d1a2038e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/421a9db3d38ddce050051f32213a05e8d1a2038e/831_113_3425_2056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket stewards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stewards huddle before play at the Lord\u2019s Test against India in 2011.

We know what the Hundred is intended for and the power of what it can deliver. There will be considerations for all competitions and a process to go through but I would be hesitant to write off anything at this stage.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll get the green light to get back on and playing.

  "<p>They tread slowly, gracelessly, at a plodding pace. With their aspirators they could be astronauts, of this earth but detached from it, sucking clean air through umbilical tubes. They comfort and alarm in equal measure, these slow-moving harbingers of sickness and death. Intellectually, you know they are there to help, to protect. But the hazmat suit creates a divide. There is the person who wears it and the person they need protecting from. You never want to be on the wrong side of a hazmat suit, because if you are, you know something\u2019s gone horribly wrong.</p> <p>As the coronavirus pandemic spreads around the world, images of medical personnel in hazmat suits have become commonplace in newspapers and news bulletins. But it Is not just medics who are donning protective wear. A fortnight ago, Naomi Campbell <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iqFRaCoyvw&amp;t=302s\">posted a video</a> in which she explained her motivations for flying in a hazmat suit, accessorised with a Burberry cape. Last week, before the nationwide lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-campaigners-lock-down-downing-street-uk-government-europe-measures-a9404441.html\">activists in hazmat suits protested outside Downing Street</a> about the government\u2019s sluggish response to coronavirus. Personal protective equipment (PPE) in general has been high up the news agenda, as beleaguered NHS staff warn the government that an inadequate supply is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/22/nhs-staff-cannon-fodder-lack-of-coronavirus-protection\">putting frontline health workers at risk</a>. </p> <p>The hazmat suit is a familiar trope in pop culture, seen everywhere from the blockbuster HBO drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/29/chernobyl-horrifying-masterful-television-that-sears-on-to-your-brain\">Chernobyl</a><em> </em>to the pandemic blockbusters of the 1990s and 2000s currently being revisited on streaming platforms. Some of us may encounter a person wearing a hazmat suit during the coronavirus pandemic for the first time. But where did the hazmat suit come from?

US firm Dupont, a major supplier of PPE, has <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus-panic-stock-lakeland-industries/\">ramped up production</a>. Dupont\u2019s David Dominish says that by the first week of the outbreak in Wuhan, the company was shipping more than 30 times the normal volume of hazmat suits to China. Weeks later, this had increased to over 100 times. \u201cWhether it\u2019s avian flu, Ebola, Sars or Covid-19, one thing we know is that whenever a terrible outbreak occurs, the demand becomes nearly infinite,\u201d Dominish says.</p> <p>Although it is loosely understood in popular culture to refer to a plastic outer layer covering the whole body, there is no uniform hazmat suit. \u201cWe have more than 15 different types of fabric, all with different levels of protection,\u201d Dominish says. Two models in particular are proving popular: the Tyvek 800 J, featuring a hooded coverall, overtaped seams and self-adhesive zipper, and the Tyvek 600 Plus, which comes with attached socks and boot flaps. Hazmat suits may also feature built-in respirators and full masks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-the-week-explained-sign-up-for-our-email-newsletter\">Coronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Getting a licence to produce hazmat suits is a costly and laborious undertaking. \u201cIt can cost \u00a363,000 to get the certificate to make one suit,\u201d says Pam Parker of PPS, a British hazmat suit manufacturer.

As early as the 1600s, paintings show grave-diggers approaching plague corpses with handkerchiefs over their mouths and noses. \u201cThese practices were not necessarily against contagion as we understand it,\u201d says Dr Christos Lynteris of the University of St Andrews. \u201cIllnesses were believed to emanate from the ground in gaseous form.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dda4c7ee253d1a40aa1cacf4bfd6dcdaef46bb99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dda4c7ee253d1a40aa1cacf4bfd6dcdaef46bb99/0_51_1328_1832/725.jpg\" alt=\"Beak-doctor, c 1720 ... one of the earliest attempts to protect medics rom bubonic plague.

Attributed to the French doctor <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/reference/european-history/plague-doctors-beaked-masks/\">Charles de Lorme</a>, it featured a long leather coat with a beak mask containing garlic and rue. In effect, it was a permanent hazmat suit. Unfortunately, it probably made things worse. \u201cA permanent hazmat suit without removal protocols and disinfectant would be a vector of disease,\u201d Lynteris says, \u201crather than something that would stop it.\u201d</p> <p>Russian scientists designed a prototype hazmat suit to deal with a plague outbreak in the Volga in the 1870s. \u201cThe suits were never produced, but beautifully designed,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cThey were designed to prevent imaginary gases from reaching our nostrils. There is a long history of personal protection, but not from bacteria, as scientists didn\u2019t have the understanding of it we do today.\u201d</p> <p>The origins of the modern hazmat suit lie in the Manchurian plague of 1910, where doctor <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791421/\">Wu Lien-teh</a>, says Lynteris, \u201chad the theory that the plague was airborne and spread like the flu. He insisted that all doctors, nurses and burial staff wore a simple gauze mask he designed. It was the first time we had a mask devised for use during an epidemic.\u201d</p> <p>At first, Wu was ridiculed by his peers. But when a celebrated French doctor operated without a mask to prove Wu wrong and died days later, everything changed. He saved untold lives. By the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu\">Spanish flu</a> pandemic of 1918, masks were commonplace. Through the 20th century, the chemical and nuclear sector developed the modern hazmat suit, with medical versions coming into widespread use during the Ebola outbreaks of the 1990s.</p> <p>The public has always been fascinated by the sight of medical workers in protective gear. \u201cThe Manchurian plague was covered by the media across the globe,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cBecause newspapers could print photographs, people saw plague masks for the first time. It was a visually powerful image that worked well in black and white.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2791e846a0883e344abb2952488800a7a808624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2791e846a0883e344abb2952488800a7a808624/0_0_1772_1119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A doctor in protective clothing examines a man during the Manchurian plague, in 1911.

In movies and TV shows, hazmat suits evolved into an evocative signifier of peril and death. Part of the reason that the hazmat suit is so useful to film-makers is because it makes visible what cannot be seen to the naked eye: the threat to life posed by disease. The act of donning a hazmat suit and venturing into a stricken area is a visual representation of extreme heroism in films such as Outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sYSyuuLk5g\">Contagion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BvKZMg2LjU\">Flu</a>. \u201cThey are a great prop to visualise danger,\u201d Lynteris says.</p> <p>The 1995 pandemic blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuuvllUlHCE\">Outbreak</a> begins with the reflection of a dying man in the mask of epidemiologist Dustin Hoffman\u2019s hazmat suit and the actors wear little else throughout. \u201cDustin was more miserable than he has ever been in his life, wearing that suit \u2013 they were boiling,\u201d says Outbreak<em> </em>costume designer Erica Edell Phillips. The distinctive blue and yellow suits were modelled on those used in the field. Phillips used airflow packs to prevent the helmets from fogging up and remodelled the helmets so the actors\u2019 faces could be seen. \u201cWe wanted the suits to look real, but to have some style,\u201d she says.Warner Bros later rented out her suits to films and TV shows: \u201cThey became the<em> </em>definitive biohazard suit for decades.\u201d </p> <p>The wearing of hazmat suits is central to the plot of Outbreak, underscoring the danger medical personnel confront for the greater good. A scientist who breaches his hazmat suit dies a bloody death. Another character accidentally sticks herself with a needle through the suit: the hazmat suit is imperfect, the boundary between life and death only a scalpel nick away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fabaf9eb9d98ffb302e24e714445f4acbc10e8bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fabaf9eb9d98ffb302e24e714445f4acbc10e8bc/0_92_2912_1905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They became the definitive biohazard suit for decades\u2019 ...

(In Contagion, Matt Damon watches as home raiders murder his neighbours; in <em> </em>Flu, screaming shoppers descend locust-like on a supermarket.) \u201cThe epidemiologist is the rational person who brings society back from catastrophe,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cThey are Noah, the person who will save humanity and restore social order.\u201d</p> <p>The hazmat suit creates a barrier between humanity and nature. Nature is conceived as hostile, full of threat. The opening scene of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksGH1NN8TBA\">I Am Legend </a>shows Times Square overgrown by vegetation following a global pandemic. \u201cThe virus is a revenge of nature,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cIt decimates humanity, and then nature flourishes.\u201d The hazmat suit represents humanity\u2019s resistance to this existential crisis. Like a knight going into battle in a jangling suit of armour, the epidemiologist dons the hazmat suit to wage war on nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f6289c2cc1cdea86f55a53267cc7bd2697fae45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f6289c2cc1cdea86f55a53267cc7bd2697fae45/0_23_960_1257/764.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s when the taking it off that people get infected\u2019 ... doctors Joseph Fair and Sheik Umar Khan at work.

Meaning that, right now, we are at war with coronavirus \u2013 and the medical personnel you see wearing hazmat suits are soldiers. But as any soldier knows, in war there are casualties. \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult for me to talk about,\u201d says virologist Dr Joseph Fair of his friend Dr Sheik Umar Khan, his voice thick with emotion. </p> <p>In 2014, they worked side by side in Sierra Leone. A staff of around 17 medics had to cope with hundreds of Ebola patients. \u201cThe walls of the hospital were covered in blood, vomit, and stools,\u201d says Fair. \u201cThere was no one to clean them because all the cleaners had died.\u201d When Khan contracted Ebola, Fair desperately tried to arrange a medevac. Two days later, Fair received word that <a href=\"Kinema\">Khan</a> had died. \u201cI completely broke down,\u201d he says. Khan was buried in Kenema, alongside the people he died trying to save.</p> <p>Fair believes Khan contracted Ebola when taking off his PPE. \u201cThe protective equipment is solid, but it\u2019s when taking it off that people get infected. You are exhausted, you have worked for 23 hours with no sleep; inside the suits, it\u2019s like wearing a garbage bag in sub-Saharan Africa, so you\u2019re sweating non-stop, dehydrated and hungry. Your first inclination when you walk outside is to get the damn thing off as quickly as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSafely removing a PPE requires meticulous concentration,\u201d says Dr JaHyun Kang of Seoul National University and Harvard\u2019s TH Chan school of public health, who has conducted research showing how medical workers can contaminate themselves during the removal of hazmat suits. \u201cWe need to develop better PPE out of more breathable material, so medical workers don\u2019t get so hot and aren\u2019t in such a rush to get them off,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also need to standardise the PPE protocols and train healthcare personnel so they become confident about how to remove PPE without contamination.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e308991e301b34e03e4340cfae6484d62ee91b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e308991e301b34e03e4340cfae6484d62ee91b17/0_109_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hazmat suit looming over you is not something you ever want to see, but it is better than a lonely room, with no medical intervention.

In 2015, a team at Johns Hopkins University redesigned the hazmat suit to make removal safer. In addition to simplifying the zips and improving the cooling system, they created more transparency around the face. \u201cWe tried to make the face very visible \u2026 [That is] really important for someone on their deathbed,\u201d one of the researchers <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/01/brilliantly-designed-hazmat-suit-ebola-workers/\">told Wired</a>. But these suits are not yet in widespread use.</p> <p>Making hazmat suits less alienating can save lives. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, infected people avoided medical personnel because their hazmats were frightening. This is an age-old problem: just as in those Ebola-stricken villages, 17th-century plague victims cowered from doctors in their beak suits, Lynteris says.</p> <p>On a fundamental level, being treated by a medical worker whose face is obscured has a dehumanising effect. The patient realises they are no longer just a person, but a vector of disease. A hazmat suit looming over you \u2013 well, it\u2019s not something you ever want to see. But it is better than the alternative: a lonely room, with no medical intervention at all. Because, although the person in a hazmat suit may seem far away, or even uncaring, they are doing the most humane thing imaginable: putting themselves in harm\u2019s way, to save a stranger\u2019s life.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The plinth supporting the landmark statue of Billy Bremner outside Elland Road bears a simple, yet evocative, message. \u201cSide before self, every time,\u201d it declares, reminding everyone of the former Leeds United captain\u2019s personal mantra.</p> <p>In a very different way and a very different context, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds are now showing they are every bit as big on teamwork as the trophy-hoarding, no-quarter-given Don Revie side Bremner led with such a memorable mixture of finesse and ferocity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/fifa-suggests-player-contracts-and-transfer-windows-be-changed\">Fifa suggests player contracts and transfer windows be changed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Championship leaders\u2019 reaction to being stuck in a coronavirus emergency-induced holding pattern with the Premier League clearly visible on the horizon has been impressively mature and measured. On Thursday Bielsa, his players, senior coaching staff and club executives accepted a wage deferral in order to protect the jobs and incomes of 272 less well remunerated members of the club\u2019s backroom staff and its army of casual workers. Other teams are now expected to follow suit.</p> <p>Bremner was aptly described as \u201c10 stone of barbed wire\u201d on the pitch but he would surely have approved of the current Leeds captain Liam Cooper\u2019s role in negotiating an arrangement designed to prevent the loss of homes and livelihoods. In the absence of the customary 35,000 matchday crowds at Elland Road Leeds are, according to their chief executive, Angus Kinnear, losing \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d per month.</p> <p>With a \u00a340m annual wage bill becoming unsustainable, first-teamers have agreed to their wages being temporarily capped \u2013 a reduction to a sum in the region of \u00a36,000 a week was discussed in recent days \u2013 leaving the balance to come when normality is finally restored. While the average Championship salary is around \u00a312,000 per week, Bielsa\u2019s top earners, Patrick Bamford and Kiko Casilla, command around \u00a330,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c20b265d997576275f3dfb5d9f746654fe0e74e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c20b265d997576275f3dfb5d9f746654fe0e74e/985_147_3448_2673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds United captain Liam Cooper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"775\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds United captain Liam Cooper played a role in negotiating an arrangement designed to prevent the loss of homes and livelihoods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Never in Leeds\u2019s 16-year top-flight exile has it been more imperative to secure a Premier League return, with its attendant, \u00a3100m broadcast revenue-funded cash infusion. However, given the lives being lost and the economic crash, the club is not about to feel sorry for itself.</p> <p>Top of the second tier and seven points clear of the play-off places with nine games to go, the players could be forgiven for feeling like weary travellers left circling their destination in thick cloud. An awful lot of hard work \u2013 mental as well as physical \u2013 has gone into reaching this position but the bigger picture has been grasped.</p> <p>Already Bielsa\u2019s squad have donated sufficient money to prevent the largely matchday-funded Leeds fans\u2019 food bank from folding, while individual players, most notably Cooper and Stuart Dallas, have gone into role-model mode, using social media to promote social distancing. Holbeck Together, a local charity helping the elderly, has received the club\u2019s entire food stocks.</p> <p>Cooper and company can only hope the Elland Road larders will be refilled and the season eventually concluded with the team still in the top two. No one wants the current campaign to be voided, with promotion and relegation either suspended for a year or Leeds and second-placed West Brom becoming part of a temporarily extended 22-club top tier. Not playing is bad but the uncertainty about what happens next is worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01a665c57dac450c5f1635803d2bfef7b3dc1f85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01a665c57dac450c5f1635803d2bfef7b3dc1f85/280_436_4129_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds United\u2019s Stuart Dallas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"545\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds United\u2019s Stuart Dallas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or at least so it initially seemed. Daniel Chapman, co-editor of the Square Ball fanzine, encapsulates a now almost unimaginably altered mood among the fans.</p> <p>\u201cTwo weeks ago the idea of calling off the season had everyone saying \u2018Typical Leeds\u2019,\u201d wrote Chapman in the Yorkshire Evening Post. \u201cThat\u2019s gone. Any defiance the mirror now shows is mostly wide-eyed fear as I think less often of promotion. The death tolls from Italy are of a scale that can be mapped on to blocks of seating at Elland Road. The notion of the virus being \u2018typically Leeds\u2019 seems absurd now that we can appreciate its global impact on our increasingly local lives.\u201d</p> <p>If and when the Championship campaign resumes Leeds must regain the momentum that was serving them so well. Given the likelihood of playing behind closed doors, they will surely have to do this without their adrenaline-supplying supporters and their incessant \u201cMarching on Together\u201d soundtrack. What effect might that have? And how might a layoff involving players training alone at home influence a team whose high-intensity style demands unusually hard, highly intricate daily training-ground drilling.</p> <p>Bielsa\u2019s squad went into lockdown with personalised exercise plans, sleep monitoring devices and diet sheets complementing deliveries of exercise bikes and other gym equipment to players\u2019 homes. Daily weigh-ins and body fat monitoring are now undertaken electronically, with the results taken on trust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5afec71c40b547db389ef174476d024c5f3c555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5afec71c40b547db389ef174476d024c5f3c555/110_186_2048_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"851\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Vaughan - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All head coaches are control freaks to varying extents but for a micro-manager as obsessive as the Argentinian to suddenly be forced into taking such a hands-off approach at a time like this must be particularly disorientating. As his squad cycle and run along Yorkshire\u2019s country roads \u2013 especially those surrounding the footballers\u2019 mecca of Linton, near the market town of Wetherby \u2013 what on earth does Bielsa do? How does he fill the time normally occupied by his famous daily dust inspection at the club\u2019s Thorp Arch training ground.</p> <p>Despite his family remaining in Argentina, he has opted to stay on at his modest flat in Wetherby. Bielsa now has little option but to indulge his passions for reading, taking long walks through the adjacent fields he has come to love and, above all, playing an active role in WhatsApp groups created by the players, coaches and medical staff. \u201cThis club\u2019s communication has been second to none,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot from Marcelo on WhatsApp telling us to stay safe.\u201d</p> <p>Leeds fans cannot wait to once more see Bielsa drinking coffee in Wetherby, posing for selfies in Morrisons and listening to music on his headphones as he makes the hour-long walk to Thorp Arch. For the moment though, they can rest assured he and his squad really are all about \u201cside before self\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>My book club was the first to concede defeat. Before my gym, hair salon and therapist accepted that there could be no more business as usual as the coronavirus took hold in the UK, the host of my book club got in touch to say that our March meet-up was off.</p> <p>The news came as no great surprise.

Last Monday, they gathered to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/08/supper-club-lara-williams-review-cooking-storm\">Lara Williams\u2019 Supper Club</a> on Zoom. After initial hellos \u2013 \u201cso that we could see each other\u2019s setup: \u2018Here I am sitting on the sofa with a cup of tea\u2019, \u2018Here I am at my table with a glass of wine\u2019\u201d \u2013 cameras were turned off to save on bandwidth and batteries.</p> <p>Without cues from body language, and with only one person able to speak at a time, the discussion required \u201cmore active management\u201d than usual, says West. But \u201cit went really well \u2013 so well that I woke up the next day and thought, \u2018God, I haven\u2019t cleaned up after book club last night.\u2019 It was quite a long time before I went downstairs and realised it had just been me, sat on the sofa. It felt really genuine.\u201d</p> <p>With her energies split between work and her two young children, West says it was a relief to find that her book club would not be disrupted. \u201cI have confidence that, at least once a month, it\u2019s going to feel like I\u2019ve had a night off, being sociable.\u201d</p> <p>The relaxed formality of book clubs might be a boon as we adjust to the age of the \u201cvideo hang\u201d, lending structure to an unfamiliar and often stilted interaction. Virtual pub quizzes are proving similarly popular right now.</p> <p><a href=\"https://pamcottman.com/\">Pam Cottman</a>\u2019s book club, based in Beaconsfield, has moved through several platforms in 15 years \u2013 from email to WhatsApp and now, Zoom.

But as a former teacher turned resilience coach, she says connection, community and \u201cholding on to a bit of normality\u201d will be crucial to weathering the weeks and months to come.</p> <p>Books themselves can help to inspire resilience, says Cottman \u2013 her group\u2019s last pick, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/02/mind-power-in-auschwitz-and-healing-decades-later-edith-eger\">The Choice by Edith Eger</a>, an Auschwitz survivor, is a case in point. \u201cIn so many stories of challenge and trauma, there\u2019s hope and positivity and that mindset shift that enables us to keep going,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Macfarlane says that he chose The Living Mountain \u2013 a \u201cmasterpiece of close observation\u201d of the Cairngorm mountains in Scotland, and the book he has given as a gift more than any other \u2013 so as to venture beyond our quarantine confines. \u201cObviously we can\u2019t reach distant landscapes at the moment, but we can read and dream our way into them,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0bb30914b21c381b0f4ed8ce383709186839f16b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bb30914b21c381b0f4ed8ce383709186839f16b/0_11_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"While films such as Contagion (pictured) have experienced a resurgence, book clubs are steering clear of virus talk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While films such as Contagion (pictured) have experienced a resurgence, book clubs are steering clear of virus talk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shepherd wrote the slender volume during the second world war, and her reflections on love, loss and goodness are set against a backdrop of distant disaster. Macfarlane calls it a \u201cbook of beauty born of crisis\u201d, with echoes of the one that we are currently facing; but, as the first choice for #CoReadingVirus, it is \u201cneither a work of escapism nor a work that confronts\u201d coronavirus head-on.</p> <p>His ambitions for his book club are modest, Macfarlane says, but not frivolous. \u201cI don\u2019t see reading as turning away from what\u2019s happening. Dreaming other places into being, other ways of being \u2013 these are powerful needs.\u201d</p> <p>It is noteworthy that as the 2011 medical-thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\">Contagion has experienced a resurgence</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/05/pandemic-netflixs-new-series-about-global-outbreaks-is-eerily-timed-and-moved-me-to-tears\">docu-series Pandemic trends</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/05/pandemic-netflixs-new-series-about-global-outbreaks-is-eerily-timed-and-moved-me-to-tears\"> on Netflix</a>, none of the book clubs I spoke to had themed their reading material around the coronavirus. It suggests, that in connecting over literature, we are seeking to align over a common experience \u2013 other than our shared experience of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI think escapism is going to be the way forward,\u201d says West, of her book club.

  "<h2><strong>The album to start with</strong></h2> <p><strong>Journey in Satchidananda (1971)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNG9xQ2T148\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XNG9xQ2T148?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Alice Coltrane: Journey in Satchidananda \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The first thing to understand about composer and musician Alice Coltrane\u2019s catalogue is that there are no duds. Jump in anywhere and you\u2019ll find variations on the signature sound that developed from her beginnings in bebop jazz, through the spiritual free compositions of the Coltranes as a romantic and spiritual unit (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-coltrane\">John Coltrane</a> died of liver cancer in 1967, four years after they met), to the transcendental sounds of her later divine music.</p> <p>But you have to start somewhere, so make it Journey in Satchidananda, a mid-point between the modal and meditative,<strong> </strong>where all the parts of her musical being and biography are present. In its opening (title) track, there are all the aspects of Alice Coltrane\u2019s music \u2013 jazz player Cecil McBee lays down a double bass motif, joined by a sharp drone from an Indian tamboura, then Coltrane\u2019s sparkling harp pours in like cool water as Pharoah Sanders\u2019s saxophone dances over the top. It is an audaciously lush theme for her guru, Swami Satchidananda, and like so much of Coltrane\u2019s composition it is positively cinematic, suggesting the opening of luxurious drapes on a panoramic vista. It ought strictly to be called fusion music, with elements taken from Indian music and combined with western traditions, but in Coltrane\u2019s music there are no visible joins \u2013 all is bound in cosmic opulence.</p> <h2><strong>The three albums to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Alice Coltrane with </strong><strong>Strings \u2013 World Galaxy (1972)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJyncnM7jZk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hJyncnM7jZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Alice Coltrane: My Favorite Things \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There is a sub-catalogue to this primer, which is the music of John and Alice. They met in 1963 when Alice was on tour as a member of the Terry Gibbs Quartet. After John\u2019s divorce they married and she joined his band, playing on albums including Infinity and Expression. They made one duo album, Cosmic Music. John died suddenly, leaving Alice as a single mother with four children, but she continued to work on the music they had been developing. World Galaxy<em> </em>includes Alice\u2019s renderings of two of John\u2019s signature tunes \u2013 it was not the first or the last time she did this, but there is a ferocious power and emotion in these versions of A Love Supreme and My Favorite Things.</p> <p>Recorded over two days with a 16-piece string orchestra, World Galaxy features Alice playing piano, harp and organ. My Favorite Things starts sweetly but descends into a chaotic breakdown as her organ flares in anxious bursts. The album closes with the salvation of A Love Supreme, which is soothingly narrated by Swami Satchidananda before she lets loose a rude funk upon the standard\u2019s signature motif.</p> <p><strong>Joe Henderson with Alice Coltrane \u2013 The Elements (1974)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihjGusuKm5I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ihjGusuKm5I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Joe Henderson with Alice Coltrane: Fire \u2013 video </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Coltrane\u2019s own music was always about collaboration, whether with other players or other cultures \u2013 this entry could equally have been Ptah the El Daoud, with Pharoah Sanders. The Elements, based on the four elements and recorded with saxophonist Joe Henderson (who also plays on Ptah), is a triumph of concept. Variously credited to Joe Henderson, or Joe Henderson with Alice Coltrane, its first track, Fire, opens with Charlie Haden\u2019s burning bassline, a lick setting up a suite that moves through Air, Water and Earth. It is an immaculately conceived and executed project and Alice\u2019s sound looms large. The pieces all sound like their titles, from the light and ephemeral Air to the fluid and rippling delay deployed on Water and the grounded groove on Earth.</p> <p><strong>Alice Coltrane-Turiyasangitananda \u2013 Divine Songs (1987)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNpJcKedrzU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oNpJcKedrzU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Alice Coltrane-Turiyasangitananda: Divine Songs \u2013 stream</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Coltrane later took the spiritual name Turiyasangitananda, which roughly means \u201cthe Lord\u2019s highest song of bliss\u201d. By the mid-80s she was recording spiritual music and releasing it as private press tapes on her own Avatar Book Institute. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/03/the-ecstatic-music-of-alice-coltrane-turiyasangitanada-review-truly-numinous-energy\">Luaka Bop released a double collection of her devotional music in 2017,</a> gathering selections from the albums Divine Songs, Infinite Chants and Glorious Chants (but missing out Turiya Sings, which is also essential).</p> <p>Divine Songs is the best, a mind-blowing psychedelic vision of what transcendence might sound like. Its lavish string sections and sung chants combine with luminous synths whose pitch arches upwards as if in salutation. It\u2019s an unbeatable cosmic power-up. Coltrane is not often considered the creator of synthesiser masterpieces, but this album demands a reassessment in that respect.</p> <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Spiritual Eternal, from Eternity (1976)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orVhbSTqtoE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/orVhbSTqtoE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Alice Coltrane: Spiritual Eternal \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Whether she is taking a section of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and making it a journey through the clouds (Going Home), or playing wild free jazz on Wurlitzer organ and harp, much of Coltrane\u2019s astral wonderland is arguably one for the heads. So rather than sending you to a lost cut, an <a href=\"https://moochinaboutltd.bandcamp.com/album/harp-improvisation\">unreleased solo performance</a> or a track from her Ashram cassettes that nobody can find unless they\u2019re pro online diggers, here\u2019s Spiritual Eternal, from her one of her most \u201cmainstream\u201d albums, Eternity.</p> <p>Eternity never gets much credit in her catalogue. It is short and lacks the coherence of her other releases. However, this opening track is wildly underrated, the huge Wurlitzer solo swaddled in strings, like the theme tune to someone parading down a palatial staircase in a silken gown (AKA the perfect soundtrack for waltzing down your own stairs in a dressing gown). What swing! What elegance!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/05/alice-coltrane-turiyasangitananda-higher-state-of-consciousness\">Higher state of consciousness: how Alice Coltrane finally got her dues</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://reader.exacteditions.com/issues/35242/page/36\">Enduring Love: Alice Coltrane</a>, by Edwin Pouncey</strong></p> <p>In 2002 Edwin Pouncey interviewed Coltrane for Wire magazine at her California ashram, which burned down in the 2018 wildfires.

His statement that \u201cthe music of Alice Coltrane is more relevant today than when it was first recorded between 1968-78\u201d is followed by speculation that \u201cperhaps the need for spiritual salvation is that much greater in a world apparently bent on self destruction\u201d \u2013 a sentiment that rings as true today.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.innerpath.com/monument-eternal/\">Monument Eternal</a>, by Alice Coltrane-Turiyasangitananda</strong></p> <p>There is a wealth of great reading about Coltrane, but she also wrote about her spiritual life herself, including this small pamphlet recounting the revelations and trials she underwent in the late 60s.

We anticipated this might happen in the very stressful circumstances for many families.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charities and police forces across the country have been warning of a potential rise in cases of domestic violence. In China there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-domestic-violence-week-in-patriarchy\">threefold increase in cases</a> reported to police stations in February compared with the previous year.</p> \n<p>The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the Commons justice committee this week that there may be more cases of domestic abuse, online crime and fraud during the lockdown. </p> \n<p>Hughes later said the overall level of domestic abuse cases was as expected, but officers had begun to classify incidents believed to have a connection to the virus.</p> \n<p>She said families were being asked to stay at home and many had significantly less money as a result of the restrictions.</p> \n<p>Hughes said: \u201cThe potential for tension to arise in the home as a result of what we are asking people to cope with, in order to suppress the virus, is going to increase and therefore we would be right to think this might display itself in an increase in the number of domestic incidents we are called to.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are preparing for that. Some of those most serious incidents will be challenging to deal with, particularly if the victim needs to be moved to a refuge, but the police specialise in these kind of cases and the local partners, local authorities, they\u2019re working together really closely to prepare for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Avon and Somerset police reported a 20.9% increase in domestic abuse incidents in the last two weeks, from 718 to 868. Police in Cumbria have asked postal workers and delivery drivers to look out for signs of abuse.</p> \n<p>DCI Dan St Quintin, of Cumbria police, said: \u201cIn the coming weeks and months we ask for everyone to look out for each other as much as possible. We would also like to extend this plea to those such as postal workers, delivery drivers, food delivery companies and carers who will still be visiting houses, to keep an eye out for any signs of abuse and to report any concerns to us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Quintin said the Bright Sky app, which can be disguised for people worried about partners checking their phones, provided support and information for victims.</p> \n<p>The National Centre for Domestic Violence said it fully supported the plea and warned of \u201chuge dangers lurking for victims\u201d..</p> \n<p>Its chief executive, Mark Groves, said: \u201cWhile the whole country grapples with the consequences of Covid-19, there are huge dangers lurking for victims of domestic abuse and violence. We fully support Cumbria police\u2019s plea to key workers to help the police investigate suspicions or concerns surrounding victims or perpetrators.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Thames Valley chief constable, John Campbell, said his force expected to see a rise in the number of domestic abuse calls He said domestic violence and fraud would become a priority for his force as \u201ccriminals decide to change their behaviours\u2019 to take advantage of coronavirus\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are seeing and monitoring very closely the issues around domestic abuse, we anticipate that it might increase and we will deal with that robustly in a way that you would expect us to,\u201d Campbell said.</p> \n<p>Shanika Varga, a solicitor at Stowe Family Law, who specialises in domestic abuse cases, said: \u201cBeing stuck in a house together for two weeks or longer means the risk of a situation becoming violent is much higher. Lots of people \u2013 whether they realise it or not \u2013 are in abusive relationships, and abusers will typically manipulate any situation to take advantage of their perceived position of power.\u201d</p> \n<p>Varga urged victims to start thinking of a contingency plan for escaping their abusers. \u201cKnowing your options and making sure people are informed and fully prepared to take action if need be is vital. Don\u2019t forget that help is out there,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>The Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, said on Thursday that the US may already be in recession and warned that the time for lifting societal restrictions that have squashed the economy would be dictated by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> \u2013 in contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s aspiration to return to normal life by Easter.</p> <p>In a rare live television interview for a Fed chair, the morning after the US Senate passed a $2.2tn disaster funding package, Powell said that America\u2019s central bank would not \u201crun out of ammo\u201d in its efforts to support the economy through this \u201cunique\u201d crisis, but gave no assurances on how long the US will be partially shut down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/us-stimulus-package-may-be-massive-but-it-wont-be-enough\">US stimulus package may be massive but it won\u2019t be enough | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are not an expert in pandemics over here, we want to listen to the [health] experts,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday morning.</p> <p>The only individual Powell referred to during his interview was not the president or any of his political aides, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/dr-fauci-press-conference-white-house-coronavirus\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert and the leading public health figure on the White House coronavirus taskforce.</p> <p>Asked by the Today anchor Savannah Guthrie whether the public should pay more attention to Trump\u2019s bullish projections of everyone soon returning to work normally or health experts who cautioned against such a prospect, Powell echoed what Fauci has said this week.</p> <p>\u201cFauci said \u2026 the virus is going to set the timetable and I think that\u2019s right \u2026 the first order of business is to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity,\u201d Powell said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the US passed the 1,000 deaths mark from Covid-19, with 68,000 confirmed cases. A week ago the number of confirmed cases in the US was around 9,000, before a rapid increase in both spread and testing.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve earlier this month dropped interest rates practically to zero and when asked if there was a blank check to support the economy, Powell said there was not but there was a tremendous amount the bank could do to get America through the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe do have the ability to use our emergency lending authorities \u2026 we can continue to make loans and the point of all that is to support the flow of credit into the economy,\u201d Powell said. He said the only backstop to such spending would be the Treasury.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors have pulled back which means that capital markets that support [things like] mortgages and car loans just stopped working. We can support that with our emergency powers. Where credit is not flowing we can step in and offer those loans and we will step in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked if the economy could handle a months-long shutdown if that\u2019s what the US public health emergency requires, Powell spoke of the unique situation.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are being asked to close their businesses and stay home, at a certain point we will get the virus under control and at that point confidence will return,\u201d he said, adding that the rebound at that point could be \u201cvigorous\u201d.</p> <p>Powell said the public health crisis must be dealt with first \u201cthen let the economy bounce back\u201d, not \u201crush in to opening the economy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe first order of business is to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked if an economic recession was inevitable or, indeed, already under way, he said: \u201cWe may well be in a recession,\u201d while emphasizing that the downturn came on the back of an exceptionally, fundamentally strong economy.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus is going to dictate the timetable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked if the bank could \u201crun out of ammo\u201d to combat the effect of the virus on the economy, Powell said the Fed would not run out of financial ammunition and when the economy began to recover \u201cwe will be there to make sure it\u2019s as strong as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Before the outbreak, Trump had repeatedly criticized Powell personally, and the Federal Reserve, in public, calling the chairman \u201cclueless\u201d and the bank \u201cpathetic\u201d among other attacks.</p> <p>Powell said: \u201cWe are totally focused on our mission of serving the American people, we try to do our best to serve them, we do not let anything else get into our thinking, that\u2019s the way it always is at the Fed, it\u2019s deep in our DNA.\u201d</p> <p>His closing message was a plea and a note of encouragement to the public.</p> <p>\u201cWe have asked people to step back from economic activity for the public good. The Fed is working hard to support you now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and<br>Infectious Diseases, warned that it was too soon for the country to<br>consider going back to normal.<br><br>\u201cThe US is not unidimensional, so what we\u2019re seeing is two components<br>of how you address an outbreak \u2013 containment, in which you try to<br>identify each individual person infected, get them out of circulation<br>and do contact-tracing.\u201d<br><br>But that, he told New York\u2019s WNYC, was a strategy \u201cwe needed to do<br>before it became a massive outbreak\u201d.<br><br>In a city like New York, which is now the center of the outbreak, the strategy now is mitigation.<br><br>But Fauci said of Trump setting Easter, 12 April, as an aspirational goal to get the country back to work, \u201che knows, and we\u2019ve discussed it with him, that he has to be very flexible on that.<br><br>\u201cHe put that out because he wants to give people some hope, but he is<br>not absolutely wed to that,\u201d Fauci added.<br><br>In an address on Wednesday, New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, warned that more than 4 million New Yorkers \u2013 or 50% of the city\u2019s population \u2013<br>will get the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fair bet to say that half of all New Yorkers and maybe more than half will end up contracting this disease,\u201d De Blasio said at a city hall press briefing about the outbreak as the Big Apple\u2019s positive cases approached 18,000 with close to 200 deaths.</p>",
  "<p>Landowners have been told to stop burning moorland for grouse shooting after firefighters condemned them for using up valuable emergency resources at a time when the the UK is fighting the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The Moorland Association, an industry body for landowners, said this week landowners must stop any controlled burning. The instruction came after a managed fire in West Yorkshire got out of control and spread into a mile-long fire front.</p> <p>West Yorkshire fire brigade urged all landowners to cease controlled burning after the uncontained moorland fire at Deer Hill reservoir in Marsden tied up firefighters for days.</p> <p>The fire brigade said: \u201cWe are currently trying to focus our resources on supporting the national effort to respond to coronavirus and this is unhelpful to us. We will be making every effort to contact landowners over the forthcoming days and to reiterate this message.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not where we want to be focusing our energies at this time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/20/grouse-moors-owners-threaten-government-with-legal-action\">Grouse moors owners threatened government with legal action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Campaigners say their request was ignored by many landowners, and this week the Moorland Association stepped in to call for landowners to cease burning.</p> <p>The association said: \u201cFollowing the increased risks of wildfire and Covid-19 restrictions we have supported the suspension of heather burning and have advised our members to use cutting instead.\u201d</p> <p>Landowners burn moorland to remove old shoots and expose new shoots that are a source of food for grouse, in preparation for the shooting season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/20/grouse-moors-owners-threaten-government-with-legal-action\">They have threatened to take legal action</a> if the government imposes a ban on burning.</p> <p>Moorland burning is condemned by environmentalists, and the environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to put an end to the burning with a new law. He has said legislation is necessary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/29/grouse-shooting-estates-face-ban-on-burning-of-peat-bogs\">because a voluntary approach has not worked.</a></p> <p>Peat bogs, a threatened moorland habitat, are one of the UK\u2019s biggest carbon stores, yet they are intensively managed by grouse moor estates, who burn the moorland heather to maximise numbers of grouse for shooting.</p> <p>Green campaigners argue the burning harms the environment and wildlife by releasing climate-changing gases into the atmosphere, worsening flooding and degrading a precious habitat.</p> <p>The Peak District national park \u2013 where several moorland fires have got out of control, has also asked people to cease burning.</p> <p>Sarah Fowler, the park\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAt a time when our emergency services are already under enormous strain as a result of Covid-19, it is vital that we do not add to this pressure.</p> <p>\u201cWith these services already stretched, we cannot expect our fire crews to attend incidents that are putting their teams in close proximity to each other, as well as the risk placed on moorland managers not being able to heed the need for social distancing, and taking fire crews to often remote locations. Our focus must rightly be on supporting the coronavirus response for all our local communities.\u201d</p> <p>Fowler said it was unacceptable the burning was taking place at a time when many wildlife species were at the beginning of their breeding season. The burning season begins on 1 October and lasts until April.</p> <p>Campaigners said a curb on burning should be made permanent. Luke Steele, a spokesman for Ban Bloodsports on Yorkshire\u2019s Moors, said: <em>\u201c</em>It speaks volumes that it has taken grouse shoot operators sparking a mile-long fire on Meltham Moor during a national emergency to persuade the Moorland Association to call off the burning season.<em><br><br>\u201c</em>Burning moorland on sensitive peatland degrades ecosystems releases climate-altering gases into the atmosphere and worsens flooding and wildfire risk.\u201d<br><br>Steele said there had been more than 550 burning incidents recorded on Yorkshire\u2019s moors since October, including fires that had started after the request to cease from the West Yorkshire fire brigade. He said it was time the government ensured the burning season ended for good.</p> <p>The Moorland Association said they decided to ask for burning to be suspended after being contacted by a large number of landowners who had already ceased controlled burning.</p> <p>Amanda Anderson, director of the MA said: \u201cControlled burning is an important tool in managing our moorlands when used in the right place at the right time.

  "<p>The Manchester rapper Bugzy Malone, AKA Aaron Davis, has been seriously injured after his motorbike hit a car on the streets of Bury. CCTV footage showed the 29-year-old\u2019s quad bike colliding with an Audi.</p> <p>The footage shows Davis apparently being flung through the air before landing on the road. Further video shot by a pedestrian and posted to social media shows Davis lying on the road bleeding from the face, then being tended to by paramedics and taken to hospital.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police told the Guardian: \u201cShortly before 9.20pm last night, police were called to Rochdale Road, Bury to reports of a collision involving an Audi car and a quad bike. Emergency services attended and the driver of the quad bike \u2013 a 29-year-old man \u2013 was seriously injured and taken to hospital for treatment.</p> <p>\u201cHis injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>A representative for the rapper offered no comment on his status. The condition of the Audi driver is currently unknown.</p> <p>Peers including KSI, Krept of Krept and Konan, and Lethal Bizzle have sent good wishes to the rapper on social media, while some fans have asked why he was out riding his bike during the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Born in Crumpsall, Greater Manchester, Davis had a turbulent childhood, born into a family that he described as \u201ccareer criminals\u201d. He went to prison aged 16. On his release aged 17, he became a boxer, and then a rapper, inspired by the influential Risky Roadz DVD series.</p> <p>Rapping, Davis told the Guardian in 2017, helped him acknowledge \u201cbad anxiety \u2026 stuff that I\u2019d never even verbalised before,\u201d he said. \u201cYou suffer from trauma from the things that you\u2019ve been through because you come from a poverty-stricken background.

  "<h2>25. Larry Crowne (2011)</h2> <p>Yikes. This was one of the Hankster\u2019s two directorial credits and it is a dull and lifeless autumn-years romcom, with Hanks playing opposite Julia Roberts, who is every bit as uneasy as the man himself.</p> <h2>24. Elvis Has Left the Building (2004)</h2> <p>Hanks has a cameo as a dead Elvis Presley impersonator here; ironic, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/tom-hanks-coronavirus-actor-and-wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-in-australia\">he got Covid-19 while on location in Australia filming Baz Luhmann\u2019s Elvis biopic</a>, in which he was due to play Presley\u2019s manager, Colonel Tom Parker.</p> <h2>23. The Da Vinci Code (2006) / Angels &amp; Demons (2009)</h2> <p>Hanks is the dashing Harvard symbologist Dr Robert Langdon, who deciphers occult signs in Renaissance artworks about Jesus in these clunky adaptations of the bestsellers by Dan Brown (whose books had specified that the hero resembled Harrison Ford).</p> <h2>22. The \u2019Burbs (1989)</h2> <p>A nosy suburbanite obsessed with his neighbours\u2019 supposed dirty dealings? That\u2019s the role here with which Hanks does his best. Maybe it would have worked better if he was the straightahead good guy whose innocent pastimes were misinterpreted.</p> <h2>21. Road to Perdition (2002)</h2> <p>A darker role for Hanks; notable, although it doesn\u2019t really play to his strengths. He plays a mob hitman in 1930s Chicago who, with his small son in tow, is going to track down the guys who killed most of his family. A high-minded oddity on his CV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"166c278246beebb078b241004a42eb87afe082ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/166c278246beebb078b241004a42eb87afe082ef/433_0_3071_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Eckhart and Tom Hanks in Sully.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Eckhart and Tom Hanks in Sully.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>20. Sully (2016)</h2> <p>Clint Eastwood directed Hanks in this true-life hagiopic about the heroic airline pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III who, with staggering coolness under pressure, landed his damaged US Airways Flight 1549 on New York\u2019s Hudson river and got all 155 passengers and crew off unscathed, only later to suffer an investigation from the contemptible pen-pushers and corporate bean-counters. Not a bad role for Hanks, but it doesn\u2019t quite come to life.</p> <h2>19. Catch Me If You Can (2002)</h2> <p>Hanks is the cool counterweight to a young Leonardo DiCaprio here; he plays the stolid, even-tempered FBI man on the trail of DiCaprio\u2019s notorious teenage conman in this stranger-than-fiction true story. While DiCaprio fakes being a lawyer or an airline pilot, Hanks is the authentic authority figure, who seems to have a sneaking admiration for DiCaprio\u2019s ingenious illegal hi-jinks.</p> <h2>18. Turner &amp; Hooch (1989)</h2> <p>Playing opposite a big adorable dog is something only an adorable actor can do. Hanks plays a cop called Turner, who has to take care of a big, sloppy lovable dog called Hooch who is the only witness to his owner\u2019s murder. There is joint relatability and some inter-species chemistry, it has to be admitted, and this film played an important part in establishing Hanks\u2019s brand identity.</p> <h2>17. Charlie Wilson\u2019s War (2007)</h2> <p>Again, it is weird here to see Hanks play someone who is not the good guy. He is playing something of a cynical slimeball in this true-life political drama from the screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a> and the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\">Mike Nichols</a>. Hanks is the 80s Reagan-era congressman Wilson who masterminded the covert war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He brings natural charisma and presence, but the part-sentimental-part-cynical vibe feels wrong.</p> <h2>16. The Terminal (2004)</h2> <p>Hanks is not like Meryl Streep: accents are not his thing. But here he is giving us an outrageous Ryussh-yun ick-syent as a wacky innocent from a fictional ex-Soviet state who has to live hobo-ishly in New York\u2019s JFK airport terminal building when a coup back home renders him stateless. Stanley Tucci plays the flustered immigration officer who has to deal with him. As so often in Hanks\u2019s CV, his mojo would work better as the kindly authority figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbde80e360b9d53045aedf687b261bd002c86b26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbde80e360b9d53045aedf687b261bd002c86b26/0_61_2649_1589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks in Cast Away.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks in Cast Away.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/DreamWorks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>15. Cast Away (2000)</h2> <p>Robert Zemeckis\u2019s film, with Hanks as the FedEx employee who is marooned on a desert island, is taken very seriously by Hanks fans; the initial \u201ccrash\u201d scene is certainly a corker, and Hanks is also a likable castaway with his tattered trousers and straggly beard, capering with self-congratulatory delight when he makes fire for the first time. But there is something a bit silly about this; with anyone less seductive than Hanks, it would have sunk.</p> <h2>14. Saving Mr Banks (2014)</h2> <p>In his senior years, Hanks has a new mastery of playing iconic real-life figures who are part of the US\u2019s pop-cultural landscape. Here he is playing Walt Disney; really, no other casting was possible. He is the kindly, persistent movie impresario persuading Emma Thompson\u2019s cantankerous author PL Travers into letting him do a film version of her creation Mary Poppins. As ever, Hanks is a genius at embodying pure likability and his Disney has to be a nice guy (there is no question of mentioning the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/12/walt-disney-anti-semitism-racism-sexism-frozen-head.html\">darker sides</a> to Disney\u2019s personality). In fact, most people will assume that Disney was naturally like Tom Hanks.</p> <h2>13. Sleepless in Seattle (1993) / You\u2019ve Got Mail (1998)</h2> <p>Maybe it is wrong to bracket these together, at least partly because Sleepless in Seattle is appreciably better: lighter of touch, lighter in heart. In SiS, Hanks is still in his big-haired younger-man mode, but by YGM, he is older with smaller hair. But, of course, it is still very much Hanks in each case conducting a poignantly/hilariously long-range relationship with Meg Ryan and jointly becoming the nation\u2019s sweethearts. They work well together, without a doubt.</p> <h2>12. The Post (2017)</h2> <p> Hanks is an actor born to work with Steven Spielberg; in many ways, he is the actorly embodiment of what Spielberg is as a director, and he gives a richly entertaining and watchable performance as the renowned Washington Post editor and liberal lion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-washington-post-alan-rusbridger\">Ben Bradlee</a>, sparring amiably with his boss Kay Graham (Streep) as they chase the Pentagon Papers scoop in 1971, which paved the way for the paper\u2019s Watergate investigation. In this role, Hanks delivers pure Jimmy Stewart decency straight into your veins.</p> <h2>11. Splash (1984)</h2> <p>A great early role for the boyish and unthreateningly cherubic Hanks, who at the time was considered by some pundits insufficiently like a leading man. He is the single guy who falls for the mermaid who saves him from drowning and who comes to Manhattan to get wet and reveal her true nature in his bathtub \u2013 although the film adroitly swims around the potential for smut. Darryl Hannah is terrific in this (and there is a Hollywood sexism story to be told in the list of Hanks\u2019s female leads whose careers have faded while his has motored ever onward). Hanks first sneakily gained cinemagoers\u2019 love in this film, as the boy-next-door who is the man-next-door.</p> <h2>10. Philadephia (1993)</h2> <p>A key moment in Hanks\u2019s early-90s golden age, winning an Oscar in this courtroom drama for playing a gay man who contracts HIV and sues his employer for wrongful dismissal. In some ways, the film conforms to the \u201cliberal balancing\u201d template by pairing Hanks with Denzel Washington as his personal-injury lawyer who is a soon-to-be-reformed homophobe, and there is a new debate now about straight actors playing gay. But nothing could have signalled empathy and respect more clearly than casting Hanks. It is a Hollywood \u201cissue\u201d movie, yes, with the self-consciousness that this implies; but Hanks brings intelligence and sensitivity.</p> <h2>9. Captain Phillips (2013)</h2> <p>You do not expect to see Tom Hanks in an action movie, but that is what\u2019s happening in this gripping hijack thriller from the director Paul Greengrass, based on a true story. Hanks plays the merchant navy captain in charge of a colossal container ship as it sails round the Horn of Africa, a great big slow-moving easy target for Somali pirates with semi-automatic rifles, motivated by poverty. Hanks gives a great performance as the authority figure under stress; the good guy who, like everyone else, is at the mercy of the vast globalised forces of capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e63665bcf41b7bbb10de084390138aeeaf507360\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63665bcf41b7bbb10de084390138aeeaf507360/0_45_2555_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Loggia and Tom Hanks in Big.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Loggia and Tom Hanks in Big.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th C Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8.<strong> </strong>Big (1988)</h2> <p>This fantasy comedy, directed by Penny Marshall and written by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg (sister of Steven), features Hanks in his \u00fcber-Hanks role, the breakout part that really did put him on the map. It is a role that speaks to everyone who feels in their heart that they are impostors, deeply implausible as adults and basically bewildered (or excited) little kids. Hanks plays Josh Baskin, the boy who resents the rules laid down for kids, wishes to be big and then \u2026 well \u2026 be careful what you wish for. Like no one else, Hanks could persuasively embody an adult with adult presence who is nonetheless someone with a child\u2019s innocence and fun. (Try to imagine Tom Cruise doing it, and you realise how quickly it could be a scary movie.) It is never better demonstrated than in the giant toy piano scene, with Hanks joyously dancing on the keys.</p> <h2>7.<strong> </strong>Saving Private Ryan (1998)</h2> <p>Another great Spielberg-Hanks pairing, with Hanks rising to the challenge of a big movie on a big subject. He is the everyman hero Captain Miller in the second world war after D-day who leads a platoon whose purpose is to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) on the field of battle and order him home on compassionate grounds, because all his brothers have been killed. Importantly, Miller is not a professional soldier, but a teacher in civilian life, someone who feels the burden of leadership keenly, but with great modesty and seriousness: a matter of civic values rather than macho heroism. He also has to try concealing that he has a tremor in his hand. The paradox of Hanks is that he is pure Hollywood star quality mixed with self-effacement and it works very well in a drama where the huge impacts of warfare distract you from the acting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3c19ed403739f50e780da4ba3f1f419c2bac75d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3c19ed403739f50e780da4ba3f1f419c2bac75d/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/DreamWorks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Bridge of Spies (2015)</h2> <p>One of the very few Hanks movies in his later period in which he goes toe-to-toe with an actor of equal heavyweight stature \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/05/bridge-of-spies-film-review-tom-hanks-steven-spielberg-cold-war-gary-powers-u2\">the result</a> is a balanced double act, rather than a Hanks leading turn. Mark Rylance plays the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in early 60s America, whom the US government was about to hand over to the Russians in a spy-swap at the Glienicke bridge linking east and west Berlin, the \u201cbridge of spies\u201d. This hair-raisingly dangerously manoeuvre is planned by Abel\u2019s modest but courageous lawyer James Donovan, played of course by Hanks; a man whose amateur enthusiasm and impulsiveness marks him out as a non-diplomat, but someone who nonetheless gets things done. Hanks\u2019s Donovan is superb: homely, wily and sweet, an inspired straight man to the deadpan humour of Rylance\u2019s spy. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d Hanks asks Rylance, who comes back with: \u201cWould it help?\u201d</p> <h2>5. A League of Their Own (1992)</h2> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d Hanks delivers a classic axiom in this Penny Marshall gem, about the foundation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the second world war. He is the grumpy former baseball star who hit the skids due to booze, and is now given his comeback chance by managing what he derisively thinks is an absurd novelty: a female baseball team, featuring Geena Davis, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Madonna. It\u2019s when he yells at right-fielder Evelyn Gardner (played by Bitty Schram) for screwing up that she begins to cry, and he lets her have it with that iconic line. Perhaps this is the one and only time that Hanks fully inhabits an unsympathetic role, and that is probably only because we know it\u2019s just temporary, and that he is basically a father/brother figure, subordinate to the women and bound to be redeemed by them.</p> <h2>4. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)</h2> <p>If Hanks has a late-period masterpiece, it is his extraordinary work in this film about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/23/everyone-said-dont-ruin-my-childhood-director-marielle-heller-on-how-her-mr-rogers-film-finally-got-made\">the real-life US children\u2019s TV presenter Fred Rogers</a> in the late-90s, when he was sliding out of fashion and a little derided by the media establishment. However, he succeeds in profoundly impressing a cynical hardbitten magazine journalist (played by Matthew Rhys) who has come to interview him. This is a genuinely complex, difficult-to-read performance from Hanks, who creates an amazingly detailed, eccentric collection of physical and vocal mannerisms based on the real Rogers, quite different from the aw-shucks routine that people might more readily associate with him. It is especially amazing when he asks Rhys to remain absolutely silent with him over lunch in a restaurant for a solid minute so that they can reflect on the people important to them.</p> <h2>3.<strong> </strong>Forrest Gump (1994)</h2> <p>Look upon the colossal importance of Forrest Gump in Hanks\u2019s career and in 90s Hollywood generally, ye mighty arbiters of taste, and despair! If not despair, exactly, then sadly concede the massive showbusiness firepower that Hanks brought to this folksy parable of \u2026 what exactly? Robert Zemeckis (second only to Marshall and Spielberg as a Hanks director) shot this Zelig-ish, or John Irving-ish story of a young man growing up in the 50s with learning difficulties (as no one then phrased it) and a low IQ, whose essential innocence, niceness and luck cause him to rise to greatness, with a college football career, distinguished service in Vietnam, mastery of table-tennis, a thriving shrimp-fishing business and then brilliance in stock-market investment \u2013 and he becomes a national celebrity for running across the whole country. It is the walk and halting voice that nail it (he was to modify it a little bit, arguably, for his performance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood). Forrest Gump was made in Bill Clinton\u2019s 90s, but Gump is pure Reagan: the simple patriot who wins through.</p> <h2>2. Toy Story (1995) / Toy Story 2 (1999) / Toy Story 3 (2010) / Toy Story 4 (2019)</h2> <p>The pure essence of Hanks is distilled for his inspired vocal role as Woody in Pixar\u2019s glorious animated Toy Story movies. He voices the pull-string cowboy figure who is the favourite toy of Andy, but in danger of being supplanted in his affections by astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), just as westerns were supplanted by space-race-inspired sci-fi in America\u2019s heart generally. Hanks\u2019s vocal work in these movies is a total joy, and it is one of the most heartwarming, heartrending pieces of casting in Hanks\u2019s career. It also puts him under pressure as an actor in a way few of his other films have, especially in TS2, when his old toy comrades tell him to forget about being the favourite of fickle kids and instead embrace being the pampered possession of adult collectors, because children will only break your heart. There is greatness in this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d83fcc47ef64c84671f3372c69e3ca80e28a3500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d83fcc47ef64c84671f3372c69e3ca80e28a3500/0_94_2094_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Apollo 13 (1995)</h2> <p>Something very, very wrong has happened and the whole world holds its breath. The Nasa moon missions, which the US and every other country had come to take for granted as an untarnished, ongoing success, look like becoming a terrible catastrophe. In 1970, the Apollo 13 spacecraft suffers an onboard explosion on its way to the moon, depriving it of most of its electric power and oxygen. There is every chance its astronauts will die, in real time, on national television. Who can save them and all of us? Who can pluck a pyrrhic victory from this defeat?</p> <p>The answer of course is the solid, dependably heroic Hanks, playing Apollo 13\u2019s modest commander Jim Lovell, on whose memoir this movie is based. It is directed with a sure hand by Ron Howard, creating a wonderfully well-made, suspenseful, exciting, poignant Hollywood classic. Hanks is an actor who has something Nasa-ish in his own professionalism, a guy who has refined and fortified his technique over a long period of time and just gets on with it. Cleverly, it is the calm and unshowy Hanks who negotiates the loss of innocence involved in all this: the Apollo 13 near-miss was the event that showed that the US was not all-powerful and also caused the country to begin losing interest in moon landings.</p> <p>Importantly, Hanks leads the operation that brings Apollo 13 and its pilots back, unharmed, and brings our idealism back to Earth as battered but also unharmed. This was a heroic adventure, given an added piquancy by the fact that they didn\u2019t get what they wanted. And Hanks embodies all of this: tough, resourceful, a leader, a pragmatist and a modest hero.</p> <blockquote> </blockquote>",

Populists are not by definition liars. They are only committed to one particular empirical falsehood: the notion that they, and only they, represent what populists often call \u201cthe real people\u201d \u2013 with the implication that other politicians are not only corrupt and \u201ccrooked\u201d, but traitors to the people, or, as Trump has often put it, \u201cUn-American\u201d.</p> <p>More important, it\u2019s not true that today\u2019s rightwing populists are indiscriminately against <em>all </em>elites. They only denounce professionals. Trump supporters did not find it scandalous that his cabinet was full of Wall Street figures. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-so-many-people-dont-get-about-the-u-s-working-class\">The base does not resent the rich</a> \u2013 rather, it aspires to be rich.

Such figures can automatically be maligned by rightwing culture warriors as \u201ccondescending\u201d \u2013 after all, they tell other people what to do, because they claim to know better.

Distrust of professionalism does not come out of nowhere. Neoliberalism paved the way for these attitudes. Margaret Thatcher memorably held that academics didn\u2019t really do any work; in fact, they all \u2013 with the possible exception of scientists \u2013 seemed to be lefties wasting taxpayers\u2019 money. Tories introduced the imperative constantly to audit and assess (and discipline and punish those not measuring up); only what could be counted, counted. Governments that praised \u201cfree markets\u201d \u2013 the spontaneous emergence of economic order \u2013 actually ended up constructing entirely artificial \u201cmarkets\u201d in academia and healthcare. These pseudo-markets had to provide the right \u201cincentives\u201d \u2013 because, so the assumption went, professionals could not possibly be motivated by intrinsic goals of helping patients or pursuing research or educating young people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The result was not a genuine market, but a vast bureaucracy reminiscent of the late Soviet Union. What one historian has called <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691174952/the-tyranny-of-metrics\">\u201cthe tyranny of metrics\u201d</a> meant that the measure became the target; the relentless quantification of performance distorted what and how professionals performed. Enormous resources, and a fair bit of cunning, went into gaming a system which was based on the suspicion that professional self-regulation and internal accountability are sham ideals that just justify professionals erecting monopolies and closed shops.</p> <p>This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientists. Business leaders are praised as more capable decision-makers, when it comes to the length of a lockdown, than epidemiologists. Trump \u2013 who apparently listens to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/as-the-crisis-escalates-trump-experiments-with-a-pivot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm\">theories cooked up by his uniquely unqualified son-in-law</a> and fears being upstaged by Anthony Fauci \u2013 has still not understood that the longer amateur hour at the very top lasts, the more lives will be lost.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis might lead us to a clear-eyed view of the value of professionalism (including professionals in politics like, say, Hillary Clinton). But it\u2019s also important to keep professionalism in its place. Professional advice should constrain political choices, not determine them. Proper professionals, unlike technocrats, do not promise that they know the uniquely correct solution to all policy problems.</p> <p>The assumption that there is only one right way is perversely shared by populists and technocrats: populists claim that there is only one authentic popular will (to build a Wall, get Brexit done, or what have you), and that they are the only ones who know it \u2013 and the only ones who can implement it. The technocratic stance \u2013 widely on display on the continent during the European debt crisis \u2013 holds that there is only one rational answer to policy challenges, and that only technocrats can identify it. If you disagree with a populist, you are declared a traitor to the people; if you disagree with a technocrat, you\u2019ll be told politely that you\u2019re not smart enough.</p> <p>The lesson is not that professionalism should replace democratic politics, or, for that matter, widespread participation by citizens \u2013 a conclusion drawn by unashamedly elitist liberals who have sought to reinstate professional gatekeepers everywhere, but <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/more-professionalism-less-populism.pdf\">especially in primaries</a>. Citizens still know best what their problems are; professionals \u2013 in perfectly non-condescending ways \u2013 play a crucial role in addressing them. Or, as John Dewey, the greatest American philosopher of democracy in the 20th century, put it, \u201cno government by experts in which the masses do not have the chance to inform the experts as to their needs can be anything but an oligarchy managed in the interests of the few.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Jan-Werner M\u00fcller teaches at Princeton.

  "<p>There is a great difference between panic and awareness. With awareness there is responsibility, a respect for the scale of the problem, and a calm consciousness of what needs to be done.</p> <p>One can be aware of the coronavirus, aware of what needs to be done to minimise its spread \u2013 and we must do those things. But one should not make the situation worse with the negative imagination that is fear. For, like fire, imagination can create or it can destroy. It can make us act from our worst selves. That is what panic does. Panic is fear on steroids. With panic, sanity is lost. Ever since the virus entered our mental culture, it has become omnipresent. We have been engulfed in its world, in its fearsome power.</p> <p>Many friends I spoke to on the phone said that just from reading too much about it, there were times at night when they felt pains in their chests or a fleeting inability to breathe. A few moments later they felt better. After a check-up, they found nothing wrong with them. They had simply imagined intensely the symptoms they read about and began to experience them in their bodies. It occurred to me that there might be a dimension to the pandemic that could be called mental contagion.</p> <p>Is it possible to obsess about something till one becomes sick with it? People have made themselves ill with their own minds. If this can happen with individual obsession, what happens when a whole culture obsesses over something as potent to the imagination as the current pandemic?</p> <p>Perhaps it is time to develop another mental contagion to counteract the force of the deadly one. Perhaps it is time to develop a contagion of courage, good health, and solidarity. Not enough has been said about the role of our mental condition in fighting the virus. Fear brings out the worst in us, it makes us panic buyers. But generosity of spirit makes us think of our common survival. This awakens in us creative ways of coping with the stresses resulting from the necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus. We are never more resourceful than when we act from courage.</p> <p>Not only will we survive this pandemic, but we will be judged by how we survived it, by what we become afterwards. We will either be transformed by what we did or damaged by how we failed to live up to our potential for goodness. We are making ourselves all the time, but never so much as when we are faced with an existential crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/we-face-a-pandemic-of-mental-health-disorders-those-who-do-it-hardest-need-our-support\">We face a pandemic of mental health disorders. Those who do it hardest need our support | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the second world war, Britain was fortunate in having a leader who helped the nation prove itself greater than its adversity. Britain\u2019s response to that moment defined its character. We are in one of those moments in history when we are given an unprecedented crisis in order that we may gift ourselves with an extraordinary response that can change our destiny as a species forever. We are at a fulcrum. Given the way we have managed life on this planet over the last 150 years, some sort of disaster was inevitable. We have overdrawn on the bank of our futures. We have exhausted the planet\u2019s goodwill. There are those who speak of the current pandemic as nature pressing the reset button, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/covid-19-is-natures-wake-up-call-to-complacent-civilisation\">nature speaking back at humanity</a> for the unthinkable ways in which we have abused and depleted her. They see it as nature\u2019s response to our arrogance.</p> <p>It is therefore an important moment for us to re-examine our conscience as a species. A moment to take stock. The questions raised by the pandemic should spill over into all the other issues through which future disasters might arise, issues of climate change, surveillance, civil rights, universal healthcare, justice and poverty. Humanity is transformed by those who took from tragedy the highest lessons. In Britain, after the second world war, one of the greatest alterations made was the creation of the welfare state, with the health service as its jewel. The NHS has been under great strain these last 20 years. But it is now, during this pandemic, that we see the value of this ideal of universal healthcare, paid for by the citizens.</p> <p>A pandemic of selfishness has eroded some of the best things the world learned from two world wars. We are gradually forgetting the value of international cooperation. Values of the market have taken over from values of human solidarity. And even of human life. Our judgments have been skewed by the measures of the money rather than measures of the heart.</p> <p>This is another way of saying that we have lost our way. We are deep in a new wasteland. We got here because only one kind of voice has been powerfully heard, the voice of financial success. Other voices, just as valuable, have not been heard enough. What voices are these? They are the voices that speak for nature, for the poor, for justice: voices easily ridiculed.</p> <p>We have entered the age of catastrophes. They will be universal in effect because the problems of the world are now universal. The climate catastrophe will not choose one country over another.</p> <p>So much bitterness has divided us of late. Doctrines of division have nowhere to take us. There is no real destiny any more for small-minded dreams. The scale of our challenges must alter the scale of our visionary response.</p> <p>The panic, driven by fear, ought to be replaced with a passion for a better life for the planet and its people. We will not acquire the calm we need to deal with this pandemic through a fear of death. What we need is a respect for death and a new hunger for life. We could begin now to create the best chapter in the human story. It could be said of us, in the future, that faced with a viral catastrophe we did something amazing. Imagine if the leaders of the world chose at this moment to put in place policies that could reverse climate change, bring health and education to all its people, and kill off the virus of poverty that has spread untold misery.</p> <p>This might sound fanciful. But history has always been made by those who guided us with vision at moments of our greatest crisis. All our myths point in two directions. We either go upwards, towards the true meaning of civilisation, or we head for an apocalypse.</p> <p>Tragic times call for extraordinary qualities. We are made for heroic realities. We have always known what to do. Our ancestors coded our choices for us in fables and legends. But we got deaf to what we needed to hear most.</p> <p>What we need to hear most is now speaking with the sinister voice of death. Perhaps we will begin to listen.</p> <p>The real tragedy would be if we come through this pandemic without changing for the better. It would be as if all those deaths, all that suffering, all the deaths to come, all the suffering to come, would mean nothing.</p> <p>\u2022 Ben Okri is a Nigerian novelist and poet.

  "<p>Ultras are notoriously difficult to define. They are the most hardcore and extremist of football fans, but while many groups have become criminal gangs, morphing into semi-secretive, paramilitary organisations that accumulate great power and wealth, others are idealistic crusaders against injustice and tyranny. Plenty of ultras are neo-fascist, but there are many far-left groups, too. The ultra mentality is all about the local \u2013 your street, suburb or city \u2013 but it\u2019s also a globalised subculture in which fans thousands of miles apart influence each others\u2019 songs, protests, politics and philosophies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesmontague\" title=\"\">James Montague</a> has spent many years with them (his subtitle \u2013 \u201camong the ultras\u201d \u2013 seems a conscious nod to Bill Buford\u2019s acclaimed if flawed book on British hooligans, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/18/sport.comment\" title=\"\">Among the Thugs</a></em>). The \u201c1312\u201d of the title refers to the alphabet code for ACAB, an ubiquitous acronym which stands for \u201call cops are bastards\u201d. It\u2019s that which unites the movement: there is, Montague writes, a \u201cmistrust in any type of authority\u201d. There\u2019s a bloody-minded contrariness to the ultras. It is typified by the word <em>di\u0161pet</em> used by its members from Hadjuk Split: \u201ca term of defiance that roughly means to oppose something no matter the consequences \u2026 <em>Di\u0161pet</em> means to be anti-everything.\u201d</p> <p>Montague is a brilliant and daring guide. Travelling to 25 countries to compare ultra movements around the world, he takes the reader to warehouses, forests, terraces and underpasses. In Albania, a nationalist called Ismail drives with his knees as he loads, cocks and fires a gun. In Indonesia the author is chased by rival ultras armed with machetes. He smokes weed with a fascist mobster in Rome. It\u2019s frequently pretty dangerous: \u201cI had been warned that if we ever got into trouble that I should not, under any circumstances, fall over. \u2018If you fall, you\u2019re dead.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an immersive account, partly because it is clearly a world Montague enjoys. He hints that he was something of a scallywag in his youth: \u201cAs a teenager I must have been arrested a dozen times. Getting caught was almost as big a rush as getting away.\u201d Researching and writing the book was a way to recapture that teenage buzz. After one scrape \u2013 and there are many here \u2013 he says: \u201cMy heart was beating fast and I felt something approaching elation after my escape. I was fifteen again. I turned on the light in the bathroom and stared at myself in the mirror. I was smiling.\u201d</p> <p>But the first-person is never overdone or naff: there\u2019s enough of it to capture the fix and the fear, but it mainly serves to explain the existential attraction of the ultra life: the absorption of the self into something far greater, into the group, into a tribe or a brotherhood. It\u2019s \u201ca sound\u201d, he writes poetically, \u201cthat you could lose yourself into\u201d. In some ways it\u2019s nothing to do with football but all about danger and adrenaline, about vulnerability and protection, about piggy-backing football to enjoy an emotional rollercoaster. Every ultra, Montague writes, has the same \u201corigins story, the same recollection. They looked at the pitch, but were drawn to the danger and the noise of the crowds behind the goals. They didn\u2019t just want to watch football. They wanted to feel it too.\u201d</p> <p>Montague never shies away from the darkest aspects of this subculture. At Boca Juniors in Argentina the Doce crew allegedly pull in $3m a month. Even if other sources have suggested a lower figure of $400,000 a month, it\u2019s still big money, especially since many come from the slums. The stakes are so high that many ultras have, over the decades, been murdered. Much of that money comes not only from dealing tickets and drugs, but from being hired as foot soldiers to do the dirty work of politicians, unions and narcos, who need boots on the ground. As one ultra in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\" title=\"\">Brazil</a> says: \u201cThe politicians, judges, the chief police officers \u2013 on one side they reject me. But on the other side, they want to talk to you, to get closer, to arrange something with you.\u201d Very often the ultras are like mercenaries, hired thugs who can fight, intimidate and cajole: \u201cIt\u2019s organised like an army,\u201d says a Serbian ultra. \u201cIn a very short period of time they can organise ten thousand men here in Belgrade.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The drunk brawls of British hooligans have been replaced by arranged fights in forests between sober martial arts obsessives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The disorganised, drunk brawls of British hooligans have now been replaced by arranged fights in forests between sober, highly trained martial arts obsessives. So it\u2019s not, perhaps, surprising that \u2013 for all their avowed independence from power \u2013 ultras have sometimes been pawns in geopolitical scraps. More than 60 per cent of Azov (far-right) fighters who helped liberate Ukrainian Mariupol from Russia came from the ultra scene. The Russian oligarch, Ivan Savvidis (who owns PAOK in Greece) was alleged to have funded Macedonia ultras to campaign against the renaming of the country, which was seen as a prelude to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\" title=\"\">Nato</a> access. The ultras are the hardest edge of football\u2019s soft power.</p> <p>But just as one is becoming jaundiced about this subculture, Montague offers examples of ultras going toe-to-toe with autocratic states. They were instrumental in protests in Tahrir and Maidan squares in Egypt and Ukraine respectively. They have often been on the frontline of civil disobedience in Turkey, Brazil, Sweden and Germany. They \u201cdespair at the commercialisation of the modern world\u201d and often fight, literally, against corruption. Without organised fans, it\u2019s likely that German\u2019s revered \u201c50+1\u201d rule (meaning that fans have a majority say in the running of their clubs) would have been abolished. It\u2019s almost as if only ultras can endow football with the metaphysical profundity to which it aspires. Montague describes one silent stadium protest as \u201csucking the importance and the significance out of what was happening on the pitch. The 22 footballers seemed small and irrelevant compared to the weight of self-discipline and control that was bearing down from four sides of the arena.\u201d</p> <p><em>1312</em> is such a global tour that the reader occasionally risks jet-lag.

Pasquale makes an appearance or two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a recent genius episode in which a patient, Lizzie, suffered from a condition that made her see every white man she encountered (and some white women with short hair) as Joe Pasquale. That\u2019s right, early 00s variety show comedian Joe Pasquale \u2013 who gamely appeared in the episode, as if to prove his enduring existence. You would think such a severe break from mental acuity would prompt some sort of panic. But no, this is Doctors, so Pasquale is used as a running gag and Lizzie is ultimately carted off for \u201cneurological testing\u201d. We never see her again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/david-lynch-interview-manchester-international-festival\">David Lynch</a> would never be so brave as to attempt a Pasquale in one of his dream sequences.</p> <p>In another episode, a man entered the surgery to have a vasectomy, only to find out \u2013 on the suspiciously unsterilised surgical table \u2013 that his partner had been cheating on him all along, that the child he thought was his was the product of a Mallorcan one-night stand and that he should retain his vas deferens after all. He found this out because his partner was watching him have the surgery (in the same room!) and stepped in at the last minute to deliver another Doctors mannequin monologue.</p> <p>It may seem surprising that the drama has clung on for so long \u2013 having borne no notable acting talent \u2013 but its fans are a committed bunch, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDoctors/photos/a.377035905709708.93903.359687864111179/1709991015747517/?type=3&amp;theater\">taking to social media</a> to vent their outrage when it has been placed on summer hiatus in favour of the football and ensuring its steady survival in the ratings.

It is a familiar hum of conversation to tune out while you work, just as you would at the office, or a woozy fever dream to accompany your own lethargy.</p> <p>Now that most of the UK population will have the chance to watch the show in real time, tuning in at 1.45pm in a post-lunch haze after their 15th consecutive meal of pasta and toilet paper to absorb whichever new medical drama and C-list celebrity cameo comes to light. Home workers of Britain, unite and take solace in half-ignoring storylines while aimlessly scrolling through your emails! Doctors is the perfect quarantine TV. Long may it continue.</p>",

  "<p>James Washington, a 37-year-old lawyer originally from Norfolk, UK, was on the US Department of State website last Thursday trying to arrange a passport to take his newborn son, born via surrogate in the US, home to Amsterdam, when a message popped up. Due to coronavirus, the US authorities would only be issuing passports for life-or-death emergencies. Everyone else would have to wait.</p> <p>As a result, Washington and his husband, Rob, 36, and their 11-day-old baby are stuck in an Airbnb in Portland, Oregon. Under normal circumstances, the Washingtons would have applied for a US passport for their son, taken him home and applied for a parental order through the British courts. (Both men are British citizens.)</p> <p>But they cannot now get the US passport, and the British passport office will not issue emergency travel documents as UK law does not yet recognise their son as a British citizen. (Technically, his surrogate mother and her husband are his legal custodians.) \u201cWe are stuck,\u201d said James.</p> <p>The Washingtons are not the only parents to have utilised the US\u2019s comparatively relaxed surrogacy laws and then become trapped by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThere are hundreds of families currently stuck, or about to be stuck, in the US right now because of coronavirus,\u201d said Robin Pope, an Oregon family lawyer and assisted reproduction specialist.</p> <p>Pope has been keeping an unofficial tally of the babies born via surrogate who are now trapped in the US. According to her list there are 21, and more than 100 more babies are expected to be born via surrogate in the coming months. The parents come from countries including France, Singapore and Israel. Pope knows of a father from China who has been unable to get into the US to meet his child, born via surrogate in February, because the US <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/\">banned</a> foreign nationals arriving from China on 31 January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/global_lockdown/giv-3902dwVVA30Eq3Qo/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/global_lockdown/giv-3902dwVVA30Eq3Qo/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>Brilliant Beginnings, a British surrogacy agency, has eight babies due to be born via US surrogates in the next six months, and three babies, including the Washingtons\u2019 son, currently stuck there. \u201cTheir parents are extremely worried about how they will get to the US in time for their birth,\u201d said Natalie Gamble, of NGA Law, a UK expert in fertility and surrogacy law. \u201cThese babies are their babies and they need to be responsible for them from birth.\u201d</p> <p>Gamble is also aware of a British couple struggling to bring home their daughter born via surrogate in the nation of Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s the same problem, because the baby is not automatically British,\u201d Gamble said. \u201cIf they could get emergency travel documents, they\u2019d be able to get their baby home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>British parents of children born via surrogate abroad can make an application to the Home Office for a British nationality registration, thereby entitling the child to emergency travel documentation, but this process can take up to six months. \u201cThey can\u2019t be stuck there for six months,\u201d Gamble said. She has written to the home secretary, Priti Patel, asking her to intervene and make emergency travel documents available to these children.</p> <p>Pope has been working with the Oregon senator Ron Wyden to get the US passport office to issue an exemption for children born via surrogacy so that their parents can get them back home. \u201cWe need the passport agency to include surrogacy in their definition of an emergency so parents can get passports for these babies,\u201d Pope said.</p> <p>Pope is particularly concerned about what would happen to these children or their parents should they contract coronavirus. \u201cThe way our healthcare system works, you need to be resident to get health insurance. If any of them were to get sick, that would be an enormous problem.\u201d</p> <p>And since many governments are now advising against all international travel for their citizens, it is unclear whether travel insurance providers would pay out if any of these children or their parents contracted coronavirus.</p> <p>A state department official said: \u201cIn an effort to reduce the potential spread of Covid-19, the Department of State\u2019s domestic passport agencies have restricted passport services at our public counter to applicants with life-or-death emergencies traveling within 72 hours only.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise that this is a very challenging time for US travelers, and we are doing our utmost to balance the safety and health of our workforce and customers with the needs of customers with life or death emergencies.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The Washingtons have made repeated trips to various local government offices to get papers printed and notarised, risking exposing them and their newborn son to coronavirus. If having a baby by surrogate abroad is an administrative hoopla at the best of times, during the coronavirus pandemic, it is a bureaucratic nightmare.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want this time to pass us by,\u201d said James, \u201cbut I\u2019m spending so much of my time in front of my laptop trying to sort this out, it feels like I\u2019m at work.\u201d</p> <p>The family have a return flight booked for 4 April but it is looking doubtful they will make it. Meanwhile, as they wait in hope for the US passport office to reopen, their 29-year-old surrogate has been pumping breast milk for their son.</p> <p>\u201cAs we\u2019re social distancing, we do doorstep pickups of the milk only,\u201d said James. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely tough.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Malian musician Rokia Traor\u00e9 has been released from a French prison, after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/22/mali-music-star-rokia-traore-on-hunger-strike-after-kidnapping-arrest\">detained </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/22/mali-music-star-rokia-traore-on-hunger-strike-after-kidnapping-arrest\">since 10 March for the alleged kidnap of her daughter</a> in a child custody dispute. Her freedom is dependent on her delivery to Belgian authorities, once travel restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic are lifted.</p> <p>Traor\u00e9 was arrested under a European warrant issued by a judge in Brussels, where a court had ordered her to surrender her five-year-old daughter to the child\u2019s father, Jan Goossens, who is Belgian. Traor\u00e9 was held in Paris after getting off a plane there.</p> <p>Until such time as she can be transferred to Belgium, Traor\u00e9 will be under judicial supervision, a French criminal procedure imposed to prevent suspects from fleeing or recidivism, following a hearing in Paris on 25 March. Traor\u00e9 appeared by video link. \u201cDespite the fact that I live in Mali, I have always answered to the Belgian justice system,\u201d she said, explaining that she had been travelling to Europe to attend a hearing related to her custody appeal.</p> <p>Her lawyer, Kenneth Feliho, said: \u201cMs Traor\u00e9 never wanted to evade Belgian justice, but it is impossible in her mind to hand over her daughter.\u201d Feliho said they would go to the French court of cassation \u2013 France\u2019s highest court of appeal \u2013 and the European court of human rights if necessary. \u201cThe fight with Belgian justice will continue,\u201d <a href=\"https://amp.lefigaro.fr/musique/la-chanteuse-rokia-traore-liberee-sous-controle-judiciaire-20200326?__twitter_impression=true\">he told </a><a href=\"https://amp.lefigaro.fr/musique/la-chanteuse-rokia-traore-liberee-sous-controle-judiciaire-20200326?__twitter_impression=true\">Le Figaro</a>.</p> <p>Traor\u00e9\u2019s case embodies a clash between European and African judicial systems. A Malian court had given Traor\u00e9 custody of the child. The country\u2019s government issued a statement in support of the musician, pointing out that she has a Malian diplomatic passport that should give her immunity. In a statement issued from prison, Traor\u00e9 said that she was told this was not valid in Europe.</p> <p>Traor\u00e9 filed complaints about Goossens in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mali\">Mali</a>, France and Belgium, which she insists have not been investigated \u2013 though later in her prison statement she claims they were a major factor in the Malian court\u2019s decision to grant her sole custody.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with a Belgian paper, Goossens said: \u201cAll horrible and false accusations were investigated and dismissed. All attempts to negotiate and achieve solutions were refused.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2223783/\">Haifaa Al-Mansour</a>\u2019s latest film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6971114/\">The Perfect Candidate</a>, opens with a doctor in her 20s driving to work. In any other film you wouldn\u2019t register the fact that she\u2019s behind the wheel. But this woman, dressed in a black abaya and niqab, is in Saudi Arabia, which until 2018 banned women from driving. Al-Mansour added the scene as a punch-the-air moment for female audiences in Saudi Arabia, an invite to a collective whoop of victory. \u201cI know that in the west this seems like common-sense stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ve really helped women to see themselves as an independent people.\u201d She fixes me with an earnest look, to see if I get it. \u201cFor younger professional women, it\u2019s huge, because it gives them control over their destiny.\u201d</p> <p>Al-Mansour is Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female director. In 2011, she shot her debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/18/wadjda-review\">Wadjda</a>, hiding in the back of a van. It would have been impossible for a woman to be seen openly on the street giving orders to men. So, she kept out of sight and used a walkie-talkie (\u201cBut I\u2019m sure you could hear my voice all over Riyadh. \u2018Do that!\u2019 \u2018Pull the camera back!\u2019\u201d) The film was gorgeous, a funny, big-hearted story about a gobby 10-year-old girl who would stop at nothing to get her hands on a bike. Al-Mansour shrugged off the death threats (\u201cOne of them told me they had a coffin ready for me\u201d). Spend five minutes in her company and you are struck by her optimistic energy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/30/the-perfect-candidate-review-venice-film-festival\">The Perfect Candidate review \u2013 powerful insight into Saudi absurdity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new film is another inspiring story of female resistance, this time about a young female doctor who runs, almost by accident, for office in local elections.

(\u201cThey are very American,\u201d she says of her kids. \u201cThey say \u2018dude\u2019 with an American accent.\u201d) But she missed home and so she wrote The Perfect Candidate, which stars the impossibly beautiful TV actor Mila Al Zahrani as Dr Maryam, a supremely capable young medic working in a rundown hospital (healthcare is a major employer of women). The film catches society in the midst of a transformation, at a moment when women have more freedom, but society is slow to embrace them. When Maryam holds an all-female fundraiser, the response is depressing: \u201cMy husband will kill me if I vote for you.\u201d \u201cI hope you win, but I don\u2019t vote.\u201d I\u2019m not giving anything away to say that Maryam has a tough time of it on the campaign trail \u2013 laughed at, patronised by a TV presenter, criticised as shrill and unfeminine.</p> <p>Was Al-Mansour making a more universal point? \u201cYeah, they are crushed. Look at Hillary Clinton. But seeing women in leadership positions is something people need to get used to.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of the film Maryam wears the niqab; as she grows more confident in her identity it comes off. What did Al-Mansour want to say about the veil? \u201cAt the beginning Maryam wants to fit in. And what does society expect of women? To cover up. But at the end she understands what defiance means. It\u2019s about respect. A human being\u2019s identity is in their face. I think face covering is one of the most dangerous things that ever happened to the Muslim culture.\u201d For the first time in our conversation Al-Mansour is deadly serious. \u201cWe need female Muslim scholars who can deconstruct a lot of the literature about a woman\u2019s body and the veil. Like, for example, when I was a kid I was, I was told: \u2018You are like a cake. If you don\u2019t cover it, flies will come.\u2019 So it\u2019s blaming the victim. This is the psychology a lot of Muslim women go through \u2013 they have to cover because they\u2019re responsible for someone\u2019s else\u2019s actions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/03/we-feel-empowered-saudi-women-relish-new-freedoms\">'We feel empowered': Saudi women relish their new freedoms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dress code for women has changed in Saudia Arabia, she adds. Women are encouraged not to be completely covered. \u201cBut a lot of women still cling to that because that is taught from the beginning that is what makes them good and chaste and noble.\u201d</p> <p>The film, I think, has demythologising effect, too. It\u2019s a lesson to audiences in the west that behind the abayas and the veils, the women of the Middle East are modern citizens of the world. \u201cSaudi women are sassy and very resourceful,\u201d says Al-Mansour. \u201cYou try to buy a carpet from a Saudi woman; she will take all your money.

She grew up in small conservative town, and describes herself as a shy kid, the eighth of 12 children in a liberal house. Her father was a poet. Where does the rebellious streak come from? \u201cMy parents,\u201d she answers quickly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have money, but I feel really privileged. I was respected. My father and my mother never told me: \u2018Because you are a woman you can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d Music filled the house, and as teenager she watched Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies. \u201cWhenever I told people at school I listened to music, they\u2019d be like: \u2018You\u2019re going straight to hell. I don\u2019t want to play with you.\u2019 So, I felt like an outsider.\u201d</p> <p>After studying literature at the American University in Cairo, she got a marketing job at a Saudi oil company. \u201cIn meetings they would never listen to me. I was invisible.\u201d Al-Mansour began her career in film by making a short films with her siblings. In 2005, she met Neimann at a screening of one of her documentaries at the US embassy in Saudi Arabia where he was working as a cultural attache. When he was posted to Australia, she studied film in Sydney and wrote the script that became Wadjda.</p> <p>Right now, Al-Mansour\u2019s plan is to make films in Saudi Arabia and the west. She arrived in Hollywood at the right time, she tells me. \u201cI get a lot of chances. I get a lot of meetings. I have a chance now to build a resum\u00e9 that allows me, hopefully, in a couple of years to direct a really big movie with a big budget.\u201d Would she be up for making a blockbuster? She raises an eyebrow, surprised I would even ask the question. \u201cYes! I think I can make an amazing $100m film. Ten years ago, that would be unheard of, for a film-maker like me who\u2019s not white and who\u2019s not American, who\u2019s not a man.\u201d</p> <p>#MeToo and #OscarSoWhite have made real and meaningful differences for women such as Al-Mansour. \u201cWhat happened with Harvey Weinstein was a wake-up call. All the misogyny that we took for granted is not acceptable any more.

Whatever the count is, it\u2019s the count for 10 years.\u201d</p> <h2>Counting the homeless</h2> <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s 2019 homeless assessment tallied more than 151,000 homeless people in California, a 16.4% increase from the year before. California\u2019s unhoused population made up more than a quarter of the nation\u2019s total count of 568,000.</p> <p>With no fixed address and little trust in the government, the homeless population has always been notoriously difficult to track. \u201cIt\u2019s a population that\u2019s very leery of the government,\u201d said Candice Elder, the founder and executive director of the not-for-profit East Oakland Collective.</p> <p>Community advocates throughout the state knew that now, more than ever, with the population growing, the Census Bureau needed to get an accurate count of California\u2019s unhoused. In the year and half leading up to the count, however, local census committees came to understand that it would be on them to make sure their homeless populations were accurately counted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b340a51957179362860552cd4526bd8ce78b9134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b340a51957179362860552cd4526bd8ce78b9134/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"While homelessness has skyrocketed, particularly in California, census staffers said plans in place to count the population were insufficient and disorganized\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While homelessness has skyrocketed, particularly in California, census staffers said plans in place to count the population were insufficient and disorganized.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur whole strategy in San Francisco has been to not rely on the Census Bureau to count during that time, and relying instead on informing people they could do the census on their own and highlighting our network of census help centers,\u201d said Robert Clinton, San Francisco\u2019s 2020 census project manager.</p> <p>While the census falls under the umbrella of the federal Census Bureau in Washington, jurisdictions have the option to form their own committees to work with the regional offices \u2013 something the federal bureau has recommended.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus crisis, the federal Census Bureau planned on counting people experiencing homelessness from 30 March to 1 April. From 3 February to 6 March, the bureau was supposed to be working with local advocates to identify shelters, soup kitchens and other service providers, as well as well-known encampments and hotspots where the unhoused frequent.</p> <p>On 30 and 31 March, the enumerators planned to conduct the service-based survey, going to the shelters and soup kitchens to count the population. On Census Day, the plan was to conduct the targeted non-sheltered outdoor location counting, going to the encampments and talking to people on the streets directly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s clear that this administration is not trying to count everyone in the US</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Clinton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Communication continually broke down between the federal bureau and the San Francisco census committee, Clinton said, whether over verifying service sites, clarifying cultural sensitivity training or just going over how enumerators would count and collect information from each location. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because the people who work in San Francisco, the Census Bureau staff on the ground here, they have really good intentions,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that this administration is not trying to count everyone in the US.\u201d</p> <p>The federal Census Bureau did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>In November, a group of advocates in Alameda county, some serving on the county\u2019s complete count committee, sent a letter to the area manager of the Los Angeles regional office, which oversees California, Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Idaho.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6df9472fb2b662f668c0539d3a2056cb59a300c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6df9472fb2b662f668c0539d3a2056cb59a300c0/0_0_1125_1491/755.jpg\" alt=\"A script sent out to some field offices in February directed enumerators to ask people about their citizenship status.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A script sent out to some field offices in February directed enumerators to ask people about their citizenship status.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria, census regional manager</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have shared the operational plans provided by the US Census Bureau with the homeless service providers and advocates in our community,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThey have expressed significant concern.

People are on high alert at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImagine just plain and simple the amount of people you will miss, even with the best enumerators,\u201d longtime census worker Maria said. \u201cHow can you count everyone at 1 o\u2019clock in the morning? It\u2019s going to be a radical undercount.\u201d</p> <p>The citizenship question in the script the bureau sent out to some field offices would only further alienate the homeless population, Elder said. \u201cYou have a lot of undocumented unhoused residents who may not complete the census out of fear of being reported to immigration,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to reassure people, and tell them that the census is not going to be reported to law enforcement.\u201d</p> <p>A 10 February email from the Los Angeles regional office moved to correct the inclusion of the citizenship question \u2013 \u201cSome offices received scripts that ask the citizenship question; this is not part of the decennial census and must be removed/crossed-out from all materials immediately\u201d \u2013 but Maria worried that some enumerators may have already received the scripts before the issue could be fixed.</p> <h2>The coronavirus crisis strikes</h2> <p>On top of the already existing confusion and uncertainty around the homeless count, comes the coronavirus crisis \u2013 the shelter-in-place orders, and the warnings of social distancing.</p> <p>Census workers at the local and national level are concerned about how the crisis will affect an already flawed operation.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to do a fixed point enumeration at a time of mass migration of where people live just seems insane, on top of what was already foundationally going to be a massive, massive challenge,\u201d Maria said.</p> <p>She described the situation as frantic. \u201cThese are not the kind of operations where you can just wing it, and we have no guidance on how we plan on enumerating these people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe household stuff is going to be counted no matter what,\u201d Maria continued. \u201cBut even if we delay this two weeks, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be able to get an accurate count of the people who are struggling on a lower rung.\u201d</p> <p>Local census workers who planned to ignore the mismanagement on the federal level and help homeless people fill out the census on their own now find themselves increasingly hampered by safety concerns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80995f2330e4c8cb51c07a5df3689294aaa6f395\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80995f2330e4c8cb51c07a5df3689294aaa6f395/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mobile shower service for the homeless in Los Angeles.

They refused, so they sent instead. \u201cWe have to overcome these confines that the Census Bureau is upholding,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Though she recognizes the complications that the coronavirus crisis will add, Farmer hasn\u2019t given up.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has a constitutional right to be counted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight hard to make sure everyone is.\u201d</p>",

<p>\u201cFood, water, shelter and adequate medical care are paramount for survival, but so too is the ability for an individual to defend his or herself, their family, as well as their home, business

and could thus stay open.</p> <p>In Connecticut, Democratic senator and gun-control advocate Richard Blumenthal argued that closing gun stores would be broadly in line with other anti-coronavirus measures, including restrictions on travel and assembly.</p> <p>\u201cPlain and simple, there is no reason why gun stores should be given this exemption,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1242459711485722633\">the senator tweeted</a>.</p> <p>But the stores stayed open and the National Rifle Association praised the state governor, Ned

of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth \u2013 a result in clear tension with the second amendment\u201d of the US constitution as well as the constitution of Pennsylvania itself.</p> <p>Wolf\u2019s office did not announce the policy change: it was included on an updated list of businesses subject to an order to close because they are deemed \u201cnon-life-sustaining\u201d.</p>

  "<p>On Monday, Donald Trump announced he would seek to \u201creopen large sections of the country\u201d by Easter with the aim of easing Covid-19\u2019s economic impact, a move public health experts say would risk escalating the pandemic. What is the worst-case scenario if physical restrictions are loosened, and why is it mistaken to think the cure is worse than the disease?</p> <h2><strong>Would it be possible to \u2018reopen\u2019 the country in two weeks\u2019 time?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Greogry Poland: </strong>We won\u2019t reopen in April. The number of new cases we\u2019re seeing now in the United States is increasing by almost 50% every day. We are on the steepest part of the curve right now. What we\u2019re seeing is a reflection of transmission two to four weeks ago, which means whatever you\u2019re seeing now, it will be significantly higher and worse in a few weeks.</p> <p><strong>Dr Robert J Kim-Farley: </strong>We want to avoid what I call the second wave. It would occur if we prematurely dropped our guard \u2013 this physical distancing \u2013 too soon.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible we might be able to be more nuanced in our approach to physical distancing, and that once we have more extensive testing, and we can truly ensure that [certain] areas do not have community transmission occurring, then those people could potentially go back to work. But [they\u2019d need to be] under a microscope. Public health officials would need to frequently test to ensure there is no introduction into that community.</p> <p>But in our densely populated areas, like Los Angeles or New York, places that have already seen major spiking of the epidemic, it would just not be appropriate epidemiologically, from a public health viewpoint, to begin to relax any of the physical distancing measures while we\u2019re still seeing an uptick of the outbreak.</p> <h2><strong>If we did reopen, what could happen?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>It doesn\u2019t make any sense to loosen restrictions during an epidemic. You\u2019re fundamentally choosing economics over our lives. Let\u2019s say you live in a community with a 200-bed hospital. They have five to 10 ICU beds, half of which are used for heart attacks and everything else. So maybe they have five beds and five ventilators. If you admit one person a week, you can give great medical care. If you admit 20, 50, or 100, mortality rates shoot up.</p> <p>It means your hospitals are overrun. People are on carts in the hallways, and they die in the hallway waiting for medical care. There aren\u2019t enough ventilators, IV fluids, doctors and nurses. It\u2019s a scenario you never want to see. So if everybody goes back to work, people start dying in droves.</p> <h2><strong>How many cases might we see without significant interventions?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>The CDC has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html\">released</a> what they think would be a worst-case scenario: 160 to 210 million people infected by December, 1 million hospitalized, and somewhere between 200,000 and 1.7 million dying. Imperial Medical College has really come up with some very dire projections. One is that they\u2019re projecting an <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">eightfold demand</a> higher than what can be met by the medical system.</p> <h2><strong>When can we start to relax physical distancing?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Kim-Farley: </strong>We\u2019re going to have to have robust testing, so we truly know what is happening in the community \u2013 not just those who are getting [sick], but even what\u2019s happening silently. Once we think we have a good understanding of who is getting the disease, we could isolate those persons and their close contacts. Once we get to a point where we think we can contain the disease, then I think it would be the appropriate time to start taking off the physical distance controls.</p> <h2><strong>What do you say to people who think the cure \u2013 physical distancing and business closures \u2013 is worse than the disease?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Kim-Farley: </strong>We have to err on the side of protecting human life. So we should not rush back to business as usual, at the expense of a second wave. That indeed could be a tsunami that would endanger many more lives.</p> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>I tell them to go on the internet. Go look at the South African Olympic gold medalist swimmer [Cameron van der Burgh], who says he has never been hit as hard with something in his life. Look at the pictures of the young people on ventilators or who have already died as a result of this.</p> <p>You\u2019re playing the odds. Put it this way.

In 1974, while the nation went into stoic semi-denial about the IRA bombing campaign, I went into a trance of excitement about the bomb-disposal suspense thriller Juggernaut, which was showing at the Watford Odeon in the school holidays. The cinema had just been split into three screens: a big one upstairs in the former balcony, and two small screens downstairs created by partitioning the rear stalls. My memory is that I was in one of these boxy \u201cminis\u201d.</p> <p>Apparently inspired by a bomb hoax on the QE2 a couple of years previously \u2014 though I\u2019ve only just found that out now \u2014 Juggernaut was about a terrifying mega-bomb planted on a transatlantic ocean liner called the Britannic, sailing from Southampton to New York. The seas are too rough for the passengers to be taken off in lifeboats. The Irish-accented bomber (codenamed: Juggernaut) telephones the liner company boss with a surprisingly modest ransom demand for \u00a3500,000 (rather like Dr Evil naively requesting a \u201cmillion dollars\u201d.) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/28/guardianobituaries.arts\">Richard Harris</a> plays the scotch-swilling cavalier tough guy with the reckless courage and intuitive bomb-disabling ability who is parachuted to the ship with his team to do the business. David Hemmings is his loyal assistant.</p> <p>Juggernaut had a very good cast. Apart from Harris, there was Omar Sharif, who gave a diffident, slightly torpid performance as the ship\u2019s captain, having an ungallant affair with a beautiful passenger (Shirley Knight); Ian Holm is the company chief, Anthony Hopkins is the Scotland Yard cop whose wife and kids are aboard the Britannic; Roy Kinnear is the frantic entertainment director who at one point actually says \u201cHi-de-hi!\u201d. Roshan Seth is the Ugandan Asian steward who can switch accents to white-Brit when it is expedient. Veteran American character actor Clifton James (who was the glowering sheriff in the Bond films Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun) plays an American tourist. Cyril Cusack has an uncredited role as the defiantly uncooperative IRA veteran who is questioned by Hopkins in prison about who might be behind this. His questioning now looks very gentlemanly. The director is Richard Lester and the writer is Richard Alan Simmons who demanded to be credited as Richard DeKoker after a quarrel about the way his script was rewritten. (Again, I\u2019m finding out about this now.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I sat through it pop-eyed with my Kia-Ora and carton of Maltesers, before staggering out into Watford High Street</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I loved Juggernaut as a 12-year-old, though it didn\u2019t have the high gloss of big Hollywood disaster movies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/91823/poseidon-adventure\">The Poseidon Adventure</a>. And watching it again now, what strikes me is the awful weather: the cloudcover of this-is-not-America Britishness, which instantly signalled the fact that this is coming from Blighty not California. The Britannic is very different from the sleek digital hallucination of James Cameron\u2019s Titanic. It is a real ship: with unsightly rust marks on the hull where the anchor comes up. The scenes on board make it look like a ropey cross-Channel ferry. I sat through it pop-eyed with my Kia-Ora and carton of Maltesers, before staggering out into the bland weekday sunshine of Watford High Street, the world of Dolcis shoe shops and Clements department store, weirdly not much less glamorous than the Britannic, with its world of slightly depressed passengers making the best of things and not questioning authority. (Some years later, Linsday Anderson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/28/jonathancoe\">Britannia Hospital</a> was offered as a condition-of-Britain metaphor. Maybe we should have been thinking the same way about Lester\u2019s ocean liner Britannic.)</p> <p>So I sat down to this again, thinking that Juggernaut would just look hilariously awful. But no. Actually, it\u2019s a really tough, forthright, well-made action thriller which holds together tremendously well, and despite the creaky, groany moments \u2026 well \u2026 the big blue/red wire finale had me on the edge of my seat. Juggernaut now has an almost gritty social-realist look.</p> <p>And watching it now, something hit me like being whacked over the head with a frying pan. \u201cJuggernaut\u201d is Irish \u2014 BUT SO IS RICHARD HARRIS! CLANGGGG! Of course, Harris\u2019s character has to be Irish, at least subliminally (his own accent is subdued and he is a Royal Navy officer,) so that there is the all-important non-controversial political balance.</p> <p>Fans of 70s trivia and ephemera will love things like the kids playing on the rudimentary Pong computer game in the ship\u2019s lounge bar and the arcade-style pinball machines. (We 70s kids really did do a lot of playing on these games on holiday, or hanging around pennilessly looking at them.) And we get to see some vintage \u201cexecutive\u201d novelty desk toys that were all the rage in those days.</p> <p>There are, of course, also some dodgy attitudes, in throwaway \u201cfunny\u201d lines that have clearly been dubbed in post-production. As the Britannic departs, leaving the crowds behind on the quayside, we hear a campy voice: \u201cRight, Humphrey, my place or yours?\u201d Oo-er. Similarly, a south Asian deckhand dealing with a dog on board mutters: \u201cI\u2019ll have you in a bloody curry if you don\u2019t move.\u201d Yikes. Yet later, Seth\u2019s steward will tell Knight that he has endured racism in both Uganda and Britain and it is a \u201csad world for refugees\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd22ea0c551d024aeb417a7702fec757ceec3954\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd22ea0c551d024aeb417a7702fec757ceec3954/50_29_3064_1839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harris\u2019s team climbs on to the ship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sea it and believe it ...

Bloody mask!\u201d Again, it really did look like a real mishap. And the scenes showing the jumpers getting hauled aboard the ship from the sea are amazingly well done and genuinely gripping.</p> <p>Juggernaut feels more like an old-fashioned war movie than a disaster movie, and Harris\u2019s character is supposed to have learned his trade disabling Nazi bombs in the blitz. It\u2019s a period piece from both the 40s and 70s. Surprisingly entertaining and effective. And the message that things will be all right in the end due to the dedication and expertise of professionals \u2026 that is also acceptable.</p>",
  "<p>We all have that one show we turn to when we have scrolled through all of Netflix and found nothing else, when we need a brief window of distraction from life\u2019s stresses, or if we want a nostalgic reminder of another, simpler time.</p> <p>Now, in lockdown and with bags of time on our hands, it seems like the perfect moment to revisit those box sets and indulge in hours of rewatching, away from the ever-present tyranny of choice.</p> <p>We asked 10 writers to take us through their rewatches of choice, from the gripping drama (and culinary delights) of The Sopranos, to the fast-paced political intrigue of The West Wing, the romantic trials of New Girl and Gossip Girl, as well as the niche fascinations of Law and Order: SVU. Or, if you would rather not live in the TV screen of the past, one writer argues to stick with the endless stream of the new.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d6659f31384bc634eb46250f425d6796089db2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d6659f31384bc634eb46250f425d6796089db2e/0_163_3258_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sopranos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking care of business \u2026 The Sopranos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Sopranos</h2> <p>If the past is a foreign country, rewatching The Sopranos is like stepping into another universe entirely. The silken polo shirts and rattling gold bracelets, the flip-phones and leather-seated Sedans, the strippers and \u2013 above all \u2013 the sandwiches; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-chase\">David Chase</a>\u2019s late-90s epic on mobsters reckoning with their consciences is endlessly rewatchable. So much so that I am about to embark on my third viewing of the six-season, 86-episode odyssey of James Gandolfini\u2019s masterful Tony Soprano and the enduring chaos of his New Jersey family of mafiosos. While I might dip in and out of Friends for a comfort-rewatch, or turn to Bob\u2019s Burgers for an easy laugh, it is almost impossible to watch single episodes of The Sopranos; it is too granular and endlessly gripping. A tentative look back at a pivotal scene soon finds you four hours in, forgetting what happens next.</p> <p>And there are myriad narratives to follow: the evolution of Anthony Junior from chubby-cheeked tween to emotionally devastated young adult; Meadow\u2019s journey from daddy\u2019s girl to fierce independence; Uncle Junior\u2019s entire aesthetic; Livia\u2019s decrepitude; and Carmella\u2019s relationship rollercoaster, from loyalty to defiance to begrudging acceptance. Of course, holding it all together are the fantastic performances by Gandolfini \u2013 whose weight gain over the seasons starts to make his heavy breathing its own marker of dramatic foreboding \u2013 and Lorraine Bracco who plays his increasingly conflicted therapist Jennifer Melfi. Their therapy sessions are a masterclass in zippy dialogue and unspoken emotion, as close as we can get to riveting conversation in this time of social isolation.</p> <p>The show ultimately manages to strike that ineffable balance between escapism and emotional realism, lending it endless depth and rewatch potential. If nothing else, the food is worthy of a repeat view: pepper-stuffed sandwiches, cannelloni, heart-busting ice-cream sundaes; mouth-watering culinary inspiration for your quarantine. <strong>Ammar Kalia</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"269b5a5a1670064bed19061f883d6278fbae603f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/269b5a5a1670064bed19061f883d6278fbae603f/0_356_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gossip Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Made in Manhattan \u2026 Gossip Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Gossip Girl</h2> <p>Every few months, I like to imagine the decimal point of my bank account has shifted a few spots to the right and hang out with the hyper-privileged teens of New York City\u2019s Upper East Side. The Gossip Girl world is so spectacularly removed from mine \u2013 even were I not self-isolating \u2013 that watching it gives me the same rush I imagine sci-fi fans get from films about sentient spaceships and alien incubators. The show follows a group of beautiful, obscenely wealthy teenagers living in palatial penthouses and the \u201cpoor\u201d family that enters their orbit; ah yes, so poor are the Humphreys that they are confined to a loft in Brooklyn. <br><br>Their lives are so thrillingly interesting that an anonymous blogger, Gossip Girl, follows their every move by posting pap shots and salacious rumours. The plots sit somewhere between tabloid and high art: in one story arc, an 18-year-old billionaire trades his girlfriend for a hotel; in another, an incest storyline isn\u2019t even close to the weirdest thing in that series.</p> <p>Although things happen almost constantly, nothing ever really <em>changes,</em> which makes it perfect for unending rewatches. The script is overflowing with mixed metaphors and one character\u2019s entire personality is that they love to cook waffles. It should be terrible. It should be consigned to the forgotten annals of Netflix for ever. And yet, it is amazing. The melodrama of your teens magnified by about one million percent and sprinkled with limitless money? Who wouldn\u2019t want to watch that over and over again? <strong>Kate Solomon</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48db734262047934ed0f259b107e82c17e58e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48db734262047934ed0f259b107e82c17e58e22/0_102_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zooey Deschanel in New Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zooey Deschanel in New Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>New Girl</h2> <p>I have had the phrase: \u201cGave me cookie, got you cookie\u201d swirling on a loop in my head for three days. Buried among every terrible coronavirus-related pun I have come up with to distract myself from the most bizarre and eerie global situation in my lifetime, is the grouchy voice of New Girl\u2019s Nick Miller delivering this line. Startlingly, it has become a sort of meditative balm. Inhale \u2026 <em>gave me cookie; </em>exhale \u2026 <em>got you cookie.</em></p> <p>To say<em> </em>New Girl is my favourite show would be an understatement. I mark my life through New Girl rewatches and sometimes I lay in bed and genuinely wonder if Nick, the recalcitrant bartender turned YA author with questionable hygiene habits (I would definitely have got the \u2019Rona from him) is my ideal man. The seven-season sitcom starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/25/zooey-deschanel-interview\">Zooey Deschanel</a> as the titular character has its axis in friendship. Zooey\u2019s sweet, quirky Jess becomes a room-mate to three men with wildly different personalities (douchey Schmidt, grumpy Nick, unexplainable weirdo Winston), and along with her feisty best friend Cece, becomes enmeshed in ridiculous hijinks with them as they meld into a highly dysfunctional and incestuous family.</p> <p>The show is funny without losing its heart and sweet without becoming cloying. It has all the intimate tenderness of a dear friend roasting you before pulling you into a hug. I started watching New Girl while depressed in my final year in university and, eight years later, it remains a show I watch when I need laughter to alleviate the darkness of the world; to remind myself of joy and where it lies: within our connections.</p> <p>In season two, episode five, Schmidt buys Nick a cookie. He saw it and thought of him. The emotionally reticent Nick is uncomfortable with the display of tenderness and, throughout the episode, agonises over how to reciprocate. Eventually he settles on returning the favour, verbalising his affection the only way he knows how: like a Neanderthal. \u201cGave me cookie, got you cookie. You gave me cookie, got you cookie! Gave me cookie, got you cookie, man!\u201d In my language that means: \u201cI love you and I\u2019m here for you\u201d and I think that\u2019s beautiful. New Girl remains a reminder that hope and joy finds a home in love and its expression. <strong>Bolu Babalola</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"111b3dbd960ca81edb67b56cfbc44d5e1b8f93c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/111b3dbd960ca81edb67b56cfbc44d5e1b8f93c9/0_221_1992_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff and Rob Lowe West Wing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All the president\u2019s men \u2026 Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff and Rob Lowe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Shapiro/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The West Wing</h2> <p>From the moment that cheesy theme tune kicks in, I feel at home. Perhaps it is because I mainlined the series while suffering from extreme exam-related anxiety at university, but The West Wing will always be my happy place. Its depiction of late-90s Clintonian politics may seem increasingly dated, yet in the creation of a group of well-meaning, if flawed, politicos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a> solidified for many the way politics <em>should</em> be done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/obama-west-wing-tv-drama-bartlet-aaron-sorkin-martin-sheen-allison-janney\">We got Obama elected! West Wing stars relive the parties, pranks and power games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From Rob Lowe\u2019s puppyish Sam Seaborn, to the gruff but ultimately warm-hearted Toby Ziegler (a pitch-perfect role for Richard Schiff), every West Winger has something about them to love (except Mandy; nobody liked Mandy; she was swiftly disappeared at the end of season one). Watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7H_L5cYkg8\">Alison Janney\u2019s</a> bizarre performance of the Jackal never fails to bring a smile to my face \u2013 and there is a simple joy to those first four seasons of Sorkin dialogue at its best. The walk-and-talks are the stuff of legend, and the rapid-fire, flirty banter between Josh Lyman and his secretary Donna (this was of course pre-#MeToo) are reminiscent of the best black-and-white screwball comedies.</p> <p>There is even a quarantine lockdown episode \u2013 No Exit, in season five \u2013 but perhaps that\u2019s too close to home just now. Instead, I can revel in that opening episode as the word \u201cPotus\u201d rings around my head, or Martin Sheen\u2019s Latin excoriation of God in the season two finale, Two Cathedrals. I might be stuck inside, and Donald Trump might be terrorising the White House out there, but I can always depend on President Bartlet. <strong>Toby Moses</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de238ab4cf43254ddc4ba31f8efe4a74791392b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de238ab4cf43254ddc4ba31f8efe4a74791392b0/0_70_2097_1258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Capaldi Malcolm Tucker The Thick of It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coming unspun \u2026 Peter Capaldi\u2019s Malcolm Tucker tries to save his career in The Thick of It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Thick of It</h2> <p>Comfort television suggests something warm and swaddling, but one of my go-to watches when I need a shot-in-the-arm is the extended, penultimate episode of the final series of The Thick of It. It is an episode that mirrored and coincided with the real-life Leveson inquiry and its themes, but also brings to mind Chilcot.</p> <p>Laughing obviously makes one feel better and The Thick of It is hilarious, but it is not just that. Seeing intelligence, creative competence, incredible art \u2013 if that does not sound too pretentious \u2013 is also immensely cheering. Whether it is the brilliant lines we came to expect \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m just a lad from Leeds with a lust for life\u201d; \u201cIf you make eye contact with Malcolm Tucker, you have spilled his pint\u201d; \u201cHe was only homeless in the sense that he didn\u2019t have a home\u201d \u2013 seeing the regulars at the very top of their game, or the sublimely handled mix of tone, it is an hour of perfect television.</p> <p>Some insist that the early New Labour focus of TTOI was superior, but this episode does not merely induce pleasure in its one liners but in its depth and resolve; the quiet, oblivious truth-telling by the much put-upon Robyn, and the exquisite Peter Capaldi with his Rachel Dolezal-esque facial expression when everything comes crashing down. But his final bravura speech is arrow-accurate by the writers. These days it is hard not to shove one\u2019s fist into one\u2019s mouth every time someone on Twitter grabs a clip of modern-day politics and makes the same joke: \u201cMissed this episode of The Thick of It!!!!\u201d But even that cannot stop the boost this hour gives me. <strong>Hannah Jane Parkinson</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e85b6697cff04b596d47bacdbd801f48c929646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e85b6697cff04b596d47bacdbd801f48c929646/0_0_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tituss Burgess and Jane Krakowski in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tituss Burgess and Jane Krakowski in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Liebowitz/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</h2> <p>I very, very rarely rewatch drama; at least not without a very big gap in between. Comedy, however, I can and do watch and rewatch, virtually on a loop. It might be Silicon Valley, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Cheers, and for most of the 90s it was of course Friends (when it was not Will &amp; Grace); but most often these days it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt\">Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</a>, Tina Fey\u2019s first post-30 Rock venture and arguably her masterwork.</p> <p>It has everything that normally makes rewatching a comedy worthwhile, turned up to 11. The jokes are not just plentiful but fast and might be pulled from any genre at any moment. Daft puns, slapstick, callbacks, character jokes, topical gags, broadbrush generic or tiny little things that depend on a Spelunker-level knowledge of the nichest of niche pop-culture references. And then there\u2019s all of Tituss.</p> <p>The individual and ensemble playing is endlessly watchable, awe-inspiring and prompts an urge to dissect it, even as such a project will and should for ever elude you. Had you world enough (and time) could you ever teach anyone else to hit the beats like Jane Krakowski does so perfectly and seemingly effortlessly? And finally there is the sheer oddity of the thing. From the premise \u2013 30-year-old woman emerges into the world after 15 years held in a bunker by her kidnapper the Rev Richard Wayne Gary Wayne \u2013 to the collection of eclectic characters. But it does, harnessing a series of idiosyncrasies to a singular, ridiculous vision and going all in on it. Utter mastery. Utter joy. <strong>Lucy Mangan</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f2bbc6cb1c037054d543e0feb6848afcb489edf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f2bbc6cb1c037054d543e0feb6848afcb489edf/0_105_3150_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ice-T and Mariska Hargitay in Law & Order: SUV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ice-T and Mariska Hargitay in Law &amp; Order: SUV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks Photo/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Law and Order: SVU</h2> <p>You know you have watched a lot of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit when you can recite the opening narration (\u201cIn the criminal justice system, sexually based offences are considered especially heinous \u2026\u201d) with the same ease as an NYPD cop reading a perp his rights. And there is a lot of SVU to watch. There have been 21 seasons and nearly 500 episodes since 1999, when Law &amp; Order franchise supremo Dick Wolf first debuted this particularly moreish combo of police procedural and courtroom drama. The choicest rewatch cuts, however, are found between season two \u2013 when Munch (Homicide: Life on the Street transfer, Richard Belzer) was partnered with Tutuola (Ice-T) \u2013 and the season 12 departure of the lead detective, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni).</p> <p>Dogged devotion to TV formula is what Law &amp; Order does best, but those \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d plots also keep things fresh over repeated viewings, while squad room chats on issues such as consent and gender identity provide fascinating snapshots of changing social attitudes. Like the man says, these offences are \u201cespecially heinous\u201d, but there is something both cathartic and comforting about watching Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and her team put away all manner of unsavoury individuals.</p> <p>The abundance of available reruns also makes it enjoyably easy to forget which you have seen and which you have not. Do I instinctively know that the friendly-seeming schoolteacher is lying about his whereabouts because I half-remember how this one ends? Or has Law &amp; Order: SVU transformed me into a damn fine detective at last? <strong>Ellen E Jones</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4/0_136_1009_605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spaced Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson and Mark Heap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spaced cadets \u2026 Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson and Mark Heap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: E4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spaced</h2> <p>If you really put your mind to it, you can get through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/the-stars-of-spaced-reunited-21st-anniversary-simon-pegg-jessica-hynes-edgar-wright-nick-frost\">Spaced</a> in a single day, horsing through its two short seasons on DVD or <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/spaced\">All 4</a> in under seven hours.

There is so much that is new and worthy of our attention that going back to old, familiar ground often feels like a waste of time. There are a couple of exceptions, however, the greatest of which is Buffy, which has taken on a therapeutic role in my life.</p> <p>Many, many years ago, after a breakup, I measured the duration of my sadness by how long it took me to rewatch all seven seasons in their entirety. By the time Buffy was over, so was the heartbreak. Now, I dip in and out of my favourite episodes, but some \u2013 Hush, The Wish, The Body, Once More With Feeling, Who Are You? and Restless, to be precise \u2013 are frequently revisited. The sound of the theme music alone is the equivalent of a hot bath in mood lighting.</p> <p>There is something particularly soothing about its ultimate moral simplicity. People are flawed (and flayed), they make mistakes, and they learn how to be better. Buffy is the Chosen One, and she has to face her toughest challenges alone, but the biggest, most world-threatening villains require collective action. They need a whole graduation class\u2019s worth of students to destroy a big snakey mayor, the support of one\u2019s friends to combat a secret military base filled with monsters, a whole army of new slayers to battle the First. Now, more than ever, that feels like a message to take comfort from, from the comfort of indoors. <strong>Rebecca Nicholson</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The thought of rewatching fills me with dread\u2019</h2> <p>Rewatching TV shows, especially at a time of massive global crisis, sounds like a genuinely lovely idea that will doubtless bring a warm feeling of comfort and joy to many people\u2019s lives. Except, I won\u2019t be one of them. The thought of a repeat viewing with shows I love and which have serious rewatch potential \u2013 Arrested Development or The Office \u2013 fills me with dread. That is even true of rewatching a casual, noncommittal episode (something I only ever allow myself to do \u201cfor work\u201d).</p> <p>But outside of that: absolutely not. Never. Ever. The feeling of shame, of drowning in 10,000 other, newer shows begins to set in within milliseconds. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you finished Cheer yet?\u201d my brain says. What about Schitt\u2019s Creek? Sure, you don\u2019t know anyone who actually watches it and you have no idea what it\u2019s about, but people are always talking about it on Twitter aren\u2019t they? What about the new series of This Country, or Shrill, or literally anything else that you\u2019ve not already seen? And that\u2019s before you even get to the classics. What about Breaking Bad, that show you watched one series of and never thought about ever again? Maybe now\u2019s the time to get really, really into that like everyone else did 10 years ago. Or Game of Thrones: that was a bit of a big deal, maybe you ought to finish that one?</p> <p>The whole thing is just another source of anxiety, to be honest, which is a shame because I would love to watch The Office Christmas specials guilt-free. Just once, ideally this summer, while all my other plans are off. <strong>Hannah J Davies</strong></p>",

If they can bail the big banks out they can definitely bail small businesses out.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21389cf1001990c9f05b0d15046d6175e226efed\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21389cf1001990c9f05b0d15046d6175e226efed/5_0_630_378/500.jpg\" alt=\"Island Pops in Brooklyn.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Island Pops in Brooklyn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: supplied</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Small businesses are the anchor of the US economy and <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/2018-Small-Business-Profiles-US.pdf\">employed 58.9 million people in 2015</a>. Governments are introducing measures to help ease the burden of forced closures, but business owners are worried that help is coming too little too late as they see an immediate drop in business.</p> \n<p>Like countless other businesses, Island Pops is encouraging customers to buy gift cards to use after the crisis passes to try to stem immediate losses. Otherwise, their only other income stream is delivery and pickup orders.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven that won\u2019t take us through the month for our responsibilities,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe have staff, of course we have rent, we have insurance, we have everything that still needs to be paid and we\u2019ve gone through our emergency fund, which is our winter fund.\u201d</p> \n<p>As of Thursday morning, Marshall said it was unlikely the business could meet the minimum amount of pints it needs to sell each week. It has even become hard to rely on loyal customers, because they too are losing their jobs, or fearful a recession will limit their funds too.</p> \n<p>Marshall said her neighborhood, a gentrifying part of Brooklyn with a lively food and drink scene, has been a \u201cghost town\u201d this week. During one shift, she commiserated with an independent coffee shop owner, who told her at 2pm she was his fifth customer of the day, after opening at 6am.</p> \n<p>Patrick FitzGerald, a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton Business School, said while people might think the world is technology-focused, small businesses depend on in-person interactions.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reality is for 90% of small businesses, it\u2019s face-to-face, one-on-one, transactions,\u201d FitzGerald said. \u201cAnd at the moment, those have all, for the most part have stalled, so the impact is highly dramatic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Technological advances can help, however, and FitzGerald said for any business which has been toying with using video conferencing, at-home delivery or pre-purchasing: \u201cThe time is now to deploy those.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/coronavirus-dashboard-blog-size\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The federal and local governments are also trying to help. The US Small Business Administration (SBA) said it would provide businesses with up to $2m in low-interest loans to keep them afloat. And New York City is one of several local governments offering loan and grant programs to local businesses.</p> \n<p>Facebook pledged $100m in grants to impacted stores and restaurants, though the company said it would only start taking applications \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. Other corporations are also offering services to ease the burden on small businesses, but these efforts don\u2019t address the urgent need to replace the cashflow that comes from someone walking in the door.</p> \n<p>So small business are taking creative steps to sell amid a disease outbreak.</p> \n<p>Retailers big and small are promoting free and discounted shipping offers. Major chains and local grocery stores have instituted special hours for senior shoppers, who are more vulnerable to a severe coronavirus infection. Yoga studios and boxing gyms have moved classes online.</p> \n<p>Capitol Hill bookstore in Washington DC closed its store to walk-in customers, but offered <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chbooksdc/status/1239542089354002432\">private, one-hour appointments</a> for up to four would-be book buyers at a time.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to do everything in our power to continue our operations, and keep people employed and keep our business viable, at the same time we don\u2019t want to do anything to harm our employer or our customers, or the community at-large,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/817022011/browsing-alone-inside-historic-book-store-may-not-be-such-a-bad-thing\">co-owner Kyle Burk told NPR.</a></p> \n<p>These moves are being made even as restaurants and nightclubs are forced to sharply cut staff.</p> \n<p>Also in Washington DC, a \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1tz2uyhgy3MsBS68MHPzO8H455_879fqfIaRPyUUw3QE/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0\">virtual tip jar</a>\u201d was created to allow people to support service workers at local restaurants, hotels and nightclubs who were either laid off, not being paid temporarily or not receiving tips. Other businesses are turning to <a href=\"https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/03/coronavirus-restaurants-crowdfunding.html\">crowdfunding websites</a> to raise money for their former staff while still trying to keep their doors open.</p> \n<p>In New York City, <a href=\"https://www.trycaviar.com/m/frankies-457-spuntino-661\">the beloved Frankies Spuntino Group</a> is trying <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/frankies-spuntino-group-employee-fund\">to raise $100,000 for the employees</a> it has had to put out of work. \u201cWe\u2019re all navigating uncharted territory right now, so we cannot tell you how much we appreciate your consideration,\u201d wrote the co-owners, Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli.</p> \n<p>Before closing indefinitely on Friday, it expanded the pick-up and delivery menu. <a href=\"https://www.trycaviar.com/m/frankies-457-spuntino-661\">Its handmade pasta, pesto and marinara sauce</a> were sold to at-home chefs. The restaurant also sold martini and negroni kits \u2013 the byproduct of an emergency law change to help food businesses during the outbreak.</p> \n<p>Previously, only beer could be sold for take-out in New York, but the state liquor board <a href=\"https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/03/to-go-alcohol-sales-new-york.html?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Grub%20Street%20-%20March%2017%2C%202020&amp;utm_term=Subscription%20List%20-%20Grub%20Street%20%281%20Year%29\">relaxed its laws</a> to allow businesses with liquor licenses to sell liquor and wine to customers who also purchase food.</p> \n<p>The Brooklyn cocktail and dessert bar Butter &amp; Scotch had to lay off its entire staff on Monday before closing indefinitely on Thursday. In the few days between, the owner, Keavy Landreth, and the general manager, Stephanie Gallardo, who had been laid off, baked cookies and cakes for to-go orders. They also put together <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B91pzH0AgTq/\">cocktail kits</a> so people could emulate the sweet and boozy experience at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe kits were a last-ditch effort to get some more cash on hand to make sure we could pay our employees and selves before closing fully,\u201d Landreth said in an email. \u201cHad I known they were going to be such a hit I would have tried to make more but there was only so much we could do with two people. Hopefully this new alcohol to-go law sticks around and we can get these cocktail kits off the ground again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Island Pops\u2019 Marshall, who was inspired to start the business with her husband after craving the traditional Caribbean soursop ice-cream while sick with another virus, chikungunya, said small businesses are the \u201clifeblood of the economy\u201d and need all the help they can get.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe employ a significant amount of employees and we create a ton of employment,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t see that, it\u2019s a huge problem in the system.\u201d</p>",

  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to get my grandma a tablet for easy video calling. She is elderly and needs to self-isolate, and she is already quite isolated after the recent death of her husband. I am not sure which tablet or which program to use. She isn\u2019t very computer literate.</p> <p>This new Facebook thing looks good but I am sceptical of the brand. <strong>Chris</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Video calling used to be a futuristic topic. Today, it is readily available on most devices except, oddly enough, smart TVs. If anything, there\u2019s a plethora of services, and I haven\u2019t tried most of them. The options include Zoom, WhatsApp, Facebook, FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, Skype and many more. Zoom is a business service but it works well and is clearly flavour of the month, with <a href=\"https://learnbonds.com/news/zoom-downloads-increase-1270-from-employers-working-from-home/\">downloads up by 1,270%</a>. Fake backgrounds are one of its winning features.</p> <p>In this case, I recommend going with whatever you know best. You\u2019re probably going to have to do remote telephone support and the more familiar you are with a system, the easier that will be. If you can get the same equipment at both ends, even better. If you have to start from scratch, try it out with someone else and find the tricky bits before involving grandma.</p> <p>I can understand the appeal of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/18/facebook-portal-smart-display-mini-tv-launch-uk\">Facebook Portal</a> because it is designed for the job. The smart cameras and tracking are far better than you get in most home speaker-type devices. You can make video calls via WhatsApp as well as Facebook Messenger, and it has Amazon\u2019s Alexa built in. The drawbacks are that it involves using Facebook, it is expensive, and you are bound to have privacy concerns. (I assume grandma isn\u2019t using Facebook now as you\u2019d probably have tried Facebook Messenger as the most obvious option.)</p> <p>The version that could swing it for some people is <a href=\"https://portal.facebook.com/gb/products/portal-tv/\">Portal TV from Facebook</a> (<a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3280858\">\u00a3149</a>), which doesn\u2019t have a screen. It plugs into your TV set and works with its own small remote as well as its \u201cHey Portal\u201d voice control.</p> <p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/06/google-nest-hub-max-review-display-camera-facial-recognition\">Nest Hub Max</a> (<a href=\"https://store.google.com/gb/product/google_nest_hub_max\">\u00a3219</a>) is similar to the standalone Portal. It has a good 6.5 megapixel camera, a 10in screen and a voice-controlled Google Assistant, but it also comes with privacy concerns. They all do.</p> <h2><strong>Amazon\u2019s Echo Show</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbde5245d0bd0263f79c96863103cadbc9ff1c48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbde5245d0bd0263f79c96863103cadbc9ff1c48/472_691_3181_1909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon echo show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u2019s Echo Show comes in a variety of sizes, including with a 5in screen (front right) and with a 10in screen (back centre).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fortunately, there is an alternative that I can recommend and use myself: Amazon\u2019s Alexa-powered Echo Show. At least with Amazon I\u2019m a paying customer, whereas Google and Facebook make most of their money from surveillance-based advertising. I think it\u2019s the lesser of three evils, but the final choice is up to you.</p> <p>There are three Echo Show options with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/24/amazon-echo-show-5-review-smaller-cheaper-alexa-display\">5in</a> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07KD7TJD6\">\u00a379.99</a>), 8in (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07SMN7FYZ\">\u00a399.99</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/15/amazon-echo-show-2nd-gen-review-alexa-speaker\">10in</a> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07H3ZRTT5\">\u00a3198.99</a>) screens. Bigger screens are better, but the 8in version is the best value for money and, in my experience, the 5in model works well enough.</p> <p>You set up an Alexa Show from a smartphone app and give it access to your contacts list. After that you will be able to make calls by saying \u201cAlexa, call grandma\u201d. Alexa can also call most numbers that are not in your contacts list if you spell them out (\u201cAlexa, call 0 2 0 8\u2026).</p> <p>Alexa performs many other useful functions, too. These include weather reports, playing radio stations or individual songs (if available), doing conversions (\u201cAlexa, what\u2019s 37 degrees in Fahrenheit?\u201d), answering general knowledge questions (though not nearly as well as Google Assistant), telling Dad jokes, and playing simple games. You can easily provide grandma with a list of things to say, and Amazon will email you suggestions on a regular basis.</p> <p>Alexa can read books and stories, including books from an Amazon Audible account. She can also control other home devices, such as lights, if you have any that are compatible. If you have an Amazon Prime account, an Alexa Show can play Amazon Prime videos.</p> <p>Finally, Alexa devices \u2013 like Portals and Nest Hubs \u2013 are always plugged into the mains, so grandma never has to think about recharging them.</p> <h2><strong>Fire HD</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f34b04a75d086b813498317b031e6f213ad30fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f34b04a75d086b813498317b031e6f213ad30fd/423_540_4083_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon fire hd 10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new Fire HD 10, released late 2019, is excellent for \u00a3149.99 but there are significantly cheaper versions available if price is an issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you decide to buy a tablet instead, an Amazon Fire HD is a good choice for your purposes, and the best value for money. There are two HD models with 8in (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-Tablet-Black-Special-Offers/dp/B0794ZL74C\">\u00a379.99</a>) and 10in (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07KD63BQ5\">\u00a3149.99</a>) screens, and a non-HD model with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/23/amazon-fire-7-tablet-review-still-a-lot-of-tablet-for-just-50\">7in screen</a> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07JQRYR5M\">\u00a349.99</a>). The 8in version is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/27/amazon-fire-hd-8-review-easily-the-best-tablet-you-can-buy-for-80\">easily the best tablet you can buy for \u00a380</a>\u201d, but I think it\u2019s worth paying more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/10/amazon-fire-hd-10-review-top-budget-tablet\">for the 10in model</a>. This has a faster processor, a sharper 1920 x 1200-pixel screen, twice as much storage, better battery life (up to 12 hours) and a USB-C port. I\u2019d also pay the extra \u00a310 to remove the Amazon promotions.</p> <p>Fire HD tablets have Alexa, so grandma would be able to use the same video calling system as with an Alexa Show. The drawbacks are that it\u2019s not as convenient as an always-on Alexa, will need charging often, and has comparatively poor speakers.</p> <p>A 5in Alexa Show works well as a bedside clock-radio alarm, and the larger versions work well as kitchen radios. With a Fire HD, you\u2019d need to add an accessory stand and an external speaker. (Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07RTDCBMS\">custom case</a> will prop it up for \u00a339.99, but I\u2019d rather have the old <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-New-Show-Mode-Charging-Generation/dp/B07DK4R2QW\">Show Mode Charging Dock</a>, which converted a Fire HD 10 into an Echo Show. See below\u2026)</p> <p>The Fire HD also has the advantage of providing tablet apps, so grandma could do her emails, browse Facebook, play games and other things. There are plenty of casual games suitable for seniors, and it\u2019s not too late for her to become addicted to Candy Crush or Bejeweled. You could also play Words With Friends with her.</p> <p>Technically, Amazon\u2019s Fire OS is a fork of Android, but it has more than enough apps and games. The apps include <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zoom-Video-Communications-Inc-Meetings/dp/B00B5L5JRM\">Zoom Cloud Meetings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Facebook-Messenger/dp/B00KZ6WRAA\">Facebook Messenger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Skype-Software-S-a-r-l-Kindle-Edition/dp/B008M721MS\">Skype</a>.</p> <h2><strong>FaceTime</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0056c2faf6d5e76f92629adb7db9d0a03c5679fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0056c2faf6d5e76f92629adb7db9d0a03c5679fb/154_86_2084_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple ipads\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple\u2019s iPads come in a variety of sizes and prices, all of which are capable of FaceTime video calls to other iPads, Macs and iPhones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple\u2019s FaceTime is a great way to make video calls. Its major drawback is that it only runs on Apple kit. If you had an iPhone or an iPad, then I expect you\u2019d already have decided to buy grandma an iPad. If I\u2019m wrong and you are an Apple user, you can buy an iPad with a 10.2in screen for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-10.2/\">\u00a3349</a>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, if you have to buy new iPads for both ends, then approximately \u00a3700 is not a cheap solution compared with roughly \u00a3200 for two Echo Shows, or one Echo Show and your current smartphone.</p> <p>Of course, iPads can do thousands of things besides making video calls, and grandma would find many of them useful or entertaining. If grandma didn\u2019t want to use FaceTime for some reason, iPads support many other video calling systems, including <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/zoom-cloud-meetings/id546505307\">Zoom Cloud Meetings</a>. They also have more and better apps than Android and Amazon tablets.</p> <h2><strong>Android tablets</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae1b22173d2b176284ddfa32ccfa4ac4b63f6659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae1b22173d2b176284ddfa32ccfa4ac4b63f6659/0_0_4543_2726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab A10 has a 10.1in screen for under \u00a3200.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab A10 has a 10.1in screen for under \u00a3200.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samsung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are a zillion Android tablets, and you can save a lot of money by buying \u201coff brand\u201d products. Nevertheless, I\u2019d go for a mainstream Samsung Galaxy Tab, one of the Huawei MediaPad range, or a Lenovo SmartTab. From what I\u2019ve seen \u2013 which isn\u2019t all of them \u2013 they are well made and they have good quality screens at reasonable prices.</p> <p>A geek could spend a long time pondering the selfie camera resolution, processor speed, storage and so on. I don\u2019t expect any of those will matter much for grandma\u2019s purposes. Just decide how much you want to spend and pick the best you can get.</p> <p>From the Samsung range, I\u2019d look at the 10.1in <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8843252\">Galaxy Tab A10</a> with Android 9 (Pie) for around \u00a3199 or less.</p> <p>From the Huawei range, I\u2019d go for a <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/search/huawei-mediapad-m5/?clickOrigin=searchbar:search:term:huawei+mediapad+m5\">MediaPad M5 lite</a> rather than a T5, because these have USB-C ports instead of microUSB. I couldn\u2019t find a 10in M5 with Android 9 instead of 8 (Oreo), though you could live with that or get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Huawei-MediaPad-Lite-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B07T9M2LGK\">an 8in model</a> instead.</p> <p>Lenovo offers a 10.1in SmartTab tablet that \u201ctransforms to an Alexa-enabled Smart Screen when docked\u201d. The dock provides the stand and extra speakers for an all-in price of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-SmartTab-10-1-Inch-Tablet/dp/B07MFHLZ3B\">\u00a3149</a> (M10) or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-SmartTab-10-1-Inch-Tablet/dp/B07VX8RXWV\">\u00a3220</a> (P10).

  "<p>Those injured or bereaved in the Christchurch attacks on 15 March only found out about the court hearing when their phones started buzzing with calls and messages after it had finished. They felt joy, relief, and utter shock.</p> <p>\u201cIt was completely out of the blue,\u201d says Aya Al-Umari, 34, whose brother Hussein Al-Umari, then 35, was killed at Al Noor mosque last year.

Plagiarism and copyright infringement \u201care related but they are distinctly different\u201d, says Peter Oxendale, who has been a professional forensic musicologist \u2013 someone who offers expert analysis of compositions for legal purposes \u2013 for more than 40 years.</p> <p>\u201cCopyright, for example, does not protect \u2018ideas\u2019 but rather the fixed \u2018detailed expression\u2019 of those ideas. Copyright infringement is a legal matter known as a tort,\u201d he says. \u201cPlagiarism, on the other hand, is an ethical matter and occurs when someone uses the ideas or works of someone else in their own work without giving the appropriate credit to the original source.\u201d The cases that come to court are not about plagiarism; they\u2019re about infringement of copyright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68b075581fa374a824616a651f534ea024d8869f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b075581fa374a824616a651f534ea024d8869f/0_108_3537_2122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of Led Zeppelin pictured in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of Led Zeppelin pictured in 1970.

In December 2018 the long-running and highly controversial case involving the song Blurred Lines came to a close, when Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, two of the song\u2019s writers, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/blurred-lines-pharrell-robin-thicke-copied-marvin-gaye\">ordered to pay</a> just short of $5m to the estate of Marvin Gaye, for Blurred Lines\u2019 similarity to Gaye\u2019s 1977 song Got To Give It Up. </p> <p>\u201cBlurred Lines certainly stirred up the music community,\u201d says Joe Bennett, a forensic musicologist based at Berklee College of Music, in Boston. \u201cThe reason it had so many musicians concerned is that the two songs are demonstrably different in their melodies, lyrics, and underlying chords. It hasn\u2019t set a legal precedent exactly, because every plagiarism case is judged on its individual merits, and every comparison is different, but it certainly has shifted the culture among songwriters, and made many worried about unintentional similarity leading to unfair accusations of copyright infringement.\u201d</p> <p>What the Blurred Lines case did was to allow something previously unheard of: the notion that the \u201cfeel\u201d of a record could be copyrighted. Given that the musician who didn\u2019t want to replicate the feel of a beloved record, if not its chords and melody, has yet to be born, the verdict sent shudders through the industry.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of the feel of a song is created by instrumentation, production techniques and other elements that many people consider to not be part of the \u2018song\u2019 itself,\u201d says Peter Mason, a music law expert at the solicitors Wiggin LLP. \u201cThe difference is starkly demonstrated by comparing Blurred Lines to the Stairway to Heaven case, in which the jury was limited to considering only the notes of the composition, as registered at the US copyright office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6e932072cc4d19397979023103ac10546429b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6e932072cc4d19397979023103ac10546429b3/0_71_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams performing at Miami Beach, Florida, in 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams performing at Miami Beach, Florida, in 2013.

Importantly, much of what remained was commonplace and therefore not protected by copyright.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, says Oxendale, \u201cWe are aware of a number of well-known clients who have been told to never cite the source of their inspiration in public or in print. This, in my view, has resulted in the stifling of creativity to the extent that inspiration is now being confused with appropriation.</p> <p>\u201cConversely, we are also seeing a growing number of instructions from clients who wish to pursue claims for infringement of copyright based on the use of nothing more than similar musical or lyrical \u2018ideas\u2019. I believe the Blurred Lines verdict has had a significant impact on the music industry as a whole and this is reflected in the number of cases coming into our office.\u201d</p> <p>For all the high-profile court cases, though, many music copyright infringement claims never see the light of day. One major star \u2013 who must remain nameless \u2013 employed a musicologist for the specific purpose of listening to new releases in order to note any resemblance to their own works. The writer of any offending song received a polite note expressing the desire to avoid any embarrassment, and suggesting the whole matter might be resolved by a payment, without the need to shame the writer by going public or forcing a change to the songwriting credits.</p> <p>Since the Blurred Lines case, notes Mason, other songwriters have pre-empted litigation by adding writers who might conceivably have had a claim to writing credits \u2013 famously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/22/mark-ronson-i-was-floundering-i-was-drinking-too-much-and-giving-orders\">Mark Ronson</a>\u2019s worldwide hit Uptown Funk ended up with 11 writers. \u201cThe average number of writers on hit songs has increased dramatically over the last five years or so,\u201d Mason says, \u201cand part of this is due to composers agreeing to add the authors of past songs that are somewhat similar.\u201d</p> <p>Why, though, do all the best-known copyright infringement cases come from the worlds of pop and rock? After all, one rarely hears of classical composers fighting it out in court, or jazz players arguing furiously about whether one has ripped off the other\u2019s saxophone solo.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are two reasons,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cFirst, popular song is a constrained art form, with a palette of statistically predictable phrase lengths, song forms, scale and chord choices, lyric tropes and song durations. These norms are largely defined by market forces, through massed listener preferences over time affecting the kind of creative decisions that songwriters are likely to make.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb06cf933fae054cb666e7399f519eee48980001\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb06cf933fae054cb666e7399f519eee48980001/0_231_3932_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonce presesnting the award for the Record of the Year, Uptown Funk, to Mark Ronson during the 2016 Grammy music awards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyonc\u00e9 presesnting the award for record of the year, Uptown Funk, to Mark Ronson during the 2016 Grammy music awards.

A plagiarism lawsuit is a financial matter \u2013 party A is pursuing party B for compensation, so there\u2019s little point in going after someone whose work has not generated significant income.\u201d</p> <p>You might think, of course, that musicians and songwriters are pinching from each other all the time \u2013 we\u2019ve all listened to songs and been reminded of something else. There are some artists, in fact, who seem to have made careers out of sounding like someone else: neither ELO nor Oasis would deny their respective debts to the Beatles.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, musicians don\u2019t even realise they are borrowing. On a recent edition of the Reply All podcast, Prince\u2019s longtime recording engineer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/princes-sound-engineer-susan-rogers-he-needed-to-be-the-alpha-male-to-get-things-done\">Susan Rogers</a> remembered him sitting at the piano and picking out a melody. He liked it, he noted. But had it already been written?</p> <p>Subconscious recollection is called cyrptomnesia, and it has been responsible for some notable copyright infringements: in the 1976 case where George Harrison was sued for the similarity of My Sweet Lord to the Chiffons\u2019 He\u2019s So Fine, the judge described the similarity as an example of unconscious copying. Sam Smith\u2019s Stay With Me ended up getting Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne added to its writing credits, because of its similarity to their song Won\u2019t Back Down, and Petty observed, without rancour: \u201cAll my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by.\u201d</p> <p>As Bennett puts it: \u201cMost melodic similarity is coincidental, and most accusations of melodic plagiarism are unfounded. In the rare cases when the similarity is so striking that it appears to be evidence of plagiarism, then yes \u2013 it\u2019s usually unintentional. Songwriters have almost zero incentive to copy melodies verbatim, and enormous economic disincentives to do so.\u201d</p> <p>The miracle, perhaps, is not that there are so many accusations of musical copyright infringement, but so few. Consider that thereare just 12 semitones in an octave. Or think about how many songs that derive from the blues use the 1-4-5 chord progression (Twist and Shout; Blitzkrieg Bop; Louie Louie and Wild Thing \u2013 and thousands more). What makes a song special is not its chords, or its top-line melody, or its lyrics, or its feel. It is how it combines all those elements.</p> <p>\u201cListeners don\u2019t hear songs as simple linear sequences of pitches \u2013 they hear everything all at once, and it\u2019s that combination of elements, in a recording or at a live show, that produces the powerful emotional response that we find so intoxicating,\u201d Joe Bennett says. \u201cIf the cultural value of a song subsisted only in its melody, the world wouldn\u2019t need performers, lyricists, producers, or artists.\u201d</p> <p>And, as everyone sitting in their living room gazing at the empty world outside knows, the word really does need all those people, for the sake of its sanity.</p>",

So I think in the long term there is going to be a conflict between the competing demands of public health and the climate.\u201d</p> <p>Sennett believes that in the future there will be a renewed focus on finding design solutions for individual buildings and wider neighbourhoods that enable people to socialise without being packed \u201csardine-like\u201d into compressed restaurants, bars and clubs \u2013 although, given the incredibly high cost of land in big cities like New York and Hong Kong, success here may depend on significant economic reforms as well.</p> <p>In recent years, although cities in the global south are continuing to grow as a result of inward rural migration, northern cities are trending in the opposite direction, with more affluent residents taking advantage of remote working capabilities and moving to smaller towns and countryside settlements offering cheaper property and a higher quality of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c24ab446e24c61d3dffc758490bcfb0dc1437d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c24ab446e24c61d3dffc758490bcfb0dc1437d8d/0_0_5464_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of a housing estate in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial photograph of a housing estate in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dale de la Rey/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/spatial-economics-the-declining-cost-of-distance/\">declining cost of distance</a>\u201d, as Karen Harris, the managing director of Bain consultancy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/macro-trends/\">Macro Trends Group</a>, calls it, is likely to accelerate as a result of the coronavirus crisis. More companies are establishing systems that enable staff to work from home, and more workers are getting accustomed to it. \u201cThese are habits that are likely to persist,\u201d Harris says.</p> <p>The implications for big cities are immense. If proximity to one\u2019s job is no longer a significant factor in deciding where to live, for example, then the appeal of the suburbs wanes; we could be heading towards a world in which existing city centres and far-flung \u201cnew villages\u201d rise in prominence, while traditional commuter belts fade away.</p> <p>Another potential impact of coronavirus may be an intensification of digital infrastructure in our cities. South Korea, one of the countries worst-affected by the disease, has also posted some of the lowest mortality rates, an achievement that can be traced in part to a series of <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-throws-up-innovative-tech-solutions-in-coronavirus-fight\">technological innovations</a> \u2013 including, controversially, the mapping and publication of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-south-korea-tracking-apps/2020/03/13/2bed568e-5fac-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html\">infected patients\u2019 movements</a>.</p> <p>In China, authorities have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-qr-code/china-seeks-help-of-national-tech-giants-to-track-coronavirus-with-qr-codes-idUSKBN20B10T\">enlisted the help of tech </a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-qr-code/china-seeks-help-of-national-tech-giants-to-track-coronavirus-with-qr-codes-idUSKBN20B10T\">firms</a> such as Alibaba and Tencent to track the spread of Covid-19 and are using \u201cbig data\u201d analysis to anticipate where transmission clusters will emerge next.

Whether such groups survive beyond the end of coronavirus to have a meaningful impact on our urban future depends, in part, on what sort of political lessons we learn from the crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74a04613f744b981622ad3ab66151b5129f8fe1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a04613f744b981622ad3ab66151b5129f8fe1d/0_0_3446_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents select items on a community table filled with groceries for those in need, in Derry, New Hampshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents select items on a community table filled with groceries for those in need, in Derry, New Hampshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Krupa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vulnerability of many fellow city dwellers \u2013 not just because of a temporary medical emergency but as an ongoing lived reality \u2013 has been thrown into sharp relief, from <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-news-social-care-elderly-councils-homes-a9390466.html\">elderly people lacking sufficient social care</a> to the low-paid and self-employed who have no financial buffer to fall back on, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/15/business/economy/coronavirus-worker-risk.html\">upon whose work we all rely</a>.</p> <p>A stronger sense of society as a collective whole, rather than an agglomeration of fragmented individuals, could lead to a long-term increase in public demands for more interventionist measures to protect citizens \u2013 a development that governments may find harder to resist given their readiness in the midst of coronavirus to override the primacy of markets.</p> <p>Private hospitals are already <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/campaign/requisition-private-hospital-beds-help-nhs-coronavirus\">facing pressure</a> to open up their beds without extra charge for those in need; in Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://2020-03-18/homeless-occupy-more-vacant-homes-coronavirus-pandemic-los-angeles\">homeless citizens have seized vacant homes</a>, drawing support from some lawmakers.

She joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2001 and her and Tina Fey, who played the Sarah Palin to her Hillary Clinton, became the first female duo to flank the famous Weekend Update of the show. Then came Parks &amp; Recreation, a workplace comedy that became so popular it was able to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/fashion/weddings/galentines-day-is-everywhere-heres-why.html\">whole new holiday, called Galentines\u2019 Day</a>, into the calendar on 14 February.</p> <p>Poehler is holed up at home in Los Angeles when I call. \u201cOne must try to be a good citizen at this time,\u201d she says, Knope-ishly.

This woman stood up in a town hall meeting and said: \u2018My children are getting out of school in two weeks. What am I supposed to do with them, keep them in my house where I live?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an episode where everybody in town gets the flu and I was thinking: \u2018Oh boy, this is a little close to home.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Parks &amp; Rec ended in 2015, which left Poehler free to write, direct and produce, as well as act. She has several projects on the go: Moxie, the YA adaptation she directed for Netflix; the second season of the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/11/best-tv-shows-2019-no-7-russian-doll\">Russian Doll</a>, which she co-created but which is now on hold (\u201cSeason two is written and ready and we\u2019re so excited to get started shooting that\u201d). Should the ceremony go ahead, she and Fey will return to host the Golden Globes in January. We are here to talk about Duncanville, the new animated series Poehler created with The Simpsons\u2019 writers Mike Scully and Julie Thacker Scully, about the life of Duncan, a very average 15-year-old boy.</p> <p>\u201cThere is so much pressure on kids to be very special,\u201d Poehler explains. \u201cMike and I were always laughing about it. We are Gen X-ers; when we were growing up, no one told you you were special.\u201d How easy was it to get inside the head of a teenage boy? \u201cShockingly easy,\u201d she laughs. \u201cEverything is very exasperating at that age, because you have very little control, but there\u2019s a lot of people that are asking you what do you want to do with your life \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of pressure to do the right thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b40e30625dc20bc9b62e50c66b70a0e51857906\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b40e30625dc20bc9b62e50c66b70a0e51857906/0_0_3600_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duncanville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Duncanville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is new territory for Poehler to be voicing a teenage boy. \u201cI am such a fan of the iconic female voices voicing young boys, whether it be Nancy Cartwright doing Bart, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/14/pamela-adlon-better-things-is-about-hope-and-love-amid-the-darkness\">Pamela Adlon in King of the Hill</a>,\u201d she says. The show is not only about Duncan \u2013 it also touches on his relationships with his dad (voiced by Modern Family\u2019s Ty Burrell), his sister, his cool-girl crush, Mia (played by Parks and Rec alumni Rashida Jones), and his mother, Annie.</p> <p>Poehler also plays Annie, which means she often has to deliver both sides of a disagreement. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to play Duncan and his mom arguing with each other. [Although] maybe to people watching it, it\u2019s unsettling?\u201d she laughs. She feels like both characters in equal measure. \u201cI relate to the 15-year-old in me and and everyone who just wants to lie down in the mall while their parents go shopping for boring stuff, and I also really relate to Annie, because she\u2019s afraid of a lot of things, she\u2019s afraid for Duncan, she\u2019s trying to get him motivated.\u201d</p> <p>When it came to casting Mia, Poehler says she only wanted Jones. \u201cWith a lot of my friends, the only time I get to see them as I work with them.\u201d</p> <p>Poehler and Jones still celebrate Galentines\u2019 Day \u2013 the platonic celebration of female friendship made popular by their characters in Parks &amp; Rec. This year, they met up with Parks &amp; Rec castmates Aubrey Plaza and Kathryn Hahn. Poehler won\u2019t take credit for the term \u2013 Michael Schur wrote the episode it appears in \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s awesome to add another fake holiday to the fake holiday canon, and I personally think it\u2019s much more fun than Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d.</p> <p>Given that so many people seem to be turning to Parks &amp; Rec for comfort, is there anything that Poehler herself is finding solace in? </p> <p>Old British comedy, it turns out. \u201cYou know the old Julia Davis, Rob Brydon one, where they play all those couples?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">Human Remains? \u201cOh my God, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">so funny!</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">\u201d</a> It can feel strange talking about television at a time like this, but, as Poehler says, comedy is \u201ca very wonderful connector and distractor \u2026 Let me just put it this way, these characters don\u2019t know that a pandemic is going on,\u201d she says. Our time is up, so she says goodbye, still laughing at the thought of Brydon and Davis. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go back and watch it again right now.\u201d</p> <p><em>Duncanville airs on Channel 4 from 27 March</em></p>",

The powerful wind shapes the weather and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere. It was sent off course \u2013 tracking southwards and disrupting weather patterns \u2013 by depletion of the ozone layer due to manmade chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The chemicals, found in fridges, aerosols and industrial processes, were phased out from 1987 under the UN Montreal protocol. The jet stream has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/global-efforts-on-ozone-help-reverse-southern-jet-stream-damage\">stopped moving south</a> and the \u201chole in the ozone layer\u201d has shrunk to its smallest size since 1982. Alexey Karpechko, a reviewer of the study, said: \u201cThis is good news, definitely. It shows our actions can stop climate change.

  "<p>It begins like any other daring escape mission: a packed bag, a methodical plan gone slightly awry, split-second brushes with danger, a narrowly avoided exposure. But Esther Shapiro, portrayed by Shira Haas in the lead role of Netflix\u2019s new miniseries Unorthodox, is neither secret agent nor jailbird. She\u2019s a Hasidic Jew in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, and she\u2019s making a break for Berlin. If she\u2019s fleeing a prison, she\u2019s only doing so in the most strictly metaphorical sense. For the past year, Esther has been suffocating in a loveless arranged marriage and, at age 19, she wants a second chance while she\u2019s still got her youth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/25/incredible-story-of-netflix-feelgood-crip-camp-it-blew-my-mind\">'It blew my mind': the incredible story of Netflix's feelgood Crip Camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It sounds like ready-made human drama, but Deborah Feldman really lived it. She detailed her time in New York, her risky departure from the <em>derech</em> (a Hebrew word meaning \u201cpath\u201d), and her personal reinvention in Germany with the memoir Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots in 2012. A teenage mother, she severed ties with her husband as well as the repressive patriarchy he came to represent, and eventually took advantage of the German citizenship afforded by her great-grandfather to settle in Berlin. She enrolled her son in the local school system, and that\u2019s how she came to meet Anna Winger.</p> <p>Like her, Winger was raising a child after coming to Berlin from faraway places. Winger had spent her youth hopping between Massachusetts, Mexico and Kenya with her anthropologist parents, ultimately finding a home on the same terms as Feldman.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d talked a lot about the experience of being Jewish in Germany, and how there are common themes throughout,\u201d Winger tells the Guardian over the phone from her home in Berlin, as a youngster\u2019s voice eagerly anticipates afternoon bagels in the background. \u201cDislocation, a reason for coming, grappling with history, the metropolitan New York-ness of Berlin. There was a lot of common ground we\u2019d found in normal conversation. The show, in a funny way, became our way to build out from those talks.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zVhRId0BTw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-zVhRId0BTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Winger had created Deutschland 83, a hit TV series tracking the movements of an East German spy on the western side of the wall during the cold war era, and she recognized potential for a new project in Feldman\u2019s extraordinary journey. \u201cAs someone who\u2019s an outsider, my whole body of work in TV speaks to Berlin\u2019s history and identity in one way or another,\u201d Winger says. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here now for 17 years, and I think that one of the things that makes the city really striking is how layers of history exist simultaneously. My other show takes place in divided Berlin, with a spy going from East to West. We also have two worlds in Unorthodox, with a specific vision of both Berlin and New York.\u201d</p> <p>A considerably greater distance separates the Jewish enclave of Brooklyn from Esther\u2019s refuge across the Atlantic, and Winger (along with co-creator Alexa Karolinski and series director Maria Schrader) required some artistic license to traverse it. The real Feldman remained in New York for some time after going OTD \u2013 that\u2019s \u201coff the <em>derech\u201d</em> \u2013 while her avatar Esther hightails it directly out of America. For the sake of an arc-based narrative, Esther gains a musical motivation, pursuing acceptance to an elite orchestral and choral program. \u201cThere\u2019s a real music academy called the Barenboim-Said Akademie where Jews and Muslims play classical music together, like a whole utopia,\u201d Winger explains. \u201cWe were inspired by this idea, as the sort of institution that could only begin in Berlin.\u201d</p> <p>Feldman\u2019s story had everything except a villain, so Winger shifted a portion of the four episodes\u2019 perspective to Esther\u2019s husband Yanky (Amit Rahav). Because he\u2019s a real schlemiel (a Yiddish term referring approximately to the kind of guy who\u2019s always spilling his soup) and intermittently sympathetic, Winger invented the harsher Moishe (Jeff Wilbusch) as a partner on the trip to retrieve Esther. His presence implicitly tacks a \u201cby force, if necessary\u201d on to the previous sentence. \u201cDeborah gave us a lot of creative freedom,\u201d Winger says, \u201cbut she was also excited about us coming up with something that speaks to present-day Berlin, which doesn\u2019t appear in the book.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c245c4caffb8bc71b702f68e5745d8012c8c8dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c245c4caffb8bc71b702f68e5745d8012c8c8dc/0_0_3600_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shira Haas stars as Esther Shapiro in Unorthodox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shira Haas stars as Esther Shapiro in Unorthodox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anika Molnar/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city, a meeting point of the past and future for modern Jewry, emerged as the linchpin of the show\u2019s conflicted perspective on religious identity. The memory of the Holocaust has a more palpable presence there than in any American city, but Esther\u2019s multicultural group of new friends take more interest in clubbing than visiting memorials to genocide. She\u2019s likewise torn between independence and reverence, rejecting the strictures of her Satmar sect even as she maintains a deeper, broader relationship to the Jewish faith. Her connection to Judaism forms an integral part of her notion of self, and she\u2019s defensive of something most outsiders can\u2019t understand. For Winger, gaining insight on the insular and exclusive world of Hasidim was a must.</p> <p>\u201cThe first person we hired was this incredible guy, Eli Rosen, who was our Yiddish translator and cultural consultant,\u201d Winger recalls. \u201cHe was a cantor before he left the community, and we had him on set every day working with the actors and the language. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s Yiddish \u2013 it\u2019s that there are 13 or 14 different kinds of Yiddish, and we needed everyone speaking the right dialect, which is a Hungarian Yiddish mixed with some English. It\u2019s a very particular patois that they speak in Brooklyn, sometimes just from neighborhood to neighborhood. You might say something a bit differently in Borough Park than you would in Williamsburg. Hyper-localized.\u201d</p> <p>She also tapped actors from New Yiddish Rep, a New York theatre company with a healthy membership of OTD twentysomethings and thirtysomethings. \u201cWe met people, went to homes, and learned about their individual journeys,\u201d Winger continues. \u201cJewish culture is almost like a spectrum from orthodox observance to secularism, but there\u2019s always more uniting us than dividing us. If anything, that should be the message of the show.\u201d</p> <p>These collaborators provided a way into the Yiddish tongue; like many present-day Jews in the west, Winger heard her grandparents use the occasional slang but never learned it herself. (Mastering German, English and Spanish kept her plenty busy.) The language now stands as a link to a rich vein of heritage that must be consciously maintained in order to survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6b75886de5ace1e4e3fe26c2be9c8bf11ef8d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6b75886de5ace1e4e3fe26c2be9c8bf11ef8d6e/0_0_3600_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Shapiro escapes her loveless marriage for Berlin in the Netflix series Unorthodox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esther Shapiro escapes her loveless marriage for Berlin in the Netflix series Unorthodox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anika Molnar/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDoing this in Yiddish was part of the project from the beginning,\u201d Winger says. It was the language of literature and theatre. It\u2019s been preserved by the religious community, and the Hasidim are the only ones that speak it on a daily basis. There were about 10 different people involved with this project that came from the community, in one way or another \u2026 We thought it was important that everyone playing the Hasidic characters actually be Jewish, because we wanted the audience to have a familiarity with the language by the time they\u2019ve seen the episodes, even if it\u2019s just an emotional familiarity.\u201d</p> <p>Unorthodox joins the Israeli series Shtisel in Netflix\u2019s limited library of Yiddish-language programming, but they both fit into a wider trend of forwardly Jewish programming on the small screen over the past few years. Esther\u2019s uphill battle to obtain a divorce mirrors that of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel\u2019s heroine Midge as she splits from her husband, while elsewhere, the Nazi-killers of Hunters get kosher revenge. The Plot Against America tackles antisemitism head-on every Sunday night at HBO, and back in 2017, hip studio A24 brought Yiddish to the big screen with Menashe, a drama set entirely within Borough Park.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say that while we were working on this show, we didn\u2019t see ourselves as fitting into something larger than us,\u201d Winger confesses. \u201cI wish I had a better answer. It makes me feel strangely comforted to think that other people were also approaching these same issues in other creative ways.\u201d</p> <p>Steeped as Unorthodox may be in the particulars of Jewish life and culture, Winger sees Esther and Feldman\u2019s twinned pilgrimage to freedom as a more primal act. Much in the same respect that the Jewish religion was founded on such core human values as resilience, togetherness and respect, so too can an account of a woman claiming agency in her own life operate on a universal frequency. Winger and Feldman came together as expatriates, and they believe audiences will be able to forge that bond just as naturally.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an uplifting story,\u201d Winger says. \u201cIf you follow it through to the end, it\u2019s about people finding their way in the world, defining their own <em>derech</em>, and that\u2019s relatable to everyone. It\u2019s a specific circumstance, but in that specificity, it becomes weirdly accessible \u2026 Anyone who feels a need to struggle for individuality against their community, they\u2019ll find some of themselves in the show. I hope it\u2019s a little bit cathartic, and leaves people who might like to start something somewhere else with hope. It\u2019s all about renewal.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Unorthodox is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>This is the photograph that threw me right in at the deep end. It was December 2015 and I was working in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games\">video games</a> industry as an art director. I had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/graphic-design\">graphic design</a> background and so I definitely had an artistic eye and could compose an image \u2013 but all I knew about the camera was how to press the shutter button.</p> <p>I was based in Canada but was on holiday in Tokyo. I was walking back to my hotel one night in the rain when I came across this taxi driver \u2013 he was waiting for a couple to leave a <a href=\"https://wanderwisdom.com/lodging/Love-Hotel-Guide---how-to-recognize--find-and-use-a-Japanese-love-hotel\">love hotel</a>. The passenger door was open, causing the interior to light up. A lot of luck was involved. I had saved up for and bought a new camera, but at the time I didn\u2019t really know how to use it. I took several pictures of this same scene and they were mostly blurry, but this shot came into focus.</p> <p>If it looks composed that\u2019s because I was thinking of all the movies and cinematography that I love: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/27/1\">Wong Kar-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/27/1\">wai\u2019s In the Mood for Love</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/22/drive-ryan-gosling-film-review\">Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s Drive</a>. It was all just there in front of me. Before this moment, I was just a visitor in the city taking photographs at regular tourist spots.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have any social media presence back then, but I would occasionally share pictures on my personal Facebook page. I put this image online and it created a real buzz with my friends, who encouraged me to take more in the same style. As a result, I spent each night of my holiday capturing the streets of Tokyo after midnight. When Adobe and the Saatchi Gallery shared it things went wild. It was quite intimidating. I didn\u2019t consider myself a photographer, and yet suddenly my work was being viewed by thousands of people and in great detail. I found it challenging. I hadn\u2019t even heard of the phrase \u201cpixel peep\u201d \u2013 when other photographers look closely into every single detail of an image and find its flaws. But it made me want to practise more to master the technical side of photography rather than just relying on the camera\u2019s automatic settings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I know the open car door invites a story, but I\u2019m not a storyteller. I\u2019m actually really bad at writing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I specialise in night photography now, so I\u2019m often walking around looking for a strong light source. Low-light photography has its own set of challenges, which I love. I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed the taxi driver if he hadn\u2019t been lit up by the open car door. I know the door invites a story, but I\u2019m not a storyteller. I\u2019m actually really bad at writing. When it comes to photography, for me it\u2019s really about capturing moments. I\u2019ve never had to inject a narrative into my photography work, I much prefer to leave it open to interpretation. </p> <p>A lot of people tell me my work reminds them of Blade Runner. Every still in that movie is like a painting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2008/mar/27/roger.deakins\">Roger Deakins</a>, who worked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/blade-runner-2049-review-ryan-gosling-harrison-ford-denis-villeneuve\">Blade Runner 2049</a>, is one of my main inspirations \u2013 he\u2019s brilliant at using strong silhouettes and restricted colour palettes. I try to combine the kind of treatment you see in films with the composition techniques of old black-and-white photographers. My absolute favourite is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/aug/20/fan-ho-hong-kong-street-photography-in-pictures\">Fan Ho </a>and his 1950s images of Hong Kong. But I never went down the route of that style of photography. It was more about seeing movies and trying to figure out how I could apply those techniques to street photography and combine it with my expertise developing styles as an art director for video games.</p> <p>It was in Tokyo during that trip that I discovered another key influence. I\u2019d been to the Imperial Palace and stumbled upon the old book district, Jinb\u014dch\u014d. I found an old copy of the late <a href=\"http://sydmead.com/\">Syd Mead</a>\u2019s art book: Kronolog \u2013 a rare discovery in perfect condition with the LaserDisc still in its wrapper. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/blade-runner-scott-science\">Mead had worked on the original Blade Runner</a> and it was his work that inspired my photography. </p> <p>I think people found the image compelling because it felt like a frame from a movie.

  "<p>It is not these extraordinary times that have made Joe Wicks. He was already huge, initially from Instagram cooking videos that lasted just 15 seconds. Rudimentary but engagingly zany, they attracted a substantial if hodgepodge fanbase from body-conscious zoomers to middle-aged mums. So when he brought out the cookbook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/09/lean-in-15s-joe-wicks-i-dont-understand-the-clean-eating-thing-ive-just-had-bangers-and-mash\" title=\"\">Lean in 15</a>, five years ago, his publisher said she would be delighted to sell 70,000 copies, which roughly amounted to one per Insta follower. Instead he sold 700,000, to become the second biggest seller in the cookery hall of fame, below Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>This week, though, his live workouts on YouTube have put him in a different league. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/24/why-35-million-people-want-joe-wicks-to-be-their-pe-teacher\" title=\"\">Every morning at 9am, he is running a \u201cPE lesson\u201d</a>: an exercise class for kids that you can do in your living room. It sounds like a simple idea, but now every child in the country (and their mum) is talking about it, his name forming a compound noun with his chosen title: \u201cYes, I\u2019ve done my PE homework, I\u2019ve done JoeWicksBodyCoach.\u201d Kids love the kangaroo hops and parents love the fact it gets their children burning off excess energy when they are trapped inside.</p> <p>Skyping me on Tuesday afternoon, Wicks runs the numbers: \u201cOn day No 1, we had 806,000 households streaming it. Today it was 954,000 livestreams; 3.7 million people have watched the first video since yesterday. It\u2019s just growing, I\u2019m over the moon. I feel quite overwhelmed by it.\u201d He has been up since seven, and so busy he has only had time for a piece of toast. This is a salient detail from the nation\u2019s ultimate dietary role model, whose MO is to show not tell; normally his lunch is way more balanced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a763febb5d71f26d1dbc1de743798832444888a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a763febb5d71f26d1dbc1de743798832444888a/0_64_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Wicks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let\u2019s get physical \u2026 Mia and Jack, two of Wicks\u2019s audience of millions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is keen to stress that this is no overnight success. The Instagram videos built up over two years, from 2014 when he was an obscure and incredibly bouncy personal trainer, shaking pans about, being cute about broccoli (\u201cbaby trees!\u201d) and wild about rice, to 2016, post his first book, when he had a million followers. He is quite down on his early broadcasts, describing his voice as monotonous and critical of the lighting. \u201cNo one that probably really loved cooking, like really skilful chefs, would have watched those,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were for general people who wanted to know where to start.\u201d But there was something distinctive about them, an unstudied inclusiveness</p> <p>It was in 2016 that he started visiting schools, up and down the country, trying to embed a passion for physical jerks. He wanted to teach the world to star jump; he wanted a TV show, like Jamie Oliver\u2019s School Dinners but for exercise. He could not get any takers. But that was then. Yesterday, he was in discussions with Channel 4 about streaming his <a href=\"https://www.thessun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11247329/joe-wicks-channel-4-daily-workout/\" title=\"\">online workouts</a> while the Sun was poring over his videos, trying to spot evidence of a lavish lifestyle from the shots of his living room in Richmond, Surrey.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very modest house,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople just focus on the stupidest things. I mean, look: it\u2019s a nice kitchen, but it\u2019s not anything fancy. It\u2019s because I won\u2019t do an interview with them, that\u2019s why.\u201d Hmmm, the last person who said they\u2019d never do an interview with the Sun was a Labour leadership candidate, I say a little slyly. \u201cI don\u2019t do politics,\u201d he says, laughing; his mind is on a larger goal. \u201cI want to be the person who completely transformed the health of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>I do not think Wicks has a particular fitness secret: his workouts are successful because people love him. This is the mystery of the man \u2013 why is it that people, across generations, like him so much? It is not a question that you can ask directly. You have to go back to the beginning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had quite a chaotic home life, it wasn\u2019t stable, my diet wasn\u2019t great.</p> <footer> <cite>Joe Wicks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A disruptive and naughty kid, \u201ca bit of a clown\u201d, he says, Wicks was always into sport, football, cross-country, anything where he could blow off a bit of steam. The defining moment of his teenage years was when, at 15, a group of his schoolmates was taken on an immersion day at St Mary\u2019s University, in Twickenham, London. \u201cI remember looking round the bus, and it was all the naughtiest kids, the ones who were always in detention. I think they must have wanted us to see how it could be different.\u201d</p> <p>On the way home, he rang his mum and announced that he wanted to be a PE teacher \u2013 and he did start as a teaching assistant, before becoming a personal trainer. It was not an obvious trajectory, he says. \u201cI had quite a chaotic home life, it wasn\u2019t stable, my diet wasn\u2019t great. I was never an overweight child, but I had behavioural issues. I think that was linked to my upbringing and not having a great start with my nutrition.\u201d</p> <p>His mother was 17 when she had his brother, 19 when she had Joe; his father was in and out of rehab for drug addiction. \u201cThere was a lot of shouting, a lot of doors slammed, we didn\u2019t sit down and have dinner together.\u201d And yet, he says: \u201cOne thing I had more than anything, I had love and support from my mum and dad. My mum used to say: \u2018I don\u2019t care if you become a dustman or a doctor, you can be who you want.\u2019\u201d It is a powerful and unusual stance, and it means he really gets imperfection \u2013 human frailty, too much sugar, not enough lunges \u2013 he gets that you can make poor choices without being a bad human being, he is palpably non-judgmental, without ever saying: \u201cI\u2019m not here to judge you.\u201d I think viewers can smell that, at any age, even through their smartphones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9442d098a044c00b5eedc527030c7446bf671e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9442d098a044c00b5eedc527030c7446bf671e0/0_339_3796_4742/801.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Wicks\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get shorty \u2026 Wicks tones his arms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McAndrew Photography Ltd/Chris McAndrew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also, of course, the impossible to ignore eye-candy element, which meant in his early career he was often seen on the covers of fitness magazines displaying his washboard torso. He is quite uncomfortable about that now. \u201cI am a dad and I am married and I\u2019m very public about my love for my wife [Rosie, who used to be a model]. So the attention has shifted, it\u2019s less: \u2018We love him because he\u2019s got abs\u2019, the heartthrob days are over.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, he says: \u201cI\u2019m 34 now, receding hairline, I\u2019m not as lean as I was.\u201d Which is stretching things a bit, since to the untrained eye, he looks the same, only more famous. But he is certainly serious about his family. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice calm feeling, since I got married and had kids [a daughter of two, a three-month-old son]. I\u2019m not chasing anything, I\u2019m not rushing to get anywhere, I\u2019m really content with what I\u2019ve got. When you\u2019ve got a nice house and you\u2019ve got your kids and you\u2019ve got your holiday, what more do you need? There isn\u2019t much more that will ever make you happier than that.\u201d If you have to pretend to be going bald to damp down the passions of a whole nation <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8148875/How-Juicy-Joe-Wicks-keeps-mums-like-half-sane.html\" title=\"\">who refer to you as \u201cJuicy Joe\u201d</a>, I guess that\u2019s a price worth paying.</p> <p>Anyway, back to the fitness; there is a good reason to start with younger kids. Before coronavirus hit, when he was still touring the country, \u201cI went to a secondary school, and they were already a little bit too cool: \u2018I\u2019m not training with him, who is this dude?\u2019 My whole philosophy is to get kids exercising at a young age, which you can really create with role modelling. \u2018My mum\u2019s sweating, she\u2019s out of breath, she\u2019s laughing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Take a sedentary teen, who is into their devices, and good luck training them, he says. This might be disheartening news if you already have a house full of sedentary teens who are all into their devices, but he continues persuasively, and by the end of it I\u2019m convinced that you probably could persuade even older kids, so long as you directed them his way and didn\u2019t try to role model it by sweating yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s just about happiness,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve stepped away from exercise to look good, exercise to lose weight. True motivation comes from how exercise makes you feel. If you\u2019re very demotivated, you\u2019ve got to remember that the sense of achievement comes at the end of the workout, not at the start.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think about financial gain. What makes me feel good is parents wanting to exercise with their kids</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As much as Wicks proselytises fitness, he is careful to show his flaws. \u201cPeople like the fact that I\u2019m out of breath when I\u2019m training, or I\u2019ll have a blowout, I\u2019ll do a little choccy run. I make mistakes, I\u2019m constantly learning.\u201d Even though he has had the ultimate social-media start, born on Instagram, raised by Facebook, he hasn\u2019t fallen into the trap of presenting an idealised version of himself, then having to meet the expectations he has raised. \u201cYou can put on a front, but people see through that very quickly, and they disengage.\u201d He never sounds censorious, even while he is describing his meal plans for the day \u2013 oats and berries, omelettes and salad, vegetable curries in the evening \u2013 and sketching out the unutterable wholesomeness of his mood management.</p> <p>\u201cThere are days when I wake up feeling flat, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not unhappy but I\u2019m not happy. I know, if I feel like that, I\u2019ll go and do a workout and it will lift my mood.\u201d His workouts sail forth on this tide of infinite enthusiasm, which it is hard not to get swept up in. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you believe in the energy and the secret?\u201d he says at one point. I have no idea what this means, so I say that yes I most definitely do. \u201cI do believe,\u201d he elaborates, \u201cthat the more you put out into the universe, the more that comes back.\u201d</p> <p>If the positivity is a bit relentless, it is definitely not unthinking. He allows in anxieties: small, medium-sized, vast. He worries whether he is as patient as he possibly could be at the dinner table, about how personal trainers are going to get through this hibernation period when they are all self-employed. \u201cThey really need some love. If you can\u2019t find what you want from my channel, type in yoga for the elderly, or pilates for pregnancy: there\u2019s millions of trainers also doing really good videos.\u201d</p> <p>Since he had children, \u201cI have days when I start thinking about the Earth, about pollution, about the sea, about the economic stuff. I\u2019ve started to think about what it\u2019s going to be like in 50 years, and I didn\u2019t used to think like that at all.\u201d It has made him more driven, he says, but not for money. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve achieved, yes. You have to understand I grew up on a council estate, and back in the day you had tokens for your lunch at school. I didn\u2019t come from a background of wealth, but it wasn\u2019t something I talked about, I still had a good life. And I\u2019m still not motivated to be financially successful. I don\u2019t look at the numbers, or think about financial gain. What makes me feel good is reaching people, trying to change the culture so that parents want to exercise with their kids.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/25/yoga-adriene-mishler-youtube-interview\">'The people\u2019s yogi': how Adriene Mishler became a YouTube phenomenon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think back to how stung he was when the Sun picked over his living room for signs of poshness.

He has just moved all the furniture out so there\u2019s room for press-ups, and there is a map above the mantelpiece. \u201cIt\u2019s a plastic map!\u201d, he says, mock-scandalised.</p> <p>He asked me at the start of the interview whether I was Zoe Williams the media doctor, and I said no, but I was once invited to give a keynote to the Royal College of GPs, and because of my weird ego, I exchanged loads of emails on my thoughts about general practice, before my Mr said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible they don\u2019t mean you.\u201d He has a version of that story, and it\u2019s much better. \u201cMy brother got invited to do a speech at an event at YouTube for the Who. He\u2019s a massive fan of the Who, he\u2019s been listening to their music for years. The day before, he thought: \u201cWhy do they want me there?\u201d And it was only the World Health Organization.\u201d It\u2019s a signal of how big Joe Wicks was, even before the online workouts, that the WHO wanted his brother, Nikki, who is also his social-media strategist, to talk through how best to improve the world\u2019s health.</p> <p>Even while he is in no way blase about the lockdown \u2013 worrying not just about personal trainers, but about people with businesses, families in debt, how we will adapt to not being able to get the ingredients we\u2019re used to, the stuff we thought we relied on \u2013 he is constitutionally oriented towards the bright side. \u201cI think the real value that people get from my YouTube videos are these questions. Are you going to feel good today? Are you going to sleep better tonight? Do you want to give yourself the opportunity to feel the best you can?\u201d</p> <p>Well, OK then.

Just two months later, as the fifth anniversary of the Saudi and Emirati coalition intervention in the war dawns, the prospect of peace is further away than ever.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s civil war escalated on 26 March 2015 after the president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, fled to neighbouring Saudi Arabia and a coalition of 20 Arab nations intervened to try to drive the Iran-backed Houthis out of the capital, Sana\u2019a.</p> <p>Since then the conflict has morphed into the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, killing an estimated 100,000 people and leaving 80% of the population \u2013 about 24 million people \u2013 dependent on aid to survive.</p> <p>Both sides have been accused of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, but according to <a href=\"https://www.yemendataproject.org/\">the Yemen Data Project</a>, at least 30% of more than 20,000 coalition bombing raids are estimated to have hit civilian infrastructure.</p> <p>The coalition, which is supported by the UK, US and other western nations, has also imposed a blockade of Houthi territory that has pushed around half of the total civilian population to the brink of starvation and led to outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. Yemen is now facing a potentially devastating new crisis in the face of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> pandemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/yemen-zip/giv-3902Dagwho1yGcj6\" data-alt=\"Graphic - map showing areas of control\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/yemen-zip/giv-3902Dagwho1yGcj6\">Graphic - map showing areas of control</a> </figure>  <p>The latest round of violence erupted after Hadi\u2019s forces tried to advance along the highway from Marib to the rebel-held capital, Sana\u2019a, but the attempt backfired spectacularly after the Houthis responded with counterattacks on several fronts, advancing to seize al-Hazm, the capital of al-Jawf province, earlier this month.</p> <p>Heavy fighting in al-Jawf, which is north of Marib, has sent at least 1,750 families fleeing, overwhelming local aid agencies already working in displacement camps on the outskirts of Marib city, where around 70,000 people are now in need of daily help.</p> <p>A total of 35 civilians, including 19 children, were killed by coalition airstrikes on al-Jawf in a single day in February. In one of the single bloodiest attacks of the war to date, 116 soldiers loyal to exiled President Hadi died in a missile attack on a mosque at a Marib military camp that was blamed on the Houthis.</p> <p>Those fighting and suffering in the latest violence are Yemeni, and new alliances currently being formed between local tribes and the Houthis are shifting the balance of power on the ground even more strongly in the rebels\u2019 favour.

  "<p>The US Senate has passed a $2.2tn emergency relief package as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the economy, marking the biggest rescue deal of its kind in US history.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a strange and evil disease,\u201d said the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, ahead of the vote. \u201cWhen we pass this bill, instead of hugging each other, we\u2019ll wave from a distance.\u201d</p> \n<p>The bill would provide up to $1,200 in direct relief for American adults, create a $500bn lending program for businesses, cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses. The plan also provides $130bn to hospitals and expands unemployment insurance.</p> \n<p>Senators overwhelmingly voted to pass the legislation, approving it 96-0.</p> \n<p>The House is expected to vote on the bill on Friday. \u201cWe are working to ensure that those who are unable to return to Washington will be able to express their views on this legislation remotely,\u201d said the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, in a statement.</p> \n<p>Lawmakers scrambled on Wednesday to smooth over snags as they rushed to pass the legislation, which provides direct payments to American families, and loans and grants to businesses. A last-minute amendment, from Republican senators who complained that the bill would incentivize workers to collect unemployment payments rather than take a job, failed.</p> \n<p>After casting her vote Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts, said: \u201cThis is not the bill I wanted, but its immediate investments are vital.\u201d \u201cThey are also insufficient,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will need to do more \u2013 and soon.\u201d</p> \n<p>McConnell similarly reflected on the compromises that Republicans and Democrats made to arrive at the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it. It will be worth it to get help to millions of small businesses and save tens of millions of jobs.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/california-coronavirus-unemployment-newsom\">More than 1m Californians have filed for unemployment amid coronavirus crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Senate majority whip, John Thune, missed the Wednesday night vote because he was in self-quarantine after experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. Senator Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus, and senators Mitt Romney and Mike Lee \u2013 who have not tested positive but are self-isolating out of caution \u2013 were also unable to vote. The House, which the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, indicated will approve the measure, is also grappling with the logistics of voting with several confirmed and suspected cases. <br><br>Wednesday\u2019s vote came after days of round-the-clock and at times extraordinarily tense negotiations among senators and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">administration</a> officials. A compromise was struck just after midnight on Tuesday to rush financial assistance to workers, businesses and the healthcare system as the pandemic sweeps the country, deepening economic fallout as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> considers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-social-distancing-coronavirus-rules-guidelines-economy\">easing</a> restrictions aimed at combating the contagion. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a deal,\u201d said Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, just before 1am, adding that the text of the bill needed to be completed.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have either clear, explicit legislative text reflecting all parties or we know exactly where we\u2019re going to land on legislative text as we continue to finish.\u201d</p> \n<p>McConnell saluted \u201ca bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic\u201d, a deal he described as a \u201cwartime level of investment into our nation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Schumer said: \u201cThis is not a moment of celebration, but one of necessity. To all Americans I say: help is on the way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Senate reconvened on Wednesday but a drive to push through the package quickly was upended by the objections of a group of conservative lawmakers.</p> \n<p>Three Republicans \u2013 Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott and Ben Sasse \u2013 raised concerns over what they claimed was a \u201cmassive drafting error\u201d that would create a \u201cstrong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Vermont independent (and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination) Bernie Sanders countered that he would \u201cput a hold on\u201d the bill, in order to push for stronger conditions on bailed-out businesses, unless the Republicans dropped their objections.</p> \n<p>Pelosi said the Senate bill went \u201ca long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people\u201d, but did not give a clear sign of approval.</p> \n<p>The legislation is an order of magnitude larger than the $800bn stimulus bill passed in 2009 to alleviate the economic pain of the Great Recession. And yet it is only expected to be a temporary patch to stabilize an economy spiraling out of control. Senators have signaled a need to begin work on the next stimulus package.</p> \n<p>Trump confirmed on Wednesday evening that he planned to sign the stimulus package \u201cimmediately\u201d when it gets to his desk, adding that he\u2019ll have a \u201cbeautiful\u201d signing.</p> \n<p>During a coronavirus taskforce briefing, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, signaled that the bill could bolster the economy for three months. But the president, contradicting public health experts, said the country will open up \u201clike a rocket ship\u201d and people would be able to return to work within a fortnight.</p> \n<p>The legislation would also prohibit businesses owned by Trump, his family and members of Congress from receiving loans or investments from the treasury department program.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose of us who write the law shouldn\u2019t benefit from the law,\u201d Schumer told CNN on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>US stock markets, which rose more than 2,100 points, or more than 11%, on Tuesday, continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace, on Wednesday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"36d4f7e384a75167d54bd847626ed03872036171\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d4f7e384a75167d54bd847626ed03872036171/0_0_4686_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Las Vegas maintenance worker disinfects playground equipment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Las Vegas maintenance worker disinfects playground equipment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But many on Wall Street appear uncertain that the stimulus package, together with a Federal Reserve pledge of nearly $4tn in aid, will counter the havoc an uncontained coronavirus outbreak could still wreak.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was a one-day bull market,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/cramer-tells-investors-to-be-cautious-of-one-day-bull-market-after-tuesdays-surge.html\">CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer</a>. \u201cYou had stocks that moved so much they basically moved as if the second half of the year is going to be good. I struggle to find out why the second half of the year should be good. I hate this kind of rally. This was a machine-driven rally, just like the sell-offs. I want to wait to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>Relief that US politicians had reached a deal pushed world stock markets up on Wednesday. Indexes in Europe and Asia rose a day after the Dow Jones had its best day since 1933. The FTSE-100 in London closed up 4.45% at 5688.</p> \n<p>A major sticking point in the negotiations concerned $500bn for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with airlines that have been rocked by a near-shutdown of travel. Hospitals would get significant help as well.</p> \n<p>The deal provides for one-time direct payments of up to $1,200 to most adults and greatly expanded unemployment insurance. It also includes a $367bn program for small businesses to keep paying employees forced to stay home.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, assailed the relief package in his daily press briefing, calling the $3.8bn in financial assistance that would flow to his state, the center of the outbreak in the US, a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d.</p> \n<p>The deal came as Trump grew impatient with his administration\u2019s decision to impose strict restrictions on all aspects of public life to try to slow the spread of the virus, a move recommended by health officials.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> said he was aiming to reopen \u201clarge sections of the country\u201d by Easter, just over two weeks away, as public health officials and state governors rejected that timeline as potentially unsafe.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.

  "<p>By the time they locked down Italy, it seemed like it was already too late. Hundreds of people there had died of Covid-19 , with thousands infected. Over the next two weeks, the death toll soared. In New Zealand, we have oddly been in the opposite position: no one has died from the virus. Seven people are in hospital but they\u2019re not in intensive care or on ventilators. There are more than 280 people confirmed to have the disease.</p> <p>Yet this country has begun at least four weeks of some of the strictest restrictions anywhere in the world to fight Covid-19, clamping down on most movement, association and \u2013 to the chagrin of some \u2013 shopping, in the hope that a tragedy like the one unfolding in Italy and elsewhere can be avoided. </p> <p>There wasn\u2019t time to finesse plans \u2013 to ensure everything was perfect \u2013 before the rules came into effect, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/ardern-urges-new-zealanders-to-act-like-you-have-covid-19-as-lockdown-looms\"> told us on Wednesday.</a> We were just going to essentially give it a punt.

We had dinner as usual (takeaways \u2013 because who knows when we\u2019ll next have those?). Children played on a driveway up the street. Only the teeth-clenching sound of an alert blaring from our phones thanks to Civil Defence officials, reminding us of the impending lockdown \u2013 and providing a hefty shot of adrenaline to anyone who wasn\u2019t already on edge \u2013 reiterated what was about to happen.</p> <p>It was faintly surreal to prepare to hunker down without having seen the enemy yet.

At the weekend, I was briefly stymied to learn I could not take the kids to the museum, so we took them on a bush walk instead. We still went to swimming lessons, a cafe for brunch. We took precautions, but when we ambled into supermarkets for late-night cheese purchases, queues were not long and the essentials (cheese) were still available.</p> <p>In other nations the dismantling of public life did not come as a surprise when it happened \u2013 things felt bad already in many cases.

I am an introvert and long walks are already my favourite hobby. I constantly promise to see my friends and then never actually see them.

And for a tiny while, it seemed there was a tension in the streets, armed police everywhere. But eventually life just sort of went back to normal, at least in public. New Zealanders pride themselves on that, that nothing \u2013 no matter what \u2013 changes the \u201cshe\u2019ll be right\u201d way in which they\u2019ve become accustomed to living.</p> <p>But Covid-19 has changed that, and very suddenly.

  "<p>With large areas of the US shut down, stock markets crashing, industries facing collapse and soaring unemployment, the US government is set to pass the most expensive bailout in US history in attempts to save the US economy.</p> \n<p>Democrat and Republican leaders of Congress, along with White House officials, have been scrambling to make a deal in around-the-clock negotiations and finally announced early on Wednesday that they have reached an agreement. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The details are still trickling out, but here\u2019s what we know so far about the package:</p> \n<h2>What does the stimulus look like?</h2> \n<p>The bill is worth about $2tn, which will go to businesses, corporations and directly into the pockets of Americans. It has six main components:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Direct payment to most Americans.</p></li> \n <li><p>$250bn to bolster unemployment insurance.</p></li> \n <li><p>$350bn in loans for small businesses that may be forgiven if firms use them to keep workers on payroll.</p></li> \n <li><p>$500bn in aid for hard-hit industries and states and $50bn for airlines.</p></li> \n <li><p>$130bn in aid to hospitals.</p></li> \n <li><p>$150bn to help state and local governments.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>What held negotiations up?</h2> \n<p>Senate Republicans introduced the bill last Friday, and a marathon of negotiations took place until an agreement was made Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>Talks had originally stalled in the Senate on Sunday because Democrats were worried that the bailout did not include enough oversight over corporate loans and gave too little protection to workers.</p> \n<p>There has been some compromise. Republicans agreed to some major changes from their original bill. More money will be given to large companies in hard-hit industries, but Democrats have also pushed for strict oversight of the loans. More aid will also be given to the healthcare sector and more funds will be earmarked for unemployment insurance after pushes from Democrats.</p> \n<h2><strong>Are US taxpayers really going to get direct checks from the government?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/republican-coronavirus-stimulus-payments\">plan</a> is for individuals to get up to $1,200 and married couples to get up to $2,400, plus an additional $500 for each child. The size of a check would diminish gradually for those whose income is above $75,000, while individuals earning more than $99,000 and couples earning more than $198,000 will not be getting any checks. The checks will be based on a household or individual\u2019s 2018 tax return unless they filed their 2019 tax return, in which case it will be based of their 2019 return.</p> \n<p>The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said last week that checks could be sent out as early as 6 April. The bill earmarks $250bn for the checks.</p> \n<h2><strong>Will there be corporate bailouts?</strong></h2> \n<p>Democrats and even some Republicans are adamant that corporations are given fair assistance that will not end up in the pockets of wealthy shareholders or corporate executives.</p> \n<p>The bill includes $500bn in loans and loan guarantees to hard-hit companies, including commercial airlines and other travel-related companies hit hard over the last few months.</p> \n<p>So far, Congress has not revealed which companies will be eligible for bailouts, though there are many that are asking for one. The restaurant industry <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/restaurant-industry-asks-for-145-billion-recovery-fund-from-the-government.html\">asked</a> the government for $145bn to help offset losses after dozens of states mandated the closure of many full-service restaurants.</p> \n<h2><strong>What oversight will there be for large companies that take out loans?</strong></h2> \n<p>Oversight of lending decisions will go to an independent inspector general and oversight board.</p> \n<p>Though Trump said, when asked who would provide oversight of the loans, \u201cI\u2019ll be the oversight\u201d, the White House conceded to Democrats\u2019 concerns.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe oversight basically is saying that you know you can\u2019t just \u2026 exempt everybody and give all your corporate executives, based on the backs of taxpayers, a free carnival,\u201d Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/25/trump-senate-coronavirus-economic-stimulus-2-trillion/\">told</a> the Washington Post.</p> \n<p>Companies who receive government assistance will also see restrictions on stock buybacks, which is when a company buys shares of its own stock to increase the value of its shares, ultimately helping their wealthy stockholders and corporate executives.

He said more than 1.2m of the 2.5m government employees would continue to be kept away from work.</p> \n  <p>Claiming the coronavirus pandemic was about to enter a second phase in Iran, he praised those Iranians that had abided by advice and not travelled to holiday resorts during Iran\u2019s new year break, but there is clearly a concern that the pandemic will spread again when millions return from their holidays. The ability of Iran to track those with the infection is limited, and promises by the army to clear the streets have been made before, only for little to happen.</p> \n  <p><strong>Rouhani also claimed the issue of US economic sanctions on Iran was set to be raised at the UN Security Council</strong>.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/china-to-lift-travel-restrictions-in-hubei-after-months-of-coronavirus-lockdown\"> relaxing of travel restrictions in Hubei province</a>, where the pandemic started.</p> \n  <p>Li\u2019s comments came as analysts questioned the veracity of China\u2019s claims that the nation has had several days with no new domestic cases.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to a meeting of the central leading group responding to the outbreak on Monday, Li urged officials to report honestly on the number of cases, and \u201cnot cover up reports for the sake of keeping new case numbers at zero\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-24/premier-orders-honest-reporting-of-coronavirus-cases-101533334.html\">according to Caixin Global</a>.</p> \n  <p>Li said worldwide analysis of the virus showed the virus was unlikely to dissipate like Sars.</p> \n  <p>He warned that while the epidemic in Hubei and Wuhan had essentially been stopped, there were still risks of sporadic outbreaks.</p> \n  <p>\u201c[We] Have to realise the prevention measure - \u2018early detection, reporting, isolation and treatment\u2019, to stop the epidemic in certain areas and prevent an even bigger outbreak.\u201d</p> \n  <p>For several days now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> has reported few or zero new domestic cases of Covid-19 infection, claiming success in controlling the outbreak which just one month ago saw thousands of confirmations a day.</p> \n  <p>However, residents and analysts have questioned the near-zero rate of community transmissions, expressing concern that the Chinese government is prioritising economic recovery over total virus containment. </p> \n  <p>The low figures have led Chinese authorities to lift stringent travel restrictions in Hubei, effectively freeing millions of people from two months of extraordinary lockdown.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a

  "<p>The future of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline has been thrown into question after a federal court on Wednesday struck down its permits and ordered a comprehensive environmental review.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock\">Our fight against the Dakota Access pipeline is far from over</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US army corps of engineers was ordered to conduct a full environmental impact statement (EIS), after the Washington DC <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/standing-rock-sj.pdf\">court ruled</a> that existing permits violated the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa).</p> <p>The ruling is a huge victory for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">the Standing Rock Sioux tribe of North Dakota</a>, which rallied support from across the world and sued the US government in a campaign to stop the environmentally risky pipeline being built on tribal lands.</p> <p>\u201cAfter years of commitment to defending our water and earth, we welcome this news of a significant legal win,\u201d said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock\">tribal chairman, Mike Faith</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to see how actions we took to defend our ancestral homeland continue to inspire national conversations about how our choices ultimately affect this planet.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2016, the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/dakota-access-pipeline-permit-denied-standing-rock\">denied permits for the pipeline</a> to cross the Missouri river and ordered a full EIS to analyze alternative routes and the impact on the tribe\u2019s treaty rights.</p> <p>In his first week in office, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/24/keystone-xl-dakota-access-pipelines-revived-trump-administration\">signed an executive order</a> to expedite construction. Construction of the 1,200-mile pipeline was completed in June 2017.</p> <p>The tribe challenged the permits \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/14/dakota-access-pipeline-environmental-study-inadequate\">and won</a>. As a result, the corps was ordered to redo its environmental analysis, which it did without taking into <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2020/standing-rock-sioux-tribe-prevails-as-federal-judge-strikes-down-dapl-permits\">consideration tribal concerns or expert analysis.</a></p> <p>The pipeline continued to transport oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The tribe and EarthJustice, an environmental law not-for-profit group, sued again.</p> <p>In his ruling on Wednesday, the federal judge James Boasberg, an Obama appointee, said the environmental analysis by both the companies behind the pipeline and the corps was severely lacking.</p> <p>The abysmal safety record of the pipeline parent company, Sunoco, \u201cdoes not inspire confidence\u201d, he added.</p> <p>The court-mandated EIS will be more in depth than the assessment already completed by the corps \u2013 and could take years. The court will next decide if the pipeline should be shut down until the EIS is done.</p> <p>The corps did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>\u201cThis validates everything the tribe has been saying all along about the risk of oil spills to the people of Standing Rock,\u201d said Jan Hasselman, an EarthJustice attorney. \u201cThe Obama administration had it right when it moved to deny the permits in 2016.\u201d</p> <p>The setback for the pipeline comes as the Trump administration moves to severely curtail <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/nepa/downloads/national-environmental-policy-act-1969\">Nepa, the 1969 legislation</a> which is widely considered the cornerstone of US environmental protection. Trump has repeatedly blamed Nepa for blocking fossil fuel projects.</p>"
