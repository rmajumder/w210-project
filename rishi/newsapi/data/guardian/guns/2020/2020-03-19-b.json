  "<p>A massive effort is under way to develop a UK vaccine for coronavirus within months and make it available to save lives before the end of the year, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>Researchers at Oxford University, led by Prof Sarah Gilbert, are planning a safety trial on humans of what is expected to be the UK\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine next month. Provided that it goes smoothly, they will move directly into a larger trial to assess how effective the vaccine is at protecting against the infection.</p> \n<p>The same vaccine will start animal trials next week at the Public Health England (PHE) laboratory at Porton Down near Salisbury. Normally, animal work must be completed before human trials can start, but because similar vaccines have worked safely in trials for other diseases, the work has been accelerated.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are conscious that a vaccine is needed as soon as possible and certainly by June\u2013July, when we expect a big peak in mortality,\u201d said Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

We will follow all standard trial safety requirements, but as soon as we have a vaccine that\u2019s working, we anticipate there will be an accelerated pathway to get it deployed to save lives. The more vaccine we can provide sooner, the better.\u201d</p> \n<p>This month, Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of Donald Trump\u2019s taskforce, said a vaccine was 12 to 18 months away \u2013 an expectation echoed by the UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance \u2013 but Hill said the Oxford team and others were \u201caiming for much earlier\u201d.</p> \n<p>Covid-19 was confirmed to have claimed a further 33 lives on Thursday, bringing the UK death toll to 137. The latest victims were aged between 47 and 96, and all had underlying health conditions. Confirmed cases stood at 3,269.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson claimed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">next 12 weeks could \u201cturn the tide of this disease\u201d</a>, telling the daily Downing Street press conference on Thursday he was \u201cabsolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country, but only if we all take the steps we have outlined\u201d.</p> \n<p>A British patient has entered a randomised trial for coronavirus for the first time, the prime minister said. The patient, who had Covid-19, is being tested to check whether they have immunity.</p> \n<p>He added that the government was in negotiations to buy an antibody test \u201cas simple as a pregnancy test, which can tell whether you have had the disease. It\u2019s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable.\u201d</p> \n<p>The vaccine being developed at Porton Down is an intramuscular injection that uses a harmless, non-replicating virus to smuggle DNA from the coronavirus into the body\u2019s cells.</p> \n<p>Once inside, the body\u2019s cells use the coronavirus DNA to churn out copies of the \u201cspike proteins\u201d that dot the germ\u2019s surface. It is these that should marshal the immune response against coronavirus infection. Previous studies suggest the vaccine should work with only a single shot.</p> \n<p>Vaccines that operate the same way have been used safely in thousands of people, aged from one week old to 90 years, for diseases ranging from malaria and TB to Mers, another coronavirus, and Ebola, for which it is now being deployed in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> \n<p>The Oxford trial is expected to recruit people from a range of ages, but scientists will be particularly keen to see how it performs in older people. They are most vulnerable to the virus, but tend to respond less well to vaccinations because of their weaker immune systems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76ecb2e1-d843-41f6-8e05-8151306c4429\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WM0gHwIjlUk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Oxford team have a small manufacturing capability to make the vaccine for trials but will need to work with a full-scale vaccine manufacturer to produce enough shots if the trials demonstrate that they can protect people. That is one hurdle the researchers need to overcome.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s massive challenge. You can\u2019t go to a manufacturing facility today and say, \u2018We\u2019d like you to take this on and spend tens of millions gearing up,\u2019\u201d Hill said. \u201cBut we are working our way around that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The hope is to have the vaccine available for use in an emergency response setting where the usual licensing rules are relaxed. Once Ebola vaccines were ready, they were approved and used very swiftly, even though they only received formal licences from regulators late last year.</p> \n<p>The Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx1, is one of five frontrunner vaccines in development around the world. The US biotech Moderna gave its first vaccine shot to a person in Seattle earlier this week. Another US firm, Inovio, will soon start trials on its own coronavirus vaccine, which requires a special device to administer through the skin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal\">In Germany, CureVac is working on a vaccine</a>, while others are in development in China.</p> \n<p>Public Health England will run \u201cchallenge\u201d trials with the Oxford vaccine, with ferrets and macaques having the jab before receiving a controlled dose of coronavirus intra-nasally. The researchers will then check whether the vaccine prevents the buildup of virus in the animals and protects their lungs from damage.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/biohacking-online-forums-coronavirus-vaccines-testing\">Biohackers team up online to help develop coronavirus solutions</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Miles Carroll, head of research at PHE\u2019s National Infection Service in Porton Down, said there was an \u201caggressive campaign\u201d to get the vaccine evaluated during the peak of the UK outbreak. That would mean giving it to people as part of a trial in the summer. The Porton Down lab is one of a small handful in the country that is licensed to store samples of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know from the Ebola outbreak that even before a vaccine is licensed, it can have a significant impact on disease,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf this looks good at protecting and we see no safety issues at all then, theoretically, after April, going into May or June, they could expand the number of people they are vaccinating and that could be into the thousands.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen, several months later, if it\u2019s working, I imagine there will be a process to massively ramp up manufacture.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Doctors and nurses in New York City hospitals are being advised to continue going to work even if they have had high-risk exposure to a patient with a confirmed case of coronavirus , according to the city\u2019s health department guidelines.</p> <p>The advice has been met with concern among some medical professionals who fear that the guidelines are helping to foster the spread of the virus in hospitals, including among the most vulnerable patients who may assume that their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/medical-workers-self-isolate-home-fears-coronavirus\">healthcare providers</a> do not have the potentially lethal virus.</p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has said there are reports that the coronavirus can be spread by a person who has the disease but is asymptomatic.</p> <p>The New York City health department guidelines, which were published on 17 March and are still effective, state that a healthcare worker who has had a \u201cknown high-risk exposure to a patient(s) with confirmed COVID-19\u201d should \u201ctake extra care to monitor your health but can keep working\u201d and that there is \u201cno requirement for 14 day quarantine of healthcare workers\u201d.</p> <p>High-risk exposure includes having an unmasked healthcare worker having \u201cprolonged close contact\u201d with an unmasked patient known to be positive and performing various procedures for the patients, including intubation and sputum induction.</p> <p>These healthcare workers are being asked to \u201cself-monitor\u201d at least twice daily for symptoms, including cough or a temperature of more than 100F, shortness of breath or sore throat, as well as other symptoms including muscle aches, malaise, runny nose, stuffiness or congestion.</p> <p>\u201cTiming of these checks should be at least 8 hours apart with one check immediately before each healthcare shift,\u201d the guidance states. \u201cIf any of these signs/symptoms develop then you MAY NOT come to work.\u201d</p> <p>Healthcare professionals say the guidance appears to show that New York City hospitals are already in a critical situation. The CDC\u2019s own guidance states that facilities should allow asymptomatic healthcare professionals who have had exposure to work only after \u201coptions to improve staffing have been exhausted\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the health department confirmed the policy was still in place.</p> <p>\u201cBased on the information currently available, it is believed that people who are experiencing symptoms are responsible for driving this pandemic,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.</p> <p>The spokesperson added: \u201cWe are expecting a substantial surge in patients in New York City\u2019s healthcare system and need to preserve staffing levels to best support those patients.\u201d</p> <p>One concerned hospital administrator who works at a New York City hospital told the Guardian the policy was putting patients and other staff at risk.</p> <p>The person cited one example in which a staff member had spent half an hour in close contact with a positive patient without a mask or other protective gear. The person could not be tested because of the scarcity of tests and was told to keep coming to work even though the person was in contact with other patients, including ones with compromised immune systems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/healthcare-workers-coronavirus-masks-beds-tests\">Tests, masks, beds: health workers grapple with shortages as coronavirus crisis grows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While some hospitals were still following more stringent guidelines and asking exposed staff to stay at home, others have accepted the view that the disease is now so prevalent that isolation is no longer warranted and might lead to severe staffing shortages.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are being told, \u2018Well, everyone has it,\u2019 when that is really not the case,\u201d the person said.</p> <p>The response was yet another reason why prioritizing testing for medical professionals ought to be a priority.</p> <p>A doctor in a New York City hospital said the guidelines probably reflected a fear that the city was nervous it would not have enough medical staff to run hospitals if staff were still being advised to quarantine exposed workers.

But we might be more tender, too | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first priority of the crisis is of course public safety, especially for the groups most at risk from catching the virus. But there are public policy issues, and different futures that might arise as the crisis unfolds. Covid-19 doesn\u2019t exist in a political vacuum.</p> <p>The overriding narrative around the crisis can go one of two ways. It can become a story of personal, social and national isolation, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/15/panic-buying-sweeps-stores-despite-appeal-for-responsible-shopping\">stockpiling and looking after number one</a>, spiralling into something more sinister. Blame and the politics of ethno-nationalism and authoritarian populism could be boosted.</p> <p>Or a new and more hopeful common sense can start to dominate, one that identifies public health as a collective endeavour and reveals a fundamental truth: we\u2019re interconnected social beings, ultimately reliant not on ourselves, but on each other.</p> <p>The virus and the demands it puts on the state and on each of us are testing the limits of our society . The NHS has been on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/06/nhs-failure-health-service\">verge of collapse</a> for years. Covid-19 will push it over the edge. People will almost certainly die because of a lack of resources. The social care system, dependent on low-paid workers and starved of resources for decades, will likewise be stretched beyond its breaking point. Already desperate local councils simply have no slack to cope with the sudden and additional pressures being put on them.</p> <p>That everything is stretched to breaking point, with no reserves,applies equally to the economy. And as ever, it\u2019s people in poverty who pay most. Workers on zero-hours contracts and the gig economy are more likely to be laid off, but are also more likely to carry on working even if they are ill. They are given little choice.</p> <p>The case for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-unions-attack-paltry-sick-pay-for-self-isolating-couriers\">liv</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-unions-attack-paltry-sick-pay-for-self-isolating-couriers\">able statutory sick pay</a> is now obvious. Temporary support for mortgage, rent payments and utility bills should be put in place. But it\u2019s a moment to go much further and examine how a basic income could now underpin not just the economy but the fabric of society. Because such pandemics are likely to recur. And in the current crisis, as everyone feels increased insecurity and the added pressure of caring for kchildren or vulnerable relatives, an ethic of compassion is becoming more apparent.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the economy that needs public investment, but trusted news reporting like the BBC, the police and the armed forces, as well as experts, scientists and health specialists. And, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\">Gordon Brown has suggested</a>, international institutions such as the World Health Organization will need strengthening too.</p> <p>The crash of 2008 was the first big warning sign of Britain\u2019s incapacity to cope with shocks, rather than markets simply exploiting them. Then came climate-driven floods. Now it\u2019s Covid-19. Everything is stripped to the bone, just in time and just managing. So we can\u2019t absorb the shocks. The individual in such circumstances becomes pretty meaningless. What matters is all of us being in it together.</p> <p>From now on, we must ensure that the state and society have the resources, capacity and resilience to be shock-absorbent.</p> <p>But the return of the state must take a 21st-century form. As our analysis in <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/publications/45o-change-transforming-society-from-below-and-above/?link_id=1&amp;can_id=16a173b31db07effd1b34de8248a0fde&amp;source=email-this-changes-everything-8&amp;email_referrer=email_750513&amp;email_subject=this-changes-everything\">45\u00b0 Change</a> demonstrates, in a world of digital networks and growing citizen-led autonomy, our collective ability to think, act and hold to account will not stop growing. The big state matters, but so do emerging civil society organisations. We need both top-down state emergency action and bottom-up capacity and resilience building. This could mean people really taking back control over their lives and the planet. Lives in which the way we travel and consume will never return to \u201cnormal\u201d. What we do and learn now will prepare us to deal with the climate emergency.</p> <p>This is a pivotal moment. The time for a reset. Usually it\u2019s wars that flip systems from private back to public. The Boer war, and the poor health and education of the soldiers, sparked the birth of the modern welfare state. The second world war led to the postwar settlement. But this isn\u2019t a war between people but one that unites the whole globe in our shared humanity. This, the war against Covid-19, must be the pivotal moment when the primacy of the public is re-asserted.</p> <p>To be clear, this is not simply a battle of left versus right, but public versus private. In 1944 it was a Tory, Quintin Hogg, who first coined the term \u201csocial security\u201d; today it is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51835856\">Angela Merkel</a> who summed up the moment as a \u201ctest of our solidarity, our common sense and our love for each other\u201d.

  "<p>An investigation into the extent of institutional racism within the Home Office must be launched in response to a damning report on the Windrush scandal, an alliance of anti-racism groups has urged.</p> \n<p>The call came after the long-awaited publication of the independent inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the scandal, which saw British citizens wrongly deported, dismissed from their jobs and deprived of services such as NHS care.</p> \n<p>The inquiry \u2013 which prompted an official apology from the home secretary, Priti Patel \u2013 concluded that the Home Office demonstrated \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race\u201d.

It concludes that the failings are \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d.</p> \n<p>Patel gave an official apology in the House of Commons on Thursday, saying: \u201cThere is nothing I can say today that will undo the suffering \u2026 On behalf of this and successive governments I am truly sorry.\u201d</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">Michael Braithwaite</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">, 68, who was sacked in 2017 from his job as a special-needs teaching assistant</a> at the London primary school where he had worked for more than 15 years (despite the fact that he had lived in the country for half a century) said he was frustrated to hear Patel make a new apology almost two years after the government first did so.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same expression of empathy, and more promises like last time.

They found themselves criticised for failing to obtain evidence of their status, even though when they tried to do so they were not provided with the right documentation.</p> \n<p>The report\u2019s author, Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, said at its launch: \u201cThe Windrush generation has been poorly served by this country, a country to which they contributed so much and in which they had every right to make their lives. The many stories of injustice and hardships are heartbreaking, with jobs lost, lives uprooted and untold damage done to so many individuals and families.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams said she met about 800 people, and many of the interviews had been extremely upsetting. She said one man had been in tears when he told her how he had lost his job and his home \u201cin tragic circumstances\u201d. He told her: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have been treated like this by my beloved England.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams said: \u201cThere were a number of examples that were equally as upsetting. There was an overwhelming sense of bewilderment.

  "<p>Emergency times require emergency measures. That can hardly be in dispute. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 outbreak</a> is unquestionably an emergency. Entire populations are at risk from the disease, some groups acutely so. This is a totalising event. Exceptional measures are needed, in principle and in practice, here and <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/coronavirus-d%C3%A1il-meets-on-emergency-legislation-as-ni-reports-first-death-1.4206792?localLinksEnabled=false+D%C3%A1il+to+rush+through+emergency+legislation+as+NI+reports+first+death\">in other nations</a>, to ensure the safety of all the people and to maintain as comprehensive, orderly and effective a response to the crisis as can be achieved.</p> <p>The British government\u2019s principal emergency measure was published on Thursday. <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0122/20122.pdf\">The coronavirus bill</a> is a vast piece of legislation. It runs to 328 pages. The <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0122/en/20122en.pdf\">explanatory notes</a> run to a further 73. Both show signs of hurried drafting. It confers powers on the state to reorganise and control people\u2019s lives, and to set traditional freedoms aside, in ways that are unprecedented since the wartime emergency powers of 1939-45. The government proposes to get all the stages of the bill through the House of Commons on Monday and to put it on the statute book by the middle of next week. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/labour-mps-alarmed-covid-19-laws-being-passed-without-vote\">Labour opposition</a> is supporting it.</p> <p>The bill is necessary. We accept that. But it is all the more essential that it is properly scrutinised by MPs. This did not happen when wartime emergency powers were rushed through parliament in 1914 and 1939, with long-lasting and controversial effects. But it needs to happen now. This is an emergency on a par with war, but it is one of a very different kind. It directly affects everyone\u2019s entire way of life.</p> <p>The powers set out in the bill are vast. Ministers are given wide authority to govern by regulations that will not be properly scrutinised. The issues range from the NHS and the cremation of the dead through food supplies and transport to legal proceedings, elections and public order, as well as powers over the infectious. The overarching approach of the bill is to mobilise against the outbreak by removing checks, diluting procedures and strengthening powers. But the powers outlined in the bill are stuffed with potential civil liberty, privacy, surveillance and data protection issues.</p> <p>The bill\u2019s starting point is the very real need to mobilise people and resources to strengthen the NHS in the face of the emergency. But the issues and implications in the bill go beyond public health. In section 49, the government confers a power on police and immigration officers \u201cto direct individuals to attend, remove [a potentially infected person] to, or keep them at suitable locations for screening and assessment\u201d. Though the origins of this section lie in legitimate public health concerns, it raises extended issues of powers of arrest, search and detention. In the past, such powers have repeatedly been civil liberty minefields regarding issues such as vagrancy and suspicious behaviour. These will need to be transparently applied and tenaciously monitored in ways that earlier powers were not.</p> <p>It is therefore vital that parliament should have enough time to debate the coronavirus bill. That is not the case under the government\u2019s proposed timetable, agreed with Labour. There is huge pressure to get the bill into law so that its powers can be used. So the first and most important overarching change that should be made to the bill is to introduce a sunset clause. The bill is set to be enacted for two years. This is too long. The various powers should cease unless parliament votes to renew them \u2013 and has the opportunity to amend them \u2013 at intervals of six months. In a related reform, parliament should also seize this opportunity to change its antique, unhealthy voting system of queueing in lobbies, and introduce electronic voting.</p> <p>Legislate in haste but repent at leisure is <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/19/respect-rights-covid-19-response\">no idle warning</a>. Many powers from the 1939-45 war remained in force far longer in postwar peacetime than in the war years themselves. The last of them only disappeared for good in 1964. Anti-terrorism legislation and emergency powers in Northern Ireland have required renewals of this kind, and properly so. These are extraordinary times and they require strong collective action by the state and the people. But they do not require powers that end up creating as many problems as they solve, and which could have been resolved by proper legislative scrutiny.</p>",

It is thought that up to 8,000 were likely to be caught in the web of misery.</p> <p>The reasons why this deplorable event occurred are complex. The trap had been set by decades of restrictive immigration laws and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/immigration-law-key-clause-protecting-windrush-immigrants-removed-in-2014\" title=\"\">questionable decisions</a>. But it was sprung by the Conservatives\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a> policy. Two immigration acts in 2014 and 2016 had the <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/briefing-what-is-the-hostile-environment-where-does-it-come-from-who-does-it-affect/\" title=\"\">effect</a> of requiring long-term residents to prove their right to be in the UK, limiting access to services if they could not do so, in a system of citizen-on-citizen immigration checks.</p> <p>Ms Williams, who had been <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/javid-appoints-police-watchdog-lead-windrush-review\" title=\"\">appointed</a> by Sajid Javid as part of the clean-up operation, took the Home Office to task for failing to look out for people it had responsibility for. A senior official in the report describes as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the fact that \u201cmost of the policymakers were white and most of the people involved were black\u201d. That is one way of putting it. Ms Williams suggests a culture stained with \u201cdisbelief and carelessness\u201d, and ingrained \u201cignorance and thoughtlessness\u201d, much of which chimed with the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51961933\" title=\"\">charge of institutional racism</a>.</p> <p>Priti Patel, the current home secretary, was right to apologise. But she was wrong to point the finger of blame at <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/priti-patel-windrush-scandal-apology-a4391911.html\" title=\"\">New Labour</a>. True, Labour ministers shamefully employed the language of the hostile environment. But this was <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081023091612/http:/www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/reports/indreview/indreview.pdf?view=Binary\" title=\"\">not backed</a> by statute. That was left to the Conservative governments that took over. In the last decade, officials and ministers ignored warning signs about the implications of their actions. When stories emerged, in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/i-cant-eat-or-sleep-the-grandmother-threatened-with-deportation-after-50-years-in-britain\" title=\"\">paper</a>, of the Windrush generation, those who came to Britain between 1948 and 1973, falling victim to the harsher immigration controls in 2017, the Home Office sat on its hands.</p> <p>In 2018 Theresa May, who had been the architect of the Tories\u2019 hostile environment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/no-10-refuses-caribbean-request-to-discuss-children-of-windrush\" title=\"\">proved so tin-eared</a> that she initially refused a formal diplomatic request from Caribbean leaders at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting to discuss the matter. Mrs May only relented when the visiting prime ministers went public with their concerns. The Home Office now runs a \u201c<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/compliant-environment-turning-ordinary-people-into-border-guards-should-concern-everyone-in-the-uk-107066\" title=\"\">compliant environment</a>\u201d. This is a change of label rather than a change of product. Ms Williams\u2019 recommendations should be implemented. The Home Office must acknowledge wrong, be open, more human, and have a race advisory board. Crucially, there needs to be a full review of the hostile environment.</p> <p>It was David Cameron who stripped away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/19/cameron-axe-equality-assessments\" title=\"\">the checks and balances</a> vital to cut the risk of policies\u2019 unintended consequences. This mentality contributed to the Windrush scandal. There is a significant lesson to learn here: political considerations must not drive internal targets, priorities and behaviour despite contrary evidence and with an indifference to humanity.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has sown fresh confusion about the US government\u2019s response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic by claiming that a therapeutic drug will be available \u201calmost immediately\u201d \u2013 only to be contradicted by officials.</p> \n<p>In the latest measure to combat the spread of the virus, the State Department on Thursday issued a new alert urging Americans not to travel abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas</p> \n<p>The global level four warning was unprecedented as such alerts are generally reserved for specific countries embroiled in conflict, natural disasters or where Americans face specific risks.</p> \n<p>But the significant move came shortly after a worryingly rambling performance at Thursday\u2019s White House press conference, the president asserted that chloroquine, used to combat malaria, had been approved and would be made available by prescription.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/medical-workers-self-isolate-home-fears-coronavirus\">Medical workers self-isolate amid fears of bringing coronavirus home</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing great with the vaccines but there\u2019s still a long process, but the therapies are something we can move on much faster potentially,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms \u2013 make people better.</p> \n<p>\u201cChloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine, this is a common malaria drug.

I really do.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe will be helping the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/us-airline-industry-seeks-50-billion-bailout-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">airline industry</a>.

If we don\u2019t have to use it, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also took a swipe at China, where the virus was first reported, musing: \u201cIf people would have known about it, could have been stopped in place, it could have been stopped where it came from, China.\u201d</p> \n<p>This prompted criticism from his presumptive rival in the presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden. His campaign said in statement: \u201cThe reality is, he did know about it and experts spent months trying to prompt Trump into action as he downplayed the growing threat of the virus and praised the Chinese government\u2019s bungled early response \u2013 at a time when Vice-President Biden warned him not to take their word about the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow, as this crisis explodes on his watch, Trump is desperately lashing out to try to cover up his incompetence and mismanagement.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a series of bizarre riffs, Trump described social distancing as a \u201chot term\u201d now and chastised reporters for sitting too close together.

In a profoundly weird finale, a reporter from the pro-Trump One America News Network asked: \u201cMr President, do you consider the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 to be racist because it is food that originated from China?\u201d</p> \n<p>He answered: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s racist at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unusually, Trump is not thought to have made contact with the House speaker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the architect of his impeachment last year. Instead he has delegated negotiations to the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who is said to have established a working relationship with Pelosi.</p> \n<p>On Thursday the Senate began work on a $1tn-plus package to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic.

The following day an immigration official emailed back to say they \u201cwould need to think carefully about how to respond\u201d.</p> <p>By the end of 2017, the Home Office acknowledged internally that the Guardian was \u201cuncovering a series of cases with a pattern that could no longer be interpreted as unique or a \u2018one-off\u2019\u201d. But no action was taken.</p> <p>When the Home Office realised it might have an issue with \u201ca few people\u201d, press officers were briefed to respond: \u201cWe\u2019re taking a closer look.\u201d But by February, senior officials told the press office staff to take a new line, in effect blaming individuals for their own difficulties, and claiming it was their own responsibility to sort out their status. \u201cThose who have resided in the UK for an extended period but feel they may not have the correct documentation confirming their leave to remain should take legal advice and submit the appropriate application with correct documentation so we can progress the case.\u201d</p> <p>That day, I spent a long time on the phone explaining to a press officer that people were not taking legal advice because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/25/windrush-scandal-immigration-legal-aid\">legal aid for immigration cases had been abolished</a> in 2012 by the government, and paying for a lawyer was unaffordable if you had been sacked from your job and denied benefits as a result of a Home Office decision to classify you as an illegal immigrant. People affected were also unable to make the application because the fees were unaffordable.</p> <p>By March, the press office had again changed its response. Now it asserted that: \u201cWe value the contribution made by Commonwealth citizens who have made a life in the UK.\u201d It was a peculiar formulation (which still remains in use by the press office), since Commonwealth citizens were coming forward in large numbers to describe how little they felt valued by a government that was treating them as if they had broken immigration laws.</p> <p>Downing Street remained oblivious to the growing unease.

London being in \u201clockdown\u201d could mean quarantine and martial law (never a prospect, as No 10 made clear today) or just all the pubs being closed (still an option). And now we have got \u201cturn the tide\u201d, which Boris Johnson says the UK will be able to do within 12 weeks. Many people will hear that as a prediction that after three months life will start getting back to normal. But it may very well not mean that, as Johnson came close to acknowledging when he faced questions.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from his press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that the UK would be able to \u201cturn the tide\u201d in the fight against coronavirus in the next 12 weeks.</strong> In his opening remarks in the press conference, responding to growing public concern about how long the social distancing measures now in force might last, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m conscious as the days have gone by that people will want to know how long we\u2019re expecting them to keep it up.</p> \n   <p>I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country. </p> \n   <p>But only if we all take the steps that we\u2019ve outlined, that is vital, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce the peak and once we\u2019ve achieved that and I think that we will, if we take the steps I\u2019ve said, then the scientific progress that we\u2019ve been making will really start coming into play.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson argued that by the middle of June scientific advances would be helping considerably in the fight against coronavirus (see below). But, when asked if he thought that people would be able to go on their summer holidays, he refused to give a direct answer to the question. And, when asked to explain what he meant by turning the tide within 12 weeks, he said he could not be sure the UK would be on the \u201cdownward slope\u201d at that point. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I believe that a combination of the measures that we\u2019re asking the public to take and better testing, scientific progress, will enable us to get on top of it within the next twelve weeks and turn the tide. </p> \n   <p>Now I cannot stand here and tell you that by the end of June that we will be on the downward slope. It\u2019s possible but I simply can\u2019t say that that\u2019s for certain, of course not, we don\u2019t know where we are, and we don\u2019t know how long this thing will go on for. </p> \n   <p>But what I can say is that this is going to be finite, we will turn the tide, and I can see how to do it within the next 12 weeks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a sensitive topic because, if coronavirus cannot be beaten within 12 weeks, then the social distancing measures in place now could stay in force for potentially a year or more. In <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">the Imperial College paper (pdf)</a> published on Monday, which explained the modelling that persuaded the government drastic \u201csuppression\u201d measures were vital, the authors said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \u2013 or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission \u2013 will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) \u2013 given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/19/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-london-lockdown-williamson-refuses-to-rule-out-government-putting-london-in-lockdown-by-weekend?page=with:block-5e7366928f085e564ad87186#block-5e7366928f085e564ad87186\">At a briefing this morning </a><strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser suggested that a long-term \u201cexit strategy\u201d from the current coronavirus policy could involve waiting for a vaccine.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson says the first British patient had been put in a randomised trial for a treatment for coronavirus. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he expected that relatively soon the government would be able to do mass testing to see if people had had coronavirus. </strong>This could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d, he claimed, because it would allow the government to track the disease and determine when people could safely go back to work. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To give you an idea of what is coming down the track, we\u2019re in negotiations today to buy a so-called antibody test, as simple as a pregnancy test which can tell whether you have had the disease and it\u2019s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable. Because obviously it has the potential to be a total game changer.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would tomorrow announce more details of measures to help businesses and workers.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He appealed to retailers not to engage in profiteering.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On mass buying and the price issue, I really hope that retailers will continue to be reasonable. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to see profiteering of any kind.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that compliance with social distancing rules in some parts of London was \u201cvery patchy\u201d and he did not rule out bringing in tougher measures for the capital. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we feel that [the current advice] isn\u2019t working and we need to bring forward tougher measure, nothing is ruled out.</p> \n   <p>It is vital that people follow that advice. There is huge evidence that they are [social distancing] in the takings of the retail sector, the hospitality sector, TfL [Transport of London] in inner London down about 50%, in outer London 60%, but some evidence that in parts of the capital it is very patchy and some areas where people aren\u2019t following it in quite the way we need them to do. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there was no prospect of public transport being shut in the capital, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no prospect of us wanting to stop public transport in London or stop the Tube or the buses.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said that it would be at least two weeks before the social distancing measures now in place might lead to the infection rate slowing.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To be clear: even if everybody does all the things we hope and really, really would ask that they will do, the numbers will continue to go up over the next two weeks because there\u2019s a lag until things start to improve.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said he was minded to give up holding press conferences in a room with journalists because that implied they were not taking social distancing advice seriously.</strong> But he did want to continue speaking to the media daily, he said, suggesting they might take place remotely.

The Guardian found one small pharmacy in south London offering paper bags of 13 paracetamol at 15p per tablet and without labelling, compared to 4p per tablet in supermarket packs last week. The same store was also selling a sample-sized bottle of hand sanitiser for \u00a34, when standard supermarket bottles of hand sanitiser are 300ml, roughly six times the volume, and were priced at \u00a33.49.</p> \n  <p>The regulator, the <strong>General Pharmaceutical Council</strong>, told us that pharmacists may need to \u201cdepart from established procedures\u201d given current exceptional circumstances and prepare smaller packs to keep families supplied, but should only sell them with the appropriate labelling and safety information. \u201cThe care of patients and the public should be the primary concern of pharmacy owners and professionals and they should not be exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic for financial gain,\u201d a spokesperson said. </p> \n  <p>The <strong>Royal Pharmaceutical Society</strong>, which represents pharmacists, said that splitting packs of paracetamol in this way was not normally within the rules, but that it was accepted that flexibility was needed. Its director of pharmacy Robbie Turner said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because of coronavirus, demand for paracetamol is high and frontline pharmacists are faced with making difficult decisions about the supply of medicines every day.

It finished a few minutes ago. Glen is a junior minister and he did not have anything to announce to MPs. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor and his boss, has already said that the government is working urgently on a package of measures to help who are losing work and mostly Glen just kept telling MPs that the Treasury was still working on these measures urgently.</p> \n  <p>But, nevertheless, the session was highly revealing because it showed that backbench Conservative MPs are alarmed by the government\u2019s lack of action on this issue so far. Opposition MPs were also very critical, but that is what you would expect. Here are some of the comments from Conservatives.</p> \n  <p>From <strong>Greg Clark</strong>, the former business secretary who tabled the urgent question</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All employers have an account with HRMC to pay tax for employees through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The monthly wage bill is known to HMRC. </p> \n   <p>Instead of firms paying PAYE to the government, that flow should now be reversed with the nation paying the wages of people for the next weeks if, and only if, they continue to employ their staff. </p> \n   <p>Separate arrangements would need to be made for the self-employed, but at a stroke this would save people\u2019s jobs, save businesses and put an immediate end to the risk of contagion and help save the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is similar to the ideas being proposed by the CBI and by the Resolution Foundation.</p> \n  <p>From <strong>Sir Iain Duncan Smith</strong>, the former work and pensions secretary</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is something else the government can do, literally today. Universal credit has three basic levers which could all be pulled now enormously to help people who are in work. One, the taper could be lowered dramatically at this stage, which would push the floor right up underneath people in work at the moment, allowing them to fall back on that if government\u2019s cannot deal with them.</p> \n   <p>Second, you could change the benefit rates allowing the greater expanse of money to flow to them. This could be done today.</p> \n   <p>The third areas is to look at the waiting time [for benefits] and reduce that almost immediately. </p> \n   <p>Those three things were always built into the flexibility. They can be done today, they can be delivered within days by the department that already has the ability to do that whilst he gets on with this other facility.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1240594616082145281\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUniversal Credit has three basic levers that could all be pulled now\u2026 to help people who are in work,\u201d says Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith <br><br>\u201cThis could be done today\u201d<br><br>Treasury economic secretary John Glen says he is looking at \u201call options\u201d<a href=\"https://t.co/5vned14aOf\">https://t.co/5vned14aOf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kf3ttTZnnH\">pic.twitter.com/kf3ttTZnnH</a></p>\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1240594616082145281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>From <strong>Sir Bernard Jenkin</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those of us who are not in the engine room of government are being told by our constituents that, welcome as Tuesday\u2019s package was, it\u2019s simply not going to be enough.

It summarises the plan like this:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The government should introduce a new statutory retention pay (SRP) scheme in which people who don\u2019t have work to do stay formally employed by their firm, but with a significant amount of their pay covered by the state. Firms would continue to pay workers at least two-thirds of their previous wages via their payroll, with the state providing a rebate for those payments at a cost of \u00a34bn for an initial six months if 500,000 employees were involved, and \u00a38bn if a million were. A simpler flat-rate payment of \u00a3151 per week would cost \u00a33.6bn if 1 million workers were involved.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/resfoundation/status/1240552337527025664\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today we propose a new Statutory Retention Pay (SRP) scheme so people who don\u2019t have to work stay formally employed by their firm, with a significant amount of their pay covered by the state.

It wants <strong>statutory sick pay to be extended and made more generous</strong>. It explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On statutory sick pay (SSP), the government should extend it to the 2m employees who earn less than \u00a3118 per week (\u00a3120 from April) and are ineligible. This would cost around \u00a3200m. The government could go further and make SSP more generous, but only if it met the costs of that increase, for small and medium-sized firms at least. Increasing SSP from \u00a395.85 to \u00a3160 per week would ensure it covered half the earnings of employees that rely on it, up from the current third, and cost a further \u00a3800m for small and medium-sized firms.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And it is also calling for <strong>universal credit payments to be made more generous.</strong> It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To protect families affected from hardship, and strengthen the automatic stabilisers that support demand in the economy, the government also needs to strengthen the social safety net. The main adult rate of out-of-work support in universal credit (UC) and other benefits should rise by one-third, to \u00a3100 per week, with equivalent increases in young-adult and couple rates. This would cost \u00a310bn over a year. The government could go further and target a 10 per cent uprating of other elements of the means-tested benefit system (UC and tax credits), which would bring the total cost to \u00a313bn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/resfoundation/status/1240556112669110272\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Given the scale of the current economic shock, job losses are inevitable.

This week the government has already a series of measures unprecedented in peacetime to fight coronavirus by limiting social contact. But there are indications that it is going to go even further. For the last 24 hours there have been widespread reports that Boris Johnson is planning to enforce measures that would put London, where the coronavirus outbreak is most advanced, under some form of effective lockdown. And in interviews this morning <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong>, the education secretary, did not rule it out.</p> \n  <p>On the Today programme, asked if the government would shut down bars, restaurants and tube stations in the capital, he said Johnson said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7261068f085e564ad86a2f#block-5e7261068f085e564ad86a2f\">at his press conference yesterday</a> that there were no plans to do that. But Williamson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But the prime minister will constantly be informed by the scientific and medical evidence. And, as has been demonstrated by the unprecedented move that we made yesterday in terms of closing schools, scrapping exams and all forms of other assessment, we will take the incredibly tough decisions that are sometimes needed in order to ensure the safety of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if that meant the government would be willing to implement these measures, Williamson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister has at every stage in terms of dealing with this demonstrated that he will provide the leadership that is required in order to deal with some of the most difficult decisions that any prime minister has ever had to deal with in peacetime. But, as the prime minister said, there are certainly no plans to do so at the moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Quite what a lockdown in the capital would involve is not clear, but<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4648d3d4-693c-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\"> in the Financial Times (paywall)</a> <strong>George Parker </strong>and<strong> Jim Pickard</strong> say one option might involve people being ordered to largely stay at home from Friday. They report:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>According to one person briefed on the proposal, there would be a full lockdown of the capital with only one person allowed to leave home at a time, with no entry to local shopping areas. </p> \n   <p> Supermarkets would be guarded by police, while pharmacies would be among the few other shops to remain open. </p> \n   <p> Two officials briefed on the proposals said residents and business would be given just 12 hours\u2019 notice of the new restrictions.

  "<p>Here is a disc that lives up to its title. The baritone St\u00e9phane Degout and pianist Simon Lepper give us a stormy sequence of songs and ballads, most of them steeped in the German Romantic tradition, all of them delivered with the dramatic sense of true storytellers.</p> <p>They start with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/franz-schubert\">Schubert</a>\u2019s Der Zwerg, spinning a gothic tale of a murderous dwarf, and then move on through similarly dark-painted numbers by Loewe, Schumann and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johannes-brahms\">Brahms</a> to Wolf\u2019s deliciously creepy Der Feuerreiter. Loewe\u2019s setting of Edward \u2013 in which a man confesses to his mother that he has killed his father, then curses her for making him do it \u2013 seems fiery enough until you hear Brahms\u2019s duet setting of the same poem, which comprehensively eclipses it, especially in such an urgent, edge-of-the-seat performance as this. It\u2019s Felicity Palmer, no less, who sings the mother, and she\u2019s wonderfully vivid; for the next number, Brahms\u2019s Die Nonne und der Ritter, it\u2019s the tender-voiced Marielou Jacquard who sings the melancholy nun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c99b6c07171c576fbea8a99597b1d5460c46f89d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c99b6c07171c576fbea8a99597b1d5460c46f89d/0_0_900_900/500.jpg\" alt=\"Epic: Lieder &amp; Balladen album artwork\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Epic: Lieder &amp; Balladen album artwork</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Otherwise it\u2019s just Degout and Lepper, whose nuanced, perfectly paced playing provides all the colour and illustrative touches these songs require: the flickering torchlight in Belshazzar\u2019s castle as imagined by Schumann, the wind playing through the strings of a cimbalom as conjured by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/franz-liszt\">Liszt</a>. It\u2019s with Liszt that the disc ends: the Three Petrarch Sonnets, that in this context offer light relief. They are beautifully handled, Lepper\u2019s playing flowing and just on the right side of understatement, Degout offering a masterclass in vocal control.</p> <p>There\u2019s some seriously superb singing on this disc: throughout, there\u2019s the thrill of hearing a big voice perfectly calibrated to the music in hand, used with absolutely security. Degout never loses control, never tips over the line even if he sometimes seems to be standing on the edge, dangling one foot over the abyss. It\u2019s quite a performance.</p> <h2>This week\u2019s other pick</h2> <p>Lucy Stevens\u2019 collection of vocal music by Ethel Smyth (<strong>Dame Ethel Smyth: Songs and Ballad</strong>) is another welcome step in the rediscovery of the music of this perplexingly neglected composer. The Four Songs with chamber orchestra and Stevens joined by the Berkeley Ensemble and the conductor Odaline de la Martinez, are piquant little French-perfumed gems. Stevens\u2019 voice isn\u2019t ideally fulsome higher up, but comes into its own in lower songs including the spellbinding Lullaby and the ballad of Fair Rohtraut, with Elizabeth Marcus the lively pianist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5DDLcOYSxtouQ27GcLMB7z\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5DDLcOYSxtouQ27GcLMB7z\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Everyone is just wondering what is going to happen next.\u201d</p> <p>Gloria Hunter, 14, said she, too, felt suddenly sad, realising Thursday would be her last day at her London comprehensive. \u201cWhile I thought it would be fun at first, the idea of school shutting for the rest of the year made everyone unhappy because of how much we would miss each other,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest, having to be home schooled sounds boring and makes you scared of missing out on things.\u201d</p> <p>As parents begin desperately collating home-schooling ideas and wondering how they will continue to work, teachers are frantically pulling together lesson plans and planning online support for their students. As one tired teacher in Hastings put it: \u201cI didn\u2019t think the apocalypse would have this much admin.\u201d</p> <p>Experts have warned that the early closure of schools could leave children feeling adrift, and without the joyous sense of closure that often comes from leaving school after exams.</p> <p>\u201cAs a clinical psychologist, I am acutely aware of the importance of preparing and having time to process endings and transitions in our lives,\u201d said Natalie Jewitt, clinical psychologist from the Jenby\u2019s school wellbeing project. \u201cWe have to remember that many children have important and supportive relationships with teachers so this will be a huge change for them. It would be good if teachers are able to offer online check-ins for pupils to maintain those relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Parents could also find that the modern-day, exam-focused education system leaves children feeling lost as tests get cancelled, said Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham and co-founder of Action for Happiness. \u201cAt best this could lead to a revival in family discussion and relationships \u2013 but at worst it will be very hard for families to keep children busy who have been formed by an education system that has stripped out all meaning but studying for exams. We haven\u2019t taught our young people how to cope on their own,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, it was already apparent that many parents were feeling overwhelmed. \u201cMy husband is still working, and I am trying to do a full-time job while looking after a seven-year-old and a four-year-old,\u201d said accountant Claire Mcelarney, who like thousands of other parents has joined the Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=871176893326326&amp;ref=br_rs\">Family Lockdown Tips and Ideas</a>. \u201cI\u2019m doing a crap job at working and a crap job at parenting.\u201d</p> <p>Others are, for the moment at least, relishing the challenge. Solicitor Danielle Ayres has drawn up a daily timetable for her nine and seven-year-olds, which includes a workout session with fitness expert Joe Wicks, who has started daily classes at 9am on YouTube. She has joined a Whatsapp group with her children\u2019s friends\u2019 parents, swapping numbers so the children can communicate over the video chat app FaceTime \u2013 and the group is planning an online Bake Off competition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/parental-warning-summer-holidays-just-got-longer\">Parental warning: the summer holidays just got a whole lot longer | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is going to be a struggle trying to work and manage them but up to now, we\u2019re doing OK and will do OK with the support from our family and friends,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said there could be positives to school closures, with advances in technology providing opportunities to connect with education, friends, family and activities. \u201cThere is great scope to learn about social responsibility and getting involved,\u201d said Dubicka. \u201cAnd there are plenty of opportunities for families to pull together and share responsibilities like calling grandparents.\u201d</p> <p>But she warned that parents and children could come under a huge amount of pressure, adding that the most vulnerable needed to be protected. \u201cParents and carers also need to look after their own health and try to contain their own anxieties in front of their children,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cEvery child and family is different, so effects will be different \u2013 but clearly there are vulnerable children and young people where increased isolation in a difficult home environment could be very detrimental, therefore it is vital that essential services are protected and supported as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Becky Francis, CEO of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), has warned that closing schools was likely to contribute to growing inequality in the UK, and could leave families who were already struggling financially unable to cope.</p> <p>\u201cWe anticipate that there will be long-term impacts on attainment gaps for disadvantaged pupils; there is a lot of evidence on the impact of summer holidays on the growth of achievement gaps between richer and poorer students,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren from disadvantaged families may be less likely to have close supervision because parents are more likely to have to stay in work, and those are crucial factors to be borne in mind.\u201d</p> <p>The EEF is coordinating with educational providers to look at how the children in most need can be supported, including making sure technology is available, she added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/school-closures-uk-financial-catastrophe-poorer-families\">School closures in the UK are a financial catastrophe for poorer families | Torsten Bell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Thursday, Westminster Academy spent the day informing pupils how classes and support would be moving online with a \u201cvirtual school\u201d, and firmly assuring them that they would still be expected to work, and they would still take exams \u2013 at some point.</p> <p>The school was determined to hold pupils and staff by the hand through uncertain times, said principal Dr Saima Rana, adding that the lack of clarity given when school closures and exam cancellations were announced had heightened concerns. \u201cWe are all infinitely aware of the crisis and are filled with sadness, but we also have to consider a future when Covid-19 comes under control. Our children are our future, and we have filled them with a tremendous sense of uncertainty,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked if she felt worried about what the future held, her pupil, 15-year-old Akasha, remained positive. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are scared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are maybe anxious for our future, and I don\u2019t think that anxiety will go away until the government tells us what\u2019s going to happen.

  "<p>Hospitals in Italy\u2019s central and southern regions are bracing themselves as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases grows daily.</p> \n<p>The rise, which has been particularly steep in Lazio, Campania and Puglia, is believed to be largely the result of the thousands of people who fled south after Lombardy, where the outbreak in Italy began, was quarantined on 8 March. The entire country was put under lockdown on 9 March and rules were tightened on 11 March.</p> \n<p>The number of deaths across Italy rose to 3,405 on Thursday, overtaking China as the country with most fatalities in the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cLooking at the situation in central and southern Italy, you see cases increasing, especially over the last few days,\u201d said Giorgio Sestili, a physicist who is collating studies from Italian scientists and sharing them on the Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/DatiAnalisiCoronavirus/about/?ref=page_internal\">Coronavirus \u2013 Data and Scientific Analysis</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe think this could be due to the many people from the north who travelled south after the 9 March lockdown, and who might have transferred the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to data from Italy\u2019s civil protection authority, there were 823 cases of Covid-19 in Lazio as of Thursday night, compared with 102 on 9 March. In Campania, cases rose from 120 to 652 in 10 days, in Puglia from 50 to 478, in Sicily from 54 to 340, in Calabria from 11 to 169, and in the central Abruzzo region from 30 to 385.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/southern_italy_cases/giv-3902xzjLXoSGUi08/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/southern_italy_cases/giv-3902xzjLXoSGUi08/\">Map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Governors of several southern regions have asked for their borders to be closed off. Soldiers will patrol the streets in Sicily and Naples to ensure citizens comply with the quarantine rules. The Sicilian government has stopped all flights, with the exception of two daily between Rome and the cities of Palermo and Catania, after 30,000 people landed from the north in the space of a week. Some 15,000 also fled to their families in Puglia.</p> \n<p>Compared with better equipped hospitals in the richer north, there are fears that those in the south will struggle to cope with an escalation in cases. The health system in the south has been blighted by cost-cutting, and more than 40 hospitals have closed in recent years.</p> \n<p>Authorities in Campania have converted two hospitals between Naples and Salerno to treat patients with Covid-19, which will increase the number of intensive care beds in the region to more than the current 600.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the problem is that Campania could become a point of reference for other regions in the south that don\u2019t have much capacity,\u201d said Dr Serena Masino, a lecturer in economics and international development at the University of Westminster in London who has spoken to doctors in the south as part of her research.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoctors there are very concerned about a lack of equipment. As of Wednesday, we still had doctors in the main Covid-19 hospitals in Naples without face masks. One doctor had been using the same one for three days. The other concern is family doctors. In Calabria they received masks and goggles last week, but in Campania, as of Wednesday, they had nothing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Doctors have also called for testing to be increased in the south, especially among medical workers, after aggressive testing in Vo\u2019 Euganeo, a town in Veneto where the first person in Italy died of coronavirus, halted the illness.</p> \n<p>Giuseppe Craparo, a doctor in Palermo, said hospitals in the south were bracing themselves for a \u201cmassive tsunami\u201d of coronavirus patients. \u201cWe live in a state of perpetual anticipation, tension and fear,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to attempt to spread the number of cases over time. In recent days, we\u2019ve only been carrying out emergency operations and were asked not to perform any routine surgical operations in order to leave the intensive care ward as open as possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pasquale Gallerano, a physician at a hospital in Sciacca, a town in the Sicilian province of Agrigento, said about a dozen cases had so far emerged. \u201cBut if we experience an outbreak of the magnitude in the north, we will face enormous pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe currently have no space in intensive care and are already sending Covid-19 patients to Palermo.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cases of the virus rose across Italy to 41,035 on Thursday, including 4,440 people who have recovered.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe next few days will still be very difficult,\u201d said Sestili. \u201cBut the fundamental thing over the next few weeks will be how the regions in the centre-south perform, because if we succeed in keeping it under control there, we can hope for a positive outcome.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

  "<p>The former Labour MP Bruce George, who has died aged 77, had a profound belief in the need for a strong defence of the UK and chaired the Commons defence select committee throughout the first two parliaments of the Blair government. Although his views on defence issues were not those of the Labour party mainstream, he was widely respected and admired by his parliamentary colleagues in all parties as a politician of immense diligence and decency.</p> <p>He sat on the backbenches as the MP for Walsall South for 36 years until his retirement in 2010. While he never won political promotion at Westminster, he nevertheless secured international recognition for his work as part of the UK delegation to Nato for 29 years and of the assembly of the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe), of which he was a member from 1992 until 2010, and of which he was elected president for two years from 2002.</p> <p>He was also popular in his West Midlands constituency because he was accessible as an MP with a hands-on approach to dealing with local problems.</p> <p>George regarded the select committee system at Westminster as \u201cthe jewel in the crown of our legislature\u201d because it provided a means to hold any government to account. After first winning his seat in February 1974, he was appointed to the defence select committee in 1979, when the new system was introduced, and would later tell a Commons debate in 1992 that a properly functioning and financed select committee system could help redress the inexorable decline of the legislature. \u201cIf we simply allow the government to get away with telling us what to do and tinkering with the existing system, we shall deserve to slip even further into political impotence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He remained a member of the committee until he was obliged to stand down in 2005 because of a rule limiting the chairmanship to two parliamentary terms. It was a measure of his status in the post that he had been made a member of the privy council in 2001, a highly unusual mark of respect for a backbencher.</p> <p>He was born in Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, the only child of Edgar George, a former police officer who became the head of security for the National Coal Board in south Wales, and his wife Phyllis (nee Thomas). He won a place at the grammar school in Mountain Ash, studied for a BA in politics at the University College of Wales, Swansea, and, after two years working as an assistant lecturer in social studies at Glamorgan Polytechnic (now the University of Glamorgan, 1964-66), qualified for an MA at the University of Warwick.</p> <p>He lectured in politics at Manchester Polytechnic (now Manchester Metropolitan University, 1968-70) and as a senior lecturer at Birmingham Polytechnic (Birmingham City University) until winning Walsall South from the Conservatives in Labour\u2019s unexpected victory in the first 1974 election.</p> <p>In his maiden speech in the debate on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/03/lord-healey\" title=\"\">Denis Healey</a>\u2019s first budget as Labour chancellor, George described his constituency as one of the workshops in the heart of the country that had helped produce much of the wealth of the land, but of which there was very little evidence on the streets of Walsall, where in some areas 20% of his electorate faced unemployment. His speech evoked his background, raised as he had been in the socialist tradition of the valleys of south Wales.</p> <p>He had joined the Labour party there, while still an undergraduate in 1963, and his political commitment led him to contest the safe Conservative seat of Southport in the 1970 election. In a more practical demonstration of his political beliefs at that time, from 1970 he also worked as a part-time lecturer for the newly established Open University when the first students were enrolled.</p> <p>He cut an amiable, if somewhat shambolic, figure in the corridors of the Commons. He seemed to personify the polytechnic lecturer from an early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/oct/23/fiction.kingsleyamis\" title=\"\">Kingsley Amis</a>\u2019 novel: he was a big man, untidy and dishevelled and always carrying paperwork. He had a voracious appetite for reading and his parliamentary office was remarkable for the quantity of books and papers he had piled on every surface. Even after election as an MP he worked as a visiting lecturer at the University of Essex (1985-86) and as a visiting professor at the University of Portsmouth (from 2009).</p> <p>He had a wide range of international interests, was a member of a number of parliamentary international groups and published numerous books and articles on defence and foreign affairs. He turned out regularly for the Commons Football Club, of which he was a joint founder, supported Walsall FC and played snooker. He was an unpaid consultant to the Confederation of Long Distance Pigeon Racing Associations, loved Gilbert and Sullivan and, suffering himself from psoriasis, was vice-president of the <a href=\"https://www.psoriasis-association.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Psoriasis Association</a>.</p> <p>He married Lisa Toelle in 1992 when he was 50, and his marriage brought him much contentment in later life.

A guide to intimacy during the coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/\">Crisis Text Line</a>, which operates in the US, UK and Canada, has seen a huge rise in volume since late February, and 80% of the texts it receives about coronavirus deal with anxiety.</p> <p>In these unprecedented times, what can people do to bring themselves a bit of mental relief?</p> <h2>Acknowledge your anxiety </h2> <p>People deal with anxiety in ways that range from harmless to harmful \u2013 from binge-watching TV to comfort eating and alcohol. But the commonality is that these are ways of avoiding dealing with it, says psychiatrist Dr Richa Bhatia.</p> <p>First, she recommends acknowledging that anxiety, which is a normal evolutionary reaction to a perceived danger or threat.</p> <p>And Bhatia suggests trying to reframe anxiety as \u201ca set of feelings, thoughts and emotions\u201d rather than something defining to you or your life. \u201cFeelings come and go and they will pass, and that\u2019s what we have to remind ourselves when we are feeling anxious.\u201d</p> <h2>Schedule worrying </h2> <p>If the worry gets overwhelming, Bhatia recommends putting aside a set time for it, say 30 minutes a day. \u201cThis might seem counterintuitive, but it can actually help reduce worrying.\u201d The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) <a href=\"http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=fs_WORRY\">says</a> setting a daily half-hour \u201cworry period\u201d at the same time and place helps to stay in the present moment the rest of the day. During the allotted slot it recommends \u201cdistinguishing between worries over which you have little or no control, and worries about problems you can influence.\u201d</p> <p>Limiting daily news consumption may be wise. \u201cIf you\u2019re losing sleep over what\u2019s happening or you\u2019re unable to concentrate on anything other than the risk that someone in your life has, you should probably consider [lowering] your dose of media to once a day,\u201d says Dr Ken Duckworth, medical director of National Alliance on Mental Illness (Nami).<strong> </strong>Apps like <a href=\"https://freedom.to/dashboard\">Freedom</a>, which enable you to block certain websites for specific time periods, can help with this.</p> <h2>Reframe the situation</h2> <p>You are not \u201cstuck inside\u201d. No, you are indulging in a long-awaited opportunity to slow down, focus on yourself and your home, <a href=\"https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/covid-19-lockdown-guide-how-manage-anxiety-and\">writes</a> psychologist Dr Aarti Gupta at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.</p> <p>\u201cDoing one productive thing per day can lead to a more positive attitude,\u201d she writes. \u201cSet your sights on long-avoided tasks, reorganize, or create something you\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d</p> <h2>Set quarantine rituals</h2> <p>With all the additional time spent not commuting or getting to places, Gupta suggests using it to do something special with new rituals. This could entail a walk first thing in the morning, starting a journal, or speaking to a family member every morning on FaceTime.</p> <p>\u201cHaving something special during this time will help you look forward to each new day,\u201d she <a href=\"https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/covid-19-lockdown-guide-how-manage-anxiety-and\">writes</a>.</p> <h2>Get moving</h2> <p>Exercise is a \u201cclassic anxiety reduction strategy\u201d, says Duckworth. A <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-018-9976-0\">review</a> in the Journal of Happiness Studies found that those who exercise just one day a week may experience a happiness boost. It could be YouTube classes, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/02/writers-try-10-big-fitness-apps-weightlifting-pilates\">fitness app</a>, cycling, jogging \u2013 and a New York club called <a href=\"https://nowadays.nyc/\">Nowadays</a> has created an online \u201cvirtual club\u201d with live DJ sets every night.</p> <h2>Small acts of altruism</h2> <p>Helping others can give you a sense of purpose and control. Do you have an elderly or sick neighbor you can offer your services to? \u201cThe idea is to get out of the helpless zone if you can. If you can get out of that then be an agent,\u201d says Duckworth.</p> <h2>Physical distancing, not social distancing</h2> <p>It goes without saying, but \u201cloneliness is bad for humans,\u201d says Duckworth. Have a coffee over FaceTime. Call your parents or kids every day. </p> <p>While in some ways coronavirus is isolating, Bhatia says it is worth remembering that it\u2019s a shared global experience. \u201cEverybody\u2019s affected to different degrees, but the bottom line is that everybody\u2019s in it together, and scientists all over the world are trying to work on it together to find a solution quickly.\u201d</p> <h2>More resources</h2> <ul> <li><p>Mindful walking, breathing and eating for just a couple of minutes several times a day can help with anxiety, says Bhatia. The aim of mindfulness is to bring the mind to the present moment \u2013 or the process of trying to.

  "<p>James Alefantis first learned about the conspiracy theory surrounding his pizzeria from a reporter\u2019s phone call. In the waning days of the 2016 election, Will Sommer, then of the Washington City Paper in DC, had been following a thread on the site Reddit in which leaked emails from the Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta were used to justify an elaborate, and entirely false, story of a Clinton-run child abuse ring in the back of Comet Ping Pong pizza. Alefantis had never heard of the faux online hysteria and assumed, as he recalled in HBO\u2019s new documentary After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News, that \u201ceverybody is up about this election and passions are high \u2013 I\u2019m sure this will go away in a couple of days\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/mcmillions-bizarre-story-how-one-man-stole-24m-mcdonalds-hbo\">McMillions: the bizarre story of how one man stole $24m from McDonald's</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It did not go away. The ludicrous theory, known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/business/media/comet-ping-pong-pizza-shooting-fake-news-consequences.html\">Pizzagate</a>, was picked up and propagated by infamous conspiracy monger Alex Jones, and disseminated on Facebook and Twitter. Harassment of Comet and its staff escalated: one-star Yelp reviews appeared with references to child dungeons. Pictures of Alefantis posted to Instagram of his godchildren were repurposed to attack him as a pedophile, with specific, hateful references to his identity as a gay man. Prank callers issued death threats. And then, on 4 December 2016, Edgar Welch, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina, convinced from online forums that he had to find the children himself, entered the pizzeria <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/business/media/comet-ping-pong-pizza-shooting-fake-news-consequences.html\">with an AR-15</a>.</p> <p>No one was hurt and Welch was arrested, but the episode underscored the terrifying power of conspiracy theories and fake news articles, cultivated in forums such as Reddit and 4chan and propagated by Facebook and Twitter, to metastasize offline, with dire consequences. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can understand Pizzagate until you see that bodycam footage from the DC metro police that we have in the first 20 minutes of this film,\u201d Brian Stelter, host of CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources and an executive producer of After Truth, told the Guardian. \u201cIt shows how average Americans can be radicalized by insane content on the internet and can be motivated to get in a car with a gun and go confront people at a pizzeria.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLi7cNAJKA8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GLi7cNAJKA8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After Truth tracks the influence of disinformation \u2013 a deliberately disseminated falsehood, as opposed to \u201cmisinformation\u201d, which is an unintentional factual error \u2013 from a niche topic in 2015 through Russian weaponization in the 2016 election and ubiquity in the Trump presidency. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at some of the biggest lies that continue to manipulate people\u2019s imaginations, even after they\u2019ve been thoroughly debunked and clarified,\u201d Andrew Rossi, the director, told the Guardian. Though the term \u201cfake news\u201d dates back to 2014 \u2013 when BuzzFeed News\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/i-helped-popularize-the-term-fake-news-and-now-i-cringe\">Craig Silverman popularized it</a> to describe false stories about the Ebola crisis \u2013 After Truth begins in 2015, with online conspiracies around a military drill in Bastrop county, Texas. Known as <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2018/05/03/hysteria-over-jade-helm-exercise-texas-was-fueled-russians-former-cia-/\">Jade Helm</a>, the theories, harnessed by YouTube personalities, spilled into the town\u2019s real life \u2013 now eerie footage depicts an army spokesperson shouted down by people who dismiss his reassurances as propaganda; instead, they believed an internet personality-driven theory that underground tunnels connected the town\u2019s Walmarts to the military base. The hysteria caught Texas governor Greg Abbott\u2019s attention, who treated it seriously. Russia took notice, and started replicating the pattern heading into America\u2019s election year.</p> <p>Beginning the arc in 2015 was deliberate \u2013 \u201cthis is bigger than any one president or term in office,\u201d said Stelter \u2013 but disinformation certainly ramped up in unison with Donald Trump\u2019s rise to the Republican nomination and, eventually, the presidency. His weaponization of the term \u201cfake news\u201d against legitimate news outlets in January 2017 represented \u201ca signal moment\u201d, said Stelter. \u201cThe president took the term and exploited it for his own political gain. Now, it\u2019s the world\u2019s worst game of whack-a-mole.\u201d</p> <p>After Truth seeks to put a face on the generally amorphous, sterile concept of disinformation, whether that be the pizzeria owner hounded by internet trolls or the frustratingly human role of prejudice and hate as \u201ca foundation for fake stories and as a magnet for people who feel aggrieved to channel their confusion with the world and their disappointment into demonizing a group\u201d, said Rossi. Comet Ping Pong was targeted as an LGBTQ+ safe space, for example; the Barack Obama birtherism theory in the early 2010s, of which Trump was a vocal proponent, was transparently racist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d70c89e3a676db9b81e0be07e40624dec20bcb3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d70c89e3a676db9b81e0be07e40624dec20bcb3d/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Comet, there was a somewhat happy ending: loyal customers rallied around the business, keeping it open. The same cannot be said for the family of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer killed in an unsolved botched robbery in the summer of 2016. Rich\u2019s death became fodder for online conspiracy theorists, who baselessly linked the staffer to DNC emails actually leaked by Russia and claimed murder by the Clintons. The Fox News host Sean Hannity ran a primetime story boosting the Rich conspiracy, which the network later retracted (Hannity never apologized). Aaron Rich, speaking with Rossi, says fighting incessant trolls has left him unable to grieve his brother, even three years later.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s Pizzagate, activating people into believing an outlandish pedophilia ring must be stopped, to Rich conspiracy theorists who feel they have access to privileged information, After Truth explores how much of disinformation\u2019s power lies in human emotion. \u201cFake stories are often successful when they capture their audience\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do in the film is to provide a different story that also appeals to people\u2019s hearts, which is the pain and the devastation that\u2019s caused to the victims of these stories.\u201d</p> <p>Putting a face on disinformation, however, means also looking at its perpetrators; After Truth includes interviews with or footage of noted conspiracy theorists, hucksters or far-right media personalities, including Jones and Jack Burkman, a notoriously incendiary Washington lobbyist who hosted a press conference in 2018 with <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/who-is-jacob-wohl-failed-smears.html\">bad-faith provocateur Jacob Wohl</a>, meant to smear Robert Mueller with a sexual assault allegation that fell apart, somewhat thrillingly, on Rossi\u2019s camera as the \u201cvictim\u201d elects not to show up.</p> <p>Talking to figures who believe all press is good press has been \u201cthe third rail of the project, and has been in the conversation among documentary film-makers who want to tackle this topic,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cHow do we do this without giving oxygen to the liars and propagandists?\u201d For Rossi, it was partly having someone like Burkman admit his cynicism, as in a 2017 interview in which he called disinformation a \u201ctool of war\u201d, like chemical weapons \u2013 if someone else can use it, he says, I may as well use it too. \u201cAnd then also to combine observational film-making with context, to immediately rebut a lie and debunk it in the moment.\u201d Journalists such as Silverman, CNN\u2019s Oliver Darcy, Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher and the New York Times\u2019s Adam Goldman debunk false claims in real time and add crucial context to the film\u2019s scope and timeline. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance to strike,\u201d said Rossi, \u201cbut always make sure it\u2019s not misleading and the truth is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, according to Stelter, when it comes to dispersing or de-escalating disinformation, \u201cthere\u2019s no one solution, there\u2019s no one right answer\u201d. It\u2019s understanding media literacy 101, it\u2019s legislating responsibility for massive platforms of information, Facebook first among them. And in the midst of a once-in-a-generation pandemic in which correct, reliable information and public trust are now literally a matter of life and death, an understanding of the tools of disinformation may be more important than ever. \u201cDisinformation in the sense that our information world is polluted is something we all have in common,\u201d said Stelter. \u201cIt\u2019s something we all share, and it\u2019s a problem that we all collectively have to address.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News premieres on HBO on 19 March and will air in the UK at a later date</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Israel\u2019s secretive Mossad intelligence agency launched a covert international operation this week to fly in up to 100,000 coronavirus testing kits, although the effort may have been in vain as critical parts were reportedly missing.</p> \n<p>Domestic news outlets, citing government and health officials, reported that the secrecy of the operation was because the kits were acquired from at least two unnamed countries that do not have good diplomatic relations with Israel, meaning the government could not openly buy them.</p> \n<p>Israel maintains low-level relations with several states in the Middle East, especially Gulf states, that do not officially recognise it in protest against its treatment of Palestinians.

  "<h2>50. Let Me Sleep Beside You (1967)</h2> <p>A rejected single finally released on a 1970 cash-in compilation, Bowie\u2019s first collaboration with the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/11/tony-visconti-on-david-bowie-death-worst-next-day\">Tony Visconti </a>is better than anything on his debut album. Driven by acoustic guitar, its sound points the way ahead and there\u2019s something appealingly odd, even sinister about the lyrical come-ons: \u201cWear the dress your mother wore.\u201d</p> <h2>49. I Would Be Your Slave (2001)</h2> <p>Uniformly strong, the songwriting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/may/31/shopping.mercuryprize2002\">Heathen</a> stretched from the prosaic \u2013 the letter-to-adult-son of Everyone Says Hi \u2013 to the baffling. Its highlight sits somewhere between: ostensibly a love song that gradually reveals itself to be about God. The melody is beautiful, the arrangement \u2013 very Visconti strings over electronic beats \u2013 perfectly poised.</p> <h2>48. Loving the Alien (1984)</h2> <p>The solitary moment that sparked on 1984\u2019s inspiration-free Tonight. A strange, genuinely great song about religion smothered by overproduction. A 2018 remix helps matters a little, and the stripped-back <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DBwN2Ve9Mc\">00s live versions available online</a> are better yet. The demo version \u2013 much talked up by Bowie in later years \u2013 remains unheard.</p> <h2>47. Jump They Say (1993)</h2> <p>Hailed as a return to peak form on release, Black Tie White Noise was nothing of the sort, but its first single was authentically fantastic. Jittery but commercial funk is undercut by a dark lyric that returned to the subject of Bowie\u2019s mentally ill half-brother Terry, this time brooding on his 1985 suicide.</p> <h2>46. The London Boys (1966)</h2> <p>Tellingly, Bowie\u2019s first great song centred on outsiders. A stark, brass- and woodwind-assisted depiction of those \u2013 like Bowie himself \u2013 left with their noses pressed against the glass of the Swinging London party, it feels like a monochrome kitchen-sink drama compressed into three minutes.</p> <h2>45. Fantastic Voyage (1979)</h2> <p>The album Lodger opened with that rarest of things in the Bowie canon, a protest song. Inspired by the ongoing cold war and its attendant nuclear paranoia, its combination of anger and fatalism still sounds pertinent. The music meanwhile is essentially a gentle reworking of Boys Keep Swinging: same key, same chords, only slower.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e655a265bafba3e1915af83471514a0d64fc8769\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e655a265bafba3e1915af83471514a0d64fc8769/0_0_5351_3724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie in Rotterdam, 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bowie in Rotterdam, 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>44. Lady Stardust (1972)</h2> <p>Ziggy Stardust\u2019s most emotionally affecting moment is one of its most straightforward songs. Driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/may/22/david-bowie-spiders-hull-yorkshire\">Mick Ronson</a>\u2019s piano, it paints a poignant picture beautifully: an overhyped gig by a hot new band, one man in the crowd sadly looking on as his younger ex-lover becomes a star. \u201cI smiled sadly for a love I could not obey.\u201d</p> <h2>43. Seven Years in Tibet (1997)</h2> <p>There was something charming about Bowie\u2019s enthusiastic drum\u2019n\u2019bass experiments on Earthling, but its finest track had nothing to do with them: Bowie suggested it was inspired by 60s soul and the Pixies. Either way, its leaps from eerie atmospherics to blasting, wall-of-noise chorus are really exhilarating: an overlooked triumph.</p> <h2>42. Something in the Air (1998)</h2> <p>Another overlooked 90s gem, from the coolly received Hours, Something in the Air is both limpid and melancholy. The lyrics are filled with regret, the vocal parched and pained behind a liberal sprinkling of electronic distortion \u2013 and, when it hits its chorus, anthemic in a way that hints at All the Young Dudes.</p> <h2>41. Joe the Lion (1977)</h2> <p>Joe the Lion defies explication. Once you get past the opening lines about the transgressive self-mutilating performance artist <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/artists/chris-burden/\">Chris Burden</a> \u2013 \u201cTell you who you are if you nail me to my car\u201d \u2013 the lyrics make virtually no sense at all. The music \u2013 arcing, frantic atonal guitar and gibbering backing vocals \u2013 sounds deranged; Bowie sings like a man on the brink of a nervous breakdown. It is ridiculously<em> </em>exciting.</p> <h2>40. Hallo Spaceboy (1995)</h2> <p>After a decade spent courting the mainstream, Bowie clearly intended Outside to be seen as a grand artistic statement. It occasionally feels a bit laboured, but its highlights rank high: a Space Oddity-referencing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfrqK_uVDok\">Pet Shop Boys remix </a>was a hit, but the original of Hallo Spaceboy is pummelling, chaotic and hypnotic.</p> <h2>39. I Can\u2019t Read (1989)</h2> <p>Tin Machine was a hard rock folly that largely hasn\u2019t aged well, but I Can\u2019t Read is the exception that proves the rule: a brilliant, agonised, self-baiting study of the creative inertia that had overwhelmed Bowie in the 80s, over a dense wall of sheet metal guitars and feedback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41a1bfa8c841a03f32a974a485ee8cbea58cf893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a1bfa8c841a03f32a974a485ee8cbea58cf893/0_0_1904_1905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowie in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowie in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Globe/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>38. Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Suicide (1972)</h2> <p>Ostensibly the tragic, French-chanson-and-50s pop-influenced finale to the Ziggy Stardust story, Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Suicide\u2019s epic coda seemed to take on a different, celebratory meaning as Bowie\u2019s star rose, his howl of \u201cYou\u2019re not alone / Give me your hands / You\u2019re wonderful\u201d summing up his effect on his fans.</p> <h2>37. Bring Me the Disco King (2003)</h2> <p>There\u2019s a sense in which the final track on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/12/popandrock.shopping8\">Reality</a>, the last album he made before his decade-long \u201cretirement\u201d, would have worked perfectly as Bowie\u2019s farewell: a beautiful, weary, uncertain and elegiac rumination on the 70s, set to Mike Garson\u2019s distinctive piano, which shifts from hypnotic to spiky and surprising.</p> <h2>36. Always Crashing in the Same Car (1977)</h2> <p>\u201cSelf-pitying crap,\u201d sniffed Bowie subsequently, which tells you more about his despondent mood during Low\u2019s recording than the song itself. Always Crashing in the Same Car is a sublime sliver of moody paranoia, with distracted-sounding vocals, electronics that alternately bubble and drone, wiry, effects-laden guitar.</p> <h2>35. Stay (1976)</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the side-effects of the cocaine,\u201d Bowie protested unconvincingly on Station to Station\u2019s title track, but Stay \u2013 a taut, twitchy funk-rock hybrid \u2013 audibly was. As usual with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie\">Station to Station</a>, the chaos of its creation (\u201ca cocaine frenzy,\u201d according to guitarist <a href=\"http://www.carlosalomar.com/\">Carlos Alomar</a>) isn\u2019t reflected in the finished product: it\u2019s perfectly poised and confident.</p> <h2>34. Cracked Actor (1973)</h2> <p>There is a particular strain of Bowie song from 1973/74 that sounds like the work of someone who has had all the sex and drugs in the world at once. Cracked Actor may be the supreme example. A sleazy, bitter blast of distorted guitar that sounds like it is seconds away from collapse, it\u2019s both intense and electrifying.</p> <h2>33. Moonage Daydream (1972)</h2> <p>You never want for high-drama rock anthemics on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, but Moonage Daydream is the best example. It switches from the opening guitar chord\u2019s strident call to something weirder and more ominous \u2013 its concluding encouragement to \u201cfreak out\u201d doesn\u2019t sound particularly inviting \u2013 and features a mind-blowing Mick Ronson guitar solo.</p> <h2>32. Diamond Dogs (1974)</h2> <p>Halloween Jack, the persona Bowie adopted on Diamond Dogs, never enjoyed the same cultural impact as Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke. That was no fault of the album\u2019s title track, a propulsive, compelling strut that is simultaneously sensual and dark, as evidenced by its troubling opening cry: \u201cThis ain\u2019t rock n\u2019 roll, this is \u2026 genocide!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a97a2968dcb51d93f2f08d83a1d5684f71635535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97a2968dcb51d93f2f08d83a1d5684f71635535/0_0_2501_2663/939.jpg\" alt=\"In New York, 1973.\" width=\"939\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In New York, 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>31. The Width of a Circle (1970)</h2> <p>Not everything on Bowie\u2019s self-consciously heavy album The Man Who Sold the World works, but its opening track is remarkable. It opens with an acoustic guitar that might have stepped off the 1969 David Bowie album, before exploding into something completely different: an eight-minute Ronson-powered homoerotic epic that swaggers with a newfound confidence.</p> <h2>30. John, I\u2019m Only Dancing (1972)</h2> <p>Considered too controversial to release in the US, John, I\u2019m Only Dancing blithely turned the era\u2019s sexual mores on its head: in its lyrics, a straight relationship is the shocking, threatening aberration. The music, meanwhile, sashays insouciantly along \u2013 in another inspired theft, the guitar part is swiped from Alvin Cash\u2019s 1968 funk hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTtKopprSWE\">Keep on Dancing</a>.</p> <h2>29. The Buddha of Suburbia (1993)</h2> <p>Proof that Bowie worked in mysterious ways: it took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/oct/24/catchofthedaybowiesgreat\">a BBC Two adaptation of Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia</a> to return him to full creative power. Amid the Blackstar-prefiguring free-jazz experiments and Low-esque instrumentals lurked the fantastic, self-referential title track, a keen drawing of pre-fame Bowie, \u201cscreaming along in south London \u2026 ready to learn\u201d.</p> <h2>28. Fame (1975)</h2> <p>Made up on the hoof in the studio \u2013 and allegedly constructed by Bowie cutting up a recording of Alomar playing a cover of the Flares\u2019 1961 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcNnIlrQBgI\">Foot Stompin\u2019</a> \u2013 Fame is a fantastic slice of funk, rendered nervy and strange by the pained delivery of lyrics that take a jaundiced view of the song\u2019s subject: \u201cThe flame that burns your change to keep you insane.\u201d</p> <h2>27. Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980)</h2> <p>Boasting a preposterously stage-y mockney vocal \u2013 \u201cshe \u2019ad an \u2019orror of rooms\u201d \u2013 Scary Monsters\u2019 title track apparently dated back to the early 70s. Bowie had attempted to donate it to Iggy Pop, before reconsidering. It\u2019s the album\u2019s most viscerally exciting moment: frenzied and aggressive, it coats everything from the guitars to Bowie\u2019s voice in distortion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81d540a0bb40c9526743e8a981749946b54a7ca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d540a0bb40c9526743e8a981749946b54a7ca3/0_0_3900_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the Glass Spider Tour in 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the Glass Spider Tour in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Steinfeldt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>26. All the Young Dudes (1972)</h2> <p>Glam rock\u2019s unofficial national anthem. All the Young Dudes announced the arrival of a new era in pop via a Lou Reed-ish cast of characters \u2013 cross-dressers, speed freaks talking about suicide \u2013 and a timely, remarkably cocky dismissal of the past: \u201cMy brother\u2019s back at home with his Beatles and his Stones \u2026 what a drag.\u201d</p> <h2>25. Space Oddity (1969)</h2> <p>In his excellent book <a href=\"https://www.foyles.co.uk/author-nicholas-pegg\">The Complete David Bowie</a>, Nicholas Pegg notes that the episodic Space Oddity sounds like something the 60s Bee Gees might have written at their weirdest. He\u2019s absolutely right, although where the Bee Gees would have played up the melodrama, Bowie perfectly inhabits its mood of blank-eyed, space-age alienation.</p> <h2>24. Where Are We Now? (2013)</h2> <p>The excitement over Bowie\u2019s surprise re-emergence perhaps caused The Next Day to be slightly overrated, but its best moments are magnificent, not least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/08/david-bowie-where-now-first-listen\">Where Are We Now?</a>\u2019s recollection of Bowie\u2019s late 70s sojourn in Berlin. Fond, nostalgic and oddly fragile, it still sounds moving.</p> <h2>23. The Man Who Sold the World (1970)</h2> <p>It\u2019s a song that was subsequently rendered as everything from pop-soul (by Lulu) to despairing acoustic commentary on global success and punk rock ethics (Nirvana), but Bowie\u2019s original version has never been bettered. The title track of his eeriest album remains mysterious, creepy and haunting 50 years on.</p> <h2>22. I Can\u2019t Give Everything Away (2016)</h2> <p>Of the Blackstar songs whose meaning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/11/was-david-bowie-saying-goodbye-on-blackstar\">suddenly pulled into focus with the news of Bowie\u2019s death</a>, none is more affecting than I Can\u2019t Give Everything Away. The music is gloriously buoyant, but it\u2019s hard to see the lyrics as anything other than a man bidding farewell, the musical quotation from Low\u2019s A New Career in a New Town perfectly judged and poignant.</p> <h2>21. Fashion (1980)</h2> <p>Brilliantly claustrophobic, reggae-influenced post-punk funk that casts a jaundiced eye over the ever-changing trends in the world of the hip. The ironic tone of Fashion seemed to be largely missed, possibly because the idea of David Bowie, of all people, protesting about ever-changing trends was frankly a bit rich.</p> <h2>20. The Bewlay Brothers (1971)</h2> <p>There\u2019s a compelling argument that the incredible flowering of songwriting talent on Hunky Dory may make it Bowie\u2019s greatest album. Its most striking moment may be its extraordinary, enigmatic acoustic finale \u2013 possibly a depiction of Bowie\u2019s relationship with his half-brother Terry \u2013 that goes from becalmed to chilling to genuinely frightening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f78baf59944781bbeac071cea8942dc7bd5e8da5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f78baf59944781bbeac071cea8942dc7bd5e8da5/0_0_2718_4023/676.jpg\" alt=\"Bowie in 1967.\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowie in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photoshot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>19. The Jean Genie (1973)</h2> <p>Aladdin Sane\u2019s Ziggy-goes-to-America concept in miniature, The Jean Genie is tougher and sleazier than anything on Ziggy Stardust \u2013 its I\u2019m A Man-ish guitar riff and bursts of harmonica sound absolutely filthy. Anyone inclined to view pop\u2019s past through rose-tinted glasses should note it was kept off No 1 by Jimmy Osmond\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriPIujLtsA\">Long-Haired Lover From Liverpool</a>.</p> <h2>18. Let\u2019s Dance (1983)</h2> <p>The difference between Let\u2019s Dance and Bowie\u2019s other 80s pop albums is that his heart was in it; even if he was largely out to make money, he made an effort. If its title track signalled his temporary abandonment of the avant garde, it\u2019s still a superb song, nervier and stranger than its global smash status might suggest.</p> <h2>17. Win (1975)</h2> <p>A ballad draped in echoing, fluttering sax, Win is utterly gorgeous. Despite Bowie\u2019s insistence it was an attack on artistic rivals who didn\u2019t work hard enough, there\u2019s something oddly sexy about it, not least his delivery of the line: \u201cSomeone like you should not be allowed to start any fires.\u201d</p> <h2>16. Rebel Rebel (1974)</h2> <p>Bowie\u2019s fabulous, valedictory farewell to glam, Rebel Rebel is essentially a loving salute to the kids Bowie had inspired, a metaphorical arm around the shoulder of every teenage misfit who had ever posed in a bedroom mirror. \u201cYou tacky thing,\u201d he sings, delightedly, \u201cyou put them on\u201d \u2013 set to one of the all-time great rock riffs.</p> <h2>15. Changes (1971)</h2> <p>A perfectly written, irresistible mission statement that few heeded at the time, Changes has ended up one of Bowie\u2019s most beloved songs. \u201cIt\u2019s saying: \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to be so fast, you\u2019re not going to keep up with me,\u2019\u201d he explained. It would count as youthful arrogance were it not for the fact that his subsequent career bore the boast out.</p> <h2>14. Golden Years (1976)</h2> <p>A moment of straightforward joy amid the complex, troubled emotional terrain of Station to Station, Golden Years perfectly matches its lyrical optimism with glittering, shimmering funk. What it would have sounded like had Bowie\u2019s original plan to give the song to Elvis Presley is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <h2>13. Absolute Beginners (1985)</h2> <p>The theme to Julien Temple\u2019s universally derided film of the same name, Absolute Beginners may well be the high point of Bowie\u2019s 80s commercial phase. It\u2019s a stately, sweeping, undeniable love song that reunited him with the pianist Rick Wakeman, and \u2013 at an artistic nadir \u2013 proved Bowie could still write incredible songs when he felt like it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KcOs70dZAw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2KcOs70dZAw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>12. Boys Keep Swinging (1979)</h2> <p>Greeted with disappointment on release, Lodger\u2019s reputation has grown with the years. It\u2019s uneven, but contains some incredible songs, not least Boys Keep Swinging, which condensed the kind of sonic overload found on \u201cHeroes\u201d into a sparky three-minute pop song, complete with lyrics that archly, camply celebrated machismo.</p> <h2>11. Starman (1972)</h2> <p>More a cultural moment than a song. Starman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYtRp9UNx8Y\">epochal Top of the Pops performance</a> is probably the most celebrated piece of music television in British history. It\u2019s a series of compelling musical steals \u2013 equal parts T Rex, Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Blue Mink\u2019s recent hit Melting Pot (the morse code guitar) \u2013 and a brash announcement of Bowie\u2019s commercial rebirth.</p> <h2>10. Drive-In Saturday (1973)</h2> <p>Glam doo-wop decorated with bursts of fizzing synthesiser, Drive-In Saturday is one of Bowie\u2019s greatest singles, despite its peculiar lyrical premise. In \u201cabout 2033\u201d, nuclear war has caused humanity to forget how to have sex and they have to relearn seduction techniques from old films. Incredibly, given its subject matter, the song sounds swooningly romantic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e457355777da1d17be69474486e4b9d357f74130\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e457355777da1d17be69474486e4b9d357f74130/0_113_1548_1868/829.jpg\" alt=\"Bowie in 1999.\" width=\"829\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowie in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9. \u2019Tis a Pity She Was a Whore (2016)</h2> <p>Before Blackstar was revealed as the most exquisitely staged final act in rock history, it sounded thrillingly like a new beginning. A relentless, intense drum loop decorated with squalls of sax, Tis Pity She Was a Whore was unlike anything Bowie had done before. His final exultant whoop suggests he knew exactly how great it was.</p> <h2>8. Oh! You Pretty Things (1971)</h2> <p>There was an apocalyptic strain in Bowie\u2019s songwriting almost from the start \u2013 see We Are Hungry Men from his 1967 debut \u2013 but it was never more beautifully expressed than on Oh! You Pretty Things, a song that sets an incredibly bleak message to a melody so lovely it could be covered by the lead singer of Herman\u2019s Hermits.</p> <h2>7. Young Americans (1975)</h2> <p>Young Americans represents the point in Bowie\u2019s career where it became apparent he could take virtually any musical genre and bend it to his will. A white British rock star adopting the breezy, sumptuous sound of Philly soul shouldn\u2019t have worked at all, but it did, to life-affirming effect.</p> <h2>6. Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise) (1974)</h2> <p>The medley on side one of Diamond Dogs is the album\u2019s sickly heart, seven minutes of music that takes glam rock as far as it could go. It\u2019s so decadent and diseased-sounding it must have been hard to imagine where Bowie could possibly go next. As it turned out, he was just getting started.</p> <h2>5. \u201cHeroes\u201d (1977)</h2> <p>Its posthumous uplifting-sporting-montage-soundtrack ubiquity means it\u2019s easy to forget what a weird, ambiguous song Heroes is \u2013 it has, metaphorically, lost the quotation marks around its title. But perhaps that is tribute to Bowie\u2019s brand of alchemy: only he could turn six minutes of pulsing electronic noise, howling guitars and screamed vocals into an all-purpose air-punching anthem.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKcl4-tcuo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AZKcl4-tcuo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>4. Life on Mars? (1971)</h2> <p>A no-further-questions masterpiece, bolstered by Ronson\u2019s fantastic string arrangement, Life On Mars?\u2019s confusing gush of images almost defies explication, but might well be Bowie\u2019s first clarion call to suburban misfits. It says a lot about the sheer power of its melody that a song so lyrically impenetrable has become so widely loved.</p> <h2>3. Station to Station (1976)</h2> <p>By his own account so out of control he couldn\u2019t even remember recording it, Bowie somehow contrived to make Station to Station a work of awesome power and focus, as evidenced by the lengthy title track. The shift into its second section \u2013 \u201cOnce there were mountains and mountains\u201d \u2013 is possibly the single most thrilling moment in his entire catalogue.</p> <h2>2. Ashes to Ashes (1980)</h2> <p>Ashes to Ashes is one of those moments in Bowie\u2019s catalogue where the correct response is to stand back and boggle in awe. Presumably a depiction of its author in his drugged-out mid-70s nadir, everything about it \u2013 lingering oddness of its sound, its constantly shifting melody and emotional tenor, its alternately self-mythologising and self-doubting lyrics \u2013 is perfect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c6c3f90c0a6d08b95652490758e305547793b9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6c3f90c0a6d08b95652490758e305547793b9c9/0_0_3000_2093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie (1947-2016).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bowie (1947-2016).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy King/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Sound and Vision (1977)</h2> <p>Picking Bowie\u2019s 50 best songs is a thankless task. His back catalogue is so rich, you inevitably end up having to lose tracks every bit as good as those you have picked in the process: Queen Bitch, Suffragette City, Be My Wife, Dollar Days. Picking his best is even worse, but Sound and Vision is both a fantastic pop song and an act of artistic daring. A three-minute hit single that doesn\u2019t even feature a lead vocal until halfway through, it twists a despondent lyric into something uplifting and, musically, transcends time. Completely original, nothing about its sound tethers it to the mid-70s. Its magic seems to sum Bowie up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0rP98TdRlBYskYSZ6Pfnx1?si=RLzjhf4bRVCkvpthQF9Ulw\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0rP98TdRlBYskYSZ6Pfnx1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",
  "<p>German police have raided properties in 10 states and arrested members of a far-right group after it was banned by the government.</p> <p>The United German Peoples and Tribes organisation belongs to the broader <em>Reichsb\u00fcrger</em> or Citizens of the Reich movement, which rejects the authority of the modern German state and is driven by conspiracy theories. It is armed and considered extremely dangerous, the police said.</p> <p>An interior ministry spokesman said on Thursday that its fight against rightwing extremism would not be halted even during the current global health emergency. \u201cFor the first time, the interior ministry has banned a <em>Reichsb\u00fcrger</em> group,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cEven in these days of crisis, we will continue to fight far-right extremism, racism and antisemitism.</p> <p>Herbert Reul, the interior minister of the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, where the group had its focus, said: \u201cThese people cannot consider themselves safe even in these times of the coronavirus.\u201d He said he was grateful to the federal interior minister, Horst Seehofer, \u201cfor allowing us to proceed against this brown sauce\u201d, in a reference to their Nazi-sympathies.</p> <p>He described the group as a danger to society. \u201cThese people deny the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and agitate against Jews and foreigners,\u201d said Reul. \u201cThis is the right moment to go after people who spread such conspiracy theories. There is no tolerance towards them, only a hard line of action.\u201d</p> <p>Similar to the sovereign citizen movement in the US, the <em>Reichsb\u00fc</em><em>rger</em> movement rejects the modern state, arguing that Germany is not a country but a company. They refuse to recognise German laws, evade taxes and fines and have their own currency. They also mix Holocaust denial with conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Police seized, computers, weapons and ammunition, baseball bats, propaganda literature and drugs during the dawn raids, officers said.</p> <p>The group has a core membership of just 21 people nationwide, and a further 100 followers. The wider movement counts thousands more members, most of whom are males between 40 and 60 years old.</p> <p>Sensitivity toward the group\u2019s existence has grown since the terror attack last month in the city of Hanau when a suspected extremist shot dead nine people, all of whom were from migrant backgrounds. The gunman was not a member of the group, but shared certain tendencies with its members.</p> <p>After the shooting, Seehofer declared war on the far-right extremist scene. He said it was the biggest security threat Germany faced and that it had left a \u201ctrail of blood\u201d across Germany in recent months.</p> <p>An antisemitic attack on a synagogue in Halle in October and the murder of a pro-refugee politician at his home last June have also heightened awareness of the phenomenon.</p> <p>Seehofer announced an increase in police measures as a result, including more resources to fight extremism online, and has signalled a willingness to tighten gun ownership laws.</p>",

Most companies have introduced special booking policies that allow customers to rebook, often into 2021, or get a credit for a future departure.</p> <p>Companies are working through the many thousands of queries in date order, so if your trip is not until later in the year you are unlikely to get an immediate response. However, virtually every travel company has introduced special booking policies in response to the crisis, offering more flexibility in terms of rebooking or cancelling. Check the website of your travel provider for their terms and conditions.</p> <h2>Will we get our money back if our tour operator goes bust?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3108ac4c3f3fa7cf3b218659244676a061402d80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3108ac4c3f3fa7cf3b218659244676a061402d80/0_0_3500_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jet2.com aircraft boarding stairs are stored at Stansted airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"589\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Jay from Ipswich</strong><strong> has a trip for a family of </strong><strong>four booked with Jet2holidays to Montenegro </strong><strong>at the end of July. He has paid a deposit of \u00a3240, plus </strong><strong>\u00a3600 towards paying off the holiday, with full payment due by mid-May.</strong></p> <p>Jay says, \u201cOur main concern is that with all the cancellations to other European destinations as well as, I assume, a drop in revenue, is Jet2holidays strong enough to handle such a decline in revenue? And is it a possibility that we start seeing some tour operators go into administration or seek financial bailouts? If this happens, where do we stand with trying to get our money back ?\u201d</p> <p>There is no doubt that travel companies are under massive strain, with many fighting to survive. It\u2019s impossible to predict which ones will collapse. Under the current <a href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/is-my-holiday-protected/new-package-travel-regulations\">Package Travel Regulations</a>, travellers are entitled to be repatriated or receive a refund if a company goes into administration. That will still be the case even if the changes to the regulations that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/18/uk-travel-industry-urges-government-action-to-forestall-collapse-of-businesses\">travel bodies are calling for </a>go ahead. The changes the travel sector is urgently requesting are around the issue of refunds for cancelled trips (for example, that credits could be given instead of a cash refund) \u2013 they are not requesting that changes be made to the protections given to consumers when a company goes bust.</p> <p>At the moment, Jet2holidays has suspended its flights and holidays departing from the UK until 30 April. But it says, \u201cWe plan to recommence from 1 May 2020, a decision we\u2019ll keep under constant review.\u201d</p> <p>Jet2holidays is dealing with customers\u2019 queries by date order, so unfortunately it is unlikely to respond to customers like Jay who are concerned about travel several months in advance. The best advice for Jay and others in a similar situation is to hold tight. Because Jay\u2019s July holiday is currently unaffected by the changes, it falls under the usual <a href=\"https://www.jet2holidays.com/terms-and-conditions\">terms and conditions</a>, meaning he will lose his deposit if he cancels now. If he waits, the holiday may go ahead. If it can\u2019t go ahead either because Montenegro has a travel ban in place or the FCO is still advising against all but essential travel, then he will be entitled to a full refund from Jet2.

She planned to go to Austria and the Czech Republic, but two days after she booked the Czech Republic announced it was closing its borders from 16 March, and on 17 March the UK government advised against all but essential international travel. Because the passes she bought were a promotional offer with a 10% discount she was told she wasn\u2019t entitled to a full refund.</strong></p> <p>We contacted <a href=\"https://www.eurail.com/en\">Eurail</a>, which issues Interrail tickets, to ask about her case. Like all other travel companies, Eurail has updated its exchange and refund policies in response to the coronavirus crisis. Under its new terms, customers are entitled to a 100% refund if<em>: </em>\u201cyou cannot leave your country of origin (as is now the case under new FCO advice); cannot enter your destination country; or cannot return to your country of origin and purchased a full-price pass.\u201d</p> <p>The last bit is key to Hazel\u2019s case \u2013 because she purchased a discounted ticket she is only entitled to an 85% refund and not a full refund. However, in normal circumstances promotional tickets are non-exchangeable and non-refundable, so offering 85% on these promotional tickets is a concession that is being made during this crisis.</p> <p>However, if she wants to postpone her trip, the tickets now have an additional six-month validity extension on the original 11-month window in which she could choose a start date. So a traveller who purchased a ticket in March 2020 has until August 2021. This applies to all travellers who purchased their passes on or after 1 June 2019 and before 1 April 2020.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en/support/travel-disruptions/coronavirus-update/?134\">More information on Interrail\u2019s coronavirus policy</a>.</p> <h2>Can I get a refund on a ferry crossing if ferries are still operating?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4fc3548e56779ff15628bcec6ffcb80ff0299fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4fc3548e56779ff15628bcec6ffcb80ff0299fb/0_0_3099_1861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DFDS Dover Seaways ferry crashes through waves as it arrives at the Port of Dover in Kent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Margaret Dakin was about to leave the UK for an extended stay of six months in Corfu with her husband.

However, when the Guardian contacted DFDS to ask about her particular \u2013 and unusual \u2013 circumstances DFDS said it was looking at each booking on a case-by-case basis and advised her to email a request.

  "<p>It was the smell that was the worst. In this dusty camp on Pakistan\u2019s border with Iran, which at one stage held more than 6,000 people, the stench of sweat, rubbish and human excrement hung in the air. There was no real housing, just five people to a ragged tent, and no bathrooms, towels or blankets.</p> <p>The camp, in the town of Taftan in Balochistan province, was supposed to function as a sanitary quarantine location, preventing the spread of the coronavirus from Iran, which has had one of the worst outbreaks globally.</p> <p>Instead, according to Mohammed Bakir, who was held there for two weeks, it was no more than \u201ca prison \u2026 the dirtiest place I have ever stayed in my life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese were the hardest days and nights of my life,\u201d said Bakir. \u201cWe were treated like animals. There were no facilities but also no humanity and everything was in disarray. They were not prepared; there was nothing for us to sleep in except some dilapidated tents.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/pakistan-coronamap/giv-3902g1ReUcRFwVrz/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/pakistan-coronamap/giv-3902g1ReUcRFwVrz/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>Thousands of people have been kept in close quarters in hot, squalid conditions in Taftan, with not even basic precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. According to doctors at the camp, even those who presented with symptoms were not tested or even isolated, and there was a severe shortage of doctors and nurses. There was such a lack of medical facilities, the few doctors on site took to paying for necessary medicines themselves. Things got so bad that protests broke out among those quarantined.</p> <p>\u201cNeither the quarantining service nor the testing procedure was satisfactory at all,\u201d said one doctor, who asked not to be named. \u201cIn the first 20 days, many people had symptoms, but there was no testing at all. We had no testing facilities for three weeks. One child was sent to [a] hospital in Quetta, and he tested positive. But there was no isolation or testing for anyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThere were patients with diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases who were quarantined for 14 days without any proper medication. Their conditions were really bad there and they were treated like animals.\u201d</p> <p>The border between Pakistan and Iran is more than 600 miles and movement between the two countries is extremely common, especially among minority Shia Muslims in Pakistan who travel to Iran on religious pilgrimages. It is also a crucial trade route.</p> <p>But over the past two weeks, it has become a hotbed of coronavirus, with infections going up by the dozen every day. There are 302 reported cases of coronavirus in Pakistan, the highest number of cases in south Asia.</p> <p>Even though infections in Iran began to rise rapidly weeks ago, the Pakistan government only officially shut the border less than a week ago. And the border is still porous; on Tuesday night at least 100 pilgrims crossed from Iran into Balochistan, reportedly after bribing border guards.</p> <p>Among those held in Taftan was Abid Hussain, who is from Nagar in Gilgit-Baltistan, and was quarantined for two weeks after returning from Iran. \u201cIt\u2019s like I have been released from prison,\u201d said Hussain. \u201cThey call it a quarantine but we didn\u2019t get hand wash, face masks or any other sanitary facilities. The only check was that in the morning a doctor used to come round taking everyone\u2019s temperature. That was it for 13 days. Everyone was desperate to leave.\u201d</p> <p> Many of those in Taftan have been released or transferred to other facilities, but 1,200 remain.</p> <p>Hussain also described lax regulations on movement for those in the camp, with many going to shops in the town, walking around the vicinity and having regular social gatherings. No guidelines were issued for how those in quarantine could protect themselves from getting the disease, and there was no running water for people to wash their hands.</p> <p>Hundreds of people supposedly under lockdown left the camp to shop at local markets and stores, buying food and returning to the camp without any checks.</p> <p>\u201cAround these fruit stalls it was more like a scene from a busy Friday bazaar which was run by people who should have been quarantine camp in lockdown,\u201d said one eyewitness.</p> <p>The situation was equally bad in the hospitals in Balochistan, the least developed and most impoverished province of Pakistan, which were tasked with dealing with the outbreak. A doctor at one hospital in Quetta claimed that medical staff had refused to treat or even examine a young girl with all the symptoms of coronavirus, whose father had recently returned from China for work. The girl reportedly died days later without being tested.</p> <p>Pakistan\u2019s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak, said the doctor, was \u201cdepressing and disturbing\u201d.</p> <p>Pakistan has a notoriously poor track record for containing disease outbreaks and is one of only two countries in the world that have failed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/07/pakistan-accused-of-cover-up-over-fresh-polio-outbreak\">eliminate polio</a>.

  "<p>When I took part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vend%C3%A9e_Globe\">the Vendee Globe</a>, I spent three months at sea alone and on the <a href=\"http://www.avivachallenge.com/\">Aviva Challenge</a> I was alone at sea for six months. My home for that time <a href=\"http://www.avivachallenge.com/yacht-specification\">was a 72ft boat</a> with very few creature comforts and nothing in the way of entertainment, apart from my karaoke skills.</p> <p>Of course, I am well aware that my isolation was one of choice and for very different reasons than the situation we find ourselves in now due to coronavirus. However, in sharing the strategies and learnings from being alone for these long periods of time, I hope that they will resonate with people that find themselves in a situation that is unfamiliar and scary.</p> <p>As mindful humans, we know we need to be physically isolated right now but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to be mentally isolated. Human contact and support are important at all times but particularly in times of crisis or stress. Now, more than ever, we need to look out for each other.</p> <p>My tips for dealing with isolation are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Keep communicating \u2013 this is reassuring for everyone. If you are the one self-isolating, it is moral boosting to know people care but it is equally important for your friends and family to know that you are OK. Stay in touch and ask for help if you need it. A five-minute chat once a day could really lift someone\u2019s spirits and be something they look forward to.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Spending 24/7 alone is alien to many of us and will be a challenge for people that thrive on the company of others. Extroverts get their energy from others so a lack of stimulation may lead to a drop in mood. For most of us, going to work, school or the gym is part of daily routine and now we have to fill that time. Having and sticking to a routine of some sort will help as it provides a focus and a reason to get going for the day. Having something to do will also make the time pass more quickly.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Make technology work for you. There are so many ways we can communicate these days, this is the time to make use of them. Skype, Facetime, email, text, phone calls and social media platforms are all great ways to stay in touch.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Focus only on what you can control and don\u2019t waste energy worrying about things that are outside your control. We are bombarded with information via the media and we do need to take news onboard. However, if you find that listening or reading the news is increasing your anxiety or stress levels then limit your exposure to it. Many of us will be seriously impacted financially through job losses or lack of work. You are not alone, millions of us will be in the same position. Make a manageable plan and seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fd8b4173d341ae3fb34e89d194329fba987206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fd8b4173d341ae3fb34e89d194329fba987206/0_80_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dee Caffari: \u2018Make a manageable plan and seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dee Caffari: \u2018Make a manageable plan and seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Be grateful for the things in your life that you have or can do. Focussing on the good will have a positive effect on your mental health. When you are having a tough day and finding it hard to cope, focus on getting through the next day or even the next few hours rather than weeks or months. The sun will continue to rise and set. This situation will pass.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Look for the opportunities and be creative. In a world of instant contact, demanding work lives and intrusive technology the current situation will allow many of us to step back from that for a period of time. Is there a project that you have wanted to take on but never had the time? Is there a bestseller in your head just waiting to be written? Is there work that you could do on a temporary basis? Necessity is the mother of invention, so perhaps now is the time to embark on something new.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Accept that we must adapt to the new environment we are living in. As a round the world sailor, I am used to my environment changing very quickly and having to adapt to forces that are outside of my control. In the coming weeks and months, restrictions on our lives and the effects of this virus will no doubt make us feel angry, upset, worried and scared. These are natural emotions but will use mental energy. Accepting a situation allows you to think more clearly and calmly.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>The future will be different. That is the reality and we may as well embrace it. Mother nature has flicked the reset button. We have an opportunity to reevaluate and change our behaviour for the better.</p></li> </ul> <p>We are all too aware in today\u2019s world that the only thing we can be certain of is change. Our ability to adapt to this change is what will define us. The current global pandemic is revealing that the majority of us fear the unknown and our reaction is to panic. Let\u2019s come together in this time of adversity and support each other.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was originally published by Dee Caffari for <a href=\"https://www.bluewatergroup.com/\">Bluewater</a>. </p></li> </ul>",

Her campaign speeches largely focused on the ills of American wars overseas, with Gabbard promising to redirect money from the military budget to social programs.</p> <p>As her campaign failed to gain momentum, however, Gabbard and her supporters increasingly criticized the media for failing to provide her with enough airtime \u2013 although the congresswoman never approached double figures in national polls.</p> <p>Gabbard was seen as a rising star in the Democratic party when she became a member of Congress in 2013, and was appointed a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>She resigned that position, however, to endorse Bernie Sanders over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> in 2016, and continued to chaff against her party when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/04/11/what-is-tulsi-gabbard-thinking-on-syria/\">she met with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad</a>, in 2017, later questioning the consensus that Assad was behind <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html\">a chemical attack</a> that killed dozens of people.</p> <p>Despite backing Biden over Sanders, Gabbard thanked the Vermont senator in her announcement.</p> <p>\u201cI want to extend my best wishes to my friends Bernie Sanders, his wife Jane, Nina Turner and their many supporters for the work that they\u2019ve done,\u201d Gabbard said.

  "<h2>Code Orange</h2> <p><strong>March 14, Twitch<br></strong>Having spent months planning the launch of their head-wrecking fourth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/13/code-orange-underneath-review\">Underneath</a>, Pittsburgh metal crew Code Orange were unwilling to let a looming pandemic stop the mosh. After their world tour was cancelled, the five-piece opted to play a hometown gig in an empty 1,500-capacity theatre, streaming the whole thing for free via their Twitch channel. The alarmingly titled <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/567489691\">Last Ones Left: In Fear of the End</a> show was a full-bore, bowel-quaking hour, an impressive shredded feat with retro CGI video inserts. (\u201cWhen\u2019s the PlayStation 2 game coming out?\u201d snarked one commentator.) Amid the juddering riffage, there was little direct political commentary until singer Jami Morgan paused the show to direct the camera at the deserted venue: \u201cThis is what happens when the ratfucks who run this world don\u2019t care about you, or me, or any of us.\u201d</p> <h2>Chris Martin</h2> <p><strong>March 16, Instagram</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMBK9OfsKO4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YMBK9OfsKO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Look at the stars, look how they stream for you. At a time of unprecedented global crisis, a rather froggy-sounding Chris Martin took to Instagram Live to spread some sonic balm around the world. For the first show under the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TogetherAtHome\">#TogetherAtHome banner</a>, he bobbed and bumbled his way solo through some Coldplay classics on upright piano and acoustic guitar, messing up the intros to Trouble and Viva la Vida but vamping through covers of As Time Goes By and Life on Mars. For the past decade, Coldplay have been filling stadiums with state-of-the-art theatrical gimmicks; this stop-start half-hour beamed from a domestic jam-hole was comparatively tinny but surprisingly charming. And, despite his stumbling interactions, Martin never messed up plugging <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/gb/\">Global Citizen</a> as a hub for reliable updates and advice.</p> <h2>Yungblud</h2> <p><strong>March 16, YouTube</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usms-qHCADA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usms-qHCADA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>North country boy Yungblud brought some chaotic Big Breakfast energy to this ramshackle revue, originally beamed live from a Los Angeles warehouse at 7am. With the help of a stripped-down but energised backing band, the Yorkshire-born strutter strove to create a genuine atmosphere with his righteously revamped rock\u2019n\u2019roll: the bursts of applause might have been canned but the sweat pouring off the 22-year-old seemed very real. Some skits involving his celeb pals \u2013 notably a drinking game with rapper Machine Gun Kelly and actor Bella Thorne, featuring bottles of Corona \u2013 veered into self-indulgence, but when he focused on the music Yungblud sounded great. Even the cliche of smashing up a drum kit mid-song felt cathartic.</p> <h2>Keith Urban</h2> <p><strong>March 16, Instagram</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B90JN2kBdsE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In a bid to \u201cdeal with the ENNUI\u201d, she has promised live musical updates, the first of which was an uplifting 15-minute tonic. Dressed in black polo neck and a tremendous Rockford Files suit, Chris performed stripped-back, piano-led versions of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0GMHfgEskZo\">People, I\u2019ve Been Sad</a> and the amazing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC1jIAP_WBc\">Je disparais dans tes bras</a> while moving hypnotically round the cavernous, wood-panelled studio. She has promised future Instagram dispatches showcasing \u201cguests and weird concepts\u201d, and a Q&amp;A with fellow pop maverick Charli XCX is apparently coming up next.</p> <h2>John Legend</h2> <p><strong>March 17, Instagram</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B920EARl9XS/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The acoustics in his home were also exquisite, enhancing his already supremely honeyed vocals. Over the course of a surprisingly slick hour, things picked up when his wife, Chrissy Teigen, sauntered in, bringing some imperious Joan Collins vibes in a bath towel and turban wrap, perching herself and a generous glass of ros\u00e9 on the piano. Among the love ballads and make-out songs, the sweetest request came from their daughter, Luna, who wanted to hear the title track from Disney\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jLG1hceTKi4\">Beauty and the Beast</a>. As well as semi-ironically plugging his own imminent album, Legend pointed fans toward Global Citizen and the <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/\">Feeding America</a> food bank initiative, while also suggesting fellow lovesick superstars Miguel and Camila Cabello could be streaming intimate shows next.</p> <h2>Ben Gibbard</h2> <p><strong>March 17, YouTube</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei9xuVkbQuU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ei9xuVkbQuU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If beamed-from-home gigs are the new status quo, part of the appeal might be seeing beloved musicians messing around in a low-stakes way, leaving all that image-making and sonic perfectionism far behind. Ben Gibbard, the veteran creative force behind beloved indie acts Death Cab for Cutie and the Postal Service, clearly isn\u2019t quite at the airhorns and hula-hooping stage just yet. For the first of what he plans to be a series of daily YouTube gigs from his Seattle home studio \u2013 in aid of local charity <a href=\"www.teenfeed.org\">Teen Feed</a> \u2013 he performed heartfelt solo acoustic versions of fan-requested tracks, including <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VN0M48Fq93s\">Northern Lights</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H8ZUV9IBEXY\">Grapevine Fires</a>. There was also a cover of Radiohead\u2019s Fake Plastic Trees that he wryly attributed to \u201cThomas Aquinas Yorke\u201d. Sombre but moving, this serious-minded show was absolute manna for superfans.</p> <h2>Lights</h2> <p><strong>March 18, Instagram</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B95oho5pX3o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>A public health expert has warned that prisons and detention centres provide ideal incubation conditions for the rapid spread of Covid-19, as the first case of the virus in a UK inmate was confirmed.</p> \n<p>Countries such as Spain and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-six-die-in-prison-protest-linked-to-italian-clampdown\">Iran</a> have ordered the release of many prisoners due to the risk of virus transmission among detainees and jail staff.</p> \n<p>The UK government issued <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance\">guidance</a> stating that if there was a significant outbreak of Covid-19, \u201ccohorting\u201d should be used to put all those infected together behind locked doors in prisons, detention centres, young offender institutions and secure units.</p> \n<p>A report by Prof Richard Coker, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, warns of the substantial risk of the virus spreading at a particularly fast rate in locked establishments such as prisons and detention centres, in a process he refers to as \u201ccluster amplification\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday the first case of Covid-19 in a UK prisoner was confirmed at Strangeways prison in Manchester.</p> \n<p>The inmate was taken to hospital and there are no further confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the prison, although the Ministry of Justice said<strong> </strong>13<strong> </strong>prisoners had been put into isolation as a precaution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A prison service source said the course of action taken suggested the inmate had an underlying health condition.</p> \n<p>Visits are going ahead at Strangeways, formally known as HMP Manchester, which has an operational capacity of 1,238 inmates. A prison service spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority is to maintain a normal regime for as long as possible, including visits.\u201d But some have questioned whether current practices can continue, with the charity Appeal calling for a proportion of low-risk offenders to be released.</p> \n<p>It is understood prison officers and other staff who had contact with the inmate are now self-isolating. There is also some isolation in place on the wing where the man was living, however it is not clear if fellow prisoners on that wing have been locked down or moved to other cells.</p> \n<p>A prison service source said it was no surprise there had been a confirmed case and that more were expected in the coming weeks and months.</p> \n<p>Current guidance advises that restrictions to inmate movements may apply in prisons where the disease is detected. As yet there are no overarching plans to stop the movement of inmates between prisons in the UK. </p> \n<p>In 2018 a report by MPs concluded 15% of the prison population had respiratory conditions, and last year inspectors found 10 out of 35 men\u2019s prisons failed to meet the minimum standards of infection control compliance and cleanliness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One woman whose son is in prison told the Guardian he had told her some inmates were refusing to report symptoms \u201cbecause they don\u2019t want to be locked in all that time\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cWhen I asked my son if he was managing to self-isolate, he said he couldn\u2019t because if they want to have a hot drink they have to go with a jug to communal hot water area, so he\u2019s having to mix with other people. There\u2019s no avoiding it. He has to have antibiotics on a daily basis and I\u2019m really scared he\u2019s going to get it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Coker\u2019s report was commissioned by Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who have embarked on what is thought to be the first legal action against the government relating to Covid-19. The law firm has called on the Home Office to release many detainees from immigration detention centres because of the high risk of contracting Covid-19 if they remain locked up. The suspension of flights means few are likely to be removed from the UK imminently.</p> \n<p>A legal challenge lodged on Monday argues that the Home Office has failed to protect immigration detainees from Covid-19 and failed to identify which detainees are at particular risk of serious harm or death if they do contract the virus due to their age or underlying health conditions.</p> \n<p>It calls for the release of all those who are particularly vulnerable and for all detainees to be tested for Covid-19, along with the suspension of all new detentions. The action warns even a short delay could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d.</p> \n<p>The legal action expresses concern about the large numbers involved. Last year 24,443 people were detained, and at any one time 1,500-2,000 are detained. Many of those locked up have arrived from high-risk countries such as Iran, China and Italy. Some are forced to share rooms, and a \u201clock-in\u201d regime prevents many from leaving their cells during the night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The charity <a href=\"https://detentionaction.org.uk/\">Detention Action</a> and a vulnerable detainee are bringing the legal action.</p> \n<p>Coker believes there is a risk of a serious outbreak behind locked doors, with a figure of 60% of people getting infected \u201cplausible and credible\u201d. He likened the conditions for incubation to those on a cruise ship.</p> \n<p>He said action to express these issues was needed \u201cextremely urgently\u201d. His report states: \u201cIf detention is unnecessary, it should be relaxed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, said: \u201cThe situation across the UK\u2019s immigration detention estate is dire \u2013 a large at-risk population, no information on Covid and a lack of soap and basic cleaning materials. Without immediate action to release those detained, the government faces a human catastrophe of its own making.\u201d</p> \n<p>Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said: \u201cThe government is sitting on its hands, keeping detainees locked up during this pandemic, contrary to its earnest public health instruction and exposing detainees to a severe risk of infection. The time for swift action is overdue.\u201d</p> \n<p> A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThese claims are completely false. The health of people in these centres is of the utmost importance. We have robust contingency plans and are following all Public Health England guidance.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been no recorded cases of coronavirus in immigration removal centres. Measures such as protective isolation will be considered to minimise the risk of Covid-19 spreading to vulnerable groups in the immigration detention estate.</p> \n<p>\u201cBasic hygiene is a key part of tackling coronavirus. Handwashing facilities are available in all immigration removal centres and we are working closely with suppliers to ensure adequate supply of soap and cleaning materials.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll immigration removal centres have dedicated health facilities run by doctors and nurses which are managed by the NHS or appropriate providers. All detainees receive a medical screening by a nurse within two hours.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spokesman added: \u201cWe do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. We remain committed to removing foreign national offenders or those who violate our immigration rules.\u201d </p>",

The ongoing problems with sanitation and accommodations in some of the shelters make it largely impossible for many residents to comply with Covid-19 precautionary measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, according to Eve Garrow, the homelessness policy analyst with the ACLU of Southern California.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, some in shelters have been waiting for years for more permanent housing due to a severe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/26/theyve-turned-their-backs-on-us-californias-homeless-crisis-grows-in-numbers-and-violence\">shortage of affordable homes</a> for low-income <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2019/09/04/thousands-of-california-renters-with-section-8-vouchers-cant-use-them-what-lawmakers-are-doing-about-it/\">renters</a>.

  "<p>Almost every day, there is a new story about the Home Office needlessly ruining someone\u2019s life.

But as Wendy Williams\u2019 blistering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush Lessons Learned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">review</a> shows, the department\u2019s problems are broader and deeper than one scandal.</p> <p>The review exposes the department as unfit for the society it is supposed to serve, after a series of colossal failures, rooted in a toxic internal culture and an ingrained misunderstanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history. It showed \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness\u201d on race issues that is \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d. It calls for ministers and officials to make an \u201cunqualified apology\u201d to \u201cthose affected and the wider Afro-Caribbean community\u201d, but more importantly it says that the sincerity of this apology can only be judged the extent of the \u201csystemic and sustainable cultural change\u201d that follows it. Every Windrush citizen harmed by the government deserves to be compensated immediately, but the true test of whether the British government has learned its lesson will be the future policies it chooses to implement.</p> <p>There is not one easy fix to the culture of the Home Office, or the inhumane policies driving the unnecessary suffering it creates. However, the Lessons Learned review provides a unique opportunity as well as a blueprint to fix a broken department. Home Office reform should follow four steps.</p> <p>Of all the reports and newspaper briefings that have characterised Priti Patel\u2019s crisis-ridden tenure at the helm of the Home Office, perhaps the most concerning was that which suggested she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/21/priti-patel-storm-warning-civil-servant-david-normington-immigration\">not committed to the rule of law</a>. When the UK government presides over a regime that fails to give migrants proper legal representation, splits children from their parents and deports people against legal advice, it is not only the immediate victims who are harmed. These failures fatally undermine the UK\u2019s standing as a champion of the rule of law and human rights in the world.</p> <p>Wendy Williams\u2019 review outlines that many of these failures stem from \u201ccultural issues\u201d in the department. The only way to fix them is with a new positive vision. That means replacing the \u201cdefensive culture\u201d, \u201cnegative terminology\u201d and \u201cbiased language\u201d with a new culture which is open to feedback, ideas, criticism and learning. The Home Office needs to develop a new mission statement and purpose rooted in the British values of the rule of law, democracy, individual liberty, diversity, openness and respect for those from different backgrounds, faiths and beliefs. Internally, the department\u2019s new purpose must be to replace the deeply divisive culture that has distorted immigration control from a responsibility into a sport. Whistleblowers should be actively protected, rather than dismissed. The department\u2019s diversity and inclusion strategy must be made concrete with tangible targets. All staff should be required to undergo education and training to understand Britain\u2019s colonial history, migration and the story of black Britons.</p> <p>Second, we need to rebuild the Home Office in a way that recognises the internal contradiction of being a department that controls immigration, but that also has a fundamental duty to protect vulnerable communities. We need to retrain Home Office officials to recognise that their primary duty is to resolve people\u2019s problems, not exacerbate them. The culture of awarding bonuses in reward for meeting quotas encourages officials to treat individuals as means to an end, rather than as human beings. This must stop. There is no reason that processes for people to be reunited with their families should be designed in a way so complex that even some lawyers struggle to understand them. The Home Office should make it easier and much less expensive for individuals to legalise the status that is rightfully theirs.</p> <p>As the review highlights, caseworkers in the Home Office need to develop a \u201ccraft\u201d, to replace its current \u201cfactory line approach\u201d. This means picking up the phone and arranging face-to-face meetings in complex cases. In terms of data collection and metrics, the Home Office must enter the 21st century. It can no longer be a paper department and it must create a central process for collecting, recording and monitoring data so that it can spot patterns of failure and respond to them.</p> <p>Third, the hostile environment must be replaced by a humane environment. By turning teachers, doctors and landlords into border guards, the government manufactured an \u201cus and them\u201d culture that led to gross discrimination across the public realm. The review calls for an immediate end to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">\u201cright to rent laws\u201d</a> and says the department must take \u201curgent action\u201d to review every hostile environment measure. The implications are clear. We should scrap the entire hostile environment, and immediately introduce a process for individuals who have been discriminated against because of it to get compensation.</p> <p>Finally, we can look at creative policy solutions to detoxify immigration issues that go beyond the scope of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review. A one-off immigration amnesty would lift 1.2 million undocumented migrants out of the black economy, allowing them to work legally, pay taxes and contribute to society. It would also massively reduce the Home Office\u2019s workload. Other countries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/09/spain.gilestremlett\">including Spain</a>, have successfully implemented amnesties on a similar scale. This is a policy that can find cross-party support, having previously been supported by Boris Johnson. A one-off amnesty could be the perfect opportunity for the Home Office to hit reset. Another potential idea is devolving parts of migration policy to the regional level. This could only follow a radical decentralisation of the UK. However, doing so could resolve existing tensions that result from varying public opinion in different parts of the country.</p> <p>If the government is serious about righting the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation, it will recognise that this moment cannot be ignored. The Home Office\u2019s systematic mistreatment of migrants, as well as British citizens, is a moral stain on the United Kingdom. Rebuilding the UK\u2019s immigration system separately from Wendy Williams\u2019 Lessons Learned review, rather than alongside it, would be the final insult to a generation that asked for so little, but gave so much.</p> <p>\u2022 David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham<br><br></p>",
  "<p>The City regulator has told insurers it expects them to treat customers fairly and consider payments on claims they might usually reject.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-conduct-authority\">Financial Conduct Authority</a> said the coronavirus had changed customers\u2019 behaviour and insurance firms needed to take this into account.</p> <p>Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive of the FCA, said: \u201cWe expect insurance firms to recognise this and treat their customers fairly, recognising the circumstances customers may find themselves in. We would not expect to see a customer\u2019s ability to claim affected by circumstances over which they have little control.\u201d</p> <p>With government advice suggesting people should work from home and avoid crowded spaces, the FCA said people may be using their properties and cars differently from when they bought insurance.</p> <p>Typically, home and motor insurers will ask questions about use when a policy is bought and base premiums on this. Car insurance customers will be asked to indicate whether their vehicle is used socially or for work, while home insurance customers will be asked about their working practices.</p> <p>The FCA said insurers should consider claims even where customers had initially indicated they would not be using their car or home for work.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect motor and home insurers not to reject claims because of a consumer\u2019s understandable temporary change in how they use their vehicle and their home address, in response to government advice and the emerging coronavirus situation,\u201d the FCA said.</p> <p>In recent days many insurers have pulled policies from the market or amended what they cover, with customers looking for travel insurance the hardest hit.</p> <p>The regulator said it could not prevent this from happening but told the industry it expected them to communicate changes and make sure the cover still met consumers\u2019 needs.</p> <p>For customers relying on annual travel insurance that they renew each year, the FCA said it expected insurers to take policyholder\u2019s circumstances into account. \u201cWhere appropriate, renew or consider claims under the terms of the original policy for these travel arrangements,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The Association of British Insurers (ABI) lobby group said some members had been forced to take a commercial decision to stop selling policies such as travel insurance or trip disruption to new customers in recent days.</p> <p>\u201cInsurance is based on assessing the possibility of an event occurring. Insurers take account of when any risk becomes more of a probability than a possibility and then make commercial decisions,\u201d the ABI said on its website.</p> <p>It said its members were \u201cdoing everything in their power to keep their operations running as fully as possible and to offer clear and up-to-date information to their customers\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/most-coronavirus-hit-uk-firms-not-protected-by-their-insurance-policies\">the organisation sparked anger</a> when it said many businesses would not be able to claim for losses resulting from the pandemic. It said standard policies did not include this level of cover and only a small number of big businesses had insurance that would pay out if they had to close.</p>",
  "<h2>Recommendation: ministers should admit that serious harm was inflicted on people who are British, and provide an unqualified apology to those affected</h2> <p>The review found that the government ignored repeated warnings, and that ministers were still failing to acknowledge the extent of suffering inflicted on thousands of people who were mistakenly classified as illegal immigrants by the Home Office. Throughout her interviews, Wendy Williams encountered a reflexively defensive position from senior civil servants and ministers. While officials agreed that the situation was \u201ctragic\u201d, there was a consistent desire to blame the individuals for failing to apply for documentation.</p> <p>Officials told her: \u201cIt was the fault of the people caught up in it that they didn\u2019t get evidence of their status and when they tried to, they didn\u2019t provide the right documentation.\u201d In the most strongly worded section of the report, Williams expresses frustration that ministers and senior officials did not appear to accept the full extent of the injustice done.</p> <p>\u201cMany gave the impression that the situation was unforeseen, unforeseeable and therefore unavoidable. Whereas, the evidence clearly shows that the sequence of events which culminated in the scandal, while unforeseen, was both foreseeable and avoidable.\u201d</p> <p>She concludes that unless there is a genuine acceptance of its failings, all attempts to right the wrongs of the Windrush generation will seem hollow, and warns that the department risks repeating the mistakes that led to the scandal.</p> <h2>Finding: race clearly played a part in what happened to the Windrush generation</h2> <p>Williams says she had \u201creally serious concerns\u201d about racism within the department. The report does not find that the Home Office was institutionally racist, but it offers a detailed analysis of how \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d and \u201cignorance\u201d on race contributed to the scandal.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is unfortunate that most of the policymakers were white and most of the people involved were black,\u201d a senior official told her. Williams finds a lack of understanding about the nature of racism: \u201cThere seems to be a misconception that racism is confined to decisions made with racist motivations \u2026 This is a misunderstanding of both the law and racism generally.\u201d She notes that the Home Office failed to track \u201cthe racial impact of its policies and decisions\u201d.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the department should establish a race advisory board, and teach staff about Britain\u2019s colonial history</h2> <p>This may go some way to addressing ongoing concerns about whether the department is institutionally racist. Williams highlights the lack of ethnic diversity at senior levels in the Home Office, reflecting a pronounced disparity with the public it serves. Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff are predominantly concentrated in the lower grades, and in 2018 made up 26.14% and 26.33% of the two lowest grades respectively, but only 7.18% of the senior civil service roles. She finds there has been low take-up of unconscious bias training in the department. \u201cThe Windrush scandal was in part able to happen because of the public\u2019s and officials\u2019 poor understanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history.\u201d</p> <p>A race advisory board might focus on improving these failings. But campaign groups want the government to go further. A group of 16 leading race equality organisations, led by the Runnymede Trust and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, has called on the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to investigate whether there is institutional racism in the Home Office.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the home secretary should commission officials to undertake a full review of the hostile/compliant environment policy and measures</h2> <p>The Home Office, under Theresa May, was aware of significant concerns about the potential for the hostile environment measures to result in discrimination, the review finds, adding: \u201cDespite the warnings, the department failed to monitor, or properly evaluate, the effectiveness and impact of the compliant environment measures.\u201d</p> <p>The review makes clear that the roots of the scandal stretch back over decades, as immigration legislation was gradually tightened from 1948 onwards, and notes the responsibility of Labour governments in the 1990s onwards in tightening immigration controls. However, it pinpoints the development of hostile environment policies during May\u2019s time at the Home Office as the moment at which problems escalated. The creation of the \u201chostile environment\u201d was done with a \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d for the Windrush generation, the report finds. \u201cWarning signs and messages about the hostile environment policy were not heeded.\u201d</p> <p>A key failure was a misplaced assumption in the impact assessments for the 2013 and 2015 immigration bills that those who were unable to prove that they were here legally were therefore here unlawfully. This was not the case. Around 17% of the UK population do not have passports, and until the introduction of the hostile environment most people had not needed them. After the report\u2019s publication, Labour called for a repeal of hostile environment legislation, and the home secretary Priti Patel said she would review the report\u2019s recommendations.</p> <h2>Finding: Windrush victims are still vulnerable to compliant environment measures</h2> <p>Some Windrush victims remain in severe financial and personal difficulties, facing homelessness and unemployment because of Home Office policies. Many people affected have not approached the Home Office because they remain scared of the threat of immigration enforcement action, Williams notes. The true scale of the problem remains unknown.</p> <h2>Finding: the department displayed a lack of empathy for individuals and used dehumanising jargon and cliches</h2> <p>Using words like \u201cstock\u201d and \u201cflow\u201d when describing immigration numbers is dehumanising, Williams says, criticising the way the department refers to people as a group, rather than recognising that individual lives are at stake. This language has \u201can impact on the attitudes and behaviour of staff towards people with whom they come into contact\u201d \u2013 and contributes to officials \u201closing sight of individuals\u201d. Initiatives like use of the \u201cGo home\u201d vans were \u201cracially insensitive\u201d, and should never be repeated.</p> <h2>Finding: the Home Office displayed \u201cdefensiveness, lack of awareness and an unwillingness to listen and learn from mistakes\u201d.</h2> <p>This review follows numerous previous highly critical reports about the Home Office, published over the past 15 years. One senior official said: \u201cThe department has got used to being beaten up.\u201d</p> <p>This defensiveness meant that officials were unwilling to acknowledge the scale of what had gone wrong. \u201cThere is the sense that priorities and decisions have been driven by an overwhelming desire to defend positions of policy and strategy \u2013 often at the expense of defending individuals from the impact of policies.\u201d The report recommends that officials be reminded of their duty to speak up when worried about the risks of policies and offer \u201ccandid\u201d advice to ministers.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the department should be more proactive in identifying people affected</h2> <p>The government has admitted that over 160 people were wrongly detained or deported to Caribbean countries, but has never investigated who has been deported to other Commonwealth countries. Campaign groups will welcome the request that Home Office extend its own investigations into who it might have wrongly deported.</p> <h2>Finding: a \u2018target-dominated\u2019 work environment within the immigration system contributed to the scandal</h2> <p>Williams criticises a \u201ctarget-dominated work environment within the immigration system and some low-quality decision making\u201d, which combined with<strong> \u201c</strong>operational and organisational failings\u201d in the department to cause the detrimental treatment meted out to the Windrush generation. Some individual decision-makers operated an \u201cirrational and unreasonable\u201d approach to individuals, demanding multiple documents for proof of presence in the UK for each year of residence in the UK \u2013 despite there being no policy basis for this.</p>",
  "<p>Numbers of African black rhinos in the wild have risen by several hundred, a rare boost in the conservation of a species driven to near extinction by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/19/super-gangs-africa-poaching-crisis\">poaching</a>.</p> <p>Black rhinos are still in grave danger but the small increase \u2013 an annual rate of 2.5% over six years, has swollen the population from 4,845 in 2012 to an estimated 5,630 in 2018, giving hope that efforts put into saving the species are paying off.</p> <p>The painstaking attempts to save the black rhino have included moving some individuals from established groups to new locations, increasing the species\u2019 range and ensuring viable breeding populations, as well as protecting them through stronger law enforcement efforts. Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving.</p> <p>\u201cThe continued slow recovery is a testament to the immense efforts made in the countries and a powerful reminder that conservation works,\u201d said Grethel Aguilar, acting director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which compiles the global red list of species under threat.</p> <p>\u201c[But] there is no room for complacency as poaching and illegal trade remain acute threats. It is essential that the ongoing anti-poaching measures and intensive, proactive population management continue, with support from national and international actors.\u201d</p> <p>The outlook for the other African rhino species is still troubled, according to the update to the red list published on Thursday.</p> <p>White rhinos are more numerous in Africa but categorised by the IUCN as near-threatened. The outlook for them has worsened in recent years, driven by high levels of poaching in South Africa\u2019s Kruger national park. White rhinos have larger horns than their black counterparts, making them more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2017/aug/25/rhino-horn-sales-banking-on-extinction\">attractive to poachers</a>, and they are easier to find as they prefer more open habitats.</p> <p>Although white rhino numbers grew between 2007 and 2012, the numbers of the southern white rhino subspecies fell by 15% during that period, from an estimated 21,300 to 18,000, cancelling out previous growth.</p> <p>Poaching levels appear to have declined again in the last few years, down from a peak in 2015 when an average of 3.7 rhinos were killed every day. Estimates for 2019 suggest poaching has declined further, owing to governments taking stronger measures against the organised crime gangs behind poaching.</p> <p>\u201cWith the involvement of transnational organised crime in poaching, rhino crimes are not just wildlife crimes,\u201d said Richard Emslie, a coordinator for African rhinos at IUCN. \u201cIf the encouraging declines in poaching can continue, this should positively impact rhino numbers. Continued expenditure and efforts will be necessary to maintain this trend.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/kenyas-rare-white-female-giraffe-killed-by-poachers\">Kenya's rare white female giraffe 'killed by poachers'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The impacts of the coronavirus crisis are also worrying experts, as the halt to tourism will reduce resources for conservation. \u201cThe impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is likely to have significant negative impacts on private commercial wildlife operations and state national parks and game reserves that conserve rhino,\u201d said Emslie. \u201cThose in the field paying for all the conservation work on the ground may need more financial support so that they can maintain current efforts despite the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The costs of keeping rhinos safe have risen greatly in the last decade, however, and live sale prices have fallen, reducing incentives for private landowners and communities to keep rhinos. About half of white rhinos and nearly 40% of black rhinos are on private land or land managed by communities. If the rhinos are viewed as a cost, that will further hamper efforts to protect them.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s update to the red list showed tha more than 31,000 species around the world are threatened with extinction. The red list is likely to be updated at least three more times this year.</p>",
  "<p>You might think, in a time of global panic like this one, the movements and behaviours of the rich and the famous are rendered dizzyingly irrelevant, candy floss-light non-news designed to distract us from The Great Looming Bug. You\u2019d be right.

I\u2019m getting messages from friends and family all around the globe and catching up on what\u2019s going on.\u201d And then \u2013 in one of the most astounding \u201cfamous people\u201d moves I think we\u2019ve seen in 2020 \u2013 Leto, a man who may I remind you learned about coronavirus about 15 minutes ago and is still getting days-old text messages coming through that just say \u201cbro did u die????\u201d \u2013 tweeted some bland coronavirus advice, saying: \u201cHope you and yours are ok.

Don\u2019t you <em>dare</em> step out of the desert after not talking for 12 days and tell me what to do! </p> <p>I\u2019ve been fascinated by Leto for a long time, because everything he does is shrouded in this inescapable, granular <em>Leto-ness</em>, possibly more than any other celebrity alive. The best Leto story \u2013 before \u201csomehow missing coronavirus because he was so lost in his own thoughts\u201d \u2013 was the filming of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488988/\">Chapter 27</a>, where he spent two months packing on 67lb (almost five stone) to play John Lennon\u2019s killer, Mark Chapman, a feat he managed by guzzling microwaved pints of ice cream mixed with olive oil and soy sauce. He put on so much weight for the role that he developed gout and struggled to walk to set every day. Such dedication to a part, you would think, might garner an Oscar nod, or a blockbuster opening weekend, but no: the film opened to generally poor reviews and ultimately grossed less than $200k. The lesson we must learn from this is: if you\u2019re going to put on so much weight for a role that you Henry VIII yourself, it\u2019s broadly advisable to do it for a decent script. It\u2019s arguable that Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s did better out of that film than the distributor did. Maybe that\u2019s what he was thinking about in the desert. I know I\u2019d never stop thinking about that, even for one quiet second of my life.</p> <p>What we need in this time is sources of simple joy, and while some celebrities have stepped up to the plate \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/robbiewilliams/?hl=en\">Robbie Williams</a>, who this week hosted an Instagram Live from his hotel room, resplendently topless, laptop steaming on his duvet, playing his own songs from YouTube, advert pre-roll and all, singing along to them direct to camera, giving his fans an utterly bonkers intimate dream concert because he was isolated from his wife and children, and if his knighthood isn\u2019t assured by that alone then I suggest we storm the castle \u2013 some very much have not, and yes obviously I am talking about Gal Gadot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gal Gadot does Imagine\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

There they are, in various gardens and against various blank mansion walls, and in various of those special calamitously bad outfits celebrities wear in the downtime moments when they are not being styled, and we realise how fundamentally useless they all are without help, that they can\u2019t even get dressed properly, and that, truly, a lot of them really are lucky that they\u2019re hot. \u201cWe are in this together, we will get through it together,\u201d Gadot wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine together. Sing with us.\u201d I have to preface this statement with: it\u2019s very nice that they all tried. The sentiment behind it is sincere. But the video itself is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen on the internet, and I\u2019ve seen corpses on this thing.</p> <p>Firstly: why do celebrities think them singing a song, badly, is helpful? Do we still blame Band Aid for this? Can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_6SaRWdJMc\">Bob Geldof saying \u201cgive us your fucking money!\u201d</a> really have had this much of a lasting, shockwave impact on popular culture? And secondly: it\u2019s already getting A Bit Bloody Rich having celebrities cloyingly telling us how important self-isolation is from their labyrinthine, exquisite, sunny Hollywood mansions, is it not? I enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/arnold-schwarzenegger-and-his-tiny-horses-urges-people-to-stay-home\">Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s at-home-with-the-ponies videos</a> as much as anyone, but I don\u2019t have a pony, or a house really, so it\u2019s tougher for me to relate. It\u2019s all well and good for famous people to stay at home where they have a room \u201cjust for clothes\u201d and a swimming pool in their garden, but slightly trickier for the rest of us, worrying about income, grocery levels, having to weapon up to go to Aldi, and whether that ominous cough our housemate seems to have got will somehow, distantly, kill our nan. But yeah please sing more tepid Lennon songs very badly. That\u2019s very helpful, Gal Gadot, and I\u2019m glad you spent the time to do it.</p>",

  "<p>xI joined up with the England squad at Lancaster Gate on Monday 4 May 1956, five days before the match, and I felt as small and as insignificant as I had when I turned up for my first day as a professional with Sheffield United. I was only just over the injury that had ruled me out of the match against Wolverhampton Wanderers the Saturday before, but the burden of my new surroundings rendered my legs jelly-like.</p> <p>When I presented myself to the receptionist at the FA headquarters, she said: \u201cAh, yes, Mr Grainger \u2013 you\u2019ll be sharing a room with Mr Matthews.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr Matthews?\u201d I replied, my voice rising an octave.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Mr Grainger, it has already been decided. What are you worried about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStanley Matthews is a star, one of the greatest players in the world. I shouldn\u2019t be sharing with Stanley Mathews.\u201d</p> <p>I wish I had taken the trouble to check the facts. The \u201cMr Matthews\u201d with whom I would share a room was Reg Matthews, the goalkeeper for Coventry City in the Third Division, which came as a massive relief. The other Matthews \u2013 the legendary Stanley, whom I idolised \u2013 never shared a room with any player. He was far too famous and far too talented to be one of the lads.</p> <p>The players to whom I introduced myself first were from Manchester United: Tommy Taylor, Roger Byrne and Duncan Edwards, who were all seated together, each wearing a smile that could only have come from the confidence born of their new status as champions of England. I had no such confidence. To me, the environment was alien.</p> <p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Colin Grainger of Sheffield United.\u201d</p> <p>I had met them all before, of course, during the trip to Belfast a week earlier, but I did not want to assume they remembered me. I was famous locally, in Sheffield and in Barnsley, but still not a national figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"91bd10fd5d3198a1700fc8b9566c61a13768fe49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91bd10fd5d3198a1700fc8b9566c61a13768fe49/0_0_2832_4160/681.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Grainger.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Grainger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCome and join us, Colin,\u201d Edwards said in a thick Black Country accent that must have been how my grandparents spoke.</p> <p>The England manager was Walter Winterbottom, whose reputation was that of a grammar-school headmaster, but he was nothing of the kind. He was quiet, extremely polite, never given to shouting at people, and always eager to perpetuate the sense of team spirit. We trained at Highbury, the home of Arsenal, but all we did was run around the pitch. When we had a meal, I noticed that Stanley Matthews was nowhere to be seen. \u201cHe eats on his own,\u201d somebody told me.</p> <p>Matthews had only just returned to the team after a spell out. John Atyeo, the prolific Bristol City striker, also returned. I was surprised to discover that Nat Lofthouse and Bill Perry, two fine players, had been dropped, while Tom Finney had been ruled out through injury.</p> <p>The day after, when we had some free time, Duncan Edwards asked me if I fancied walking into the West End with him. We cut through Hyde Park and shared stories about our backgrounds. He was interested to learn that the Graingers and the Hollidays hailed from Dudley, Staffordshire, the town where he was born in 1936. We spoke about Joe Mercer, who was not only my manager at Sheffield United but also the man who, as the coach of the England schoolboys\u2019 team, recommended Edwards to Manchester United in 1952. Edwards might otherwise have signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers or Aston Villa.</p> <p>As we strolled around London, Edwards and I enjoyed our anonymity, taking in the sights like wide-eyed tourists, and even going shopping. It was Edwards\u2019s idea to go to a lingerie shop. A gift for the lady, he said, picking up a saucy pair of knickers with that childlike charm of his. The lady in question was Molly Leech, to whom he was engaged. I was a bit more self-conscious when I selected something appropriate (ie, less risqu\u00e9) to take back to Doreen in Havercroft. It required no small amount of dexterity to get these gifts into our rooms back at the hotel in Lancaster Gate without any of the other players noticing.</p> <p>Edwards was something of a paradox. He was shy in social situations, yet he had the most endearing personality. For example, whereas most of us conformed to protocol and addressed Walter Winterbottom as \u201cMr Winterbottom\u201d, Edwards always called him \u201cWalter\u201d \u2013 in that thick Black Country accent that we all liked to imitate. Nobody else would have got away with such informality where Winterbottom was concerned but, then, nobody else had Edwards\u2019s attractive disposition off the pitch or magical exuberance on it. Although I was aged only 22 at that time, Edwards made me feel like I was of an older generation.</p> <p>As my relationship with Edwards seemed to develop quickly into a friendship, I felt a part of the England structure. I woke up on the morning of the match feeling good. I read the newspapers. \u201cStan\u2019s back: England need him again,\u201d read one headline. \u201cColin Grainger beats brother Jack to first family cap,\u201d went another.</p> <p>Apparently I was \u201cthe fastest footballer in England\u201d; quicker aged 22 than I was three years earlier when I could sprint 100 yards in 10.4 seconds. Journalists noted that I was now earning \u201ctop money\u201d at Sheffield United \u2013 20 quid \u2013 and that my speed and direct style could find gaps in the \u201csquare Brazilian defence\u201d. Everything I read seemed designed to make me feel great. But when the time came to get on the bus to Wembley, the nerves kicked in, and everything around me \u2013 the players on the bus, the spectators outside walking to the stadium, the discordant sounds \u2013 turned into an overwhelming assault on the senses.</p> <p>Trembling and sweating, all I could think of was the members of my family who had come down for the match to form part of a 100,000 capacity crowd. What were they thinking? Would they get their tickets OK? Would I let them down? Was I really of the required standard for a career at international level?</p> <p>In the dressing room, I found myself changing next to Stanley Matthews, which, I think, Walter Winterbottom arranged deliberately, possibly in an attempt to calm my nerves. \u201cDo you still get nervous before these big matches, Stanley?\u201d I asked him, partly out of curiosity, partly out of the need to fill an uncomfortable silence. \u201cNervous? I am as nervous as you, Colin.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"497c9db42c471dd1af5185eee3157111f07c6874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/497c9db42c471dd1af5185eee3157111f07c6874/0_0_3368_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The matchday programme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"770\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then he swigged something from one of those new Babycham bottles. I did not ask him what it was but he was shaking so much that some of the liquid spilt all over the floor. He was nearly 20 years older than I and had been a professional since before I was born. He was an idol of mine. He was above sharing a room and the dinner table with his colleagues. And yet, on that blissful afternoon, as Matthews\u2019s hands juddered, I realised that there was something wonderfully egalitarian about the Wembley dressing room.</p> <p>Walter Winterbottom had given us some information about the Brazilians. They were great on the ball and technically superb, but not good at closing you down when you had the ball. Our plan was simple: do not let them have the ball and they will fade away. At that time, Brazil had never won a World Cup, and while there was an aura about them, it was not an aura of invincibility. I formed the impression early on that they had more to fear about England than we had to fear about them. One of the first things I noticed was that the Brazilians wore boots like slippers, made of fine leather. Our boots had improved from 10 years earlier but were still heavy and cumbersome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/23/the-psychology-of-football-rivalries\">The psychology of football rivalries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tommy Taylor scored to give England the lead inside three minutes, which was long enough for us to realise that the Brazilians were limited when it came to the arts of defending. This was easier than I expected, and confidence engulfed my being, replacing the apprehension that had made the pre-match countdown so debilitating. When we had arrived at Wembley two hours earlier, it felt as though my veins contained cement, but now they contained rocket fuel.</p> <p>In the fifth minute, Stanley Matthews received the ball near the corner flag and then, as a loud cheer circulated the stadium, he flicked it between Canhoteiro\u2019s legs to feed the England right-back, Jeff Hall. Hall\u2019s pass forward found Taylor, who beat Pav\u00e3o. The ball went across the goal from Johnny Haynes, and there I was, drifting in at the far post, in perfect position to side-foot the ball home from four yards out.</p> <p>As England debuts went, this was perfect: five minutes of action, my first touch, and already I had engraved my name on the list of England goalscorers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"317c4498ccdc6aced40e7e9627692d28a87a7e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317c4498ccdc6aced40e7e9627692d28a87a7e9c/0_0_3360_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Grainger with the matchday programme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Grainger with the programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brazil responded by scoring twice early in the second half, through Paulinho and Didi, and then John Atyeo missed a penalty for England just after the hour mark. Tommy Taylor restored our lead in the 65th minute, before Roger Byrne missed a penalty two minutes later. The match became exciting, with Brazil pushing forward in search of an equaliser but leaving gaps in midfield and at the back.</p> <p>Billy Wright in defence and Duncan Edwards in midfield were superb, as was Stanley Matthews on the right wing. I was always impressed with Wright\u2019s timing in the air, which enabled him to out-jump taller men. In the 83rd minute, I picked the ball up on the halfway line, laid it off to Johnny Haynes and kept running. Haynes passed wide to Stanley Matthews, who made light work of Nilton Santos\u2019s attempted tackle, and I continued my run towards the left of the penalty area. Matthews\u2019s cross to the far post was accurate and clever, forcing Gilmar, the Brazil goalkeeper, out of position. I darted towards the six-yard box, jumped as high as I could, and met the ball a split-second before Gilmar got there, and the roar of the crowd confirmed that my header was nestling in the back of the net for a 4-2 lead.</p> <p>Not in my wildest dreams did I envisage such a debut, but it was a fine victory for a fine team on a day that those present were unlikely to forget for a long time. After the tribulations of the matches against Hungary in 1953 and 1954, and the anti-climax of the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, the England team had reclaimed its lost horizon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=true&amp;is-extract=true&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F29e76c097605877df6c671a741823498af016594%3Fcrop%3D0_0_343_499&amp;title=The%20Singing%20Winger&amp;author=Colin%20Grainger%20and%20Hyder%20Jawad&amp;publisher=deCoubertin%20Books&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FSinging-Winger-Colin-Grainger%2Fdp%2F190924595X\" data-alt=\"x\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=true&is-extract=true&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F29e76c097605877df6c671a741823498af016594%3Fcrop%3D0_0_343_499&title=The%20Singing%20Winger&author=Colin%20Grainger%20and%20Hyder%20Jawad&publisher=deCoubertin%20Books&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FSinging-Winger-Colin-Grainger%2Fdp%2F190924595X\">x</a> </figure>  <p>I discovered later the reason why Stanley Matthews was so keyed-up: apparently Brazilian journalists were writing that he would be no match for Nilton Santos. As events unfolded, the opposite proved to be the case. Matthews was world-class, even at the age of 41. Whatever was in that Babycham bottle was doing him good.</p> <p>Afterwards, I was at the back of the bus with Roger Byrne and as the Twin Towers of Wembley faded into the distance, he turned to me and said: \u201cColin, look at that. Just look at that. Once you\u2019ve played at Wembley, you\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p> <p>One match, two goals, and suddenly \u2013 having begun the week by feeling inconsequential \u2013 I felt now part of the England set-up.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has increased the risk of shortages of several essential medicines. Raw materials for many key drugs, such as antibiotics and statins, are manufactured in China, where factories have been disrupted by efforts to contain the virus. Will this mean shortages for the NHS?</p> <p>The drug supply chain relies on what are known as \u201cactive pharmaceutical ingredients\u201d \u2013 the basic molecules used to make drugs. These raw materials are manufactured in China and then exported to India and other countries where they are formulated into tablets or injections, for sale worldwide. Indian companies procure 70% of their raw materials with ingredients from China, where manufacturing is cheap. The <a href=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/features/india-and-china-spark-concerns-for-uk-drug-supplies/20206998.article?firstPass=false\">NHS imports</a> 80-90% of its drugs supply from abroad, and 25% of its generic drugs from India.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If new treatments for coronavirus emerge in the next few months, the UK can\u2019t afford to be the last link in a vulnerable chain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the height of the Chinese Covid-19 epidemic, Chinese factory production was stopped. Workers were quarantined and transport between factories was <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30459-1/fulltext,\">disrupted</a>, so key raw materials weren\u2019t produced. After supplies of Chinese raw materials ran out, companies in India and elsewhere could no longer produce and export the same volume of medicines.</p> <p>In response to shortages, India decided to provide its people with essential medicines first. The country recently banned exports of key medicines such as antibiotics, statins and paracetamol. In the long-term, this could wreak havoc on the NHS supply line. Although some Chinese factories have reopened, it is unclear when production will be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/12/814623335/how-coronavirus-is-affecting-the-u-s-pharmaceutical-supply\">fully restored</a>, or when India will lift its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51731719\">restrictions on drug exports</a>.</p> <p>In the short-term, as a result of no-deal Brexit planning, the NHS has a reserve supply of drugs to <a href=\"https://medicines.necsu.nhs.uk/no-deal-brexit-continuity-of-medicines-supplies/\">prevent shortages occurring</a>. But these contingency plans won\u2019t last for ever.</p> <p>We have seen drug shortages in the past, albeit on a smaller scale. In 2008, after Chinese factories closed near Beijing for three weeks during the Olympic Games, there were <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/olympics-spawned-api-shortages\">shortages of raw materials</a>. In 2019 an epidemic of swine flu in China depleted the global <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-30/mass-chinese-pig-deaths-cause-short-supply-of-u-s-blood-thinner\">supply of heparin</a>, an essential medicine to prevent heart attacks. In Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-so-many-medicines-arel-in-short-supply-after-hurricane-maria/\">damaged another factory making heparin</a>, which disrupted supplies of the drug in 2017.</p> <p>The effects of coronavirus will last for months, and will expose the vulnerabilities of our drug supply chain. We need to apply new stress tests to the NHS drug supply chain. How will the NHS cope if Chinese supplies are continually disrupted? How will it be affected by disruptions to supplies of drugs from other countries, such as Italy? For each essential medicine, are there alternative suppliers in other countries? And are there alternative drugs that patients could take if one drug is no longer available? Stress tests were applied to the banking system after the financial crisis of 2008. Our supplies of medicines are equally important, and should be tested in similar ways.</p> <p>Instead of relying on imports, we should re-evaluate the case for manufacturing more medicines in the UK. Britain has a long history of pharmaceutical development. During the second world war, Glaxo Laboratories in the UK <a href=\"https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/about-us/our-history/building-brands-1919-1949/\">manufactured 7.5 billion tablets of penicillin</a> a year. Now, however, both the UK and US <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/u-s-officials-worried-about-chinese-control-american-drug-supply-n1052376\">depend on supplies of penicillin from China</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/the-covid-19-crisis-is-a-chance-to-do-capitalism-differently\">The Covid-19 crisis is a chance to do capitalism differently | Mariana Mazzucato</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Human trials for a coronavirus vaccine will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">begin in April</a> \u2013 but before a vaccine is ready, we will need to ensure that key drugs to treat the symptoms of coronavirus are available for everyone who needs them. Pilot studies from France and the US suggest that <a href=\"https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/French-researcher-in-Marseille-posts-successful-Covid-19-coronavirus-drug-trial-results\">hydroxychloroquine</a> can lessen the severity of coronavirus infection. A clinical trial in Shanghai is currently evaluating whether pirfenidone could <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04282902\">improve lung function</a> for people with severe disease. More definitive clinical trial results of these and other drugs are expected in May and June.</p> <p>These drugs are already being manufactured in other countries. But the acute worldwide demand for drugs to treat coronavirus could easily outstrip supply. In times of shortage, other countries could stockpile their supplies to treat their own people. Like India, they may be unwilling to export drugs to the UK.</p> <p>Supply chains are only as strong as their weakest links. If new treatments for coronavirus emerge in the next few months, the UK can\u2019t afford to be the last link in a vulnerable chain. The government has already requested that UK companies manufacture more ventilators and protective masks. It should do the same with the UK pharmaceutical industry, repurposing factories to produce drugs that help treat coronavirus and any other essential medicines at risk of shortage.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Hill is a senior research fellow in the Institute of Translational Medicine at the University of Liverpool.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>1) Whilst the rest of the sporting world is shutting down, the relatively low spread of coronavirus in Mexico means that Liga MX was one of the few major global football leagues still playing matches last weekend. As this parish has previously covered, the Mexican top flight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-agony-and-the-ecstasy/2017/feb/09/football-league-liga-mx-mexico-club-america-chivas\">is no backwater</a>.

Goalkeeper Mois\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz was the hero in the shootout, saving Javier Orozco\u2019s effort as Am\u00e9rica won 4-2. Herrera\u2019s celebrations in the rain are also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOLkUTVT7ko\">quite something</a>.</p> <p>Spare a thought for Cruz Azul. That defeat in 2013 prolonged a wait for a league crown that is still ongoing and stretches back to 1997. La Maquina\u2019s last title was secured in almost equally dramatic and certainly more violent circumstances than their aforementioned loss.

  "<p>The US healthcare system is helping to kill people in staggering numbers. And when it isn\u2019t driving Americans to an early grave, the medical industry is bleeding the rest of the country of resources at the expense of decent jobs, crucial infrastructure and schools, according to a new book by two of the country\u2019s leading economists.</p> <p>As America\u2019s health system faces its greatest challenge of recent times in the coronavirus, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who won the 2015 Nobel prize for economics, say the pursuit of profit by medical corporations has played a leading role in the surge of \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d since the 1990s, led by opioid overdoses, alcoholism and suicide.</p> <p>The Princeton economists were the first to reveal the phenomenon which by 2017 was claiming the lives of 158,000 Americans every year \u2013 a number they liken to three 737s\u2019 worth of passengers falling out of the sky every day. Case and Deaton, who are married, also discovered that the surge in deaths of despair was overwhelmingly among white working-class Americans without a university degree, and that it was forcing down life expectancy in the US.</p> <p>Now their new book, <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190785/deaths-of-despair-and-the-future-of-capitalism\">Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism</a>, explores why this tragedy is an unusually American phenomenon and concludes that the greed of the US\u2019s medical corporations was both an important driver in creating the conditions for the rise in deaths of despair and in providing the means for many to kill themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is something going on in America that is different, and that is particularly toxic for the working class</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is something going on in America that is different, and that is particularly toxic for the working class,\u201d they write.</p> <p>The book springs from Case and Deaton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/08/inequality-is-now-killing-middle-america-joseph-stiglitz\">shocking revelations</a> five years ago about the causes of so many Americans dying in middle age and younger, a phenomenon not seen in any other industrialised country. Life expectancy rose sharply in the US through the 20th century but over the past two decades fell by 25% for white Americans without a university degree even as it continued to rise for the better educated and for other races. The geography of this tragedy \u2013 people dying younger in West Virginia and Mississippi and living longer in New York and California \u2013 reflects the country\u2019s deepening class divide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8961e55e7812ef863f5d954c5905497fab13f3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8961e55e7812ef863f5d954c5905497fab13f3bf/0_0_4500_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial in Huntington, West Virginia.

They are claiming lives all around me | Jessika Bohon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe American healthcare system is a leading example of an institution that, under political protection, redistributes income upwards to hospitals, physicians, device-makers, and pharmaceutical companies while delivering among the worst health outcomes of any rich country,\u201d the economists write.</p> <p>That in turn has contributed to the retreat of steady, decently paid work in working-class communities at the cost of social cohesion and helped drive the retreat to drugs and alcohol, and an increase in suicides.</p> <p>\u201cThe pillars that held communities together are a job with meaning, a family life that was stable, getting to know and raise your kids, and hope for them for the future,\u201d said Case. \u201cAttachment to traditional churches fell dramatically as well. In the US, organised religion is an incredibly important institution and gave people a place of comfort during difficult times.\u201d</p> <p>The economists say that while globalisation and technical change, particularly robots, are often blamed for destabilising communities, other industrialised countries facing similar challenges have not experienced a comparable rise in deaths of despair. They conclude that the greed of America\u2019s medical industry played a central role, calling it \u201ca cancer at the heart of the economy\u201d that has resulted in a \u201cuniquely American calamity that is undermining American lives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnlike the countries of Europe, we have let the healthcare sector just run totally free. Totally, in that it was 5% of GDP in 1960 and it\u2019s 18% of GDP today. It\u2019s eating the economy from the inside out,\u201d said Case.</p> <p>In other industrialised countries medical treatment is covered at least to some degree by public funds. The structure of US healthcare passes the cost to the individual or their employer through private insurance. As the medical industry has grown more rapacious, so insurance premiums have surged and patients have been required to make ever larger out-of-pocket payments that can amount to thousands of dollars a year.</p> <p>US drugmakers charge up to 10 times as much for insulin in a country where diabetes is rampant as they do across the border in Canada. For many Americans, the extra hundreds of dollars a month are not covered by insurance.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost of healthcare is like a tribute that Americans have to pay to a foreign power,\u201d the economists write.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb6ad490c8232719ef98b918b7dcf9016aeecf4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6ad490c8232719ef98b918b7dcf9016aeecf4c/0_0_4500_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sometimes staggering cost of health care means that Americans in need of everyday items such as insulin to treat diabetes resort to the black market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sometimes staggering cost of healthcare means that Americans in need of everyday items such as insulin to treat diabetes resort to the black market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Case and Deaton said that has taken a toll on employers too over the past two decades and contributed to the decline of working-class communities.</p> <p>\u201cFirms used to be able to afford to be the providers of social insurance, both healthcare and defined benefit plans for pensions. But we don\u2019t live in that world any more. So that as healthcare becomes more and more expensive, these firms can\u2019t afford to keep on workers that aren\u2019t worth to them what they have to pay for their healthcare,\u201d said Case.</p> <p>So jobs get outsourced to contract workers who, if they have health insurance through their employers at all, find that it comes with requirements to pay thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs before their insurance kicks in. Many low-income families deal with this by not going to the doctor except in an emergency, or taking only take half their prescription pills each day to minimise costs, and so compounding the social crisis as their health fails.</p> <p>The burden of extortionate medical costs is also felt by state governments forced to divert funds from crucial infrastructure maintenance, education and other public work projects to fund the public Medicaid scheme for very low-income families.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not a free market at all. It\u2019s a giant swamp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The economists attribute this to a failure of capitalism, arguing that healthcare and the free market are incompatible. But Deaton, a Scot who is now also a US citizen, scoffs at the idea that this is the free market at work when medical corporations pour vast amounts of money into buying politicians and laws to protect what he goes so far as to suggest is a corrupt health system.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a free market at all. It\u2019s a swamp. It\u2019s a giant swamp that\u2019s killing people in large numbers and making a lot of providers very rich,\u201d said Deaton.</p> <p>Case hopes their research will \u201chelp people connect the dots between what\u2019s happened in the healthcare industry and what\u2019s happening to low-wage workers in America.</p> <p>\u201cIf enough people understood that the reason that these once great state universities have to increase their tuition to the point where in-state kids can\u2019t go any more because the state can\u2019t afford to fund them, because their Medicaid bills are so expensive; or if people understood that the reason that infrastructure is decaying is because the states don\u2019t have the money because they\u2019re paying their Medicaid bills; or if people understood that the reason that they\u2019re being outsourced is because of the cost of healthcare premiums, maybe there might be enough of a push for cost control to actually see real change,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That may become even more evident if the toll of the coronavirus includes bankrupting medical bills for weeks of treatment for large numbers of Americans. But Deaton does not underestimate the forces arrayed against change.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a system that was designed by an immensely clever team of devils who programmed it in a way that is self-protecting and really difficult to change,\u201d he said.</p> <p><em>Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, Princeton University Press,</em> <em>$29.95 / \u00a325</em></p>",

Purchases of government bonds and semi-government securities across the yield curve will be conducted to help achieve this target as well as to address market dislocations. These purchases will commence tomorrow.

Further details about the implementation of this are provided in the accompanying notice.</li> \n   <li><strong>A term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses. </strong>The Reserve Bank will provide a three-year funding facility to authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) at a fixed rate of 0.25%. ADIs will be able to obtain initial funding of up to 3% of their existing outstanding credit. They will have access to additional funding if they increase lending to business, especially to small and medium-sized businesses. This facility is for at least $90bn. Further details are available in the accompanying notice.The Australian government has also developed a complementary program of support for the non-bank financial sector, small lenders and the securitisation market, which will be implemented by the AOFM.</li> \n   <li><strong>Exchange settlement balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under the previous arrangements. </strong>This will mitigate the cost to the banking system associated with the large increase in banks\u2019 settlement balances at the Reserve Bank that will occur following these policy actions.</li> \n  </ol> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:35:39.185Z\">at 3.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e77d8f088d7575596269\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:31:26.765Z\">3.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More information here:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBAInfo/status/1240480672759889920\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At a meeting yesterday, the Reserve Bank Board agreed to a comprehensive package to support the Australian economy through the current challenging period - <a href=\"https://t.co/YYzRnpZGyO\">https://t.co/YYzRnpZGyO</a></p>\u2014 RBA (@RBAInfo) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RBAInfo/status/1240480672759889920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:32:20.523Z\">at 3.32am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e71c8f085e564ad86dc8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:30:40.548Z\">3.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">RBA announcement</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rates have been cut to a historic low of 0.25%.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:31:54.192Z\">at 3.31am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e5ab8f085e564ad86dc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lorena-allam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:23:46.524Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Northern Territory is already facing a healthcare crisis, because travel restrictions have severely limited the supply of nurses and doctors to remote areas, so it cannot afford to manage a Covid-19 outbreak, and should enact \u201cspecial isolation measures\u201d immediately.</p> \n  <p>Chief medical officer at central Australian Aboriginal Congress, Dr <strong>John Boffa</strong> has told reporters in Alice Springs that \u201cwe already have a crisis\u201d, because the remote area health corps is so heavily reliant on nurses from interstate and New Zealand, who now cannot travel.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe need reserve nurses and doctors from the army health corps,\u201d Boffa said.</p> \n  <p>Congress and a group of central Australian Aboriginal health and land council leaders are calling for the Northern Territory to declare itself a \u201cspecial controlled area\u201d to keep Covid-19 from spreading.</p> \n  <p>The closure of Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park is under consideration, according to the CEO of the Central Land Council <strong>Joe Martin-Jard</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMaybe there is a way to accommodate some visitors but in a very controlled way,\u201d Martin-Jard said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf we are in a special controlled area visitors would need to be quarantined for 14 days.</p> \n  <p>He said the traditional owners were \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the impacts of a closure, so are being careful with the decision.</p> \n  <p>Earlier the NT chief minister <strong>Michael Gunner</strong> said there was some legal complexity about the NT closing itself off, but he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep people safe.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:28:43.254Z\">at 3.28am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e4288f085c6327bc2b8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:20:07.564Z\">3.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The countdown is on for the RBA announcement \u2013 it is due in less than 15 minutes now.</p> \n  <p>Rates are expected to be cut to 0.25%, which the RBA considers to be its floor.

However, pregnant women are potentially at increased risk of complications from any respiratory disease due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy. These include reduced lung function, increased oxygen consumption and changed immunity.</p> \n   <p><strong>Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage, teratogenicity or vertical transmission of the Covid-19 virus. There is a possibility of an increased incidence of premature birth but there is insufficient evidence at this point in time</strong>.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recommends that, where possible, pregnant healthcare workers be allocated to patients, and duties, that have reduced exposure to patients with, or suspected to have, Covid-19 infection. </p> \n   <p>All personnel should observe strict hygiene protocols and have full access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). </p> \n   <p>The college also urges employers to be sensitive to the fact that pregnant women are, appropriately, often anxious about their own health and protective of their unborn baby. Consideration should be given to reallocation to lower-risk duties, working from home or leave of absence.</p> \n   <p>The current circumstances are unprecedented. The community will rely on the medical system to function at the highest level and near 100 percent participation of the medical, nursing and midwifery workforce. Specialist practitioners may need to re-allocate to other areas of the medical system. The college expresses our deep and sincere gratitude to our members, all doctors, nurses, midwives and other health care workers, the administrative staff and management of our hospitals and health services for their dedication, professionalism and compassion.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recognises that decisions around resource allocation are complex, and multifactorial, and defers to local jurisdictions in this regard.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:58:10.170Z\">at 12.58am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72bf428f085e564ad86ca7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/melissa-davey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:39:43.405Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Health Protection Principal Committee</strong>, comprised of all chief health officers and chaired by the chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020\">has published</a> the rationale behind its latest recommendations, including that schools remain open for now. Of course, this advice may change \u2013 school closures are not permanently off the table.</p> \n  <p>The committee says there is currently l<strong>imited information on the contribution of children to transmission of Covid-19</strong>. The World Health Organization found in China 2.4% of total reported cases were under the age of 19 years old. Worldwide, very few cases of infection in children have been severe or critical. The committee says;</p> \n  <p><em>\u201cThis contrasts distinctly with the severity pattern observed with other respiratory viruses, where young children are particularly at risk of severe disease.<br><br>\u201cPrevious studies suggest that the potential reduction in community transmission from pre\u2011emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements that are in place for children who are not at school. <strong>Children may require care from older carers who are more vulnerable to severe disease, or may continue to associate (and transmit infection) outside of school settings.</strong><br><br>\u201cBroadly, the health evidence on school closures from previous respiratory epidemics shows the costs are often underestimated and the benefits are overestimated. This may be even more so in relation to Covid-19 as, unlike influenza, the impact on otherwise healthy children has been minimal to date.<br><br>\u201cSchool closure is associated with considerable costs. S<strong>tudies have estimated that around 15% of the total workforce and 30% of the healthcare workforce may need to take time off work to care for children.

Influential festival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/06/sxsw-cancelled-coronavirus-austin\">SXSW,</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/06/sxsw-cancelled-coronavirus-austin\"> held in Austin, Texas</a>, was the firs<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/06/sxsw-cancelled-coronavirus-austin\">t</a> of many major music events to be cancelled this year; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\">Glastonbury</a> followed Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend in scrapping their 2020 plans. On an individual level, innumerable artists and bands have rearranged tours or scrapped them altogether. With streaming still offering low royalty rates for artists, most musicians rely on essential revenue from touring. So can a livestreamed show be a feasible replacement for the real thing?</p> <p>The immediate and long-term impact of these cancellations on the industry will be severe, says artist and researcher Mat Dryhurst. Usually, he says, \u201cthe only advice you can give someone in music to make money is to do a live show\u201d. Dryhurst believes that the coronavirus crisis is only amplifying the flawed, precarious nature of the music industry at large, and that wider reform is essential. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a future for telematic or remote performances,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it can\u2019t just be like, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re an entertainer, get your guitar out for the camera!\u2019 That\u2019s the worst version of all these things.\u201d Moreover, he\u2019s concerned that the platforms could \u201cend up being the beneficiaries\u201d if livestreaming became a mainstream expectation.</p> <p>Although livestreaming in music is nothing new \u2013 internet legend has it that a band called Severe Tire Damage were the first to perform live online in 1993, and <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/\">Boiler Room</a> has produced a decade of livestreams from the DJ-booth \u2013 there has been a boom in the last week. Artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/christine-and-the-queens\">Christine and the Queens</a> are encouraging fans to meet on Instagram for ad hoc performances, and a reported 13,000 people watched hardcore punk band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/13/code-orange-underneath-review\">Code Orange</a> stream on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/08/how-did-twitch-become-as-big-as-youtube-by-live-streaming-video-game-players\">Twitch</a> this week in place of a cancelled gig.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09b1867bd7ffd6bcce95a3044a8721a2e2d35310\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b1867bd7ffd6bcce95a3044a8721a2e2d35310/0_100_2902_1742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Code Orange livestreamed to 13,000 fans on Twitch in place of a cancelled gig.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Code Orange livestreamed to 13,000 fans on Twitch in place of a cancelled gig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atlantic Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each of these experiences is free to access \u2013 although other artists have been experimenting with monetisation. Brooklyn-based magazine Left Bank is hosting a <a href=\"https://leftbankmag.com/leftbanklive/\">virtual music festival </a>via YouTube, running 12 hours a day until 22 March with artists from around the world broadcasting from their bedrooms. Rather than charging fans for digital entry, they are encouraging listeners to tip the musicians they enjoy using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/17/venmo-payments-app-default-privacy-settings-public-information\">Venmo</a>. Left Bank Media founder Kristyn Potter explains that given the international spread of bands and fans, this was the simplest way to get artists paid without \u201cpotentially breaking any international money laws\u201d. Although limitations of licensing and intellectual property are yet to be fully hashed out by the industry, Potter enthuses: \u201cSome artists are made for this format \u2013 we\u2019ll definitely do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Music industry expert Cherie Hu argues that artists who do best on such platforms are not necessarily the most famous, but those who commit to the format on a long-term basis. Electronic musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/20/spotlight-on-hana-alt-pop-producer-grimes-lorde\">Hana</a>, best known for her collaborations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grimes\">Grimes</a>, has spent hundreds of hours on Twitch \u2013 a livestreaming platform favoured by gamers and owned by Amazon \u2013 to create an intimate connection with her fans. As she chats, makes music and plays games such as League of Legends, her 9,000 followers donate cash to show their appreciation. Rather than using it to sell records or produce the equivalent of a live gig, Hu explains, these artists tend to use \u201cstreaming to offer an insight into their lives and careers\u201d. The opportunity for backstage nuggets and private, more intimate conversations is what draws the fans in. Midway through Devine\u2019s Instagram Live, she jokes that it\u2019s like a VIP meet and greet event. One fan replies: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in the front row.\u201d</p> <p>Hu recently created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11wWL_7I4BG76t0V2kw1a4yIeWxUSfGwMQFYdUWAgSnA/preview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true\">a widely-shared Google Doc of live</a><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11wWL_7I4BG76t0V2kw1a4yIeWxUSfGwMQFYdUWAgSnA/preview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true\">streaming resources</a> designed to help artists suffering from the financial fall out of SXSW\u2019s cancellation \u2013 when I access it, a pop-up warns me that the document is experiencing unusually heavy traffic. Hu is positive about the potential of livestreaming, but hesitant to recommend it as an immediate solution. \u201cI think if artists approach livestreams in an interesting way, I can see it becoming a revenue stream for some of them,\u201d she says. \u201cBut those models aren\u2019t financially proven. From the artists\u2019 perspectives, there are definitely other channels that could bring them more immediate and concrete income.\u201d Buying an album and a T-shirt remains the most effective way of helping an artist with a cancelled tour.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGnw-x-46pE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GGnw-x-46pE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Electronic musician Hana livestreams the making of her album.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In her document, Hu warns readers that livestreaming is not an exact replacement for the financial, emotional or cultural value of a live show, which raises a further question: what does \u201clive\u201d mean, exactly? The academic debate about the topic usually centres on two key thinkers. Peggy Phelan, writing in 1993, argued that: \u201cPerformance\u2019s only life is in the present. Performance cannot be saved, recorded, documented\u2026 once it does so, it becomes something other than performance.\u201d Many music fans would likely agree: that it is a kind of magic in the air, the sense that anything could happen, and that whatever magic is happening, it\u2019s happening here and now. That said, there\u2019s big business in selling live music, or perceptions of it: the Rolling Stones alone have released 28 live albums to date.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Philip Auslander, whose celebrated book Liveness was published in 1999, responded to Phelan by calling the \u201cmagic of live theatre\u201d a reductive cliche. He argued instead that the phenomena of \u201cliveness\u201d is context-specific, nuanced and subjective. Twenty years later, we have more variations of \u201cliveness\u201d at our literal fingertips than Auslander or Phelan could have ever predicted. That sparkling feeling of \u201cliveness\u201d manifests differently on Instagram Live than it does in the digital lifespan of a popular gif, or in the overwhelming rush of new content being shared on TikTok.</p> <p>Dryhurst remains sceptical even about livestreaming\u2019s potential as a short-term solution. \u201cI don\u2019t know if music in this particular crisis needs to reinvent itself,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are already plenty entertained!\u201d Plus the sudden demand for these performances is putting extra pressure on musicians who are dealing with the stresses of the pandemic just like everyone else. \u201cI won\u2019t name names,\u201d he says, \u201cBut musicians have been panicking and sending me messages like, \u2018Should I be learning how to livestream?\u2019 I\u2019m kind of annoyed that they are feeling that anxiety on top of worrying about their parents.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThrough my dread and my fear, I saw the beauty in them, the patterns in the universe. I could tell it was dangerous, this raw energy, this coursing feeling, and for a moment, I wished I could tumble in, tumble into the madness.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine Cho\u2019s episode of postpartum psychosis came on when her baby was three months old. She and her husband James had taken Cato to America from their home in London to introduce him to his relatives. Everywhere they went, their Korean families told them off for defying the Korean custom of keeping the baby inside for the first 100 days and risking his health during the flu season. Cho took on their anxiety, doubting her own ability to cope. Then one day she saw Cato\u2019s eyes as devils\u2019 eyes. Within hours, she lost all sense of time, imagining herself as her own grandmother and her son\u2019s child, and became convinced she was in hell and that her son was going to die as expiation for their sins. By the time she was sectioned, she had forgotten who she was.</p> <p><em>Inferno</em> is a brilliantly frightening memoir about Cho\u2019s two weeks on the psychiatric ward, elegantly interwoven with tales from her past. We hear about her childhood, raised by Korean parents in an austerely silent American home, where Cho had to protect her brother from her father\u2019s violent rages. We hear about her relationship with a near-murderous boyfriend, and then about her courtship with James, whose kindness promised to erase the past. There\u2019s no easy cause and effect here, no suggestion that past trauma causes the psychotic breakdown. But the past experiences resonate, and in fleeing her vulnerable son Cho also flees her own vulnerable younger self.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/07/my-baby-had-devils-eyes-the-reality-of-postpartum-psychosis\">\u2018My baby had devils\u2019 eyes\u2019: the reality of postpartum psychosis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Insights of this kind are rarely explicit. Cho\u2019s language is poetically associative and points are made through suggestive juxtaposition. Fragmentary structures can feel merely fashionable, but here it feels hard won, allowing Cho to juxtapose everyday reportage about life in a psychiatric ward with more florid accounts of her psychosis. While Cho paces, expresses milk to alleviate her painful breasts, and writes frenetically in the notebook where she is reconstructing her memories, she observes the other inmates, many of whom have no homes to return to. She notices that it\u2019s the race majority in the TV room who gets to be in charge of the remote control. And she learns the rules. As in prison, you never ask another resident why they are there.</p> <p>Arguably, by the time Cho is observing this, she has ceased to be as ill as she was when admitted. Indeed, the intelligent curiosity with which she observes the ward becomes a crucial part of her recovery. Given the brevity of her psychological problems, she may not have much new to tell us about psychosis. But the real strength of the book is its revelations about motherhood and mental illness. Running through her psychosis is fear about herself as a mother. She fears for her baby and that she will forget she\u2019s a mother altogether. These are common anxieties, and one of the book\u2019s most compelling suggestions is that even ordinary motherhood resembles psychosis. The sense of being outside time, the terror of being responsible for another life, the feeling that the word \u201cmother\u201d defines us and yet remains dissociated from much of our mental life: these are familiar feelings, and yet Cho\u2019s book reminds us how close they are to psychological illness, especially when you add in the immigrant\u2019s feeling of living in parallel realities. Korean traditions and stories thread through the book, adding to the feeling that the reality Cho is now accustomed to \u2013 being a middle-class mother in Britain \u2013 is only another story, which might turn out to be as unreal as the fantastical folktales she\u2019s grown up with.</p> <p>In the end, Cho goes against Korean tradition by believing in love. \u201cAs for love,\u201d she writes at one point, it is seen by her relatives as \u201can unfortunate passion, irrational and destructive\u201d, partly because \u201cany happiness must be bought with sorrow\u201d. She comes to believe that it\u2019s her love for James that takes her into psychosis, because her attachment to him becomes the site of her vulnerability, and that pulls her out again. Her love for Cato is more elusive \u2013 and among the book\u2019s strengths is its bravery in admitting that the \u201cfierce, possessive affection\u201d she feels for her baby is very different from the kind of in\u2011love feeling she expected. When love fails, she has to remake her relationship with Cato. Part of what makes <em>Inferno</em> so moving is that we can feel her doing this as she writes, writing herself into motherhood and into a form of sanity that does not leave behind the insights enabled by psychosis.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Lara Feigel\u2019s Free Woman: Love, Liberation and Doris Lessing is published by Bloomsbury.

  "<p>If a week is a long time in politics, it\u2019s an eternity for governments dealing with coronavirus. The pandemic threatens to wreak havoc on health services and bring the global economy to a standstill. Though France has not reached the critical stage of its Italian neighbour, where permits are required to leave your house, it is inching closer towards quarantine.</p> <p>Less than a week ago, President Emmanuel Macron announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/france-at-war-how-parisians-are-coping-with-life-under-lockdown\">schools and universities</a> would be closed. Two days later, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, hastily took to the political stage to order that cafes, bars, cinemas and theatres be shut down by midnight that day. It was a Saturday evening, and the theatres and restaurants of Paris were full. On social media, people posted videos of relaxed customers enjoying a last drink in bars long after the curfew had commenced. Policemen surveyed the scene as bystanders. They did not dare to interrupt this ordinary show of French <em>joie de vivre</em>.</p> <p>The following day, still undeterred by the government\u2019s warnings, crowds were spotted in outdoor markets and parks across the country. Macron and Philippe were reportedly appalled by the population\u2019s lack of collective discipline. The French media reported that one of <a href=\"https://www.sudouest.fr/2020/03/16/en-finir-avec-l-esprit-de-jouissance-7334095-10142.php\">Macron\u2019s political advisers</a><strong> </strong>quoted Philippe P\u00e9tain\u2019s infamous 1940 speech: \u201cThe spirit of enjoyment has overpowered the spirit of sacrifice.\u201d P\u00e9tain, who served as the chief of state of Vichy France in collaboration with Nazi Germany, believed that France\u2019s abject military defeat in the summer of 1940 could only be explained by the population\u2019s lack of seriousness, poor work ethic and innate penchant for entertainment. P\u00e9tain singled out the leftwing Popular Front alliance, which granted workers their first ever paid holiday, as responsible for the country\u2019s military and moral collapse.</p> <p>After people showed little sign of heeding Macron\u2019s guidance, the president implemented further restrictive measures. During a speech on Monday, which invoked a mixture of Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, Macron insisted several times that the country was \u201cat war\u201d, and asked the French to stay at home and self-isolate for two weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5aa979468e657c4d26b22d261fd29c07e693c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5aa979468e657c4d26b22d261fd29c07e693c8/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers check a motorcyclist\u2019s travel certificate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers check a motorcyclist\u2019s travel certificate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Macron has become known for cutting public spending, so his pledges to fully fund the French national health service, \u201cwhatever the costs\u201d, came as a surprise. Most surprising of all, however, was his announcement to freeze controversial pension reforms that ignited a months-long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/french-unions-strikes-emmanuel-macron-pension-reforms\">nationwide strike</a> earlier this year. What the political left, the French unions and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\">gilets jaunes</a> could not achieve after a year of intense political backlash, coronavirus has done in just a few days.</p> <p>This is the closest France has come so far to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/11/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-leaves-streets-deserted-in-pictures\">Italian-style lockdown</a>. In theory, all French citizens are confined at home and should work from there. Everyone has to download an <em>attestation de d\u00e9placement d\u00e9rogatoire</em> (an exceptional travel certificate). You are not required to show proof that you have a right to be out on the street; people self-certify and sign the \u201cdeclaration of honour\u201d. The government is hoping that people will follow the rules.</p> <p>But the first day of the national lockdown did not go according to plan. In some big cities (notably Paris), large crowds could be seen wandering in the streets. Shoppers bustled through the streets; few wore masks or kept the one-metre distance.<strong> </strong>The police began issuing on-the-spot fines to citizens who weren\u2019t carrying travel certificates. Didier Lallement, the police chief of Paris who has presided over a dramatic increase in alleged cases of <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200124-focus-france-french-police-brutality-under-scrutiny-paris-yellow-vest-pension-reform-protests\">police brutality</a>, threatened to use more \u201cexpedient\u201d measures to force people to obey orders.</p> <p>The situation has dramatically worsened this week. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/\">1,200</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/\">new cases </a>were detected in one day, bringing the total number of reported cases to 6,633. At the time of writing, there are now 7,730 diagnosed cases and 175 have died after having contracted the virus. Stronger measures should probably have been taken earlier. Macron has acted decisively \u2013 but not consistently. Just a week ago, he invited the French to carry on life as usual, while on the same weekend that Macron closed bars and cinemas, the French executive flip-flopped on whether to hold local elections (<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200316-france-set-to-postpone-second-round-of-local-elections-over-coronavirus-fears\">they have since been postponed</a>). Instead of giving orders once the virus had already begun to spread, Macron would perhaps have been well advised to sketch out how, in a time of coronavirus, a new French resistance could help contain the outbreak.</p> <p>\u2022 Philippe Marli\u00e8re is professor of French and European politics at University College, London</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 March 2020 to correct Emmanuel Macron\u2019s announcement on pension reforms: they will be frozen, not reversed.</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What do I need to work at home during the coronavirus outbreak? At this rate, we might all be working from home for a year! How will the broadband providers cope? Do we need a plan B? <strong>FranklySwiss</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Everyone will need their own customised solution, but there are two things to think about. First, will you be working at home for two weeks or four months or possibly forever? I share the view that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/13/covid-19-could-cause-permanent-shift-towards-home-working\">Covid-19 could cause a permanent shift towards home working</a>.</p> <p>Second, who is paying for homeworking equipment and services: you or your employer?</p> <p>If you\u2019ll only be working at home for a short time, you can probably get away with not buying much new equipment or signing up to remote working services. If you\u2019re in for the long haul, try to match or preferably beat the equipment you would normally use in the office. If you can\u2019t afford a <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/ThinkPad-T490s/p/22TP2TT490S\">ThinkPad T490s</a> (\u00a31,213.71), for example, get as close to the specification as possible.</p> <p>If you are paying for your own kit, you may want to take an economical approach. But if the company is insisting that you work from home, ask for ergonomic equipment. This often costs more, but is worth it in the long run.</p> <p>If your company has an IT department, then it should either supply or advise you on which equipment and software to use. This may well include a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network\">VPN</a> and a two-factor authentication system, such as <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/\">YubiKey</a>.</p> <p>One of the IT department\u2019s jobs is to make choices for tens or even tens of thousands of employees. You may not like their choices \u2013 I usually don\u2019t \u2013 but letting everybody pick their own collaborative software, messaging app or video conferencing system doesn\u2019t work. Of course, this doesn\u2019t prevent people from setting up unofficial groups on WhatsApp or Facebook.</p> <p>The good news is that you may end up being more productive when you don\u2019t spend hours commuting or in meetings, taking long lunches or catching up with the latest gossip.</p> <p>The bad news is that you have to set and stick to office routines without the external pressure to turn up on time, take regular meal breaks, and keep to a reasonable sleep schedule. Every company has early birds and night owls, so their work times are likely to diverge. However, you must overlap during some agreed office hours when everyone is always available.</p> <p>Self-discipline is why much of the advice about working from home includes things such as getting dressed for work, even though you might work just as well in your dressing gown. But if you talk to colleagues or customers over video links, you must keep up appearances. You will be judged.</p> <h2><strong>Temporary office</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ace7bc9bce892f72cc107b6ce7699a26478af02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ace7bc9bce892f72cc107b6ce7699a26478af02/0_115_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nice though it may be, your original iMac may not be up to the task of working from home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nice though it may be, your original iMac may not be up to the task of working from home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you will only be working at home for a short time, you won\u2019t need much in the way of extra equipment. If you have your own laptop, you will only need an external USB keyboard and mouse, and you may already have those. After that, you can think about a separate monitor, an external hard drive for backup purposes, and either a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=powered+four-port+USB+hub&amp;i=computers\">powered four-port USB hub</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=usb+3+docking+station&amp;i=electronics\">docking station</a> to connect them all together.</p> <p>Laptops have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/jun/20/using-laptops-tablets-physical-pains\">bad ergonomics</a> so you should not use them for sustained periods of work. You can solve this problem by making your laptop work like a desktop, by putting it on a commercial <a href=\"https://www.feelbetterclinic.co.uk/2017/10/30/laptop-riser-prevent-back-pain-neck-pain/\">riser</a> or a pile of books and plugging in an external keyboard and mouse. Your eyebrows should be roughly level with the top of the screen, so you can work without slouching.</p> <p>Buy a docking station if you can. If you plug your laptop and all the peripherals into a docking station, you only need to unplug a single cable from the laptop to be able to take it somewhere else. That makes it easy to get a change of scene by working in another room or in the garden.</p> <p>One major problem with working on a laptop is that most domestic tables and many desks are too high. Your arms should be angled slightly downwards when you are typing, not upwards. You can solve this problem by buying an accessory <a href=\"http://ergonomictrends.com/tips-picking-best-ergonomic-keyboard-tray/\">keyboard tray</a>, where the keyboard sits under the table top, or an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06Y4CQS2W\">adjustable chair</a>, where seat height is the key dimension. However, both of those are getting into home office territory.</p> <p>Otherwise, the supreme law for working from home is <em>thou shalt not lose thy work</em>. Make hitting Ctrl-S (for save) a reflex action. Save files to your local hard drive and to an online drive (OneDrive is built into Windows 10), and back them up to an external hard drive or USB thumb drive. Even if you are saving your work on a company server or in an online office suite \u2013 such as Microsoft, Google or Zoho \u2013 you may need a local copy if your comms link goes down.</p> <h2><strong>Permanent office</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"253df1fa4ccaf222cb119f21889d80111ea4ac15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/253df1fa4ccaf222cb119f21889d80111ea4ac15/196_140_3932_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If you can set up a home office in a disused room then it\u2019s a lot easier to get a set up that suits your work, whether it\u2019s an ergonomically organised laptop on a riser or a multi-screen command and control centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you can set up a home office in a disused room then it\u2019s a lot easier to get a set up that suits your work, whether it\u2019s an ergonomically organised laptop on a riser or a multi-screen command and control centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much the best way to work at home is to set up a proper office in a spare bedroom, junk room, attic, conservatory, garden shed or David Cameron-style <a href=\"https://www.redskyshepherdshuts.co.uk/blogs-new/2019/2/28/3t2t88zy0h0krcnzdwtd2l47rlxq9i\">shepherd\u2019s hut</a>.

It\u2019s also easy to do, thanks to software such as Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams, GoToMeeting, Google Hangouts, TeamViewer and more.</p> <p>You will look and sound a lot better if you buy a decent webcam with 1080p (Full HD) resolution.

Even if everyone starts video chatting, there is easily enough capacity for home workers during the day. However, you should either have an unlimited business broadband service, like me, or a cellular backup based on <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/mobile-wifi-3656619/\">a mobile router like a Mifi</a> or tethering a smartphone or whatever.</p> <p>Either way, your plan B should include an alternative device \u2013 a smartphone or tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard, or a spare laptop \u2013 and an alternative way of connecting to the office, even if it means using a hotspot while parked outside a local coffee shop. Sort out all the log-in and connection details and test it before you actually need it. You probably won\u2019t be able to do much work without an internet connection.</p> <h2><strong>Top tip</strong></h2> <p>Almost every operating system supports multiple users, so set up a separate account for work. Make this account look as much like your office PC as possible, with the same wallpaper and the same icons in much the same places. That way, you won\u2019t be distracted by whatever games, social media or entertainment services you use when not working.</p> <p>Using a separate account eliminates all your personal websites from your browsers and browser tabs. Having PornHub loaded is never a good look, even if you don\u2019t accidentally switch to it.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

  "<p>This week it was reported that several countries\u2019 closures of pubs and restaurants, along with other \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures intended to slow the rate of coronavirus infection, constituted \u201cdraconian\u201d measures, a common phrase for strict or severe actions.

There is a great scene in which Fabienne whimsically proclaims that all France\u2019s great female stars have surnames that begin with the same letter as their first names: Danielle Darrieux, Simone Signoret, Anouk Aim\u00e9e \u2013 and it is a joy to watch Deneueve\u2019s subtle wince or moue of suppressed disgust when someone adds: \u201cBrigitte Bardot.\u201d (No one dares point out that her own initials don\u2019t match.)</p> <p>It is very stylish, amusing work from Deneuve who comes as close to really loosening up as she is ever going to get, and there is, incidentally, an entertaining, brief shot of her walking her dog in Paris that Kore-eda repeats in full as an out-take over the closing credits.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpcFICXG4TQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JpcFICXG4TQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Fabienne has just published her memoirs, outrageously entitled La V\u00e9rit\u00e9, or The Truth, and, to mark this occasion, her screenwriter daughter Lumir (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliette-binoche\">Juliette Binoche</a>) has come from New York with her American husband, Hank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ethan-hawke\">(Ethan Hawke</a>), a failing TV actor, and their young daughter, Charlotte (Cl\u00e9mentine Grenier). Instantly, these memoirs cause uproar: her long-suffering assistant Luc (Alain Libolt) quits, because he is not mentioned in them at all, and Lumir is furious because Fabienne has invented ridiculous anecdotes about the loving mamma picking her up from school \u2013 when in fact she was always away filming.</p> <p>Yet Lumir\u2019s attitude to her mother and to their own troubled mother-daughter relationship changes subtly, and mysteriously, because Fabienne has invited her to come and watch the new movie that she is shooting, a sci-fi fantasy entitled Memories of My Mother, about a young woman in the future with a terminal disease who is able to use time travel to visit her young daughter at various ages; Fabienne is to play this daughter as an old woman. (It is based on a story by sci-fi author Ken Liu, and it has, in the real world, been adapted as a short film called <a href=\"https://www.beautifuldreamerfilm.com/\">Beautiful Dreamer</a>, by commercials director David Gaddie.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb311e8d521cdf3bda98337d808370a2b134a947\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb311e8d521cdf3bda98337d808370a2b134a947/686_136_848_509/500.jpg\" alt=\"Deneuve as Fabienne and Ethan Hawke as her son-in-law, Hank\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deneuve as Fabienne and Ethan Hawke as her son-in-law, Hank</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is intriguing to wonder if Kore-eda himself considered making his own version of Memories of My Mother, maybe in French, maybe with the same cast envisaged here \u2013 but then realised what a shame it would be to waste Deneuve in such a small part. In any case, this enigmatic story within a story has an echo with at least one part of Kore-eda\u2019s previous work: his cult docu-essay fantasy After Life from 1999, which imagined a future in which people are allowed to choose the most ecstatic moment of their lives in which to spend eternity.</p> <p>The Truth starts as a droll tale but then morphs into something else, something stranger and more elusive, something with a hint of fairytale magic realism, which plays with the interconnection between cinema and reality: Fabienne is continually reproached with her attitude to a certain contemporary whose lost career runs alongside Fabienne\u2019s own life in a sort of ghost parallel. Kore-eda might have had in mind at some subconscious level an inversion of the case of Deneuve\u2019s late sister Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac (although the analogy is hardly exact).</p> <p>As for Binoche\u2019s Lumir, the topsy-turvy spectacle of her mother appearing in a role much older than her character\u2019s mother affects her strangely, and she begins to see how she might use her own daughter in a dramatic ploy to rethink their relationship, and re-establish her own power within it. It\u2019s a startling, even shocking piece of imposture. This movie is an absorbing serio-comic flourish.</p> <p>\u2022 The Truth is released in the UK on 20 March and <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-the-truth-film-2020\">will be available on the Curzon Home Cinema streaming platform</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S20 Ultra superphone is packed to the brim with chart-topping features, including 100x zooming, 108MP cameras, a ginormous screen and 5G.</p> <p>The \u00a31,199 S20 Ultra leads an important new lineup of 5G-as-standard smartphones from Samsung, which looks to make the technology a normal part of mobile life rather than an expensive add-on for early adopters.</p> <p>But in 2020 5G alone isn\u2019t enough to stand out, so the S20 Ultra has a smorgasbord of stats and features that, on paper at least, make it unbeatable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4dfcf80f82ddac25298b3e67e307d7ad6cbb588\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4dfcf80f82ddac25298b3e67e307d7ad6cbb588/279_427_4078_2447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra back\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back is dominated by the massive camera lump, and is otherwise plain glass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First is the sheer size of the thing.

The 166.9mm length makes it difficult to pocket without injuring yourself or the phone when you sit down.</p> <p>The glass is slippery when cold or put on the sofa, but the phone is so big I can\u2019t see many using it without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/28/five-best-phone-grips-to-stop-smashed-screens\">some sort of case or a handle</a>.</p> <p>The screen\u2019s 120Hz refresh rate is twice the standard 60Hz, and faster still than last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">OnePlus 7 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/29/google-pixel-4-xl-review-not-quite-ready-for-primetime\">Pixel 4</a>.

In the US it has Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 865 instead. Both variants come with 12 or 16GB of RAM, which is more than most laptops.</p> <p>Performance all round was brilliant. Snappy, responsive and smooth, even with graphically intensive games. Like everything else, the battery is supersized in the S20 Ultra, with a capacity of 5,000mAh, which is about 1,000mAh bigger than the one in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/iphone-11-pro-max-review-battery-camera-screen\">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/22/oneplus-7t-pro-review-the-best-kind-of-deja-vu\">OnePlus 7T Pro</a>, and bigger than the 4,500mAh battery in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/21/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-review-bigger-faster-and-lasts-longer\">S10 5G</a>.</p> <p>Battery life ranges from an excellent 42 hours on 4G with the screen set to FHD+ at 60Hz, to 40 hours with that upped to 120Hz, and a solid 38 hours on Vodafone\u2019s 5G with 120Hz active. The S20 Ultra will get through even the heaviest of days without needing a charge.</p> <p>Fully charging the S20 Ultra took 70 minutes with the included power adapter, but closer to two hours with other 30-45W USB-C chargers. Fast 15W wireless charging and 7W wireless power-sharing is also available \u2013 great for charging your Galaxy Buds+ or other Qi-compatible phones from the back of the S20 Ultra.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2> <p>Samsung does not rate the battery in the S20 Ultra for a set number of charge cycles (which is typically 500) but does provide a one-year warranty. Despite being rated <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Galaxy+S20+Ultra+Teardown/131607\">as difficult to repair</a>, Samsung says the device is generally repairable and that the battery is replaceable, by authorised service centres at costs likely to be in excess of \u00a3200.</p> <p>Samsung offers <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/trade-in/\">trade-in</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsungrecycle.co.uk/\">recycling schemes</a> for old devices.

You can also do split-screen multitasking, have apps float over other apps (not just video), duplicate messaging apps such as WhatsApp so you can have two accounts on one phone, quickly manage two sims from the notification shade, and a plethora of other features.</p> <p>One UI 2 defaults to the traditional three-button Android navigation bar, but Android 10\u2019s new gesture navigation system makes using the super-sized screen easier.</p> <p>Samsung guarantees only two major Android versions from release. It provides monthly security updates for its devices but does not commit to a particularly length of support, instead listing the current support status of handsets on <a href=\"https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb\">its security site</a>. Other models such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">Galaxy S7 Edge</a> from 2016 are currently receiving only quarterly security updates.</p> <p>Apple supports its iPhones for approximately five years, including security and full iOS version updates. Google offers about three years of security and version updates for its Pixel line, while OnePlus offers two years of software plus another year of security updates.</p> <p>Samsung has recently made great strides, but you will still likely have to wait in the region of three months for major version Android updates to appear after Google releases them. \u00a31,199 is also a lot of money to pay for a phone that is only guaranteed updates for two years.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78b313c11523bd068e1728dad54fa09bfc7d18e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78b313c11523bd068e1728dad54fa09bfc7d18e4/574_567_3604_2163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camera app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samsung\u2019s camera app allows you to customise which modes are in the carousel, while the new Single Take mode that shoots videos, gifs and photos all at once is great fun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The massive lump on the back of the phone contains Samsung\u2019s new quad-camera system: a large 108MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide angle, 48MP telephoto with periscopic 4x optical zoom and a depth sensor. There\u2019s a 40MP front-facing camera poking through a small hole in the screen too.</p> <p>Samsung\u2019s camera system has taken a big leap forward over the last year, after lagging behind competitors from Apple, Google and Huawei. The quartet of cameras allows you to smoothly zoom from ultrawide angle (0.5x), through the wide angle (1x) and out to 4x optical zoom, then on to 10x hybrid zoom. From there you\u2019re into what Samsung calls \u201cSpace Zoom\u201d, which is essentially a digital zoom on top, taking you all the way to 100x magnification.</p> <p>The 12MP ultrawide camera produces some really good shots in most lighting conditions, excellent for creating a fisheye effect close up or for capturing more of a cityscape in one shot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82edb8c0093536d45efdb199976cc28408078980\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82edb8c0093536d45efdb199976cc28408078980/770_257_4047_2428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rear cameras\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Space Zoom might be a bit of marketing mumbo jumbo, but the optical and hybrid zoom is really rather impressive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main 108MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default, combining nine pixels on the sensor into one pixel of final image, in a process known as pixel binning. The resulting photos are great, striking an excellent balance of detail and low noise, although occasionally a little over-sharpened on full crop, even in the kind of middling light of British homes where previous Samsung cameras struggled. Samsung\u2019s dedicated night mode is good but not quite on the same level as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/29/google-pixel-4-xl-review-not-quite-ready-for-primetime\">Night Sight on the Pixel 4</a>, taking considerably longer to take the same shots.</p> <p>The live focus portrait mode is improved too, but given that the wide-angle camera takes images with plenty of natural <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh\">bokeh</a>, I found I didn\u2019t need to use the artificial mode. The camera app has the usual array of beautifying and smoothing features, if that\u2019s your jam.</p> <p>The camera can also shoot full 108MP shots, but I found that most of the time the 12MP mode produced better images. It\u2019s nice to have the creative option, though, as you can crop right into a 108MP image for a closeup without using a zoom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9CKnnLp9DI/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The 100x headline figure isn\u2019t really worth using except as a surrogate pair of binoculars, as images are full of artefacts. It\u2019s also worth noting it is very difficult to hold steady at 100x, despite Samsung\u2019s excellent picture-in-picture aiming box that pops up to help hit the target over 20x magnification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2wuhGcpsUI/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Everything pushed to excess.</p> <p>That excess is great when it means a massive battery, future-proofed 5G and a camera that\u2019s leagues ahead of where Samsung was a year ago. The combination of great main, ultra-wide and 4x optical cameras, with a 10x hybrid zoom, is so flexible and fun to use.

  "<p>You can learn a lot about someone\u2019s perspective from what they find reassuring at a time like this. This week I saw a private briefing from a bank, soothingly reassuring its clients that \u201cthis feels more like 9/11 than 2008\u201d. I think the point was to let investors know that this crisis is not systemic. It felt a bit like updating the old wartime spirit for today\u2019s hyper-capitalist economy: \u201cKeep well-capitalised, and carry on.\u201d</p> \n<p>I can think of a host of reasons why 9/11 does not bring calming thoughts to mind, but one is the long-term impact it had on human rights. Back then I was in the early stages of becoming a human rights lawyer. My very first day in court was with the team defending a victim of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/03/humanrights.terrorism\" title=\"\">extraordinary rendition</a>, where Britain had helped facilitate his torture. By the time I was practising, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/28/77-london-bombings-10th-anniversary-terror-attacks\" title=\"\">7 July London bombings</a> had happened, and so had draconian new laws \u2013 90-day detention without trial, plus sweeping surveillance and monitoring. Many Muslims remember this as the time that racial profiling and state harassment \u2013 in airports, on the tube, in the street \u2013 became the new normal.</p> \n<p>This might sound like a strange issue to raise when the national priority is \u2013 understandably \u2013 how to stop the spread of coronavirus, treat the sick and tackle the hit to the economy. But since last month, when the government drafted emergency regulations to grant police new powers \u2013 and more far-reaching laws are expected this week \u2013 the potential has been building for a clash between liberty, privacy and public health measures. The authorities now have the power to arrest and detain someone they believe is infectious for up to 14 days, to move that person around from custody facilities including secure hospitals, and to take blood or saliva from them by force, even if they are a child.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: all schools in UK to close from Friday; A-levels and GCSEs cancelled</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/129/contents/made\" title=\"\">legislation</a> set to come before parliament is likely to ban public gatherings, to widen police and immigration officer powers of detention and restraint, to give doctors powers to sign death certificates without seeing the deceased person\u2019s body, to allow fast-tracked burial and cremation, and to strip back services in care homes. People who refuse to self-isolate could be made to do so using the always contested \u201creasonable force\u201d.</p> \n<p>Our human rights protections \u2013 long maligned by many of the politicians now running our pandemic-stricken nation \u2013 were designed for moments such as this. They contain specific exemptions for situations in which the state needs to contain the spread of infectious disease. And the continuing shutdown caused by coronavirus doesn\u2019t make them less relevant, it makes them more important than ever.</p> \n<p>The proposed measures will contain safeguards \u2013 as they are constitutionally required to do so \u2013 especially rights to appeal.

One QC compared the idea to Germany\u2019s post-9/11 attempt to permit hijacked passenger planes to be shot down, as if the lives of those on board were expendable. Similarly, he suggests, the very idea of herd immunity would have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/will-johnsons-coronavirus-response-be-overthrown-eu-courts/\" title=\"\">subordinated human dignity</a> by treating it as a quantifiable entity that can be measured and weighed in the balance.\u201d</p> \n<p>There\u2019s the potential for a kind of tyranny of the majority \u2013 one of the reasons we need human rights in the first place \u2013 and then there are the new, established but upgraded, tyrannies of the state. China has developed an app of remarkably intrusive proportions, using facial recognition to track both your movements and those of everyone in your proximity, so that they can be tested in the event you become infectious.</p> \n<p>Israel is ditching superfluous apps altogether and simply allowing security services to hack infected people\u2019s phones to monitor their movements.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has insisted on a project of deliberate racial demonisation by calling Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 inflaming what we already know to be harmful prejudice against east Asian people, including those who have suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-panic-uk-hostile-environment-east-asians\" title=\"\">shameful abuse</a> in Britain. In one of the most surreal responses to the pandemic, commentators who are usually allergic to this form of social justice have belatedly discovered the concept of reparations \u2013 not for the genocidal abuses committed by Europeans over the centuries, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattwridley/status/1239627378307055616\" title=\"\">for Europeans</a> from the allegedly guilty Chinese. </p> \n<p>The truth is that China has been remarkably effective at stemming the spread of Covid-19, but has done so through a heady concoction of human rights abuses and authoritarian rule, of which no one should be envious. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/12/human-toll-chinas-coronavirus-control-efforts\" title=\"\">has reported</a> censorship; dissenters put \u201cunder quarantine\u201d; a disabled child left to die when his parent was forced into isolation; and a leukaemia sufferer turned away from hospital. </p> \n<p>That doesn\u2019t justify racism against Chinese people any more than the British should be stigmatised for the uniquely dodgy leadership we currently endure. This pandemic has exposed what many of us said about the Tories\u2019 long boast of \u201crecord high\u201d numbers of people in employment \u2013 namely, insecure workers with no rights and no safety net. Likewise, we warned about starving the NHS so that its resilience is shot, creating a generation of renters with no savings, and allowing homelessness and destitution to mushroom.</p> \n<p>These casualties had already become the new normal. But once we see newly troubling scenes \u2013 people arrested for resisting isolation or treatment \u2013 we will be reminded why this could become a crisis of rights, as much as it is one of disease.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>The Trump administration is putting the health and potentially lives of thousands of federal judges, lawyers, court staff and undocumented immigrants and their families at risk by insisting that immigration courts remain open for the deportation hearings of detained immigrants, despite the threat of coronavirus.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DOJ_EOIR/status/1240124718298038273\">announced</a> the temporary closure of 10 immigration courts in addition to the already shuttered location in Seattle. All deportation hearings relating to undocumented people who are not in custody have also been suspended.</p> <p>But a rare alliance of federal employees including immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing immigrants are saying the changes are too little, too late. With 58 immigration courts still open across the country, and only 11 closed, the prospect of courthouses acting as incubators and disseminators of the virus remains pronounced, with the risk of spreading the disease to large numbers of federal employees and the public.</p> <p>A judge working out of the immigration court in Denver, Colorado, is understood to have contracted Covid-19. The Denver court is one of the 58 ordered to remain open.</p> <p>Judge Samuel Cole, communications director of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), told the Guardian that the new restrictions were helpful but not enough. \u201cThere are still hearings going on across the country in courts that need to be closed because they are a public safety hazard.\u201d</p> <p>Staff in federal courts have been making increasingly desperate appeals to the Trump administration to abide by the guidelines set by its own disease control agency and temporarily close all immigration courts. But they have repeatedly been told that hearings must continue.</p> <p>It appears that amid the crisis over the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump is putting his desire to stand tough on immigration in an election year ahead of protecting the lives of government workers and the public. The instruction to keep going with immigration removal hearings of detained individuals issued by the DoJ has come from the top of the Trump administration, court employees have been told.</p> <p>Yet the approach directly conflicts with the guidance given by the government\u2019s own disease control agency. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Seattle_Community_Mitigation.pdf\">Latest advice</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that individuals at risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19 should avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. It also says that workplaces should \u201cencourage staff to telework\u201d.</p> <p>Yet deportation hearings for detained immigrants which frequently have 15 or so people holed up in closed-air courtrooms for several hours, must now carry on.</p> <p>\u201cPrioritizing politics above all else is incompatible with the principles of due process and is a danger to the health and security of all involved,\u201d Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the NAIJ, said before the new restrictions came into effect.</p> <p>Among the 10 courts that have been closed are three located in New York City that are among the busiest in the country. Court staff have been trying for days to persuade management to let them telework from home in line with CDC advice.</p> <p>A whistleblower working in the New York City immigration courts has shared with the Guardian details of how basic CDC guidelines have been flouted every day in the city\u2019s three immigration courts. Even after the announcement was made on Wednesday that the courts were closing, federal staff were told that they had to come into work for the rest of the week to \u201cassist with an orderly shutdown\u201d.</p> <p>The whistleblower said they were relieved the courts were being shuttered but they remained angry at how the issue has been handled. \u201cAt every turn when we brought up our concerns, management has downplayed and deflected responsibility. We could have been exposed for days, even weeks.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cThere is no other reasonable explanation to risk these many people\u2019s lives other than that the Trump administration hates immigrants so much they want to get rid of them. That is abhorrent to me.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days members of the public have been showing up at the New York courts looking visibly unwell. Yet only the most basic hygiene measures have been taken, the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Security guards have been instructed to wipe surfaces clean in courtrooms and waiting rooms where suspected coronavirus cases have been present. \u201cThat\u2019s the extent of the deep-cleaning of immigration courts,\u201d the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Around the country, courts that must remain open to hear detained deportation cases are already experiencing shortages of cleaning supplies to sanitize courtrooms forcing federal employees to provide their own. Interpreters needed to translate for immigrants in removal hearings were being flown from high-risk areas where Covid-19 is already prevalent such as New York to less at-risk states, thereby potentially spreading the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThat contradicts everything we are being told by health experts and the CDC,\u201d said Judge Amiena Khan, NAIJ\u2019s executive vice-president. \u201cHow in God\u2019s name is flying interpreters around the country helping to combat this global pandemic?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week the unions and professional bodies of immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing undocumented clients issued a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6811831-Immigration-Letter.html\">joint statement</a> calling for the immediate suspension for up to a month of all of the nation\u2019s 68 immigration courts. The groups called the measures taken so far \u201cwoefully insufficient \u2026 The DOJ is failing to meet its obligations to ensure a safe and healthy environment within our immigration courts.\u201d</p> <p>Federal employees are being asked to make unconscionable choices, as illustrated by the battles waged in the New York courts.

  "<h2>Top story: School gates shut against virus from Friday</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray here to explain things for the increasing number of people at home.</p> \n<p>The UK response to the coronavirus emergency has escalated to the next phase, with schools to be closed indefinitely<strong> </strong>from Friday and A-level and GCSE exams replaced by teacher assessment. School doors will remain open, however, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-schools-to-be-closed-indefinitely-and-exams-cancelled\">hundreds of thousands of children of NHS staff and other frontline workers</a>, as well as for vulnerable children. Gavin Williamson, the England education secretary, said: \u201cExamples of these workers include NHS staff, police and supermarket delivery drivers who need to be able to go to work to support the country\u2019s fight to tackle coronavirus.\u201d The government says pupils eligible for free school meals will get a voucher to receive a meal each day.</p> \n<p>London is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/18/london-coronavirus-lockdown-tougher-measures\">moving towards a possible lockdown</a>. Overnight it has been announced that the tube is to ration services, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/london-tube-to-close-many-stations-because-of-coronavirus\">closing up to 40 stations</a> and no longer running overnight on Fridays and Saturdays. Whitehall has been asked to draw up a \u201cshielding plan\u201d for the capital, where 953 people have been diagnosed \u2013 nearly a third of the 2,626 UK total.

The Windrush Lessons Learned review is expected to criticise Home Office staff and government ministers for continued failure to admit the magnitude of their mistakes and the scale of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-review-to-call-for-reform-of-reckless-home-office\">damage inflicted on thousands of legal UK residents</a> who were wrongly treated as illegal immigrants. The report was prepared by Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary.

No end date for the measure was given. The country\u2019s central bank also cut interest rates to a the historically low figure of 0.25%, and announced a major financial stimulus package.

The move is unprecedented in both countries.</p> <h2>China\u2019s Hubei province records no new cases for first time</h2> <p>China reported 34 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, but for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/china-reports-no-domestic-cases-of-coronavirus-for-first-time-since-outbreak-began\">none were in Hubei province</a> \u2013 the centre of the outbreak. All 34 were so-called \u201cimported cases\u201d , of people who had returned to the China with infections. Chinese state media listed Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the UK as the top four places people had returned from during the outbreak.</p> <h2>Donald Trump signs coronavirus bill ordering free virus testing</h2> <p>US legislation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/trump-signs-coronavirus-bill-free-testing-paid-leave\">that will expand Medicaid and unemployment benefits,</a> mandate paid sick leave and childcare leave for certain employees, and order free coronavirus testing, has been passed in an effort to to limit the damage from the pandemic.

Transport for London announced a series of changes late on Wednesday evening as it urged people in the capital not to travel if at all possible. \u201cPeople should not be travelling, by any means, unless they really, really have to,\u201d said the mayor, Sadiq Khan. On Wednesday the UK announced the closure of all schools, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-schools-to-be-closed-indefinitely-and-exams-cancelled\">the first in its modern history.</a></p> <h2>Iran to pardon 10,000 prisoners</h2> <p>Tehran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/iran-to-pardon-10000-including-security-prisoners\">plans to pardon 10,000 prisoners</a>, including political ones, in honour of the Iranian new year on Friday.

The sheer number of cases and fatalities has overwhelmed the funeral industry, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/generation-has-died-italian-province-struggles-bury-coronavirus-dead\">coffins awaiting burial are lined up in churches</a> and the corpses of those who died at home are being kept in sealed-off rooms for days.</p> <h2>South Korea launches stimulus package</h2> <p>South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, on Thursday pledged $39 billion) in emergency financing for small businesses along with other stimulus measures to help shore up its economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <h2>Japan\u2019s deputy prime minister says Olympics are \u2018cursed\u2019</h2> <p>Taro Aso, who has a history of making gaffes, has described the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/19/thats-a-fact-olympics-are-cursed-says-japans-deputy-prime-minister\">Tokyo Olympics as \u201ccursed\u201d</a>, as speculation over postponing the event due to the outbreak mounted. The nation\u2019s northernmost island of Hokkaido has lifted its state of emergency, less than three weeks after its governor, Naomichi Suzuki, asked residents to remain indoors after a spike in the number of local cases of the virus. </p> <h2>Foreigners stranded in Panama</h2> <p>Between 400 and 500 foreigners are stranded in Panama after a \u201ctribal\u201d festival and music event ended with many of them being quarantined at the concert site near the Caribbean beach of Playa Chiquita, an organiser said Wednesday.</p> <h2>Markets continue to fall as governments take action</h2> <p>South Korea prepared crisis funds to put a floor under crashing bond and stock markets on Thursday as the coronavirus pandemic led to heavy sales of riskier assets worldwide and a scramble in emerging markets for the safety of US dollars. On Thursday, Korea\u2019s Kospi fell nearly 9%; India\u2019s currency hit a record low (and its central bank has pledged to buy a huge amount of bonds on Friday); the Philippines stock market slumped as much as 24% at one point and has lost more than a third of its value this year; Australia\u2019s market fell by 3.4%; Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 1%.</p>",
  "<p>We must act, said Boris Johnson on Tuesday, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/enemy-deadly-boris-johnson-invokes-wartime-language-coronavirus\">like any wartime government</a>\u201d. The measures to control the population, he added, were \u201cunprecedented since world war two\u201d. Rishi Sunak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">speaking later</a>, announced, \u201cWe have never, in peacetime, faced an economic fight like this one.\u201d</p> <p>The second world war remains the foundation myth of modern Britain. Invoking it is a familiar default setting in British party politics. It has a Conservative version, embodied in Churchill, with whom Johnson compares himself. And it has its Labour version, in the form of veneration of Attlee and the post-1945 welfare state. The war still suffuses much of the national culture. It can sometimes be an inspiration. But it can sometimes, indeed more often, be a curse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The playbooks of this peacetime effort will have striking comparisons with the playbooks of distant wartimes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is not true today, however. Johnson and Sunak are right to compare the coronavirus crisis with the wartime emergencies of the 20th century. We are all doing it. These are the only meaningful reference points for the totalising crisis that suddenly faces this and other nations. Government and society are now in a very new place. As Johnson put it this week: \u201cThe state is asking people to make very considerable changes to their lives. And it is only right therefore that the state should stand behind people as they make those changes.\u201d</p> <p>It is 75 years since a British prime minister talked in such terms. For most of the past 50, such remarks were effectively anathema, especially in the Tory party. And yet, although the transformation of the role of government in less than two weeks has been genuinely jaw-dropping, this is not yet the same as a wartime crisis in some very important ways. These differences need to be understood, not least because it may help to avoid the error, long familiar in military strategy, of mistakenly setting out to fight the last war rather than tackling the one that we actually face.</p> <p>Start with the blindingly obvious. Britain in 2020 is not the Britain of 1939, let alone the Britain of 1914. We are an infinitely more connected, more individualistic and more informed society today than we were then. These realities cannot be ignored, though they may change. They will set the initial terms of what is politically possible. The playbooks of this peacetime effort will have striking comparisons with the playbooks of those distant wartimes, but there will be striking differences too.</p> <p>You can see this in Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-covid-19-response\">reluctance to prohibit things</a> that will soon need to be stopped. Much of that will surely change and be tightened, and rightly so. The same is true of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/chancellors-330bn-coronavirus-package-is-big-but-not-big-enough\">incomplete character</a> of Sunak\u2019s huge spending spike. Johnson may say that the state is standing behind society \u201cthrough thick and thin\u201d but the state is not yet standing behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">households, behind renters and the self-employed</a>. At the height of the second world war, public expenditure topped 80% of national income. We are nowhere near that figure yet.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s Tories will also take exceptional powers this week, rather as Asquith\u2019s Liberals did in 1914 and Chamberlain\u2019s Tories did in 1939. But those wartime powers were truly draconian from the outset in ways that Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-emergency-law-workers-keep-job-volunteer-for-nhs\">emergency </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-emergency-law-workers-keep-job-volunteer-for-nhs\">coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-emergency-law-workers-keep-job-volunteer-for-nhs\">bill</a> is not \u2013 at least for now. Hancock\u2019s bill is certainly remarkable. It allows police and immigration officials to detain people suspected of carrying the Covid-19 virus, permits ministers to close transport hubs and ports, and gives government the power to ban and close places such as schools that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-school-colleges-nurseries-england-close-uk-friday\">up to now</a>, have mainly stayed open.</p> <p>But this is as nothing when compared with past wartime powers. The <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/yourcountry/overview/homefront/\">Emergency Powers Act of 1939</a>, for example, gave ministers sweeping authority to govern through regulations with no parliamentary sanction whatever. Any act of parliament could be amended or suspended on a minister\u2019s say-so. Food, fuel, pharmaceuticals and clothing were controlled by the state and strictly rationed. Ministers could intern anyone whose detention was thought expedient on grounds of public safety or the defence of the realm. Censorship of the media was effective and was broadly accepted by the media themselves.</p> <p>In both the world wars, moreover, it soon became unsustainable for the single-party government which presided over the outbreak of war to remain in power without forming a national coalition. Asquith brought the Tories and Labour into government in May 1915 and even offered a cabinet post to the Irish Nationalist leader John Redmond. Formal opposition in parliament ceased, and there was a byelection truce. Churchill did much the same in May 1940, when Labour agreed to serve under him.</p> <p>Are such things conceivable as the coronavirus crisis progresses? Certainly they are. But much will have to change on the ground and in government before there is even a chance of them happening. It is hard to imagine the media agreeing to withhold statistics on the progress of the pandemic in the national interest as they did with casualty figures during the world wars. A form of rationing has now begun in the wake of panic buying, but it remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/asda-puts-restrictions-on-shoppers-to-limit-stockpiling-coronavirus\">devolved to a cartel of supermarkets</a>, and confined to a small number of goods. The over-70s do not yet risk arrest for buying a pint in a pub.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/the-covid-19-crisis-is-a-chance-to-do-capitalism-differently\">The Covid-19 crisis is a chance to do capitalism differently | Mariana Mazzucato</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet this is unquestionably a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">national crisis</a>. But it is just the start. We are still in the phoney war, it-will-be-all-over-in-weeks phase. In August 1914, most governments assumed the existing armed forces would do all the fighting and that civilians would not be much involved. They were wrong. By the same token, it is possible that Johnson and Dominic Cummings still imagine they will be able to spin their way through the crisis and resume their interrupted election agenda. But they would be wrong too.</p> <p>Politics and the nation are still adjusting to a systemic shock. Johnson is not a unifying figure, though he is trying hard to be one. Nor are many of his ministers or advisers. Who trusts Priti Patel with our liberties? Trust in all politicians is low. The country has been deeply divided by austerity and Brexit. That\u2019s why, just as in 1915 and 1940, it may eventually feel inevitable for Labour and even the SNP to be brought into a governing coalition in some way. This may be a wartime government but, as Asquith and Churchill found out and Johnson may learn, the politics that emerged from the war may be very different from the politics that preceded it.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>For a child prodigy, learning didn\u2019t always come easily to Derek Haoyang Li. When he was three, his father \u2013 a famous educator and author \u2013 became so frustrated with his progress in Chinese that he vowed never to teach him again. \u201cHe kicked me from here to here,\u201d Li told me, moving his arms wide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/audio/2020/jun/01/computers-replace-school-classroom-education-ai-podcast\">Can computers ever replace the classroom? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet when Li began school, aged five, things began to click. Five years later, he was selected as one of only 10 students in his home province of Henan to learn to code. At 16, Li beat 15 million kids to first prize in the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad. Among the offers that came in from the country\u2019s elite institutions, he decided on an experimental fast-track degree at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. It would enable him to study maths, while also covering computer science, physics and psychology.</p> <p>In his first year at university, Li was extremely shy. He came up with a personal algorithm for making friends in the canteen, weighing data on group size and conversation topic to optimise the chances of a positive encounter. The method helped him to make friends, so he developed others: how to master English, how to interpret dreams, how to find a girlfriend. While other students spent the long nights studying, Li started to think about how he could apply his algorithmic approach to business. When he graduated at the turn of the millennium, he decided that he would make his fortune in the field he knew best: education.</p> <p>In person, Li, who is now 42, displays none of the awkwardness of his university days. A successful entrepreneur who helped create a billion-dollar tutoring company, Only Education, he is charismatic, and given to making bombastic statements. \u201cEducation is one of the industries that Chinese people can do much better than western people,\u201d he told me when we met last year. The reason, he explained, is that \u201cChinese people are more sophisticated\u201d, because they are raised in a society in which people rarely say what they mean.</p> <p>Li is the founder of Squirrel AI, an education company that offers tutoring delivered in part by humans, but mostly by smart machines, which he says will transform education as we know it. All over the world, entrepreneurs are making similarly extravagant claims about the power of online learning \u2013 and more and more money is flowing their way. In Silicon Valley, companies like Knewton and Alt School have attempted to personalise learning via tablet computers. In India, Byju\u2019s, a learning app valued at $6 billion, has secured backing from Facebook and the Chinese internet behemoth Tencent, and now sponsors the country\u2019s cricket team. In Europe, the British company Century Tech has signed a deal to roll out an intelligent teaching and learning platform in 700 Belgian schools, and dozens more across the UK. Their promises are being put to the test by the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 with 849 million children worldwide, as of March 2020, shut out of school, we\u2019re in the midst of an unprecedented experiment in the effectiveness of online learning.</p> <p>But it\u2019s in China, where President Xi Jinping has called for the nation to lead the world in AI innovation by 2030, that the fastest progress is being made. In 2018 alone, Li told me, 60 new AI companies entered China\u2019s private education market. Squirrel AI is part of this new generation of education start-ups. The company has already enrolled 2 million student users, opened 2,600 learning centres in 700 cities across China, and raised $150m from investors. The company\u2019s chief AI officer is Tom Mitchell, the former dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and its payroll also includes a roster of top Chinese talent, including dozens of \u201csuper-teachers\u201d \u2013 an official designation given to the most expert teachers in the country. In January, during the worst of the outbreak, it partnered with the Shanghai education bureau to provide free products to students throughout the city.</p> <p>Though the most ambitious features have yet to be built into Squirrel AI\u2019s system, the company already claims to have achieved impressive results. At its HQ in Shanghai, I saw footage of downcast human teachers who had been defeated by computers in televised contests to see who could teach a class of students more maths in a single week. Experiments on the effectiveness of different types of teaching videos with test audiences have revealed that students learn more proficiently from a video presented by a good-looking young presenter than from an older expert teacher.</p> <p>When we met, Li rhapsodised about a future in which technology will enable children to learn 10 or even 100 times more than they do today. Wild claims like these, typical of the hyperactive education technology sector, tend to prompt two different reactions. The first is: bullshit \u2013 teaching and learning is too complex, too human a craft to be taken over by robots. The second reaction is the one I had when I first met Li in London a year ago: oh no, the robot teachers are coming for education as we know it. There is some truth to both reactions, but the real story of AI education, it turns out, is a whole lot more complicated.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At a Squirrel AI learning centre high in an office building in Hangzhou, a city 70 miles west of Shanghai, a cursor jerked tentatively over the words \u201cModern technology has opened our eyes to many things\u201d. Slouched at a hexagonal table in one of the centre\u2019s dozen or so small classrooms, Huang Zerong, 14, was halfway through a 90-minute English tutoring session. As he worked through activities on his MacBook, a young woman with the kindly manner of an older sister sat next to him, observing his progress. Below, the trees of Xixi National Wetland Park barely stirred in the afternoon heat.</p> <p>A question popped up on Huang\u2019s screen, on which a virtual dashboard showed his current English level, unit score and learning focus \u2013 along with the sleek squirrel icon of Squirrel AI.</p> <p>\u201cIndia is famous for ________ industry.\u201d</p> <p>Huang read through the three possible answers, choosing to ignore \u201ctreasure\u201d and \u201ctypical\u201d and type \u201ct-e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y\u201d into the box.</p> <p>\u201cT____ is changing fast,\u201d came the next prompt.</p> <p>Huang looked towards the young woman, then he punched out \u201ce-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y\u201d from memory. She clapped her hands together. \u201cGood!\u201d she said, as another prompt flashed up.</p> <p>Huang had begun his English course, which would last for one term, a few months earlier with a diagnostic test. He had logged into the Squirrel AI platform on his laptop and answered a series of questions designed to evaluate his mastery of more than 10,000 \u201cknowledge points\u201d (such as the distinction between \u201cbelong to\u201d and \u201cbelong in\u201d). Based on his answers, Squirrel AI\u2019s software had generated a precise \u201clearning map\u201d for him, which would determine which texts he would read, which videos he would see, which tests he would take.</p> <p>As he worked his way through the course \u2013 with the occasional support of the human tutor by his side, or one of the hundreds accessible via video link from Squirrel AI\u2019s headquarters in Shanghai \u2013 its contents were automatically updated, as the system perceived that Huang had mastered new knowledge.</p> <p>Huang said he was less distracted at the learning centre than he was in school, and felt at home with the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d he told me after class, eyes fixed on his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to concentrate on the system because it\u2019s a device.\u201d His scores in English also seemed to be improving, which is why his mother had just paid the centre a further 91,000 RMB (about \u00a311,000) for another year of sessions: two semesters and two holiday courses in each of four subjects, adding up to around 400 hours in total.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone can learn,\u201d Li explained to me a few days later over dinner in Beijing. You just needed the right environment and the right method, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f62cadbc286aa339ca95b310d7bc904308fe3b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f62cadbc286aa339ca95b310d7bc904308fe3b46/0_42_4859_2916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Haoyang Li, the founder of Squirrel AI, at a web summit in Lisbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Haoyang Li, the founder of Squirrel AI, at a web summit in Lisbon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cody Glenn/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea for Squirrel AI had come to him five years earlier. A decade at his tutoring company, Only Education, had left him frustrated. He had found that if you really wanted to improve a student\u2019s progress, by far the best way was to find them a good teacher. But good teachers were rare, and turnover was high, with the best much in demand. Having to find and train 8,000 new teachers each year was limiting the amount students learned \u2013 and the growth of his business.</p> <p>The answer, Li decided, was adaptive learning, where an intelligent computer-based system adjusts itself automatically to the best method for an individual learner. The idea of adaptive learning was not new, but Li was confident that developments in AI research meant that huge advances were now within reach. Rather than seeking to recreate the general intelligence of a human mind, researchers were getting impressive results by putting AI to work on specialised tasks. AI doctors are now equal to or better than humans at analysing X-rays for certain pathologies, while AI lawyers are carrying out legal research that would once have been done by clerks.</p> <p>Following such breakthroughs, Li resolved to augment the efforts of his human teachers with a tireless, perfectly replicable virtual teacher. \u201cImagine a tutor who knows everything,\u201d he told me, \u201cand who knows everything about you.\u201d</p> <p>In Hangzhou, Huang was struggling with the word \u201churry\u201d. On his screen, a video appeared of a neatly groomed young teacher presenting a three-minute masterclass about how to use the word \u201churry\u201d and related phrases (\u201cin a hurry\u201d etc). Huang watched along.</p> <p>Moments like these, where a short teaching input results in a small learning output, are known as \u201cnuggets\u201d. Li\u2019s dream, which is the dream of adaptive education in general, is that AI will one day provide the perfect learning experience by ensuring that each of us get just the right chunk of content, delivered in the right way, at the right moment for our individual needs.</p> <p>One way in which Squirrel AI improves its results is by constantly hoovering up data about its users. During Huang\u2019s lesson, the system continuously tracked and recorded every one of his key strokes, cursor movements, right or wrong answers, texts read and videos watched. This data was time-stamped, to show where Huang had skipped over or lingered on a particular task. Each \u201cnugget\u201d (the video to watch or text to read) was then recommended to him based on an analysis of his data, accrued over hundreds of hours of work on Squirrel\u2019s platform, and the data of 2 million other students. \u201cComputer tutors can collect more teaching experience than a human would ever be able to collect, even in a hundred years of teaching,\u201d Tom Mitchell, Squirrel AI\u2019s chief AI officer, told me over the phone a few weeks later.</p> <p>The speed and accuracy of Squirrel AI\u2019s platform will depend, above all, on the number of student users it manages to sign up. More students equals more data. As each student works their way through a set of knowledge points, they leave a rich trail of information behind them. This data is then used to train the algorithms of the \u201cthinking\u201d part of the Squirrel AI system.</p> <p>This is one reason why Squirrel AI has integrated its online business with bricks-and-mortar learning centres. Most children in China do not have access to laptops and high-speed internet. The learning centres mean the company can reach kids they otherwise would not be able to. One of the reasons Mitchell says he is glad to be working with Squirrel AI is the sheer volume of data that the company is gathering. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have millions of natural examples,\u201d he told me with excitement.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The dream of a perfect education delivered by machine is not new. For at least a century, generations of visionaries have predicted that the latest inventions will transform learning. \u201cMotion pictures,\u201d wrote the American inventor Thomas Edison in 1922, \u201care destined to revolutionise our schools.\u201d The immersive power of movies would supposedly turbo-charge the learning process. Others made similar predictions for radio, television, computers and the internet. But despite small successes \u2013 the Open University, TV universities in China in the 1980s, or Khan Academy today, which reaches millions of students with its YouTube lessons \u2013 teachers have continued to teach, and learners to learn, in much the same way as before.</p> <p>There are two reasons why today\u2019s techno-evangelists are confident that AI can succeed where other technologies failed. First, they view AI not as a simple innovation but as a \u201cgeneral purpose technology\u201d \u2013 that is, an epochal invention, like the printing press, which will fundamentally change the way we learn. Second, they believe its powers will shed new light on the working of the human brain \u2013 how repetitive practice grows expertise, for instance, or how interleaving (leaving gaps between learning different bits of material) can help us achieve mastery. As a result, we will be able to design adaptive algorithms to optimise the learning process.</p> <p>UCL Institute of Education professor and machine learning expert Rose Luckin believes that one day we might see an AI-enabled \u201cFitbit for the mind\u201d that would allow us to perceive in real-time what an individual knows, and how fast they are learning. The device would use sensors to gather data that forms a precise and ever-evolving map of a person\u2019s abilities, which could be cross-referenced with insights into their motivational and nutritional state, say. This information would then be relayed to our minds, in real time, via a computer-brain interface. Facebook is already carrying out research in this field. Other firms are trialling eye tracking and helmets that monitor kids\u2019 brainwaves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The supposed AI education revolution is not here yet, and it is likely that the majority of projects will collapse under the weight of their own hype. IBM\u2019s adaptive tutor Knewton was pulled from US schools under pressure from parents concerned about their kids\u2019 privacy, while Silicon Valley\u2019s Alt School, launched to much fanfare in 2015 by a former Google executive, has burned through $174m of funding without landing on a workable business model. But global school closures owing to coronavirus may yet relax public attitudes to online learning \u2013 many online education companies are offering their products for free to all children out of school.</p> <p>Daisy Christodoulou, a London-based education expert, suggests that too much time is spent speculating on what AI might one day do, rather than focusing on what it already can. It\u2019s estimated that there are 900 million young people around the world today who aren\u2019t currently on track to learn what they need to thrive. To help those kids, AI education doesn\u2019t have to be perfect \u2013 it just needs to slightly improve on what they currently have.</p> <p>In their book The Future of the Professions, Richard and Daniel Susskind argue that we tend to conceive of occupations as embodied in a person \u2013 a butcher or baker, doctor or teacher. As a result, we think of them as \u2018too human\u2019 to be taken over by machines. But to an algorithm, or someone designing one, a profession appears as something else: a long list of individual tasks, many of which may be mechanised. In education, that might be marking or motivating, lecturing or lesson planning. The Susskinds believe that where a machine can do any one of these tasks better and more cheaply than the average human, automation of that bit of the job is inevitable.</p> <p>The point, in short, is that AI doesn\u2019t have to match the general intelligence of humans to be useful \u2013 or indeed powerful. This is both the promise of AI, and the danger it poses. \u201cPeople\u2019s behaviour is already being manipulated,\u201d Luckin cautioned. Devices that might one day enhance our minds are already proving useful in shaping them.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In May 2018, a group of students at Hangzhou\u2019s Middle School No 11 returned to their classroom to find three cameras newly installed above the blackboard; they would now be under full-time surveillance in their lessons. \u201cPreviously when I had classes that I didn\u2019t like very much, I would be lazy and maybe take naps,\u201d a student told the local news, \u201cbut I don\u2019t dare be distracted after the cameras were installed.\u201d The head teacher explained that the system could read seven states of emotion on students\u2019 faces: neutral, disgust, surprise, anger, fear, happiness and sadness. If the kids slacked, the teacher was alerted. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pair of mystery eyes are constantly watching me,\u201d the student told reporters.</p> <p>The previous year, China\u2019s state council had launched a plan for the role AI could play in the future of the country. Underpinning it were a set of beliefs: that AI can \u201charmonise\u201d Chinese society; that for it to do so, the government should store data on every citizen; that companies, not the state, were best positioned to innovate; that no company should refuse access to the government to its data. In education, the paper called for new adaptive online learning systems powered by big data, and \u201call-encompassing ubiquitous intelligent environments\u201d \u2013 or smart schools.</p> <p>At AIAED, a conference in Beijing hosted by Squirrel AI, which I attended in May 2019, classroom surveillance was one of the most discussed topics \u2013 but the speakers tended to be more concerned about the technical question of how to optimise the effectiveness of facial and bodily monitoring technologies in the classroom, rather than the darker implications of collecting unprecedented amounts of data about children. These ethical questions are becoming increasingly important, with schools from India to the US currently trialling facial monitoring. In the UK, AI is being used today for things like monitoring student wellbeing, automating assessment and even in inspecting schools. Ben Williamson of the Centre for Research in Digital Education explains that this risks encoding biases or errors into the system and raises obvious privacy issues. \u201cNow the school and university might be said to be studying their students too,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>While cameras in the classroom might outrage many parents in the UK or US, Lenora Chu, author of an influential book about the Chinese education system, argues that in China anything that improves a child\u2019s learning tends to be viewed positively by parents. Squirrel AI even offers them the chance to watch footage of their child\u2019s tutoring sessions. \u201cThere\u2019s not that idea here that technology is bad,\u201d said Chu, who moved from the US to Shanghai 10 years ago.</p> <p>Rose Luckin suggested to me that a platform like Squirrel AI\u2019s could one day mean an end to China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/gaokao-china-toughest-school-exam-in-world\" title=\"\">notoriously punishing gaokao college entrance exam</a>, which takes place for two days every June and largely determines a student\u2019s education and employment prospects. If technology tracked a student throughout their school days, logging every keystroke, knowledge point and facial twitch, then the perfect record of their abilities on file could make such testing obsolete. Yet a system like this could also furnish the Chinese state \u2013 or a US tech company \u2013 with an eternal ledger of every step in a child\u2019s development. It is not hard to imagine the grim uses to which this information could be put \u2013 for instance, if your behaviour in school was used to judge, or predict, your trustworthiness as an adult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca518387c8a805b1342e02c9562f737014c2e46b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca518387c8a805b1342e02c9562f737014c2e46b/0_5_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students leaving a gaokao college entrance exam in Hangzhou, China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students leaving a gaokao college entrance exam in Hangzhou, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the one hand, said Chu, the CCP wants to use AI to better prepare young people for the future economy, and to close the achievement gap between rural and urban schools. To this end, companies like Squirrel AI receive government support, such as access to prime office space in top business districts. At the same time, the CCP, as the state council put it, sees AI as \u201copportunity of the millennium\u201d for \u201csocial construction\u201d. That is, social control. The ability of AI to \u201cgrasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner\u201d through the surveillance of people\u2019s movements, spending and other behaviours means it can play \u201can irreplaceable role in effectively maintaining social stability\u201d.</p> <p>The surveillance state is already penetrating deep into people\u2019s lives. In 2019, there was a significant spike in China in the registration of patents for facial recognition and surveillance technology. All new mobile phones in China must now be registered via a facial scan. At the hotels I stayed in, Chinese citizens handed over their ID cards and checked in using face scanners. On the high-speed train to Beijing, the announcer repeatedly warned travellers to abide by the rules in order to maintain their personal credit. The notorious social credit system, which has been under trial in a handful of Chinese cities ahead of an expected nationwide roll out this year, awards or detracts points from an individual\u2019s trustworthiness score, which affects their ability to travel and borrow money, among other things.</p> <p>The result, explained Chu, is that all these interventions exert a subtle control over what people think and say. \u201cYou sense how the wind is blowing,\u201d she told me. For the 12 million Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, however, that control is anything but subtle. Police checkpoints, complete with facial scanners, are ubiquitous. All mobile phones must have Jingwang (\u201cclean net\u201d) app installed, allowing the government to monitor your movements and browsing. Iris and fingerprint scans are required to access health services. As many as 1.5 million Uighurs, including children, have been interned at some point in a re-education camp in the interests of \u201charmony\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As we shape the use of AI in education, it\u2019s likely that AI will shape us too. Jiang Xueqin, an education researcher from Chengdu, is sceptical that it will be as revolutionary as proponents claim. \u201cParents are paying for a drug,\u201d he told me over the phone. He thought tutoring companies such as New Oriental, TAL and Squirrel AI were simply preying on parents\u2019 anxieties about their kids\u2019 performance in exams, and only succeeding because test preparation was the easiest element of education to automate \u2013 a closed system with limited variables that allowed for optimisation. Jiang wasn\u2019t impressed with the progress made, or the way that it engaged every child in a desperate race to conform to the measures of success imposed by the system.</p> <p>One student I met at the learning centre in Hangzhou, Zhang Hen, seemed to have a deep desire to learn about the world \u2013 she told me how she loved Qu Yuan, a Tang dynasty romantic poet, and how she was a fan of Harry Potter \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t the reason she was here. Her goal was much simpler: she had come to the centre to boost her test scores. That may seem disappointing to idealists who want education to offer so much more, but Zhang was realistic about the demands of the Chinese education system. She had tough exams that she needed to pass. A scripted system that helped her efficiently master the content of the high school entrance exam was exactly what she wanted.</p> <p>On stage at AIAED, Tom Mitchell had presented a more ambitious vision for adaptive learning that went far beyond helping students cram for mindless tests. Much of what he was most excited by was possible only in theory, but his enthusiasm was palpable. As appealing as his optimism was, though, I felt unconvinced. It was clear that adaptive technologies might improve certain types of learning, but it was equally obvious that they might narrow the aims of education and provide new tools to restrict our freedom.</p> <p>Li insists that one day his system will help all young people to flourish creatively. Though he allows that for now an expert human teacher still holds an edge over a robot, he is confident that AI will soon be good enough to evaluate and reply to students\u2019 oral responses. In less than five years, Li imagines training Squirrel AI\u2019s platform with a list of every conceivable question and every possible response, weighting an algorithm to favour those labelled \u201ccreative\u201d. \u201cThat thing is very easy to do,\u201d he said, \u201clike tagging cats.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/28/can-we-stop-robots-outsmarting-humanity-artificial-intelligence-singularity\">Can we stop AI outsmarting humanity?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Li, learning has always been like that \u2013 like tagging cats. But there\u2019s a growing consensus that our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/27/why-your-brain-is-not-a-computer-neuroscience-neural-networks-consciousness\" title=\"\">brains don\u2019t work like computers</a>. Whereas a machine must crunch through millions of images to be able to identify a cat as the collection of \u201cfeatures\u201d that are present only in those images labelled \u201ccat\u201d (two triangular ears, four legs, two eyes, fur, etc), a human child can grasp the concept of \u201ccat\u201d from just a few real life examples, thanks to our innate ability to understand things symbolically. Where machines can\u2019t compute meaning, our minds thrive on it. The adaptive advantage of our brains is that they learn continually through all of our senses by interacting with the environment, our culture and, above all, other people.</p> <p>Li told me that even if AI fulfilled all of its promise, human teachers would still play a crucial role helping kids learn social skills. At Squirrel AI\u2019s HQ, which occupies three floors of a gleaming tower next door to Microsoft and Mobike in Shanghai, I met some of the company\u2019s young teachers. Each sat at a work console in a vast office space, headphones on, eyes focused on a laptop screen, their desks decorated with plastic pot plants and waving cats. As they monitored the dashboards of up to six students simultaneously, the face of a young learner would appear on the screen, asking for help, either via a chat box or through a video link. The teachers reminded me of workers in the gig economy, the Uber drivers of education. When I logged on to try out a Squirrel English lesson for myself, the experience was good, but my tutor seemed to be teaching to a script.</p> <p>Squirrel AI\u2019s head of communications, Joleen Liang, showed me photos from a recent trip she had taken to the remote mountains of Henan, to deliver laptops to disadvantaged students. Without access to the adaptive technology, their education would be a little worse. It was a reminder that Squirrel AI\u2019s platform, like those of its competitors worldwide, doesn\u2019t have to be better than the best human teachers \u2013 to improve people\u2019s lives, it just needs to be good enough, at the right price, to supplement what we\u2019ve got. The problem is that it is hard to see technology companies stopping there. For better and worse, their ambitions are bigger. \u201cWe could make a lot of geniuses,\u201d Li told me.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>As the number of coronavirus cases across the US continues to grow, everyone from restaurant owners and musicians to the elderly and those with chronic illness have been affected.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 4,226 confirmed cases, including 75 deaths. For the people who are able, there perhaps has never been a more important time to give to those in need.</p> <p>You can start by following guidelines on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/17/21181694/coronavirus-covid-19-lockdowns-end-how-long-months-years\">social distancing</a> and local restrictions for self-quarantine. But here are some other ways to support your own community and those struggling all across the country:</p> <h2>Support local businesses and not-for-profits</h2> <p>In an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, governors in at least nine states have announced the closure of eat-in restaurants and bars, while local officials have made sweeping bans on large gatherings.</p> <p>Dozens of well-known restaurants have opted to wait out this virus behind closed doors. Others are still open, and are asking the community to support them by ordering pick-up or delivery, and making sure to tip the staff as much as they can.</p> <p>Canlis, a fine-dining hotspot in Seattle, temporarily converted its restaurant into a drive-in burger eatery, bagel shed and family meal delivery service. Jessica Powers, spokeswoman for the restaurant, said the response from the community had been amazing. She encouraged anyone who wants to support the restaurant, but doesn\u2019t want this more casual dining experience, to buy a gift card and make future bookings.</p> <p>The arts sector has also been hit especially hard, with a wide array of performances and concerts canceled across the country. Theaters and orchestras are encouraging people who have tickets to a canceled performance to not ask for a refund and even consider donating further to the organization.</p> <p>Look up your local businesses and not-for-profits online, and find out if there are ways you can still buy from them or donate.</p> <h2>Contribute to local social service organizations</h2> <p>There are plenty of groups and organizations helping those negatively impacted by coronavirus. <a href=\"https://disasterphilanthropy.org/\">The Center for Disaster Philanthropy</a> recommends directing donations to free clinics in areas hit hardest by the outbreak, and also contributing to supplies of protective equipment and educational outreach initiatives about the virus.</p> <p>Those people who were already vulnerable before the outbreak will probably feel its effects hardest and longest, so the center recommends contributing to food banks. But try not to just make it a single donation, as the impacts of this outbreak will probably be felt long into the future.</p> <p>Paul Ash, executive director of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank, said they are especially in need of volunteers in their warehouses and people who can help them open additional pantries. The food bank serves about 144,000 people on an average week, and is preparing for an increased need over the next few weeks because of the many people who are not going to work or have seen their job changed significantly because of the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThose people will probably have enough in their refrigerator for a week or two, or enough in the bank account, but they\u2019ll eventually come to a point, if this is anything like the financial crisis in 07, 08, they\u2019ll come to a point where they are willing to avail themselves to a free bag of groceries from the food bank,\u201d said Ash.</p> <h2>Donate blood</h2> <p>With thousands of blood drives across the country canceled because of the outbreak, the American Red Cross and America\u2019s Blood Centers announced on Tuesday that the US is facing a \u201csevere blood shortage\u201d. The organizations encouraged anyone who is healthy and eligible to give blood or platelets, to <a href=\"https://americasblood.org/for-donors/find-a-blood-center/\">make an appointment</a> to donate through the Red Cross.</p> <p>The Red Cross\u2019s leaders said they are taking additional steps to keep all donors safe, including checking the temperature of staff and donors and having plenty of hand sanitizer available.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand why people may be hesitant to come out for a blood drive but want to reassure the public that blood donation is a safe process, and that we have put additional precautions in place at our blood drives to protect the health of safety of our donors and staff,\u201d Gail McGovern, president and chief executive officer, American Red Cross, said in a statement.</p> <h2>Reach out to family and friends</h2> <p>Simply reaching out to those most severely affected by coronavirus can be a big help in such a turbulent time. For people older than 60 years and those with chronic illness or weakened immune systems, the virus can cause very severe issues.</p> <p>These people may be stuck in their homes and need food deliveries, or simply looking for some emotional support.</p> <p>But don\u2019t stop there. Everyone is in the middle of a global pandemic. Staying connected with others through the many virtual tools at our disposal can be key to getting through this outbreak as unscathed as possible.</p>",

But in his latest update he pointed out that Greenland is still waiting for the test results from nine other patients to be analysed in Denmark which controls the island.

We have been told test results will take five to ten days. People have contacted the hospital, but for the most part they are still advising that testing is not necessary unless you have travelled. We do not know if the virus is here. I believe we have one person in self isolation who felt unwell after travelling from the UK, but again that has not officially been confirmed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reader said there was also alarm on the Falklands about the limited hospital capacity if coronavirus does hit. They said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A key concern is the ability of the hospital to cope. In total the island\u2019s hospital has 29 beds, seven of which are used for long term care for the elderly already. There are two intensive care beds. Usually if anyone needs critical or specialist care they are flown out to South America or the UK, which is clearly not going to be an option with coronavirus cases. The government raised the possibility that even regular emergency cases might not be accepted by our partners countries if their health systems are already overwhelmed.</p> \n   <p>Many of our medical staff are here on short term contracts, recruited from the UK (or occasionally other countries, we have had several doctors from Canada lately) to work for for 3 to 6 months at a time. Falkland Islanders are concerned what will happen when contracts end and if we will be able to replace those who leave.</p> \n   <p>The other key concern has been tourists coming in. Cruise ship tourists regularly outnumbering the population during the peak season. The season is coming to an end, which should help reduce exposure, but as of today there are still several ships heading here that were reportedly turned away from Punta Arenas.</p> \n   <p>Falkland Islanders are strong, resilient people, but it does feel like the Falkland Island government has been caught unaware by the current outbreak. Updates are few and far between and the current policy to follow the UK\u2019s lead feels problematic given our geographic location and resources.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Madsen writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A second person with Covid-19 in Nuuk has been confirmed. As of 16:00 this afternoon local time the shopping center \u201cNuuk Center\u201d will close, along with will bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and gyms.

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day. And, although he did not reveal what the government\u2019s employment support measures would involve, his answers on this were intriguing. He did not dismiss out of hand the temporary universal basis income idea floated by Blackford, or Bryant\u2019s call for a handout in the form of a summer version of the winter fuel payment.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also interesting on the subject of schools. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The house should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to make sure we square the circle both of making sure we stop the spread of the disease but also making sure we relieve, as much as we can, pressure on our NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded very much like a hint that the government will announce a partial closure of schools, with some provision being kept open - perhaps for children of key workers, or perhaps with schools in childminding rather than education mode? - to minimise the impact on the NHS.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">Keep with more detailed live news from the UK here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: schools in Scotland and Wales to close from Friday</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7224508f085c6327bc2477\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ashifa-kassam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:41:47.338Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish hotels set to close as British tourists told to return home</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>British tourists in Spain who are looking to return to the UK should make travel arrangements as soon as possible, the British ambassador to Spain has said, as all hotels in the country have been ordered to close down within a week, writes my colleague Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur advice is now that British tourists in Spain who wish to return home should make travel plans to do so as soon as possible,\u201d Hugh Elliott <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HughElliottUK/status/1240044921207304193\">said in a video posted online on Tuesday evening.</a> </p> \n  <p>He continued: \u201cThe government has ordered the closure of hotels over the next seven days in order to reduce risks to health.\u201d As hotels begin shuttering, some tourists will be asked to move hotels, he noted.</p> \n  <p>The embassy is in close contact with Spanish authorities, who have made it clear that \u201cno one will be left without accommodation,\u201d said Elliott.

Just like in the old days with measles. The larger the group that is immune, the less chance that the virus will jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health. With group immunity you build, as it were, a protective wall around them,\u201d said Rutte.</p> \n  <p>The debate by members of the Dutch House of Representatives can be <a href=\"https://nos.nl/livestream/2327490-kijk-mee-kamerdebat-over-ontwikkelingen-coronavirus.html\">viewed live here</a> on the Netherlands public broadcaster, NOS.</p> \n  <p>But while Rutte insisted on Tuesday that the strategy of his country - which has banned public gatherings and taken other measures - differed little from that of other states some Dutch people have been left to wonder if had become \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDutchmen4/status/1239674291798585360?s=20\">the guineapigs of Europe</a>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">announced last week</a> that it would be banning mass gatherings after prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s cautious approach to the coronavirus outbreak was overtaken by care homes, sporting bodies and others. That came after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had last week defended its initial approach to coronavirus, saying it was aimed at creating a \u201cherd immunity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Amid a continued debate in the Netherlands, some insisted that the strategy of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 was a side effect rather than the main goal, which was to mirror that of other states in attempting to use social distancing and other measures to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of the likely peak of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>A Dutch microbiologist, Marc Bonten of UMC Utrecht,<a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/601067410/virologen-vertrouwen-in-nederlandse-aanpak-maar-nog-veel-onzeker\"> told De Telegraaf newspaper </a>that even countries opting for a total lockdown would have to work on building group immunity.</p> \n  <p>But critics including the London-based economist Jerome Roos pointed to what they estimated the resulting death rate would be, as well as arguing that countries going for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239628249367445506?s=20\">make it impossible for the countries</a> trying

The decision stalls years of careful planning to get people to respond to the survey.</p> \n  <p>The Bureau still has plans to send out field workers in May to follow up with people who fail to self-respond, a critical effort that aims to ensure hard-to-count groups get counted. The Bureau said Wednesday it would adjust that operation as necessary to follow the guidance of public health authorities.</p> \n  <p>The decision, made to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, came about a week after Americans began filling out the survey. The results of the census have profound political consequences -- the data is used to allocate $1.5 trillion in federal funding and to draw electoral districts in place for the next decade. The decennial census is mandated by the constitution.</p> \n  <p>Coronavirus concerns add to a pile of challenges facing the bureau. There is considerable concern that minorities and immigrant groups will be fearful of responding to the survey because of the <strong>Trump administration</strong>\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Individual census responses must be kept confidential by law. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:58:48.168Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725d988f088d7575595e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:52:12.774Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Detroit Three -- Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler -- have agreed to temporarily close all US plants</strong> to protect workers against coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The Detroit Free Press <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/2020/03/18/ford-gm-fca-plant-closures-coronavirus/2865289001/\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Ford Motor Co. said after Thursday evening shifts, Ford is temporarily suspending production at its North America plants through March 30 to thoroughly clean its facilities to protect its workforce and boost containment efforts for the COVID-19 coronavirus.<br></p> \n   <p>Ford said it will continue to work closely with union leaders to find ways to help keep workers healthy and safe, \u2018even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,\u2019 said Kumar Galhotra, Ford\u2019s president of North America. \u2018In these unprecedented times, we\u2019re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Union leaders had pushed for the shutdown for the sake of workers\u2019 health, but the move does make it more likely that auto giants will later seek financial assistance to recover from the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725b9f8f085e564ad869df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:36:23.279Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Dow has now dropped below where it was on the day of <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s inauguration in 2017.</p> \n  <p>Therefore, all of the stock market gains that Trump has repeatedly boasted about have now been wiped out.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*DOW INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WIPES OUT GAINS SINCE TRUMP INAUGURATION<a href=\"https://t.co/ryuOmteNca\">https://t.co/ryuOmteNca</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DtiBIaGX4y\">pic.twitter.com/DtiBIaGX4y</a></p>\u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7256a28f088d7575595e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:30:30.895Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trading halted again amid steep losses</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Adam Gabbatt.</p> \n  <p>Trading was temporarily halted at the New York Stock Exchange, with the Dow currently down more than 1,800 points.</p> \n  <p>This marks the fourth time in two weeks that trading has been halted because of steep losses linked to investors\u2019 fears about the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>For the latest updates on the market drop, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/18/markets-government-stimulus-pledges-ftse-dow-recession-business-live\">Markets slide and pound hits 1985 lows as Covid-19 crisis deepens - business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7252558f085c6327bc2705\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:10:46.441Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u2022The government has closed the US-Canada border to \u201cnon-essential traffic\u201d, Donald Trump announced</strong>, as the number of coronavirus cases continued to rise.

Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer at Associated Press, has been looking at how coronavirus became the latest flashpoint between the two nations:</p> \n  <p>Since the virus has spread, he reports, Trump and his top aides have stepped up their criticism of China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They have referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d or the \u201cChinese virus\u201d on multiple occasions, disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying the virus by geography.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday alone, Trump discussed the Chinese source of virus outbreak during at least two events. At a State Department news conference, Mike Pompeo referred six times to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response.<br></p> \n  <p>In a meeting with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd this all started in China? That\u2019s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit?\u201d Trump asked.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sorenson replied.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cHopefully, you all heard that,\u201d Trump told reporters.</p> \n  <p>Having already been targeted by Trump in a trade war and by Pompeo and others for repression of Muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in western Xinjiang Province, the Chinese have taken particular offence to the constant repetition, complaining vociferously and suggesting that the US military may have actually introduced the virus to Wuhan.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cRecently, some American politicians have linked the new coronavirus with China to stigmatize China. We express strong indignation and opposition to it,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \u201cWe urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes and stop unwarranted accusations against China.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That, in turn, has prompted angry US protests with the State Department hauling in China\u2019s ambassador to the United States to complain and Pompeo calling the top Chinese diplomat to re-register the anger.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe disinformation campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,\u201d Pompeo said, before quickly adding that \u201cnow is not the time for recriminations.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yet recriminations seem to be the order of the day.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cChina was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was false. And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it\u2019s a very accurate term. But no, I didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Shortly after Trump\u2019s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. </p> \n  <p>Pompeo responded to that news: \u201cI regret China\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct free press operations that frankly, would be really good, really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times. Where more information, more transparency are what will save lives. This is unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they will reconsider.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71fec88f085c6327bc227b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T11:00:39.616Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another thing we can expect today is further fall-out from the Chinese decision yesterday to expel American journalists. </p> \n  <p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been \u201ccompelled\u201d to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.\u201d</p> \n  <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/18/us-media-accuse-china-of-cold-war-mentality-after-move-to-expel-journalists\">China: expulsion of US journalists was response to 'unreasonable oppression'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71f4678f085c6327bc2200\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T10:49:11.058Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. Last night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">Joe Biden swept to victory in three primaries</a> held in unprecedented circumstances. Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/democratic-primary-delegate-count-latest\">has now racked up 1,147 pledged delegates to Bernie Sanders\u2019 861</a> - a lead of 286 that surely looks to be insurmountable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-us-elections-2020-panel\">Is it time for Bernie to quit the race</a> in the interest of unifying the party during a national emergency?</p> \n  <p>Ohio cancelled its primary planned for yesterday due to the coronavirus. But with Florida, Illinois and Arizona running their primaries yesterday, predictably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">voters faced confusion, a shortage of poll workers, and shifting or closed polling stations</a>. It\u2019s clear that the way the rest of the campaign is going to be deeply affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The DNC is already urging a shift to vote-by-mail.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In order to ensure voters can safely make their voices heard, we at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DNC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DNC</a> are urging the remaining primary states to make voting easier and safer for both voters and election officials. The simplest way to ensure this is to make vote by mail available to all registered voters.</p>\u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>With bars, shops, and restaurants ordered shut across parts of the nation, it is impossible to see politics being business-as-usual for some time to come.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday Donald Trump was proclaiming that he knew it was a pandemic all along - just weeks after the president promised that the 15 cases of coronavirus in the US would soon go down to zero. There\u2019s currently - as recorded by the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a> -<strong> 6,496 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, and the death toll has now exceeded 100. </strong></p> \n  <p>It is understandably dominating today\u2019s White House agenda. Trump has calls and meetings with the aerospace industry, physicians, nurses, and a quarterly business roundtable. The Coronavirus Task Force will be doing a morning briefing.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll be tracking the responses to Biden\u2019s win last night and political developments around the country here.
