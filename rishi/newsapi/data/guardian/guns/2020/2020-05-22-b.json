  "<p>The family of a \u201cremarkable and inspirational\u201d law student killed in a botched drive-by shooting have said their only comfort is that she died during the holy month of Ramadan, as tributes flowed in for a teenager whose \u201cwhole ethos was to commit everything to this country\u201d.</p> <p>Aya Hachem, 19, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/20/she-was-a-beacon-of-hope-tributes-pour-in-for-murdered-teenager-aya-hachem\">fatally shot</a> from a passing car as she shopped for groceries near her home in Blackburn on Sunday afternoon. She was not the intended victim, police said.</p> <p>On Friday evening, Lancashire police announced that four men and one woman \u2013 Feroz Suleman, 39, Abubakir Satia, 31, Uthman Satia, 28, and Kashif Manzoor, 24, all from Blackburn, and 26-year-old Judy Chapman from Great Harwood \u2013 had been charged with her murder. All those charged are due to appear before magistrates in Preston on Saturday.</p> <p>Her death has triggered waves of pain, grief and revulsion far from the street where she was killed. An Islamic funeral prayer, a <em>Janaazah</em>, was performed near the scene on Thursday morning and white flowers spelling \u201cAya\u201d arranged beside her coffin. A sea of carnations decorate the pavement where she fell.</p> <p>The brutal nature of her murder \u2013 and the extraordinary story of her life \u2013 has compounded the shock felt in Blackburn and beyond. On Friday, the dean of Manchester, Rogers Govender, led prayers for Hachem\u2019s family during a virtual service to mark the anniversary of the Manchester Arena bomb.</p> <p>In a week when the Hachem family should have been celebrating Eid, they were \u201cvery, very distraught\u201d and unable to speak publicly about their loss, friends said.</p> <p>\u201cThe only comfort they have got is the fact that their daughter died during the holy month of Ramadan,\u201d said Shanaz Hussain, associate headteacher at Blackburn central high school, where Hachem excelled. The family have told their imam that Ramadan was giving them some \u201cpeace and tranquility that their daughter died during the most blessed time of the year for Muslims\u201d, she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecadfdf1d0d7e6910cdd49c87b7c7f6d98ec44e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecadfdf1d0d7e6910cdd49c87b7c7f6d98ec44e0/0_220_6588_3953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police at the scene where Aya Hachem was shot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police at the scene where Aya Hachem was shot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hachem was the eldest of four siblings. She arrived in Britain from Lebanon aged nine speaking \u201cvery, very limited English \u2013 probably like \u2018Hello\u2019\u201d, her former headteacher, Diane Atkinson, said. But Hachem went on to become a star pupil and a role model for the more than 700 students at Blackburn central high school, many of whom come from similar backgrounds.</p> <p>In her final year, Hachem was named \u201cmost improved student\u201d of the 180 pupils in the group. She was charming, always smiling and humble, her teachers said, and was regularly used as a positive example to younger children and their parents.</p> <p>Aged 16, Hachem became one of the youngest trustees in the history of the Children\u2019s Society and went on to study law at the University of Salford. She was in the second year of her degree, preparing for a placement starting in September, when she was shot dead outside a Lidl supermarket, a passerby caught in an apparent local feud.</p> <p>Friends who knew Hachem said she had used her early experiences in Lebanon to help improve the lives of others. Her father, Ismael, is said to have moved the family to Britain after being shot in crossfire there.</p> <p>\u201cLebanon was very, very difficult for her family,\u201d said Hussain. \u201cHer family were constantly under threat and they had lots of traumatic experiences. Part of her culture, her whole ethos, was to commit everything to this country, which the family did, and to give back as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>From her early childhood Hachem \u201cfostered a compassion, tolerance and promoted all the British values that we, as the United Kingdom, are very, very passionate about\u201d, said Hussain. Her father was granted British citizenship last year, she said, and the family are thought to have celebrated at Blackburn town hall.</p> <p>After leaving school for college, Hachem would often return to catch up with her former teachers. Her last visit was in autumn, Hussain said, to show around her 10-year-old sister who is due to start secondary school this September.</p> <p>Thirteen people had been arrested in connection with her death, 10 on suspicion of murder. They include two women, aged 19 and 29, and nine men, aged 31 to 39, all but one from Blackburn.</p> <p>As the police investigation continued, and a community sought to process Hachem\u2019s death, her father shared a message from a family friend: \u201cOur grieving is not over for you Aya,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are so sorry as a community to have destroyed your dreams and the beautiful visions that your family had. We are sorry Aya, please forgive us.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has been forced to cave into to Conservative backbench rebels opposed to the presence of Huawei in 5G networks and has drawn up plans to reduce the Chinese company\u2019s involvement to zero by 2023.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s retreat is designed to stave off what could have been an embarrassing defeat when his existing proposal to reduce Huawei to a 35% market share was to be voted on in the Commons.</p> <p>Although Johnson boasts an 80 strong majority, the number of Conservative MPs willing to rebel on the issue is now estimated to be 50 \u2013 enough in theory to defeat the government \u2013 as anti-Chinese sentiment hardens in the light of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The mooted retreat will delight the White House which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/30/mike-pompeo-restates-us-opposition-to-huawei-access\">relentlessly campaigning against Huawei</a>, but is likely to provoke a hostile reaction from Beijing, which has believed the UK was open to inward investment until now.</p> <p>The original plan was signed off as recently as January with the support of Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies. They argued that any risks that Huawei equipment could be exploited for mass surveillance could be contained.</p> <p>But political concerns about the Chinese company lingered. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/10/government-wins-huawei-vote-despite-tory-rebellion\">The rebels forced a vote on an unrelated telecoms bill in early March</a>, and 38 Conservative MPs voted with the opposition after Johnson refused to slash Huawei\u2019s market share to zero.</p> <p>At the time, that was not enough to defeat No 10 but sources close to the rebels said a growing number of the 2019 intake of MPs were ready to vote against the government, in a sign of escalating geo-political tension with China.</p> <p>As the coronavirus crisis worsened, China has been accused of not being transparent about the early phases of the disease \u2013 while tension has also risen further as Beijing has recently threatened to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong.</p> <p>Senior ministers also want to reduce the UK\u2019s economic dependance on China for essential goods in the light of the crisis and have begun to draw up \u201cProject Defend\u201d aimed at boosting British self sufficiency in strategic medical and technological sectors \u2013 following warnings from intelligence agencies that the UK needed to reassess its relationship with China.</p> <p>Downing Street declined to comment although sources said the reports of the Johnson plan were accurate. But last night one of the rebel leaders, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, welcome the change of heart. \u201cThis is very good news and I hope and believe it will be the start of a complete and thorough review of our dangerous dependency on China.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The lawyer representing Tara Reade, who has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, said on Friday he was dropping her as a client although he continued to believe in the truth of her allegations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-us-live-trump-holiday-weekend-latest-news-updates\">Coronavirus US live: Trump demands churches, synagogues and mosques reopen 'right now'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur decision \u2026 is by no means a reflection on whether then Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms Reade,\u201d Douglas Wigdor said in a statement. \u201cOn that point, our view \u2013 which is the same view held by the majority of Americans, according to a Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll \u2013 has not changed.\u201d</p> <p>Reade is a former staffer from Biden\u2019s office when he was a senator from Delaware.

Much of what has been written about Ms Reade is not probative of whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted her, but rather is intended to victim-shame and attack her credibility on unrelated and irrelevant matters,\u201d Wigdor said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, defense lawyers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> have said that they are reviewing criminal cases in which Reade has served as an expert witness on domestic violence, out of concern that she had misrepresented her educational credentials in court.</p> <p>Days after CNN <a href=\"https://t.co/U3p0xLB5TT\">raised questions</a> about Reade\u2019s educational background, a spokesperson for Antioch University confirmed to the New York Times that she had not received a degree from the school.</p>",
  "<p>I am very tired of Joe Biden.

Interrupting the Breakfast Club host\u2019s explanation that black people needed assurances that our communities will benefit from his presidency, Biden asserted: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or for Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d</p> \n<p>Again, I am very tired of Joe Biden. Not because I am a purist, or have inflexible ideological commitments of what it will take to remove Donald Trump from office. But rather because Biden\u2019s condescension towards black communities is intolerable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/biden-progressives-push-left\">The fight is on for progressives to push Biden to the left.

But his mistreatment of black people, verbally and politically, is decades old, and is a reflection of the Democratic party in general.</p> \n<p>Throughout Biden\u2019s career, he has boasted about his ability to bridge partisan divides by sacrificing the needs of black people and poor people in the name of \u201ccompromise\u201d. For the last 30 years, Biden has repeatedly talked about freezing, cutting, or raising the age for social security and other benefits \u2013 as much as $2tn one time. <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/21856/joe-biden-cut-medicare-social-security-retirement-age\">His response</a> to concerns that these cuts would hurt the poor? \u201cWe\u2019re going to do lots of hard things \u2026 we might as well do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social security is an important program for black people, especially as we age. Among <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">African Americans receiving </a><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">social </a><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">security</a>, 35% of elderly married couples and 58% of unmarried elderly persons relied on it for 90% or more of their income.

Biden authored and successfully passed the $30bn 1994 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act</a>. Besides putting 100,000 additional police officers in the streets, the crime bill distributed funding for new prison construction, encouraged prosecutors to charge children as adults, and even added the death penalty for 28 new areas, including <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-69-federal-death-penalty-act-1994\">drug-related offenses</a>. Pushing for further criminalization, then senator Biden argued that George HW Bush\u2019s crime plan <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?8997-1/democratic-response-drug-policy-address\">did not go far enough</a> because it did not \u201cinclude enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, not enough prosecutors to convict them, not enough judges to sentence them, and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time\u201d. An older black generation fought through Jim Crow only for Biden to help make sure that their children and grandchildren lived through a new Jim Crow.</p> \n<p>On the House floor, Biden compared his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html\">criminal justice approach</a> to Richard Nixon\u2019s law and order stance: \u201cI would say, \u2018Lock the SOBs up.\u2019\u201d Black people were arrested in droves following this bill, despite comparable drug use rates to white people; many are still sitting in prison today. Biden has since acknowledged flaws in the bill, but last summer he reiterated his support for the bill. The law spent $30bn but contributed to only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/opinion/the-police-cant-solve-the-problem-they-are-the-problem.html\">a 1.3% decline in violent crime</a>. He has yet to call for it to be repealed.</p> \n<p>Today, some cities plan to expunge marijuana records and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/02/evanston-illinois-reparations-plan-african-americans-is-marijuana-tax/\">hope to pay reparations</a> to black people formerly incarcerated for marijuana offenses. But Biden can\u2019t seem to let go; <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/06/joe-biden-legalize-marijuana-111642\">he is inconsistent and ambivalent about marijuana legalization</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug/index.html\">argued</a> it may be a gateway drug, a statement he has since <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2020/03/06/joe-biden-is-frustrated-people-think-he-still-believes-marijuana-is-a-gateway-drug/#5a5184749aa2\">dialed back</a>.<strong> </strong>Of course, keeping marijuana illegal at the federal level does not mean that people will not use it, but rather that the extra police that he put on the street will send people of color to jail for using it. Ironically, the police were probably nowhere to be found when Biden\u2019s friends <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/in-secretly-taped-conversations-glimpses-of-the-future-president.html\">George W Bush</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">Barack Obama</a> used marijuana. If anything, the drug seems to be a gateway to the White House.</p> \n<p>Despite attempting to cut social programs and increasing mass incarceration, Biden claims to care about black families. But he doesn\u2019t seem to know many. During the September 2019 Democratic debate he claimed that poor families should put on a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/sports/joe-biden-parents-should-make-sure-you-have-the-record-player-on-at-night-to-expand-childrens-vocabulary/vi-AAHfDMH\">record player</a> so their children will know more words. Recently, during an interview with the New York Times editorial board, he argued that poor black parents feel ashamed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">because they cannot read and skip parent-teacher conferences</a>. He was hoping to encourage them to be better parents. But his assertion is incorrect. Black and white parents have comparable participation rates overall and attend parent-teacher conferences at the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">exact same rates</a>. In fact, black parents and poor parents are the most likely to check their children\u2019s homework and <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">meet with</a> guidance counselors. Biden instead relied on stereotypes that black people are not involved in their children\u2019s lives.</p> \n<p>Harris forced Biden to confront his work with racist elected officials to stop integration efforts using school busing. That was not his only education mistake. Biden played a significant role in creating the student debt crisis, including making student loan discharge \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/07/joe-biden-student-loans/\">nearly impossible</a>\u201d. This is devastating to black people, who disproportionately carry school debt. While the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/why-women-hold-the-majority-of-student-loans.html\">average school debt</a> for black women with a bachelor\u2019s degree is about $25,000, that level of education does not provide the same level of financial security for black women as it does other groups, including white people with less education (primarily because of sexism and racism).</p> \n<p>Again and again, Biden\u2019s relationship with black Americans, like the Democratic National Committee\u2019s relationship, has been patronizing at best and actively harmful at worst.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Some black people will support Biden because of his association with Barack Obama \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/obama-to-biden-dont-run\">Obama himself doesn\u2019t seem especially excited about Biden</a> becoming president. The Obama days feel distant yet warm compared to Donald Trump\u2019s current presidency. But remember: Biden cycled millions of black people in and out of jail, voted for massive numbers of poor people to go to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-iraq-war.html\">war in Iraq</a>, threw Anita Hill under the bus <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html\">to confirm a conservative justice</a> to the US supreme court, and, under Obama\u2019s administration, helped to deport <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/11/joe-biden-deportations-immigration-barack-obama\">millions of immigrants</a> and <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-democratic-party-military-hawk\">bombed brown countries</a>. When Biden was vice-president, black <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality\">home ownership and wealth</a> declined significantly, even as it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2019/02/28/feature/the-heartbreaking-decrease-in-black-homeownership/\">rose</a> for other races. Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people.</p> \n<p>The Democratic party holds black people in an abusive relationship but says you cannot leave because the other option is more abusive. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe that a vote against Biden solely means a vote for Trump. Perhaps it is a vote against being captured by the party that makes empty promises every four years when it is election time, and delivers nothing. Perhaps it is a vote against the crime bill, drones and deportations. Perhaps it is a vote against covert and overt racism.</p> \n<p>Biden and others will rightfully argue that Trump is worse, and I agree. But what can Biden actually deliver? Will there be fewer drones if he\u2019s president? Maybe not. Fewer deportations? Maybe not. Less money to police departments? No. Will fewer black people die from police? Unlikely. Will black people have healthcare? Unlikely. Will black wealth increase? Unlikely. Will Palestinian lives be safer? Unlikely. Commitments to preserving our climate? Doubtful. If black people have a hard time figuring out the differences between Trump and Biden, then that is Biden\u2019s problem, not ours.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden refuses to reckon with the harm that he has caused to people all over the world. His best line is that he is better than the other guy, and that is exactly how abusive relationships function. Black people \u2013 all people \u2013 deserve better than Biden and the Democratic party. And yes, we are still black.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a social movement lawyer and writer based in Washington, DC.

In America we need more prayer, not less.\u201d</p> \n<p>After his two-minute statement, the president left the briefing room podium without taking questions.</p> \n<p>His remarks sowed confusion because the federal government does not have the constitutional right to unilaterally order individual states to reopen businesses, churches or schools.

But it omitted details about houses of worship and faith-based organisations.</p> \n<p>There has been friction between Trump and state governors during the coronavirus pandemic.

  "<p>More than 30 shorebird species that fly across oceans each year to visit Australia \u2013 including nine that are threatened \u2013 are being hunted during their long migrations, according to a study that analysed decades of records from 14 countries.</p> <p>The study, which experts said filled a major gap in the world\u2019s knowledge about the impact of hunting on declining shorebird numbers, found that more than 17,000 birds from 16 species were likely being killed at just three sites \u2013 Pattani Bay in Thailand, West Java in Indonesia and the Yangtze River delta in China.</p> <p>Prof Richard Fuller, a co-author on the study, said that figure was \u201cterrifying\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe know hunting is going on at hundreds of other sites around the flyway.

Combined, the nativist micro-parties vacuumed up more than 20% of primary votes. But George held his regional Queensland seat with a positive two-party preferred swing of more than 11%. Labor\u2019s vote in Dawson crashed by more than 12%. George did that by pulling populist stunts like the egregious website. Sadly, we are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/22/tim-fischer-obituary-singular-political-character-who-rose-to-become-australias-deputy-pm\">a long way from the era of Tim Fischer.</a></p> <p>I\u2019ll bring us back to the power of anxiety and resentment in a bit, but first I need to guide you away from George\u2019s website, and touch down on an internal brawl that erupted inside the government back in 2017. This might seem an arcane diversion, but it\u2019s important. It marks the point in time when China hawks on the Coalition backbench started to front-run the government\u2019s China policy.</p> <h2>The official line on Beijing became tougher in increments</h2> <p>Let\u2019s remind ourselves quickly about what happened. In March 2017, Malcolm Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/28/china-extradition-treaty-government-isolated-abbott-joins-critics\">had to yank a proposed extradition treaty</a> with China because of an internal boilover. Labor, the Greens and the former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/20/cory-bernardi-stalls-china-australia-extradition-treaty-for-six-months\">lined up in support of a disallowance motion</a> to scuttle the proposed treaty with China, and a handful of Liberal senators telegraphed they would back the disallowance.</p> <p>Perhaps some of the opponents were intent on creating opportunistic havoc for Turnbull and then foreign minister Julie Bishop, but in the main, the internal resistance to the treaty was entirely principled.</p> <p>The argument from Liberals who dissented from government policy was Australia should not be party to an extradition treaty with an authoritarian regime where the rule of law does not prevail \u2013 an impeccable principle for anyone who cares about human rights and basic principles of liberty. The mystery was not the pushback, but why Australia had contemplated such an agreement in the first place. It seemed symptomatic of a loss of moral clarity in the relationship; that the dollars had clouded the sense.</p> <p>Prevailing in that internal battle taught the China hawks there was merit in pushing the envelope, and it is fair to say after that incident, the government\u2019s official line on Beijing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/09/china-says-turnbulls-remarks-have-poisoned-the-atmosphere-of-relations\">became tougher in increments</a>.</p> <p>Obviously the shift that played out during 2017 is significantly more complex and multifaceted than a backbench tail wagging a frontbench dog. There is a good book to be written documenting how and why Australia\u2019s tone about China became more muscular, and how that pivot was then <a href=\"https://insidestory.org.au/journalists-on-the-ramparts/\">filtered and amplified through the media</a> \u2013 resulting in a complex bilateral relationship being presented routinely in cartoonish and sometimes hysterical terms. The era of the \u201cpanda hugger\u201d was unleashed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/australia-australia-pm-scott-morrison-disappointed-if-china-coronavirus-invesigation-tariff-plan-linked-covid-19-inquiry\">Scott Morrison 'disappointed' if China tariff plan is linked to coronavirus investigation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s a great story, but the simple point to establish right now is a front-running, or pace-setting, dynamic was created within the government after the 2017 treaty boilover. That dynamic has persisted, and if anything accelerated, to the point where the Coalition\u2019s China hawks have factions.</p> <h2>Let a hundred flowers bloom</h2> <p>George, not known for playing well with others, is a solo act. The New South Wales conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/scott-morrisons-push-for-who-reforms-a-herding-cats-exercise-liberal-senator-says\">Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is another soloist</a>. Then there\u2019s the group that have dubbed themselves \u201cThe Wolverines\u201d (which believe it or not is a reference to a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087985/\">Patrick Swayze movie, Red Dawn</a>) \u2013 people like Andrew Hastie, the head of parliament\u2019s intelligence committee, James Paterson and Tim Wilson. This latter group runs as a pack, coordinating messaging.</p> <p>This front-running is largely unrestrained by Scott Morrison or senior ministers \u2013 at least not in public \u2013 which is a dynamic worth investigating. Given the issue in question is the China relationship \u2013 a matter of great import given the combustibility of the geopolitics, and the importance of the trading relationship to Australia\u2019s economic prosperity \u2013 Morrison could muzzle. He could insist that he and the foreign minister articulate Australia\u2019s foreign policy, and yet he mostly gives the hawks their head, provided the language doesn\u2019t get too florid.</p> <p>We are witnessing a contemporary Maoism. <em><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-silence-that-preceded-chinas-great-leap-into-famine-51898077/\">Let a hundred flowers bloom</a>, and a hundred schools of thought contend.</em> The obvious question to ask is why? There are a few potential answers. Morrison evidently calculates the risk of muzzling up-and-coming MPs who believe they must speak outweighs the benefits of dialling down the diplomatic noise.</p> <p>Presumably the prime minister intuits a crackdown on the free range China seminar within his own ranks would lead to a lethal breakout at some point or other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9829be965a283d80615b6990ab5fd264684419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9829be965a283d80615b6990ab5fd264684419/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Payne and Morrison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The China conversation under way in the polity is in part a function of the historical moment.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other benefit for Morrison of the free range seminar is it allows his government, domestically, to project many positions on China. It allows the government to speak to people in the community who fear the hegemonic ambitions of the authoritarian regime in Beijing. The hawks represent those view points, while the grown-ups in the ministry maintain a more measured diplomatic tone, trying to keep trade on the rails.</p> <p>Now why would Morrison feel the need to be all things to all people? A cynic might observe this is situation normal for this prime minister, but the worst thing about cynicism is it saps curiosity. We need to be curious about why things happen, and there are significant issues to tease out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/chinas-coercive-behaviour-a-wake-up-call-australias-former-top-public-servant-says\">China's coercive behaviour a 'wake-up call', Australia's former top public servant says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The China conversation under way in the polity is in part a function of the historical moment. Australians can see the great powers are in flux. China is rising, and America is withdrawing from global leadership. The geopolitical gear shift isn\u2019t elegant, it\u2019s chaotic and unsettling, and we are wedged between our most important security partner, America, and our economic interests in the region.</p> <p>Then of course, Covid-19 hit, bringing with it an overlay of domestic economic insecurity. Anyone in politics right now knows unease is building in the Australian community. You can feel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/essential-poll-one-in-10-australians-who-have-lost-jobs-fear-they-wont-work-again\">a ripple of anxiety in our Guardian Essential poll</a> as people begin to fret about their labour market prospects, with unemployment still to peak at 10%. A strong majority in that survey suspects China isn\u2019t being transparent in its reporting about the scope of the pandemic. A significant chunk of the sample, over a third, thinks the Covid-19 virus was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab\">engineered and released from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan</a>.</p> <p>We know that economic downturns light a match under nativist sentiment. We saw it during the global financial crisis, which triggered Brexit, and created the wave that carried Donald Trump to the presidency. We largely avoided a witches brew here because we were shielded from the worst of the fallout by China\u2019s demand for our commodities and by an economic stimulus program rolled out by the then Labor government.</p> <p>But the negative economic effects of Covid are harder to insulate ourselves from, despite the Coalition\u2019s stimulus now dwarfing Labor\u2019s in 2009. There has always been a current of community opposition to foreign investment, to foreign workers, to threats beyond our borders. That\u2019s in Australia\u2019s collective DNA. But this undercurrent of nativism will be turbocharged by the economic shock associated with the coronavirus.</p> <p>Over the coming months, the government is going to be dealing with rising protectionist sentiment, both domestically and internationally \u2013 and here\u2019s a prediction. While the Wolverines faction have been out promulgating the perils of proximity to the Chinese Communist party, those same MPs will also be on the frontline of resisting a return to protectionism.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a journey, this column, so let\u2019s bring our story together: Morrison giving the China hawks their way \u2013 while pursuing a more restrained diplomatic line at senior levels \u2013 presumably works in his head as an automatic stabiliser in febrile political times.</p> <p>Bubbling grievances and anxieties are validated by one arm of the government, while the grown-ups work to keep the China relationship more or less on the rails, and duck to avoid being co-opted by the lunatic in the Oval Office, who would burn the world to the ground to survive his date with the ballot box in November.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite the game of chicken, this. Maybe it works, and Australia manages to weather the geopolitical storm. Or maybe things go to shit in a really big way, because China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/australia-china-ties-at-risk-of-slipping-into-permanent-hostility-former-senior-diplomat-warns\">declines to be played off the break by Australia</a> for domestic purposes, and the lunatic burns us all.</p>",

For decades, they\u2019d been bedevilled by eye-rolling scandals, administrative ineptitude, false dawns, crumbling facilities and rotten luck. But this was their year. They won 19 straight games, including what many think is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnNEmuwe_OI\">highest standard game ever played</a>. They boasted a handful of bona fide champions. The rest were typical Ross Lyon footballers \u2013 jobbers, scrappers, asphyxiators. To topple them, Geelong would have to go to a place premiers are rarely asked to go.</p> <p>The Saints probably should have won. They laid more tackles than any side in the history of the game. They had 19 more inside-50s. They butchered a succession of easy shots. As the Geelong players collected their medals, Ross Lyon perused the stats: \u201cHow the fuck did we lose?\u201d he kept saying. \u201cHow the fuck did we lose?\u201d</p> <p>It would not be St Kilda if there wasn\u2019t some sort of last minute fiasco. Zac Dawson spent the Friday night on an intravenous drip. Nick Riewoldt strained his hip flexor in the final training drill and spent the night running the corridors at Box Hill Hospital. Even at the best of times, he was barely functional leading into games. \u201cLike being on death row,\u201d he later described it. He fought gamely, but wasn\u2019t his usual self.

Crazy-eyed and alligator blooded, Matthew Scarlett loomed like some sort of Cossack squat dancer. Off the drip but out of his weight division, Dawson was thwarted.

Roughly 30% of domestic flights are due to resume from Monday.</p> <p>Infections have surged in <strong>Indonesia</strong>,<strong> </strong>the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, ahead of celebrations this weekend to mark the end of Ramadan, raising questions about the government\u2019s commitment to curbing the pandemic.</p> <p>The country reported 973 new cases, its highest one-day count, bringing its official total to more than 21,000 \u2013 although the real figure is thought to be much higher. Officials have said the public are not taking proper precautions, but only four of 34 provinces and 26 cities have imposed wide-scale restrictions.</p> <p>The rates of new infections have begun to dip in much of the world, but the disease is continuing its deadly march in <strong>Latin</strong> <strong>America</strong>, which was described by the World Health Organization on Friday as \u201ca new epicentre\u201d of the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong> reported 150 new deaths, a record daily number that took the country\u2019s official death toll from Covid-19 to 3,249.

Shopping centres and department stores in the kingdom opened at the weekend for the first time in almost two months as the rate of infection slowed, but bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports remain off-limits.</p> <p>The WHO said <strong>Africa</strong> was approaching 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>The UN said the virus was assumed to be spreading throughout <strong>Yemen</strong>. Appealing for urgent funding, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said Yemen\u2019s healthcare system \u201chas in effect collapsed\u201d.</p> <p>He said aid workers were turning people away because of a lack of medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment in the war-ravaged country. Yemen\u2019s malnourished population has among the world\u2019s lowest immunity levels.</p> <p>Months before a general election in <strong>New Zealand</strong>, the leader of the main opposition party was ousted after a poll showed an 84% approval rating for the way the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has handled the pandemic.</p> <p>In the <strong>US</strong>, pictures emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a factory visit in Michigan. The president had earlier been called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear a mask during a tour of the plant.</p> <p>The <strong>Czech Republic</strong> said the virus remained under control nearly two weeks after shopping centres, cinemas and restaurant terraces were reopened. \u201cThe massive easing of 11 May did not affect the epidemiological curve,\u201d said the health minister, Adam Vojtech.</p> <p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, the government said the Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area \u2013 the two areas hardest hit by Covid-19 \u2013 would be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday.</p> <p>The loosening means all of Spain will now be in at least the second phase of the exit plan: people can meet in groups of up to 10, and restaurant and cafe terraces can reopen at 50% capacity. Places of worship will be able to operate at 30% capacity.</p> <p>The health minister, Salvador Illa, said 47% of the country would move to the third and penultimate stage on Monday, meaning people can visit shopping centres and eat inside restaurants, both of which will operate at 40% capacity.</p>",

But, he said: \u201cFundamentally mutations, especially here, are nothing to worry about ... it is just some kind of minor typo [in the genome] that are either neutral or actually often not favourable to the virus.\u201d<br><br><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108506v1\">The study</a>, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by a team of researchers in the UK and France, who scrutinised more than 15,000 coronavirus genomes collected from patients around the world since the outbreak began. <br><br>Across all the genomes they uncovered 6,822 mutations in total, relative to the ancestral genome, but none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Further analysis revealed 273 of the mutations cropped up repeatedly \u2013 with the team focusing on the 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cThere is no such thing as a European strain, an American strain, an Icelandic strain- there has been a lot of mixing from the beginning of the pandemic,\u201d said Balloux. <br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIf there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better, then we should see it happening multiple times,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a mutation that happened once over the pandemic, then that is most unlikely to be something beneficial [to the virus].\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">They then looked at whether these mutations made the virus more transmissible. \u201cWe just work out whether the ones that carry a mutation, whether they have more descendants, whether they are actually spreading faster [than closely related genomes without the mutation] \u2013 and the answer is no,\u201d said Balloux, adding the mutations could be introduced by enzymes involved in the body\u2019s immune system. In fact, the team says, some of the mutations studied seem to be actually harmful to the virus.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Balloux added that while there is not enough data as yet to explore whether mutations may make the virus more deadly or cause more severe symptoms, he said it is unlikely.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cViruses don\u2019t benefit from killing their hosts.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to unveil the plans at the daily Downing Street briefing later. The measures, which will be introduced next month, will be reviewed every three weeks, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said. Tony Smith, a former head of Border Force, said he was surprised quarantine measures had not been brought in sooner.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sir Paul Nurse: \u2018We are desperate for clear leadership\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute and 2001 Nobel laureate for medicine, has delivered a scathing attack on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe are desperate for clear leadership at all levels,\u201d he told the BBC. He said the UK had been \u201ctoo much on the back foot, increasingly playing catchup\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Care home boss calls for repeat testing</strong></p> \n  <p>Weekly testing of all residents and staff could help ease the Covid-19 outbreak in care homes, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest care providers said. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, which took part in a government pilot of whole-home testing, said asymptomatic cases meant the virus could spread without being noticed. He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is either once a week or once a fortnight. Some of the research that seems to have been done would suggest that weekly would be the most effective way. There was a real reluctance to test staff. They were going to test the residents but they were not going to test the staff. But that was the most highly likely way the infection could have come into the home.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Government borrowing hits record \u00a362bn in April</strong></p> \n  <p>UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993.</p> \n  <p><strong>Independent Sage warns against school reopening plan</strong></p> \n  <p>The Independent Sage committee has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The group, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says that new modelling of the coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September reduced the risk still further. A straw poll of Unison members working in schools in England found that the vast majority remain concerned over the safety of their workplaces opening to more pupils on 1 June.</p> \n  <p><strong>New spitting incident at a London station</strong></p> \n  <p>Union leaders have condemned another \u201cdisgusting and frightening\u201d spitting incident at a London station. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said a man approached staff at Mile End London underground station on Thursday and demanded they open the gate as he did not have a ticket for the barriers. He became aggressive and swore at an older female customer who intervened, and spat at her, said the union. British Transport Police were called and spit samples were taken from the female customer\u2019s face and arm.

Delaying until September reduced the risk still further.</p> \n  <p>The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so that new cases are found and isolated fast. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,\u201d Professor King said. </p> \n  <p>In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a \u201cvital\u201d part of the decision-making process.</p> \n  <p>The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes.</p> \n  <p>King said the decision of when to re-open schools was a \u201ccareful balance\u201d but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Professor King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance and England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty. </p> \n  <p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cSupport for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly.

  "<p>Around this time last year, criticism was mounting in Hong Kong over a proposed bill that would allow people wanted by the Chinese authorities to be sent to the mainland. Demonstrators marched on the city\u2019s legislature and scuffles broke out between pro-democracy and pro-Beijing lawmakers.</p> <p>Within a few weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/vast-protest-in-hong-kong-against-extradition-law-china\">more than a million people took to the streets</a>, decrying legislation they believed would mark the end of Hong Kong and the freedoms that set it apart from China. A protest movement was born and for months the city was engulfed in violent street battles, in what has been described as Hong Kong\u2019s worst crisis since the 1997 handover of the former British colony to Chinese control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/chinese-security-forces-could-be-deployed-in-hong-kong-under-new-law\">Chinese security forces could be deployed in Hong Kong under new law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, new legislation is in the works that promises to make that crisis much worse. China\u2019s national legislature is preparing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/chinas-national-security-law-ban-subversion-and-separatism-hong-kong\">impose a sweeping anti-sedition law</a> on Hong Kong in an unprecedented legal manoeuvre that would bypass the city\u2019s legislative system, where similar moves were shelved for 17 years because of widespread public opposition. Beijing has said such measures are \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for stopping the protests and restoring order.</p> <p>\u201cIt is way worse than the extradition bill. It proves that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 has been completely repealed,\u201d said Biyanca Chu, 23, a protester, who was among many shocked by the announcement.</p> <p>Rights advocates and legal experts say the law, aimed at stopping subversion, separatism, terrorism and \u201cactivities of foreign and external forces to interfere in the affairs of Hong Kong\u201d would be used on protesters like Chu, a recent graduate. Over the last year, charges of rioting, illegal assembly, public obstruction among others have failed to dent the demonstrations.</p> <p>By including foreign interference under national security, the law could also curb international lobbying by pro-democracy activists. China has long blamed countries including the UK and the US as the \u201cblack hand\u201d behind the protests</p> <p>\u201cUsually the penalty will be much heavier when it is national security,\u201d said Ma Ngok, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who said in addition to targeting protesters, the law could affect anyone seen as critical of the government.</p> <p>\u201cInternational NGOs operating in Hong Kong will not be safe. I don\u2019t know what will happen to the media. This is all part of a major decline of Hong Kong freedom and autonomy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Legal experts say the law, details of which would be drafted by the standing committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress and then directly added to Hong Kong law, is a blatant violation of the autonomy promised under \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 and the city\u2019s de-facto constitution, the basic law.</p> <p>According to a draft document, Beijing would reserve the right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/chinese-security-forces-could-be-deployed-in-hong-kong-under-new-law\">set up national security agencies in Hong Kong</a> to \u201csafeguard national security\u201d. This increases the possibility of Chinese security forces on the streets of Hong Kong.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the beginning of direct rule by Beijing, sidelining the authority of the Hong Kong government and the legislative council as designated by the basic law,\u201d said Prof Ho-Fung Hung, a lecturer in political economy at Johns Hopkins University in the US.</p> <p>Experts say the aggressive move comes at a time when China is in a stronger position relative to much of the rest of the world struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic. It is also a way for China to send a message to the US, which is debating whether to continue granting Hong Kong special trade status under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, passed last year to pressure Beijing into respecting the city\u2019s rights.</p> <p>Having largely contained the virus, China has begun to restart its economy after months of paralysis, while sending aid and equipment to other countries. According to Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, China has came out of Covid-19 stronger than any other major economy.</p> <p>\u201cIn a situation where the countries that historically would speak up for Hong Kong are on their knees and are dependent on China for PPE, what better timing is there than that?\u201d said Tsang, referring to China\u2019s shipments of personal protective equipment around the world.</p> <p>Yet the move also comes from a position of vulnerability for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who disappeared from public view during the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak in China and has been under scrutiny over what he knew about the virus and when. Some have described the proposed anti-sedition law as a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeromeacohen/status/1263837704719986690\">mark of desperation</a>\u201d after almost a year of not being able to halt the protests.</p> <p>\u201cXi Jinping clearly understands that he was weakened by Covid-19, which is more reason why he needs to reassert his authority,\u201d said Tsang. \u201cIf he can demonstrate resolve and ability to move in Hong Kong it shows he has not really lost that much control \u2026 and therefore [his] enemies within the party better watch out.\u201d</p> <p>Observers believe the immediate effect of the law is likely to be more unrest. On Friday, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said her government would fully cooperate with China to enact the legislation while protesters called for demonstrations at the weekend. </p> <p>\u201cGiven that the protests and their intensity have been driven by Beijing\u2019s erosion of promised freedoms, Beijing\u2019s direct imposition of a security law would clearly enflame the population,\u201d said Victoria Tin-bor Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame who has been following the protests.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to see people going back in the streets in Hong Kong, both big demonstrations and smaller demonstrations \u2013 which will be met by police with full force \u2013 and violence re-erupting in Hong Kong,\u201d said Tsang. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very hot summer.\u201d</p>",

No one should be in any doubt, however, that a 14-day quarantine period for all travellers returning to the UK will unavoidably put many people off travelling abroad or visiting the UK, and will therefore have a hugely damaging impact on the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries \u2013 which support hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country and have already been severely affected by the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical that the government regularly reviews this policy \u2013 including assessing its effectiveness and how it works with other control measures. We\u2019d also continue to urge the government to keep any measures proportionate, targeted and limited only to what is necessary and to seek a coordinated approach with destinations in the EU and beyond.\u201d</p> \n<p>The stringent new quarantine system will be reviewed every three weeks. The government confirmed there will be exemptions for freight drivers; doctors and scientists working on the pandemic; and fruit pickers, who will be expected to confine themselves to the farms where they work. Visitors from Ireland will also be exempt.</p> \n<p>Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: \u201cIndustry will be disappointed with this measure which is isolationist and will prevent many essential daily cross-border journeys to provide service and maintenance. Additionally air freight on passenger aircraft provides a significant proportion of UK export and supply chain capacity, all of which is vital to operations as companies begin to get up and running.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adam Tyndall, programme director of the business lobbying group London First, said: \u201cDeciding to quarantine all passengers arriving into the UK is an indiscriminate response to an increasingly nuanced situation. Two weeks in isolation will put off most travellers, all of whom would have contributed to the UK\u2019s economic recovery.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe UK is a world leader in aviation and should be forging international agreements between low-risk countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: \u201cThe imposition of a quarantine period will inevitably damage international visitor travel, and the longer it is in place, the more damage it will wreak.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has not ruled out negotiating \u201cair bridges\u201d \u2013 an idea championed by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps.

These security bodies would \u201csafeguard national security,\u201d the document states.</p> \n<p>Last month Hong Kong authorities arrested 15 of the city\u2019s most prominent pro-democracy figures for illegal assembly; the new legislation could make such activists and campaigners still more vulnerable.</p> \n<p>The spectre of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 has hung over the last year of unrest in Hong Kong. Particularly as violence escalated, there were mounting concerns among demonstrators that police or military personnel might be sent over from the mainland to clear the streets \u2013 fears that are now likely to deepen, analysts said.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The draft] includes specifically a provision for mainland security forces to be deployed to Hong Kong if necessary, which suggests that they have already thought about this and are prepared to put it into the law,\u201d said Prof Steve Tsang, the director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo they are expecting the protests to come, and they are prepared to go and crush them. And I regrettably think they will crush them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, explicitly linked provisions of the new law to the \u201cdisturbances\u201d of the protest movement.</p> \n<p>She said in a statement that offences covered in the legislation were \u201cexactly the situations which the political and business sectors in Hong Kong and members of the public have been worrying about over the past year\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe emergence of various incidents involving explosives and firearms has posed the risk of terrorism, seriously jeopardising public safety,\u201d the statement said, adding a frequently stated and unsubstantiated charge that the protesters were manipulated by foreigners.</p> \n<p>Lam said late on Friday the new laws would improve business confidence in the city and would not damage the interests of foreign investors, China\u2019s state news agency <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/23/c_139080188.htm\">Xinhua reported</a>.</p> \n<p>For years Beijing had been chipping away at the autonomy that Hong Kong was guaranteed for 50 years when the British colonial administration handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997. But it has also had setbacks, with mass protests forcing authorities to drop a national security law in 2003 and more recently the extradition law that sparked last year\u2019s demonstrations.</p> \n<p>By passing laws for the city in Beijing, and allowing Chinese security forces to be stationed there, China\u2019s Communist party leadership is sweeping away even a pretence of autonomy. Helena Wong. a pro-democracy legislator, said: \u201cEven the [Hong Kong] government will not be able to regulate what the [Chinese security] agents do in Hong Kong.\u201d</p> \n<p>News of the law stunned Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy activists and lawmakers, and there was an outpouring of fear, grief and anger in the city. On Friday afternoon legislators protested against the decision in the legislature and were forcibly removed. Street demonstrations will follow, with the first mass gathering expected on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Downloads of VPN software that allows users to circumvent Chinese censorship and browse anonymously rose overnight after the law was announced.</p> \n<p>There is no hope that the legislation can be altered or delayed by people turning out on the streets in Hong Kong, but over the past year many protesters said they had come out on to the streets out of desperation rather than in real hope of change.</p> \n<p>Even if authorities have more tools to stop demonstrations, and an even clearer message of intent to break the movement, intimidation alone is unlikely to keep Hong Kong\u2019s people off the streets. Some will be hoping to garner international support, which they see as the only slim hope of pushing back against Beijing.</p> \n<p>Pompeo\u2019s statement attacking China\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d move was part of a strong chorus of international condemnation. In a joint statement with the Australian and Canadian foreign ministers, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the proposed new law, and he emphasised that the \u201clegally binding\u201d 1984 agreement \u2013 which promised Hong Kong 50 years of autonomy \u2013 remained in force.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaking such a law on Hong Kong\u2019s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019, under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n<p>A bipartisan bill being introduced by the US senators Chris Van Hollen and Pat Toomey would impose sanctions on officials and entities that enforce any new national security laws, the Washington Post reported.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s foreign ministry said it would fight back against any US attempt to influence the law.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/uk-has-too-much-at-stake-to-confront-china-over-hong-kong\">UK has too much at stake to confront China over Hong Kong</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is unclear how many western countries will have the appetite to enforce costly sanctions or other penalties at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is causing massive economic strain.</p> \n<p>Lam insisted that Hong Kong was and \u201cwill remain a very free society\u201d. She brushed off concerns about the economic impact of China\u2019s move.</p> \n<p>Hong Kong has functioned as a regional hub for many international companies who want to do business in China but also seek the protection of an independent judicial system.

Decades of farming in the Great Plains had rid the topsoil of its native grass, leaving nothing to prevent fields crumbling to dust when drought struck in 1931.

Its mission was to put unemployed Americans to work. More than 3 million people planted 3bn trees, built shelter belts across the Great Plains to reduce the risk of dust storms, and created 700 state parks.

  "<p>The end of one country, two systems is now clearly in sight. Though Beijing promised to respect Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and autonomy for a full half-century, it has chipped and then hacked away at them since the handover in 1997. Almost a year ago, the people of Hong Kong startled themselves and the world with their all-out rejection of the growing encroachments. About one in four took to the streets to protest against the extradition law.</p> <p>Now, less than halfway through the 50-year pledge, China has taken a bulldozer to its foundations. The National People\u2019s Congress is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/chinas-national-security-law-ban-subversion-and-separatism-hong-kong\" title=\"\">proposing</a> a national security law for Hong Kong prohibiting acts of \u201ctreason, secession, sedition, or subversion\u201d. Should anyone doubt the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/hong-kongs-security-laws-what-are-they-and-why-are-they-so-controversial\" title=\"\">implications</a>, official sources have helpfully briefed that this would cover acts such as defacing the national flag. National security bodies will be able to set up agencies in the city.</p> <p>The manner of this move is as alarming as its substance. The city\u2019s mini-constitution requires its government to enact such a law, but an attempt 17 years ago was dropped due to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/02/world/security-laws-target-of-huge-hong-kong-protest.html\" title=\"\">backlash</a>. This time, Beijing is imposing it from on high. The aim is probably to force it through the Legislative Council \u2013 stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists \u2013 to give the thinnest veneer of legitimacy, promulgating it only if necessary. But this is an undeniable declaration of intent.</p> <p>Further unrest is inevitable. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong+protest\" title=\"\">last year</a> suggests it will only be fuelled by brutal policing. Beijing does not care about hearts and minds. It has done more to radicalise Hong Kong than any dissident could. Support for protesters has grown even as some have turned to violence: a survey in March suggested 58% of residents backed them and only 28% opposed.</p> <p>The question is whether burgeoning hostility to Beijing overseas, fuelled by its handling of coronavirus, will translate into support for Hong Kong\u2019s protesters. As the other signatory of the joint declaration, a legally binding international treaty, Britain must vigorously defend it. That will require working with other nations: though the foreign secretary\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-from-the-uk-australia-and-canada-on-hong-kong\" title=\"\">criticism</a> was muted, making it in a joint statement with his Australian and Canadian counterparts was sensible. Individuals too need support; those forced to flee political persecution should be able to make their home here.</p> <p>In the US, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/pompeo-china-measure-death-knell-135814209.html\" title=\"\">described</a> the proposed law as a death knell for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy \u2013 upon which rests the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-hong-kongs-special-status-in-the-us-is-touchy-territory/2019/11/19/\" title=\"\">special economic status</a> it enjoys with the US. Though a full-scale revocation might be unlikely, stripping protections from the technology sector would chime with the Trump administration\u2019s broader agenda. Since Beijing understands the risks, it is either gambling that other interests will prevail, or regards the resulting economic damage \u2013 even as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus \u2013 as an acceptable price to pay for its political victory.</p> <p>What is now at stake is bigger than the future of Hong Kong, as important as that is. Other nations should ask themselves whether they want China to believe that it can trample on its pledges and renege on international treaties with impunity.</p>",

  "<p>Alex Hales would have the backing of the England dressing room in the event of a surprise recall this summer, according to Chris Woakes.</p> <p>Woakes was among those consulted by the limited-overs captain, Eoin Morgan, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/29/alex-hales-withdrawn-from-england-squads-world-cup-after-drugs-ban-cricket\">Hales was dropped</a> on the eve of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\">World Cup win</a> after it emerged the opener had served a 21-day ban for a second recreational drug offence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/21/australia-could-visit-england-for-white-ball-series-in-september\">Australia could visit England for white-ball series in September</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while Morgan stated that trust still needs to be rebuilt and \u201c11 months is actually not that long ago\u201d, the sudden need for a pool of up to 45 players to cover England\u2019s rescheduled Test and limited-overs summer could prompt a rethink.</p> <p>At the age of 31, it is possibly a case of now or never for Hales, at least while Morgan remains captain. Should the respected leader\u2019s view mellow in light of the extraordinary circumstances then Woakes expects the rest of the setup to fall in line.</p> <p>Woakes said: \u201cI\u2019m a believer that people serve their time, so to speak. He\u2019s gone through a tough time being left out of the World Cup; going on to see that team lift the trophy must have been difficult for him. I think if people have gone away for a time and worked on their weaknesses they should be allowed a second chance. In a way I felt sorry for him but I understand the decision from the management, captain and rest of the team.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t 100% know what will happen but I\u2019d be happy to see Alex back in England colours. I would imagine the majority would have the kind of views I have given. I don\u2019t know why anyone would see that any differently. We have a culture and an environment in the England squad we all try and pull in the right direction. If Alex is willing to do that then I imagine everyone would be happy to see him back.\u201d</p> <p>The white-ball team\u2019s goal of a second global title will probably be delayed by the expected postponement of the T20 World Cup in Australia this October (the slot for which looks set to be taken by a rescheduled Indian Premier League). It means the Test team will take priority selection-wise this summer \u2013 if that was not already the case \u2013 and not least since movement between formats is likely to be restricted by the bio-secure measures in place.</p> <p>Although he is the leader of the attack in one-day internationals, Woakes is among the red-ball bowlers who resumed individual training during the past two days with an hour-long session at Edgbaston that included five overs bowling at \u201c50%\u201d and fitness work, supervised at a distance by the Warwickshire physio, Gerhard Mostert. His day began with a temperature check at home, the results of which are entered into an app, before arriving at the ground in full kit, making regular use of the hand-washing stations and training with a batch of balls that only he is permitted to touch.</p> <p>A temporary ban on using saliva to shine the ball is expected to be confirmed by the International Cricket Council and so the 31-year-old expects players will need to work harder to get swing during the proposed six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan.</p> <p>Woakes, who has been forced to train wearing an alice band due to 12 weeks without a haircut, said: \u201cFrom a bowler\u2019s point of view we\u2019ve just got to find a way to shine it for harder and longer to find a way of getting some shine on the ball. Thankfully it\u2019s a Dukes ball and not a Kookaburra this summer, because then we would be struggling. I\u2019m sure we will find a way of getting some shine and making sure it does move off the straight.</p> <p>\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>Beijing\u2019s announcement that it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">force through a \u201cnational security\u201d law</a> in Hong Kong is, to date, the greatest infringement of China\u2019s promises to the special administrative region. It threatens to undermine all the cherished institutions and rights that distinguish this international city from mainland China. The legislation is designed to prevent \u201csedition, subversion, secession and treason\u201d, but the manner in which it is being introduced is undercutting Hong Kong\u2019s relative autonomy, its independent judiciary and its legislature.</p> <p>The issue has always been controversial. In 1989, Beijing became worried by Hong Kong\u2019s support for the pro-democracy movement in China; it requested that the territory draft anti-subversion laws on its own after 1997, when Hong Kong was handed over to China by Britain. Although this is required by article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/hong-kongs-security-laws-what-are-they-and-why-are-they-so-controversial\"> the Basic Law</a>, it has never been enacted. In 2003, the Hong Kong government tried to introduce the legislation, resulting in street protests of half a million people. This time, following months of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/the-stakes-are-higher-hong-kongs-battle-lines-redrawn-for-post-covid-protests\">bitter protests</a>, Beijing has clearly run out of patience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China\u2019s Communist party has shown that it can outplay the protest movement with the very same crash-and-burn strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress \u2013 delayed by two months because of the global pandemic \u2013 the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3085574/two-sessions-2020-beijing-sets-sights-hong-kong-legal\">announced</a> that Beijing would impose the legislation on Hong Kong by adding it to an annex of the Basic Law. This bypasses Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, whose procedural gridlock climaxed last week with pro-democracy legislators being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-52702076\">carried out</a> by security guards while a pro-Beijing politician was installed as a committee chair. Beijing is effectively taking away Hong Kong\u2019s right to legislate for itself, promulgating laws that will be forced upon the territory.</p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said that safeguarding national security is necessary and urgent, given \u201cthe mutual disruption approach\u201d adopted by radical protesters and the deadlocked legislature. But one measure of the speed with which these measures are being rushed through was her answer at a press conference to the question of who would be responsible for enforcing the law. \u201cI am unable to give you all the details today,\u201d she said. The law is expected to be approved by the National People\u2019s Congress as early as 28 May, when the plenary session winds down. It could be in Hong Kong\u2019s books by the end of June.</p> <p>The decision to bypass Hong Kong\u2019s government and legislature shatters any pretence that the city still enjoys \u201cthe high degree of autonomy\u201d that it was promised in 1997. The method of promulgation also undermines the independence of Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary and its rule of law, equally prized by the Hong Kong population and the multinational businesses headquartered here. As news of the decision broke out, the stock market <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-markets/hong-kong-stocks-drop-5-as-beijing-pushes-security-law-idUSP8N2B401N\">plunged</a> by 5.5%, its biggest fall in five years, with property stocks and banks the worst hit.</p> <p>Draft copies of the legislation, viewed by reporters in Beijing, <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1527656-20200522.htm\">indicate</a> that mainland security agencies will be allowed to operate in Hong Kong. These security services often target dissidents, rights lawyers and journalists in China. In Hong Kong, it is believed that at least one of the five booksellers that disappeared from the territory in 2016 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/missing-british-bookseller-appears-on-television\">abducted</a> by mainland security agents. The legislation might also mean an end to the freedoms of speech and assembly that Hong Kongers have enjoyed since 1997 \u2013 even as these freedoms were gradually curtailed in recent years.</p> <p>In Hong Kong, the news was met with numb disbelief. It was \u201cthe saddest day in Hong Kong\u2019s history\u201d according to the pro-democratic Civic party politician Tanya Chan. The very vagueness of mainland Chinese definitions of sedition, subversion and secession could criminalise groups such as religious believers, political parties advocating greater autonomy and even those who organised Hong Kong\u2019s massive protests, some of which saw more than 1 million participants.</p> <p>Given that Hong Kong\u2019s future autonomy is now uncertain, the move also brings into question the city\u2019s future as an international business centre. The news was met by protests in the legislative council and calls for more street action in spite of the ongoing restrictions on gatherings of more than eight people due to the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">'This is the end of Hong Kong': China pushes controversial security laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hong Kong\u2019s defenders have often hoped the city would be protected by its role as a world city, thanks in no small part to the institutions that distinguish it from mainland China. Some warned that this would not be enough to protect Hong Kong from the Communist party.

And Baza, the internet agency that had correctly broken the news of the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, being ill, said there had been damage to Kadyrov\u2019s lungs.</p> <p>Chechnya has stood out in the North Caucasus during the coronavirus epidemic for its low reported number of deaths. In neighbouring Dagestan, deaths from coronavirus and pneumonia are thought to have passed 700, but Chechnya has continued to post rock-bottom numbers that have raised questions, Shvedov said. The government has claimed they were a result of early quarantine measures.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/50899/\">a recent protest at a hospital in Gudermes</a>, where doctors said there was not enough PPE, could indicate that Chechnya is facing similar problems to other regions and that \u201cfear towards coronavirus is stronger than their fear of Kadyrovtsy [paramilitaries who protect Kadyrov]\u201d, Shvedov said. Three nurses and two doctors later apologised on Chechen state television for the protest. Kadyrov later said they should be fired.</p> <p>In news reports and official press releases, Kadyrov has sought to portray himself as irreplaceable in controlling Chechnya, making any kind of extended absence a dangerous prospect. Without directly denying reports of Kadyrov\u2019s hospitalisation, an aide said his headquarters remained \u201cunder his personal control\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile there are images of Kadyrov breaking his own quarantine, making it a potentially sensitive moment if he must now admit he has fallen ill.</p> <p>\u201cIf at some point he needs to show he is a human being and he might be ill, even seriously ill, it becomes really complicated to show the real picture,\u201d Shvedov said.</p>",

Therefore \u2013 at least in large part \u2013 this represents a policy success: large parts of the economy have, as was intended, shut down to stop the spread of COVID-19, reducing VAT owed.</p> <p>In addition, firms have been able to defer payment on their VAT liabilities until the end of the financial year. To the extent that businesses had short-term liquidity problems, this measure will help support them through the crisis and revenue will come in later in the year. However, some fraction of businesses is likely to face not just a liquidity but a solvency issue and not survive, meaning that some VAT revenues will never be paid. </p> <p>The OBR assumes that 5% of the VAT that is deferred will never be repaid and, on this basis, forecast that the deferral cost will mean that ultimately revenues are depressed by \u00a31.9 billion as a result. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PJTheEconomist/status/1263755729711874048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One aspect of today&#39;s dreadful fiscal numbers. <br><br>We normally receive \u00a310-12bn in VAT revenues in April.

Forever. </p> <p>Soros says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures. Perpetual bonds or consols are such a measure. They should not even be considered in normal times. But if the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts.

By contrast the coronavirus moves very fast and in unpredictable ways.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>In order to borrow so cheaply, the EU would need to maintain a AAA credit rating</strong>. That would mean agreeing taxes to cover the cost of servicing the bonds. A long process, that would be opposed by those who won\u2019t accept collective borrowing.</p> <p>But Soros has a solution:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The taxes only have to be authorized; they don\u2019t need to be implemented.

It is only a matter of time before the death toll reaches 100,000.</p> <p>During the Democratic primary, Biden spoke of restoring normalcy after four years of Donald Trump, frequently appealing to voters\u2019 nostalgia for the presidency of Barack Obama. But now, as he faces the general election amid the deepening economic turmoil, the presumptive Democratic nominee is reaching for the legacy of a radical American president: Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p> <p>\u201cThe blinders have been taken off,\u201d Biden told supporters recently during a virtual fundraiser from his Delaware home, where he has been since March. \u201cBecause of this Covid crisis, I think people are realizing, \u2018My Lord, look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, Biden, who has climbed above Trump in national polls, has openly courted progressive leaders and ideas, adopting some of the populist rhetoric more commonly associated with his vanquished rivals, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. In turn, they have offered their full-throated endorsements, casting Biden, a pragmatic dealmaker who still believes in bipartisan comity, as the perhaps unlikely herald of a new progressive era.</p> <p>\u201cA shift of frame matters \u2013 it\u2019s not to be underestimated,\u201d the California congressman Ro Khanna, who was a co-chair of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, said of Biden\u2019s bold messaging. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different vision for what he thinks the next four years should be about.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Biden nor Trump has yet laid out their vision for what the first 100 days of a new presidency might look like, a benchmark established by FDR during which he offered a series of sweeping reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478/0_0_3000_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\ufeffBut Biden and his economic advisers believe they must be prepared to marshal a far more ambitious domestic agenda than they initially imagined. During daily virtual meetings, Biden and his team are beginning to draft a new governing vision that reflects the scale and urgency of the crisis that Biden predicted may \u201ceclipse what FDR faced\u201d.</p> <p>The task is not entirely new to Biden. As vice-president, he led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the recession, and his campaign hopes to leverage his remarkably scandal-free stewardship of the nearly $800bn stimulus package with Trump\u2019s handling of the economy.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, Biden said he would share a detailed plan \u201cfor the right kind of economic recovery\u201d, aspects of which are expected to include massive investment in public health, expansive legislative action on climate change, and broad new protections for workers.</p> <p>Last week, Biden announced six policy taskforces \u2013 centered around issues that include healthcare, climate and the economy \u2013 that pair his supporters with ideological allies of Sanders. Among those chosen to participate are some of the young, progressive leaders most skeptical of his approach, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p> <p>In a joint press release announcing the taskforces, Biden said the groups would help \u201ctransform our country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVice-President Biden understands in his gut that this is a totally different order of magnitude than any president has ever dealt with,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union and a member of the healthcare taskforce.</p> <p>Henry said the coronavirus has exposed the underlying causes of the US\u2019s problems, calling public attention to issues she believes government and business leaders can no longer afford to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cWe had [38] million people that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">have lost jobs</a>. But that\u2019s on top of the 64 million Americans who already made less than $15 an hour before Covid,\u201d she said. Without paid sick leave, some essential workers are reporting for work even if they feel ill because they can\u2019t afford the alternative while fast-food and healthcare workers stage protests to demand protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of inequality has sort of hit people between the eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Jared Bernstein, one of Biden\u2019s economic advisers, said Biden was looking beyond the \u201ccyclical\u201d challenges posed by the pandemic to the many \u201cstructural\u201d problems it has revealed.</p> <p>\u201cBiden is, I think, developing a particularly robust agenda that really strikes at this reality that the Trump economy was built on a house of sand and has turned out to be totally non-resilient to any shock,\u201d said Bernstein, who advised Biden during his tenure as vice-president.</p> <p>Biden, Bernstein said, recognizes the need for an \u201curgent expansion\u201d that better insulates the American economy from the \u201cshocks that are coming fast and furiously\u201d not as a direct result of the pandemic but from climate change and income inequality.</p> <p>Biden has also made other gestures. He has adopted aspects of Sanders\u2019 free college tuition proposal. He has embraced Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bankruptcy proposal and joined with the senator, viewed as a potential running mate, to call for better oversight of how the Trump administration spends the coronavirus relief fund. </p> <p>Critics on the left have scoffed at the notion of Biden as an FDR-style visionary. After all, they say, Biden once told supporters that under his presidency \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d.</p> <p>David Sirota, a former adviser to Sanders 2020 presidential campaign, dismissed Biden\u2019s overtures to the left as performative politics \u2013 a \u201ccanned SNL skit\u201d that progressives were being asked to accept as \u201csomething real\u201d.</p> <p>\ufeffRepublicans, meanwhile, view Biden\u2019s expanding policy aspirations as a political gift. After the taskforce members were announced, the Republican National Committee tagged Biden a \u201cbanner-man for the socialist agenda\u201d.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s policy platform \u2013 which includes a public option for healthcare and an aggressive plan to combat the climate crisis \u2013 might have been considered far-reaching in another presidential cycle. But during the primary he resisted pressure from activists to embrace progressive litmus-test items such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.</p> <p>Campaign aides and allies say Biden\u2019s calls for change are part of a policy evolution in response to the crisis, not a sudden embrace of a Sanders-style agenda. Biden himself has pointed to his nearly 50-year political career as a guide for how he would make \u201cinstitutional\u201d changes \u201cwithout us becoming a socialist country, or any of that malarkey\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Gwin, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cHe\u2019s scaling up the solutions he\u2019s proposed so that we can meet this moment, get through this crisis, and ensure that we come out on the other end with a stronger middle class and a more resilient country.\u201d</p> <p>Surrounding his planning for the presidency is the uncertainty over who will control the House and Senate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/us-senate-democrats-elections-2020\">which is suddenly within reach for Democrats</a>. Yet there are signs that the coronavirus, and Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, have scrambled the political calculus, giving Biden new latitude to move in a far bolder direction.</p> <p>A recent survey by the non-partisan <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">Pew Research Center</a> found that the public\u2019s view of the economy has darkened dramatically: just 23% of Americans describe the economic outlook as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, down from 57% at the start of the year. The same poll found <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">overwhelming</a> support for the $2tn coronavirus relief measure passed by Congress last month, a marked contrast from the<a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2009/03/16/obamas-approval-rating-slips-amid-division-over-economic-proposals/\"> polarized, partisan views</a> of the stimulus package passed to stem the economic fallout from the Great Recession.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t underscore enough the extent to which this economic moment is unprecedented,\u201d said Steph Sterling, vice-president of advocacy and policy at the liberal Roosevelt Institute. \u201cOur institutions need to shift to meet the moment in a way that only government can.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is widespread frustration at the British government\u2019s muted initial response to China\u2019s plans to impose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/chinas-national-security-law-ban-subversion-and-separatism-hong-kong\">new security laws in Hong Kong</a>, raising the perennial questions about what the UK can realistically do to persuade China to protect the territory\u2019s cherished freedoms.</p> <p>Johnny Patterson, the chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, described the UK\u2019s response so far to the planned crackdown as \u201climp, inane and could have been copied and pasted directly from their previous statements\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was utterly inappropriate given the gravity of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing\u2019s decision to impose the worst kind of draconian legislation without consulting the [Hong Kong] legislative council is a direct breach of the handover agreement. Given Britain\u2019s moral and legal duties as co-signatories of that settlement, the prime minister should be leading the way in calling it out and drawing together like-minded countries to coordinate a joint response.\u201d</p> <p>A subsequent UK, Canada and Australia statement issued on Friday was tougher in tone.</p> <p>Arguably, the chances of forcing China to rethink are dependent not on the UK government \u2013 which handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a 50-year form of semi-autonomy known as one country, two systems \u2013 but largely on the reactions of others, notably the markets, the people of Hong Kong and the US Senate.</p> <p>The UK, as former colonial power and joint signatory of the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration, could seek to persuade Chinese diplomats that the destruction of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms will destroy its economic value to China. It could also warn that the measures will provoke the kind of street protests that forced China to shelve a clampdown the last time this was attempted, in 2003. Months of new protests would only damage Beijing\u2019s image, already tarnished by allegations of a coronavirus cover-up and negligence.</p> <p>The UK Foreign Office could privately lobby the US to end Hong Kong\u2019s preferential trading status by declaring it is no longer an autonomous jurisdiction. Moves to this effect are already under way on a bipartisan basis in the US, and could become a focus of revived plans for a G7 leaders\u2019 meeting in Washington next month. The UK foreign affairs select committee chairman, Tom Tugenhadt, applauded the tough initial US response, saying: \u201cBeijing is killing the one country, two systems model followed by all President Xi\u2019s predecessors. He\u2019s turning his back on the past.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from that, the UK in extremis could offer sanctuary to as many as 150,000 British national overseas passport owners in Hong Kong \u2013 something the Home Office has resisted but which has support from the liberal internationalists on the Tory benches.</p> <p>But the government is leery of confronting China or enlisting in Donald Trump\u2019s trade war on the country. At both official and business level, cooperation between China and the UK remains intense. In recent weeks the chancellor, the health secretary and the deputy national security adviser have all spoken with the Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming.</p> <p>The golden era hailed by the former prime minister David Cameron may be over, but the UK does not favour Trump\u2019s economic decoupling. The UK is the number one European destination for Chinese foreign investment, which in the past five years has equalled the sum in the previous 30 years. China is also the UK\u2019s third largest market. Trade has slumped in recent months but may rebound.</p> <p>Indeed Liu, speaking to 1,500 CBI members in a webinar on Wednesday, portrayed the UK and China as \u201cthe flagbearers for free trade and globalisation beyond Covid-19\u201d, contrasting that alliance with Trump\u2019s protectionism and flouting of a rules-based order.</p> <p>In the view of Nicolas Veron, of the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel, it is almost as if the UK, weakened after Brexit, could become a site of competition or testing ground between China and the US as they each seek the UK\u2019s allegiance.</p> <p>The ambassador seemed confident that the UK government was not about to turn against his country. \u201cWe heard some politicians spreading this argument for \u2018decoupling\u2019, and some even go so far as to preaching the cold war rhetoric against China, and that is very harmful. I had webinars with the Chinese business community because they are very concerned. They do not know how pervasive, how massive and how influential this rhetoric is. I had good conversations with British secretaries and senior officials, and they told me these words did not represent the UK government position, and I believe that.\u201d</p> <p>He was speaking before the Chinese Communist party made its move on Hong Kong, but it was a reminder of how the UK today has more at stake than the civil rights of its former colony. It looks like the first true test of Boris Johnson\u2019s Global Britain.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government\u2019s approval of a large new gas-fired power plant has been ruled legal by the high court. A legal challenge was brought after ministers overruled climate change objections from planning authorities.</p> <p>The plant, which is being developed by Drax in North Yorkshire, would be the biggest gas power station in Europe, and could account for 75% of the UK\u2019s power sector emissions when fully operational, according to lawyers for ClientEarth, which brought the judicial review.</p> <p>The planning inspectorate recommended that ministers <a href=\"https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/EN010091/EN010091-001253-FINAL%20Drax%20Recommendation%20Report.pdf\">refuse permission for the 3.6GW gas plant</a> because it \u201cwould undermine the government\u2019s commitment, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008, to cut greenhouse emissions\u201d by having \u201csignificant adverse effects\u201d.</p> <p>It was the first big project rejected by planners because of the climate crisis. However, Andrea Leadsom, who was secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy at the time of the planning application, <a href=\"https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/EN010091/EN010091-001251-Drax%20Re-Powering%20Decision%20Letter%20of%204%20October%202019%20Signature%20Copy.pdf\">rejected the advice</a> and gave the go-ahead in October. </p> <p>The government\u2019s actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny at the moment as the UK will host a UN summit in early 2021. At the meeting, nations will need to dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/most-countries-climate-plans-totally-inadequate-experts\">avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures</a>. For the summit to be successful, experts say, the host nation needs to take a leadership role at home.</p> <p>Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at ClientEarth, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very dissatisfied by today\u2019s judgment, rejecting our arguments against the lawfulness of the government\u2019s decision and of its approach to assessing the project\u2019s carbon lock-in risk. We will consider an appeal.\u201d</p> <p>A Drax spokeswoman said: \u201cDrax power station plays a vital role in the UK\u2019s energy system, generating reliable, flexible electricity for millions of homes and businesses. The development of new high-efficiency gas power would support the UK\u2019s decarbonising energy system.\u201d</p> <p>She said the company\u2019s ambition was to remove, not add, carbon to the atmosphere by 2030. It would do this by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. The gas plant is capable of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future, the company says.</p> <p>John Sauven, the head of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cBuilding new gas-fired power stations when the UK has a net zero carbon target is hardly showing climate leadership. It also makes little economic sense. The costs are already higher than for renewable options like wind and solar. Investing money to increase pollution may still be legal but it\u2019s no longer defensible.\u201d</p> <p>ClientEarth argued that the combination of the project\u2019s large scale, level of emissions and long operating life made it a significant threat to the UK\u2019s carbon targets. The group has previously inflicted three defeats on ministers over their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/high-court-rules-uk-air-pollution-plans-unlawful\">failure to tackle air pollution</a>.</p> <p>The planning inspectorate concluded that wind and solar power would cut energy bills for consumers, while the proposed gas plant would not. \u201cBoth [Drax] and [National Grid] confirmed that it is the production of renewable plants that will deliver cheaper energy,\u201d it said.</p> <p>This year there have been a series of legal actions against polluting infrastructure projects on climate grounds. Last week the Good Law Project launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/18/legal-case-launched-over-uks-outdated-energy-policies\">legal action</a> over decade-old energy policies that it said the government was using to approve fossil fuel projects such as Drax\u2019s gas plant, even after ministers had pledged to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.</p> <p>In April, Transport Action Network <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/21/campaigners-take-legal-action-over-27bn-uk-road-building-scheme\">launched a legal challenge</a> to try to prevent billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money being spent on a huge road-building programme, which it said breached the UK\u2019s legal commitments to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution.</p> <p>In February the court of appeal ruled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-chang\">plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport were illegal</a> because ministers did not adequately take into account the government\u2019s climate commitments. This was the first major ruling in the world to be based on the 2015 <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\">Paris climate change agreement</a>. Heathrow is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.internationalairportreview.com/news/117096/heathrow-third-runway-challenge-court-ruling/\">overturn this decision in the supreme court</a>.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cWe welcome the high court\u2019s ruling issued today which supports the secretary of state\u2019s decision to grant consent for the Drax repowering project. We are going further and faster than any other major economy in taking action on climate change.</p> <p>\u201cAs we transition to net zero emissions in 2050, natural gas can provide a reliable source of energy while our world class renewables sector continues to grow, supported by record levels of investment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Bob Geldof doesn\u2019t do nostalgia.

  "<p><strong>A few years ago, I sought help for my </strong><strong>obsessive</strong><strong>-compulsive </strong><strong>disorder, which I could trace back to when I was</strong><strong> about</strong><strong> 14. I did CBT, which I found positive and helpful.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have a son who is now two years old, and </strong><strong>worry he has started to display OCD tendencies, and that I am passing it on. Though I am far better than I was, I struggle with managing some behaviours, including handwashing. </strong><strong>With the threat of Covid-19, this has ramped up,</strong><strong> and I have been </strong><strong>fastidious about the whole household washing hands. I try to do it in a \u201cnormal\u201d way, but sometimes feel I need to wash my hands more often. I wonder if my son picks up on the fact that I am more stressed when we wash his hands. He recently said: \u201cI need wash my hands again \u2013 I dirty\u201d and got upset when I tried to dry his hands with a towel, wanting a different one; just being touched by the towel I had offered provoked him to wash his hands again.</strong></p> <p><strong>We have just started toilet training, which has opened up a </strong><strong>new world of opportunities for my son to touch the toilet/potty, and I don\u2019t know how to be reasonable about what contact necessitates hand</strong><strong>washing. How can I keep my OCD under wraps and act as normally as possible around my son, to avoid him developing similar issues?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s great you are so thoughtful about your behaviour and how it may affect your son. I consulted psychotherapist Graham Music (<a href=\"http://childpsychotherapy.org.uk\" title=\"\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>) and the first thing we both wanted to know was: what happened to you aged 14? This felt like an important piece of information. My own OCD behaviours stemmed from my mother going to hospital when I was nine; they can still rear their heads <strong>\u2013</strong> but in a diluted form <strong>\u2013</strong> when I\u2019m anxious and am seeking to control my immediate environment because my usual coping mechanisms are overwhelmed. This is probably what\u2019s happening to you. In your treatment, I\u2019m sure you learned that OCD is a particular set of behaviours around intrusive thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Music said, \u201clet\u2019s think about your boy. There\u2019s something that happens around that age anyway; two-year-olds can be quite obsessional; that\u2019s normal. He\u2019s very likely imitating you, rather than starting to display true OCD behaviour which, generally speaking, manifests later.\u201d</p> <p>Your son may be picking up on your anxiety for everyone to keep their hands clean and wanting to do the right thing <strong>\u2013</strong> and nothing more. Of course you don\u2019t want it to turn into something else, but in these heightened times, and with your history, you may be picking up on something you recognise, and giving it more meaning than it deserves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/24/i-slept-with-my-best-friends-ex-now-im-terrified-of-confrontation\">I slept with my best friend's ex. Now I'm terrified of confrontation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing that may help, Music advised, is \u201cif you could find ways of relaxing a little, looking after your anxious self\u201d. What might those be at the moment? Maybe talking about it to your husband, who you say in your original letter is very supportive; or checking in with a trusted friend? If you can find ways to dissipate your angst, that will go some way to helping you to deal with your son in a more relaxed way; it will also help you eventually see your son\u2019s behaviour as the separate entity it is. (Is your husband worried?) Remember also that when we worry about things, it\u2019s very hard to step back, have an air of confidence and joke about them, all of which would be useful tools right now.</p> <p>Practically speaking, could you allow yourselves to wash your hands when you come in, and have certain protocols around toilet training and washing hands before eating, etc, but try to relax about touching things that are already in the house? Forgetting, if we can, about coronavirus for a moment, a sterile environment is not optimal for our immune system.</p> <p>If your son, for example, balks at using a towel he perceives to be dirty, you could gently model that \u201cMummy can use it\u201d, and if he asks to wash his hands when he doesn\u2019t need to, you can say, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to now.\u201d Remember the way you say things is probably more important than what you say; and also remember that he may need time to take this message on board.</p> <p>If you can, you might also want to consider both of you going outside into the garden, if you have one, and getting (safely) dirty. Slowly he will learn the difference between when to wash his hands and when to be more relaxed about it.</p> <p>\u2022 Send your problem to <a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

  "<p>As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all UK fertility clinics were required to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/thousands-lose-last-hope-of-having-a-baby-as-lockdown-closes-ivf-clinics\">close their doors</a> in early April. Fertility specialists had to inform their patients, some of whom had been on waiting lists for up to a year and others who were midway through drug cycles, that their treatments were going to be delayed or paused for an indefinite period of time. Shirin Khanjani, a consultant in reproductive medicine and surgery at University College Hospital, who underwent retraining to be redeployed to the NHS Covid-19 frontline, says these were extremely difficult conversations, and that the news was distressing for many of her patients. She explains: \u201cThey have waited for months, if not years, to have their treatment and this break in proceedings may have had a damaging impact on their emotional and physical wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Although the clinic closures were an understandable part of coronavirus restrictions, and a necessary measure to protect NHS capacity, they left many patients <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/time-precious-ivf-women-fear-lost-chance-to-have-children\">facing uncertain futures</a>. How long would men and women have to wait until they could have a chance to attempt conception? What would be the fate of those patients who found themselves \u201cageing out\u201d and missing their opportunity for much-needed NHS funding for their treatments? And how about those who were told their fertility was already on a steep decline, who now feared their odds of a successful outcome might irrevocably diminish as lockdown progressed into months?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fertility patients will require additional medical, emotional, and psychological care as part of their treatment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A stressful and rollercoaster experience at the best of times, the pandemic has exacerbated fertility patients\u2019 emotional turmoil, by amplifying the already overwhelming feelings of uncertainty, lack of control and isolation that are often associated with infertility and IVF treatment. As Philomena da Silva, a psychologist working in a fertility clinic told me; \u201cThe journey towards parenthood as a fertility patient can be a long, emotionally heightened and precarious experience in itself, and these feelings seemed to increase during the isolation period.\u201d Da Silva has continued to speak to patients over the telephone since lockdown began, and some fertility counsellors have been running online counselling and daily support sessions through Zoom or Facebook. But despite these offerings, for many men and women the unforeseen disruption to their fertility plans has been heartbreaking.</p> <p>As such, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority\u2019s (HFEA) recent announcement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/ivf-clinics-set-to-reopen-across-uk\">clinics could apply to reopen</a> as of 11 May was generally welcomed by both professionals and patients across the fertility industry. In order to reopen for treatment, clinics will be required to meet the <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/covid-19-and-fertility-treatment/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-professionals/\">revised </a><a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/covid-19-and-fertility-treatment/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-professionals/\">general </a><a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/covid-19-and-fertility-treatment/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-professionals/\">direction</a> and to reconfigure their services to ensure the safety of staff and patients, including compliance with government guidance on social distancing. However, the HFEA does not require clinics to reopen, and it is likely that some will take much longer than others to do so. As with much of the guidance around the transition out of lockdown, here too a great deal of confusion reigns and questions remain unanswered.</p> <p>What will the new requirements mean for the numbers of patients who can be treated at any one time, and how might this impact waiting lists? Will all clinics reopen in a matter of weeks or will some choose to take much longer, depending on local conditions and staff shortages? Can patients who were receiving treatments in clinics that remain closed transfer to alternative clinics? As yet, we simply don\u2019t know. Plus, part of the new requirements will be for patients to actively consent to having treatment while there is a risk that they could contract Covid-19 either during the treatment or if successful, during pregnancy, adding yet another layer of potential anxiety.</p> <p>Some patients are, of course, optimistic and eager to resume their treatment plans as soon as possible. Others are feeling worried or cautious, concerned about a huge range of issues, from how to safely negotiate travel to their soon-to-be-open clinic, to balancing newly emerging care responsibilities or remote working arrangements with the taxing demands of a treatment cycle. And then there are those who are facing additional financial burdens, having lost significant income or even their jobs during this pandemic, and who find themselves having to recalculate the considerable expense of fertility treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/coronavirus-mental-health-trauma\">Coronavirus affects mental health too \u2013 here's what we know | Anthony David</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sally (not her real name), who was about to start her third cycle of IVF with her husband just before the clinics closed, says the lockdown has been an \u201cincubator of frustrations\u201d for her. She describes her experience of \u201cstill\u201d being childless at 37 after six years of marriage as a source of loneliness and perceived exclusion. Over the past two months in particular, she says, it has created \u201ca growing chasm\u201d between her and the friends who\u2019ve variously complained about the impossibilities of home schooling young children and relished the creative activities they finally had time to enjoy as a family. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite painful to see all that on social media actually,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone is doing mum challenges and posting photos of their children, and it kind of rubs it in your face.\u201d</p> <p>For Sally, the reopening of clinics is good news; it gives her an opportunity to try to join the parenthood club she so much wants to become a part of. But it won\u2019t be treatment as usual, and she is yet to find out what new measures her clinic has put in place, or whether she might have to wait longer if they can only treat a smaller number of patients each month. There is, of course, also the question of what might happen to newly reopened clinics if there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">second peak</a> or an increase in the R number. One thing seems fairly clear: fertility patients will require additional medical, emotional and psychological care as part of their treatment during this pandemic, and clinics must build robust support systems as part of their reopening strategies.</p> <p>\u2022 Zeynep Gurtin is the lead researcher on a new research project organised by the Institute for Women\u2019s Health at UCL exploring the impact of clinic closures and the coronavirus pandemic on fertility patients\u2019 lives, relationships and feelings. <a href=\"https://ifwh.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_036pawRXJspDsMZ\">Click here</a> to learn more about this project or to take part in the anonymous online questionnaire</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>I suspect a fair number of you buy your wine from a supermarket on the basis that it\u2019s bound to be cheaper there.

Or, if you really want a wine box \u2013 or rather a giant wine tube \u2013 go for the <strong>Terre de Faiano</strong> in today\u2019s panel (below), which is only a pound more expensive and much better quality.</p> <p>If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s been supporting local food producers or takeaways from your favourite restaurant, you might want to buy at least some of your wine from indies, too, especially suppliers and importers who service the currently non-existent restaurant trade. Many pubs and restaurants are positively encouraging customers to use their suppliers to keep them going. Others, such as <a href=\"http://foxandhounds-hunsdon.co.uk/\">The Fox </a><a href=\"http://foxandhounds-hunsdon.co.uk/\">&amp; Hounds</a> in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, are selling wines direct themselves, alongside pasta sauces and pies.</p> <p>Granted, you won\u2019t find much \u2013 if anything \u2013 for less than \u00a36 at an indy, but if you\u2019re prepared to spend between \u00a37 and \u00a310 a bottle, you\u2019ll certainly get a more interesting wine than you would from a supermarket. And you can get it delivered to your door, rather than having to queue for an hour to get in, social distance down the wine aisles or lurk over your computer late at night in the hope of finding a delivery slot.</p> <h2>Five wines that are worth what you\u2019ll pay for them</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"32 pixel spacer with thin rule allows space for the wine bottle to line up with the text and to allow room for the next entry below.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2351f27e0fc80da9a97654f107872c27edf8a853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2351f27e0fc80da9a97654f107872c27edf8a853/0_0_1417_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain Nivei Variedades Autoctonas Rioja 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Nivei Rioja Blanco 2018</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.lidl.co.uk/en/p/white-wine/nivei-rioja-blanco/p30834\">\u00a35.99, Lidl</a>, 13%.</p> <p>Fresh, easy-drinking blend of sauvignon blanc, verdejo, tempranillo blanco, viura and three other grape varieties, which makes it more nuanced than straight sauvignon blanc.

Or are they theatres, cinemas, spoken-word events and the whole cornucopia of the cultural world? They are basically everything interesting that happens externally, without which conversation pings off the walls, like a rat that has been given ecstasy for research purposes. Control rods are the couple you went out for a pizza with, where one ordered a vegetarian one and the other ordered chorizo, only when the pizzas arrived, the chorizo was more appetising and the veggie-orderer just swiped it, and you happily kill an hour trying to place that on the spectrum of good and evil.</p> <p>Or the guy with one leg, who has a brandy every night outside a Portuguese cafe, and always looks incredibly happy, as if life has treated him really well. He\u2019s a control rod. A film that wasn\u2019t as good as everyone else said it was \u2013 sure, you can talk about TV if you like, or books, but part of the interest was always at the meta-level, beyond the artefact itself. What were the people who went to it trying to say about themselves, and what did it mean that they reacted to it the way they did?</p> <p>A minuscule breach of etiquette on a bus, a homeless guy who asks your name and says his sister is also called Zoe, and then you ask his name, and it turns out to be the same as your dad\u2019s (Mark). These are the control rods of relationship fusion (or fission).</p> <p>Friendships are suffering the same vacuum right now: I don\u2019t think I have ever asked so many people, so often, how they feel about things. How are you feeling about lockdown? How are you feeling about your family? Are you worried about your parents? How are you feeling about your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/13/sourdough-is-silicon-valleys-latest-craze-could-i-beat-the-coders-and-bake-the-perfect-loaf\">sourdough</a>? How are you feeling about the job that you\u2019ve been made redundant from/furloughed from/realised wasn\u2019t a real job after having attempted to do it from home? How are you feeling about your unprecedented and entirely unnecessary levels of fitness? We never used to talk about feelings; we used to talk about weird stuff that had happened.</p> <p>I have been reading so much complicated theorising about why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/the-zoom-boom-how-video-calling-became-a-blessing-and-a-curse\">Zoom is tiring</a>. It\u2019s some combination of tech (the refresh rate of the video feed leaves all the work for your brain to do to make sense of an often senseless image) and psyche (the dissonance between being with the person, and yet not with the person, heaps yet more unwanted work upon your poor noggin). I have something to add to this analysis: it\u2019s exhausting, trying to do intimacy from a standing start. I don\u2019t want to talk about how I feel, I want to bitch about other people. (I make an honourable exception for one friend: she tells me what she has bought online, and asks whether she should send it back. Currently, she has a wetsuit that is too small and two leftwing tea towels. I told her to keep all these items. And now, look, I am bitching about her, so we\u2019re both happy.)</p> <p>Other people have found solace in the natural world. For me, this lacks the element of surprise. Ah, look; a heron, in our garden, trying to eat fish out of the pond. Oh my; a fox, also in the garden, trying to eat the rabbit. There are two cats fighting in a tree. When are you going to reverse my expectation, animals? Don\u2019t get me started on plants.</p> <p>The children can still suck an argument out of their thumbs. Through two floors, I could hear the 10-year-old and one of the 12-year-olds fighting about whether dog years were a thing. \u201cThere is no dog sun,\u201d said TJ, \u201cso there is no such thing as a dog year.\u201d H hit back. \u201cIf a 12-year-old died, that would be a tragedy. If you died, today, everybody \u2013 not me, I\u2019d be pleased \u2013 everybody else would be devastated. It\u2019s not sad when a 12-year-old dog dies because that dog is actually [unspeakably long pause \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what she hasn\u2019t been doing, which is times tables] 84.\u201d</p> <p>It is so perfect, I can hardly breathe; nobody can win, so the argument will never end. It is as if they have discovered perpetual motion. If they could only do it without hitting each other, it would be like watching an executive toy.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

One of the world\u2019s richest countries, they said, was bungling its response.</p> \n<p>But today, Japan can make a strong case for being another coronavirus success story, albeit one that has failed to resonate globally in the same way as those in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p> \n<p>So far, Japan \u2013 a country of 126 million people with one of the biggest elderly populations in the world \u2013 has confirmed 16,433 infections and 784 deaths, out of a global death toll of more than 300,000 people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Japan\" data-alt=\"Japan deaths\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Japan\">Japan deaths</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In Tokyo, where almost 14 million people live, new cases have remained below 40 for more than a fortnight, with just five cases reported on two consecutive days this week.

While Japan hesitated before imposing restrictions on overseas visitors, it was quick to recognise the dangers of mass gatherings.</p> \n<p>Museums, theatres, theme parks and other attractions have been closed for months. Japan\u2019s professional football league suspended matches three weeks before 150,000 people attended the four-day Cheltenham horse racing festival in Britain.</p> \n<p>Rugby and baseball leagues followed suit, delaying the start of their seasons, while sumo authorities decided to hold the recent spring tournament without spectators for the first time in the sport\u2019s history.

  "<p>Nestled in the corner of Brockwell Park, <a href=\"https://c20society.org.uk/building-of-the-month/cressingham-gardens-estate-lambeth\">Cressingham Gardens</a> housing estate feels like an extension of the rolling municipal greenery. The low-rise fingers of housing weave their way around clusters of mature trees, framing pedestrian paths flanked by lush patio gardens. Slightly higher blocks to the west mask noise from the main road, creating an oasis of calm where a village green faces a community hall rotunda, designed with \u201cfairground overtones of merry-go-rounds and bandstands\u201d, as a 1979 issue of the Architectural Review put it.<br><br>Cressingham Gardens is, <a href=\"https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/cressingham-gardens-lambeth/\">in the words of council housing expert John Boughton</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/19/municipal-dreams-john-boughton-review\">Municipal Dreams</a>, \u201cone of the finest council estates in the country\u201d. The London scheme was designed in the late 1960s by a team of Lambeth Council architects led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jan/24/guardianobituaries\">Ted Hollamby</a>, a pioneer of high-density low-rise housing who championed a move away from tower blocks. </p> <p>Hollamby wanted his developments \u201cto create a sense of smallness inside the bigness\u201d of the city, and to have \u201cthe kind of atmosphere in which people did not feel all herded together\u201d. His philosophy is embodied in the layout of Cressingham Gardens, with its village scale and neighbourly feel, encouraged by front doors facing each other and ample space for children to play in the patchwork of lanes and wooded areas, a particular boon in these times of being trapped at home.<br><br>Despite all this, Lambeth Council wants to knock the estate down.</p> <p>For the last eight years, since the local authority declared its intention to bulldoze the area, the residents have been living on the edge, the future of their homes and community ties uncertain. The council insists that the buildings are beyond repair, and that by redeveloping the land they can <a href=\"https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=30860\">create an additional 158 homes</a> (fewer than half of which would be \u201caffordable\u201d). The residents strongly beg to differ. The dilapidated homes can be easily repaired, they say, while a more sensitive plan could see the addition of 33 homes built for social rents, retaining the character of the neighbourhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b8c5c5ce1c8341b7f8e616225d5fe64b128695c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8c5c5ce1c8341b7f8e616225d5fe64b128695c/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The power of self-organising \u2026 Cressingham Gardens estate during Lambeth Open House weekend, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The power of self-organising \u2026 Cressingham Gardens estate during Lambeth Open House weekend, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since 2012, the community has used every possible tool to battle the council\u2019s plans. They have leafleted, demonstrated, drawn up <a href=\"http://cressinghampeoplesplan.org.uk/\">a fully costed People\u2019s Plan</a>, twice brought the council to judicial review, attempted to have the buildings listed, successfully applied for both the ownership and management of the homes to be transferred to the community, and registered assets of community value under the Localism Act. Their campaign has been extraordinarily successful \u2013 yet the council still plans to press ahead with demolition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like dealing with jelly,\u201d says Tom Keene, who has lived on the estate since 2006 and is an active member of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/savecressingham?lang=en-gb\">Save Cressingham Gardens campaign</a>. \u201cIt takes a huge effort to extract any accurate information from the council. They keep us in the dark. It\u2019s a Kafkaesque nightmare trying to find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br><br>The residents\u2019 story is one of several told in a new free-to-download book, <a href=\"https://www.uclpress.co.uk/products/125696\">Community-Led Regeneration</a>, by Pablo Sendra and Daniel Fitzpatrick, a pair of radical academics at University College London\u2019s department of planning. Described as a \u201ctoolkit for residents and planners\u201d, this is no dry theoretical survey, but a practical guide for the thousands of people currently facing uncertainty about the future of their homes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2785dad56fec34753ad12d0c0470f958b99900d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2785dad56fec34753ad12d0c0470f958b99900d5/0_161_5123_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbourly feel \u2026 kids play football at Cressingham Gardens housing estate, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbourly feel \u2026 kids play football at Cressingham Gardens housing estate, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Mellish/In Pictures via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaign group <a href=\"https://justspace.org.uk/\">Just Space</a> estimates that there are at least 60 council estates currently under threat of demolition in London alone, on top of 160 estates that have already been demolished since 1997 \u2013 equating, they say, to the displacement of 130,000 people. Despite the widespread negative publicity around a number of recent high-profile regeneration schemes that have become synonymous with social cleansing \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">Heygate Estate</a> in Southwark to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/18/-sp-truth-about-gentrification-how-woodberry-down-became-woodberry-park\">Woodberry Down</a> in Hackney \u2013 the threat of demolition and displacement remains very much alive across the capital and beyond.</p> <p>\u201cThere is now more awareness of the importance of involving the community in decisions about the future of estates,\u201d says Sendra, \u201cbut demolition is still taken as the starting point. The <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/improving-quality/estate-regeneration\">mayor\u2019s guidance</a> is directed at achieving the councils and developers\u2019 goals, rather than the interests of the existing communities.\u201d<br><br>In 2018, following the backlash against a number of regeneration schemes, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, introduced a new requirement for every estate regeneration project involving demolition of social homes: there would have to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/18/sadiq-khan-to-cut-cash-for-housing-schemes-opposed-by-residents\">ballot of residents</a> before receiving City Hall funding. But, as many have pointed out, the ballots are open to manipulation and can be easily framed to achieve the desired outcome. Sendra is currently working with a community in Brent where, he says, the council is only presenting the residents with one option. \u201cSo far, most ballots follow the template, \u2018Do you agree with regeneration? If so, you get a nice new home. If not, you get nothing.\u2019 Communities are not being given the full picture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85211983195bd90dcdb208c2cfea22059bf6b4d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85211983195bd90dcdb208c2cfea22059bf6b4d3/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demolition and displacement \u2026 a boy walks through the condemned Heygate Estate in London in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demolition and displacement \u2026 a boy walks through the condemned Heygate Estate in London in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He hopes some of the examples in the book will provide residents with the ammunition they need to fight back. The case studies range from the lengthy battle to realise the groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.wech.co.uk/\">Walterton and Elgin Community Homes</a> project in Westminster, to the fiery direct action of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/05/focus-e15-mums-fight-for-right-to-home\">Focus E15 campaign</a> in Newham, to the collaborative strategies of the <a href=\"http://www.peach-e16.org.uk/\">People\u2019s Empowerment Alliance for Custom House</a>. In each case, the key obstacles, tools and lessons are drawn out, painting a picture of how communities can triumph against the odds when they pull together.</p> <p>\u201cThe strategies are all focused on challenging the linearity of the council-led regeneration processes,\u201d says Fitzpatrick, \u201cand putting spanners in the cogs of their logic to slow it down. These tools can also help to organise the community towards a common goal.\u201d</p> <p>Linda Sanders, of the <a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/\">West Ken and Gibbs Green estates campaign</a> in Hammersmith and Fulham, says she and her neighbours have spent the last decade fighting attempts to bulldoze their homes, which were in the firing line of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/jun/25/earls-court-how-to-do-regeneration-wrong\">Capco\u2019s gargantuan Earl\u2019s Court redevelopment</a>.<br><br>\u201cWe know that sticking together has been imperative,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned to share ideas from other campaigns and just get stuck in.\u201d She says their tactics have ranged from holding a Victorian dressing-up day and parading outside the local pub when it was threatened with closure, to \u201cvisiting the developer\u2019s own backyard\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5765aef4d476930d09004c575409383526445a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5765aef4d476930d09004c575409383526445a/0_145_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tenants and supporters marched from Cressingham Gardens to Lambeth Town Hall in Brixton in 2017 to demand a ballot on the planned redevelopment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tenants and supporters marched from Cressingham Gardens to Lambeth Town Hall in Brixton in 2017 to demand a ballot on the planned redevelopment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rowe/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their carnivalesque direct actions have been combined with the formal tools of setting up a <a href=\"http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/\">Community Land Trust</a> and preparing their own <a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/the-peoples-plan/\">People\u2019s Plan</a> for up to 300 new homes, without demolishing any of the existing housing, as well as launching a judicial review and applying for the right to transfer. All of which helped to grind the developer\u2019s momentum to a halt and encourage the newly Labour-led council to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/08/residents-of-london-peoples-estates-hail-council-move-against-developer\">demand the estate be handed back to the local authority</a>. As Sanders puts it: \u201cAfter all these delays, selling luxury flats became harder to do.\u201d</p> <p>What comes across in all of the stories is the sheer amount of effort and willpower required to keep these campaigns going for so many years, as well as the uphill struggle to find the required expertise to challenge the developmental juggernauts. \u201cYou\u2019re hit with this tsunami of disciplines that you\u2019ve got to get your head around very quickly,\u201d says Keene. \u201cI considered myself reasonably politically active, but I didn\u2019t understand how a local authority worked, or housing management, or the law, or the planning process.\u201d</p> <p>He has since drawn up a <a href=\"http://www.db-estate.co.uk/08.RegenCheatSheet/00.CheatSheet.html\">\u201cRegen cheat sheet\u201d</a>, as a quick guide to help others in his position get their heads around the fiendish complexities of estate regeneration.<br><br>The book adds to this kind of work, bringing activists together to share their experiences and build a collective body of knowledge that will be so important for future campaigns. Its release is timely: the coronavirus pandemic has shown just how powerful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">community self-organising, mutual aid and the solidarity of local support networks can be</a>. By compiling such a broad (if London-centric) range of case studies, Sendra and Fitzpatrick have performed a vital public service, helping to ensure that any communities facing top-down regeneration in future know that they are not alone \u2013 and that it is eminently possible to hold off the bulldozers.

  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Just when you think things can\u2019t get much more surreal, we hear that Donald Trump has been dosing himself up with the anti-malarial drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">hydroxychloroquine</a> in efforts to ward off the coronavirus that he doesn\u2019t yet have. \u201cI\u2019m taking it for about a week and a half now and I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still here,\u201d he told reporters during a White House briefing. Given that hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine, is completely unproven as a treatment for Covid-19 and can have dangerous side-effects, you can only wonder about the president\u2019s state of mind. And that of his medical team who are happily prescribing him a drug that is far more likely to do him harm than good. Next he\u2019ll be hooking himself up on a ventilator at night. I thought my hypochondria was bad \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times over the past 10 weeks when I\u2019ve woken up with a slight headache or the merest hint of a sore throat and imagined I had the virus \u2013 but it\u2019s never occurred to me to start dosing myself up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/remdesivir-the-antiviral-drug-is-being-touted-as-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment-but-will-it-work\">remdesivir</a>. It would be like me marching into the doctor\u2019s and demanding to be put on a course of chemotherapy on the off chance that I had cancer. Or having elective surgery to remove my appendix to ensure that I don\u2019t get peritonitis.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Two weeks back my daughter was tidying her garden in Minneapolis when she came across a small burrow of tiny, furless animals, with their eyes shut, that were clearly no more than a day or so old. She sent me a picture and we wondered if they might be moles, before someone pointed out they were above ground, had large ears and were obviously rabbits. Anna even got round to setting up a webcam so she could check up on them at all times, and we got used to watching the mother returning from time to time to feed them and scrape her fur to keep them warm. At a time when so much else in the world seemed so bleak, they came to represent something new and hopeful. A week or so ago, we got the call that we had been dreading. The webcam had picked up a neighbour\u2019s cat entering the burrow. When Anna went out to check up on them, there was no sign of the bunnies. Then today, Anna was looking out of her kitchen window and spotted a small rabbit at the bottom of her garden. It was almost certainly from a different burrow, but I would like to believe it was one that had escaped the carnage and come back to let us know that just occasionally the natural world can provide a happy ending.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson sold himself to many voters at the last election as the great communicator: the leader who could unite a divided country and get Brexit done. So it\u2019s been a surprise to find just how invisible he\u2019s been since recovering from the coronavirus. He\u2019s given one confusing TV statement \u2013 with no questions allowed \u2013 and sent out junior cabinet ministers in his place at the Downing Street press conference. One explanation for his absenteeism over the last week has been that he was so wounded by his mauling from Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions that he had spent the last seven days preparing for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/this-time-boris-is-better-prepared-but-the-qc-still-gets-under-his-skin-pmqs-john-crace\">this week\u2019s encounter</a>. If so, it only partially paid off: Boris was much more of his usual aggressive, unpleasant self, but the Labour leader still came out comfortably ahead on points. Not least because Boris insisted that all those overseas nationals who were working on low salaries in the NHS would have to pay a visa surcharge of \u00a3624 to access health services if they got ill while doing their jobs of trying to keep the rest of us alive. It was so obviously unjust and immoral that Boris was shamed into doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">massive U-turn</a> the following day. There was no screeching reversal, however, on him forcing through a vote preventing MPs from accessing Commons proceedings remotely at a time when the official government policy is still for people to work from home if they possibly can. When recess ends in 10 days\u2019 time, the only MPs able to join in the debate will be the 50 or so allowed in under the physical distancing guidelines. So MPs from constituencies remote from London will be in effect disenfranchised. Some would call it a scandal. Boris calls it taking back control.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>We need to talk about Kevin. Again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/15/zoom-dog-groom-how-stay-alert-covid-19-boris-johnson\">Last week</a> I wrote about my friend Kevin\u2019s experience of coronavirus testing as performance art. What neither of us had realised was that he was only in the first act of the play. Two weeks to the day after his initial test, for which he was never able to get the results, he was offered a second test. On Monday this week he went off to have that second test. The following day a result of \u201cunclear\u201d arrived back, so a further test was required. However, what was also unclear was whether the result was from the first or second test. Kevin rang the ironically named helpdesk which, as ever, had no information and put him on hold for several minutes. After a discussion with all of his colleagues, the adviser reported back that they had unanimously concluded that the result couldn\u2019t have come from the second test as they had never known of an instance when the system had been that efficient. So on the basis of their absolute certainty of the incompetence of the system, they say he should ring back next Monday to find out if the series is to be extended to a third test. And the government wonders why the whole country doesn\u2019t share its excitement when it announces a new testing programme.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve watched more of the Downing Street press briefings than I care to remember and will have to endure many more before the pandemic is over. Though sadly I will miss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/priti-patel-to-outline-coronavirus-quarantine-plan-for-travellers-to-uk\">Priti Patel\u2019s outing</a> this evening as the home secretary is such a liability she is only allowed out in public when no sketch writers are writing for the following day. Already though, there are signs that the government is regretting its decision to give the country daily updates, not least because more often than not the minister taking the press conference \u2013 Boris has long since decided these are too much like hard work and can\u2019t be bothered to turn up \u2013 has nothing new to announce. So on Thursday we were treated to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/matt-hancock-is-not-ok-someone-really-ought-to-furlough-him\">Matt Hancock</a> running through the same slides that have been used in every other briefing for the past two weeks, before being forced to admit that the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test, track and trace app that he had insisted only a month or so ago would be a game-changer in easing lockdown restrictions wasn\u2019t going to be ready in time. And, in any case, it wasn\u2019t such a big deal as all that and had only ever been intended to be an adjunct to human track and trace. Most of us would just settle for solutions that were good enough to make a difference. Still, in these days of existential despair, just occasionally something remarkable does happen. I had been checking on the status of my exercise bike I had ordered from Amazon and had been informed that the one I had ordered was now indefinitely unavailable, so I had mentally prepared myself for the likelihood it would never appear. Then, out of the blue, I got an email saying it would arrive on 3 June. Even more remarkably, it turned up two weeks early and was comparatively simple to assemble. It has been the best \u00a3229 I have spent for a long time. Nearly an hour free from anxiety about the coronavirus and thoughts of missing my family and friends.

It increases uncertainty at a time when that is the last thing we need.\u201d</p> <p>He says Portsmouth did not switch any offers, but a minority of other institutions saw the financial risks ahead and decided to act quickly. He adds that the sector generally saw this as bad practice, because by siphoning off students at a time of crisis they could potentially sink their competitors.</p> <p>Smita Jamdar, head of education at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, who has been advising universities on the new OfS powers, says institutions should be extremely cautious about withdrawing any offers, which could lead to accusations of having misled students. \u201cStudents may feel they are having something valuable taken away from them. Institutions need to think carefully about the legal rights of the students and the reputational impact of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Jamdar is concerned that the OfS has not defined which sorts of offers it wants to stamp out.

This is a sector trying to react to a changed environment, that genuinely wants its students to succeed.\u201d Many in the sector argue that there is no real evidence that unconditional offers are hurting students.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/loss-of-international-student-fees-could-decimate-uk-research\">Loss of international student fees could decimate UK research</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vice-chancellors are also concerned that the government is seeking to control far more than admissions.

University chiefs say any number of issues the government doesn\u2019t like could fall into this definition.</p> <p>Jamdar says this is \u201capparent opportunism. The sector has asked for support and the government has seen it as the chance not only to ensure stability in recruitment, but also to establish a basis to intervene in a much broader and quite onerous way. I feel deeply uncomfortable about it.\u201d</p> <p>Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, agrees. \u201cThis is a time of crisis, but we are still in a democracy. These powers are deliberately intended to circumvent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/oct/18/higher-education-research-bill-needs-amended\">Higher Education Act of 2017</a>, which enshrined universities\u2019 autonomy in law.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to supporting our world-class universities and students through this challenging time.

  "<p>Over the last few weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/bachelor-and-brignall-consumer-champions\">Guardian Money has highlighted many excuses</a> made by the travel industry, particularly airlines, when refusing refunds for Covid-19-related cancellations. One reader even wrote in about a battle for a refund from a hotel on a Scottish island to which non-residents cannot now take ferries.</p> <p>There will doubtless be many cases taken on the consequences of the virus but the present law is quite simple. Once a contract becomes impossible to perform, due to the fault of neither party, it is treated as frustrated, meaning neither party is bound and any advance payments, including deposits, have to be refunded.</p> <p>Impossibility has a broad meaning but includes the situation where performance would become illegal. This was decreed in 1917, where the building of a reservoir was halted by government wartime regulations. Perhaps not surprisingly, the builders were not liable for their failure to complete.</p> <p>Travel being banned under the hastily passed <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents/enacted/data.htm\">Coronavirus Act</a>, means the vast majority of UK holiday accommodation bookings cannot be performed legally even if the accommodation remains physically available. The non-availability of ferries or flights will make the situation even clearer in some cases.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Frustration does not just depend on illegality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Airlines cannot in such circumstances be made to pay compensation under EU regulation 261 or otherwise \u2013 but they cannot retain fares for flights that do not exist or insist on passengers rebooking. Some are making that the easiest option. EasyJet, although accepting its obligation to make refunds, requires passengers to phone its virtually unobtainable customer services department or use a well hidden and only recently added form on its website which will require customers to wait for the \u201cduration of the summer\u201d, while allowing those who want to rebook to do so very simply online.</p> <p>Frustration does not just depend on illegality. With events being cancelled some months into the future, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/01/edinburghs-five-festivals-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus\">August\u2019s Edinburgh festival</a>, hoteliers may hope that travel to the venue will no longer be against the law then and refuse cancellations. However, cases arising out of the postponement of Edward VII\u2019s coronation in 1902 may oblige them to refund deposits. A Mr Henry who had booked rooms to watch it was entitled to his money back, although it would have been possible for him to occupy the rooms anyway. So long as the parties know what the purpose of the stay is, the cancellation of the event makes the contract impossible to perform as envisaged, as is likely to be the case where hotels market themselves and raise prices for a specific event.</p> <p>Where the accommodation is abroad, like that of one reader who had been refused a refund even after a Spanish hotel closed completely, the contract may be subject to a foreign law. However, EU-wide consumer protection laws would mean a refund was due. In the US, where citing Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code may be helpful and in most English-speaking countries the same basic law of frustration applies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/trust-in-airlines-and-holiday-firms-plummets-says-which-coronavirus\">Trust in airlines and holiday firms plummets, says Which?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some contracts contain clauses that specify what will happen in the event of force majeure. This is not defined in English law but according to the Dutch airline KLM\u2019s conditions means \u201cextraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances that are beyond the control of the party invoking it and which could not have been avoided despite all the care and attention exercised\u201d. UK airlines do not generally include such a condition.</p> <p>EasyJet\u2019s obstruction of claims by customers for refunds, which they are clearly legally entitled to, is particularly galling. It paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/mar/24/the-uk-airline-industry-doesnt-need-treasury-bailouts\">a \u00a3174m dividend to shareholders</a> on 19 March, 34% of which went to its founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou. The dividend was declared, giving shareholders a legal entitlement, on 27 February. By then there had been 288,000 coronavirus cases and 3,800 deaths worldwide.

In 2015 Theresa May, who was then the home secretary, took the UK into the database, securing an unprecedented special deal for a country outside the EU passport-free travel zone. During the EU referendum campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/europol-chief-says-brexit-would-harm-uk-crime-fighting\">experts warned Brexit imperilled access to the database</a> and would damage the UK\u2019s ability to fight terrorism and crime.</p> <p>British police and border guards are the third heaviest users of the database, making 571m searches in 2019 (a figure that includes automated bulk data sweeps) to look for wanted people or stolen goods.

The EU offer, it argues, would add nothing to the UK\u2019s law enforcement capability.</p> <p>EU negotiators want to maintain police data sharing with the UK, but say their hands are tied because of case law from the European court of justice (ECJ) that limits what can be offered to an outsider.</p> <p>European diplomats also cite political factors such the UK\u2019s refusal to countenance a role for the ECJ and opposition to any reference to the European court of human rights (ECHR) in the EU-UK treaty.</p> <p>Both institutions are seen by European governments as providing crucial safeguards over the transfer of data or \u2013 in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/brexit-could-bring-back-bad-old-days-of-costa-del-warns-mep\">the European arrest warrant </a>\u2013 people.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted of course to have an exchange of data, but it cannot be SIS as such,\u201d an EU diplomat said, citing the absence of guarantees on the ECJ and ECHR.</p> <p>The Brexit clash comes after a prominent MEP accused the UK government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/uk-accused-of-behaving-like-cowboys-over-eu-database-copying\">\u201cbehaving like cowboys\u201d</a> earlier this year, after a leaked EU report concluded that British authorities had illegally copied SIS II data.</p> <p>The report fuelled complaints that the UK wants the benefits of EU systems without offering reciprocal aid \u2013 a charge strongly rejected by the government.

They have evolved over time in a warm bath of fringe conspiracy groups that have spent decades fighting against the teaching of evolution, among other social evils. One of those groups was Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum, which <a href=\"https://ncse.ngo/phyllis-schlafly-dies\">worked</a> to push evolution out of the classroom, almost as doggedly as <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/series/mrs-america-96f330fe-878d-412e-949f-fd8b69b3adf2?\">Mrs America</a> fought against women\u2019s rights and the Equal Rights Amendment.</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise to find her son Andrew <a href=\"https://aapsonline.org/about-aaps/board-of-directors/\">named</a> as general counsel to the AAPS.

The biggest one, naturally, is the supposed science about the climate crisis. But if you\u2019re at all confused, the Birchers\u2019 website cites \u201cconspiracy\u201d as the first thing that bothers them about science.</p> <p>\u201cBy definition, a conspiracy is when two or more people work in secret for evil purposes. The John Birch Society believes this definition fits a number of groups working against the independence of the United States,\u201d its <a href=\"https://www.jbs.org/jbs-other-issues/\">website</a> declares about science. \u201cExtensive study has shown us that history is rarely accidental.\u201d</p> <p>Extensive studies are everywhere if you know where to look. It was no accident of history that Barack Obama recently tried to hypnotize young Americans by warning that the fools who ignored the pandemic were also ignoring the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1245007713387544576?s=20\">tweeted</a>. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any more consequences of climate denial.\u201d</p> <p>His successor is immune to this kind of mind control known as logic, especially when it comes to testing for Covid-19. For Trump, the number of tests is both a remarkable triumph \u2013 the biggest in the world \u2013 and also a remarkable admission of failure. You see, if you test more, you find more sickness. It\u2019s like a scientific plot conspiring against him, much like the negative hydroxy study that he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/19/trump-describes-medical-researchers-trump-enemies-because-he-doesnt-like-their-results/\">called</a> \u201ca Trump-enemy statement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBy doing testing, you\u2019re finding people,\u201d he explained to a couple of governors and reporters on Wednesday, before bragging again that the US was testing more people than Germany and South Korea. \u201cSo we\u2019re way ahead of everybody. But when you do that, you have more cases. So a lot of times, the fake news media will say, \u2018You know, there are a lot of cases in the United States.\u2019 Well, if we didn\u2019t do testing at a level that nobody has ever dreamt possible, you wouldn\u2019t have very many cases.\u201d</p> <p>This was a genius strategy, first perfected by a teenager hiding under his bed covers to avoid homework. But then one of those fake news reporters asked Trump about a per capita comparison with countries like Germany and South Korea.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, when you say \u2018per capita\u2019 there\u2019s many per capitas,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, per capita relative to what?

The FDA has approved lots of medications like chemotherapy drugs that will actually kill you if you self-prescribe. So maybe the scientists are wrong about everything.</p> <p>America\u2019s founding fathers knew we\u2019d end up in this place. \u201cFacts are stubborn things,\u201d John Adams declared in his successful defense of the hated British soldiers responsible for the Boston massacre. \u201cWhatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence,\u201d he said 250 years ago.</p> <p>Then again, Adams thought that democracy was doomed because of the power of the plebeian mob. \u201cRemember Democracy never lasts long,\u201d he <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6371\">wrote</a>. \u201cIt soon wastes exhausts and murders itself.

There are no more or fewer customers than there ever were; the chat about the lateness of the spring is a variant on other years, when spring came unusually early. The same gorgeously flowering trees are in bloom; drivers know to slow down to avoid the chickens flocking over the road, and families with kids pull over to look at the horses.

And on weekends, when we\u2019ve driven past, it\u2019s been alarmingly crowded.</p> <p> With hundreds of thousands dying, every experience seems saturated with mortality and privilege. Very little seems important enough in the face of so much suffering and death.

We put on masks and gloves.

  "<p>It would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 it\u2019s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life. That\u2019s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was \u201cthrowing everything at it\u201d.</p> <p>But while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed \u2013 Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research \u2013 ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days.</p> <p>This is why.</p> <h2><strong>Why might a vaccine fail?</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this week, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure we will get a vaccine.\u201d</p> <p>But he was right to be circumspect.</p> <p>Vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show.</p> <p>More than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/first-fda-approved-vaccine-prevention-dengue-disease-endemic-regions\">approved only last year</a>, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years.</p> <p>Scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both. But none have been licensed, partly because Sars fizzled out and Mers is regional to the Middle East. The lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2, but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus.</p> <p>A chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger long-lasting immunity. About a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses, but the immune response fades so rapidly that people <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2170159/\">can become reinfected</a> the next year.</p> <p>Researchers at Oxford University recently analysed blood from recovered Covid-19 patients and found that levels of IgG antibodies \u2013 those responsible for longer-lasting immunity \u2013 rose steeply in the first month of infection but then <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066407v2\">began to fall again</a>.</p> <p>Last week, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that most people who recovered from Covid-19 without going into hospital <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.092619v1\">did not make many killer antibodies</a> against the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what is particularly challenging,\u201d says Stanley Perlman, a veteran coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa. \u201cIf the natural infection doesn\u2019t give you that much immunity except when it\u2019s a severe infection, what will a vaccine do? It could be better, but we don\u2019t know.\u201d If a vaccine only protects for a year, the virus will be with us for some time.</p> <p>The genetic stability of the virus matters too. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year. The rapid evolution of HIV is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease.</p> <p>So far, the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus seems fairly stable, but it is acquiring mutations, as all viruses do. Some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus\u2019s protein \u201cspikes\u201d which are the basis of most vaccines. If the spike protein mutates too much, the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection.</p> <p>Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped identify some of the virus\u2019s mutations, called them \u201can early warning\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Another challenge: making any vaccine safe</strong></h2> <p>In the rush to develop a vaccine \u2013 there are now more than 100 in development \u2013 safety must remain a priority. Unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill, the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people.</p> <p>This means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous side-effects. During the search for a Sars vaccine in 2004, scientists found that one candidate <a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672\">caused hepatitis</a> in ferrets. Another serious concern is \u201cantibody-induced enhancement\u201d where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse. The effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478436/\">Sars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574614/\">Mers</a>.</p> <p>John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the difficulties, the specific difficulties, that every vaccine will give you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>We should </strong><strong>\u2018end up with something</strong><strong>\u2019 \u2026 but what does that mean?</strong></h2> <p>When the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told a No 10 press briefing that a vaccine was \u201cby no means guaranteed\u201d, his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed, but added: \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something.\u201d Many scientists share that view.</p> <p>In all likelihood, a coronavirus vaccine will not be 100% effective.</p> <p>Those in development draw on at least eight different approaches, from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient\u2019s cells, which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against.</p> <p>Ideally, a vaccine will generate persistent, high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also \u201cT\u201d cells to destroy infected cells. But each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection,\u201d says David Heymann, who led the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Sars epidemic.</p> <p>Early results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use.</p> <p>The US biotech firm Moderna reported antibody levels <a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine\">similar to those found in recovered patients</a> in 25 people who received its vaccine.</p> <p>Another vaccine from Oxford University did not stop monkeys contracting the virus, but did appear to prevent pneumonia, a major cause of death in coronavirus patients.</p> <p>If humans react the same way, vaccinated people would still spread the virus, but be less likely to die from it.</p> <p>How well a vaccine works determines how it is used. Armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years, countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least two-thirds of the population.</p> <p>Coronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others, on average, but if two or more are immune, the outbreak will fizzle out. That is the best-case scenario.</p> <p>More likely is we will end up with a vaccine, or a number of vaccines, that are only partially effective.</p> <p>Vaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people, but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection.</p> <p>Meanwhile, older people might get vaccines that simply prevent infections progressing to life-threatening pneumonia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the ability to induce immunity, you\u2019ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection,\u201d says McCauley.</p> <p>But partially effective vaccines have their own problems: a vaccine that doesn\u2019t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve, making the vaccine redundant.</p> <h2><strong>So, is the virus here to stay?</strong></h2> <p>The simple answer is: yes.</p> <p>Hopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there. \u201cIf and when we have a vaccine, what you get is not rainbows and unicorns,\u201d says Larry Brilliant, CEO of Pandefense Advisory, who worked on the WHO\u2019s smallpox eradication programme. \u201cIf we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection, then we are doomed to have Covid become endemic, an infection that is always with us.\u201d</p> <p>The virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be harder to get rid of Covid than smallpox,\u201d says Brilliant. With smallpox it was at least clear who was infected, whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing. A thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country, all other nations are at risk.</p> <p>As David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told a Chatham House webinar recently: \u201cUnless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in.\u201d</p> <p>Or as Brilliant puts it, the virus will \u201cping-pong back and forth in time and geography\u201d.</p> <p>One proposal from <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-advance-market-commitment-and-how-could-it-help-beat-covid-19\">Gavi, the vaccine alliance</a>, is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an \u201cadvance market commitment\u201d. And Brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now. \u201cWe should be demanding, now, a global conference on what we\u2019re going to do when we get a vaccine, or if we don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf the process of getting a vaccine, testing it, proving it, manufacturing it, planning for its delivery, and building a vaccine programme all over the world, if that\u2019s going to take as long as we think, then let\u2019s fucking start planning it now.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How will we live with the virus?</strong></h2> <p>People will have to adapt \u2013 and life will change. Heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment. People must play their part too, by maintaining handwashing, physical distancing and avoiding gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. Repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines, so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available, he adds. Immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate.</p> <p>Yuen Kwok-yung, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Hong Kong, has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed \u2013 but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work, and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas.</p> <p>At restaurants, tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus. \u201cIn our Hong Kong perspective, the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sarita Jane Robinson, a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the University of Central Lancashire, says people are still adapting to the \u201cnew normal\u201d and that without more interventions \u2013 such as fines for not wearing face masks \u2013 \u201cwe could see people drifting back to old behaviours\u201d.</p> <p>We might become blase about Covid-19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on, but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore, she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/has-the-coronavirus-pandemic-made-us-all-nicer-community\">Has the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One last possibility could save a lot of trouble. Some scientists wonder whether the common cold coronaviruses crossed into humans in the distant past and caused similar illness before settling down. \u201cIf the virus doesn\u2019t change there\u2019s no reason to think that miraculously in five years\u2019 time it won\u2019t still cause pneumonia,\u201d says Perlman. \u201cBut that\u2019s the hope: that we end up with a much more mild disease and you only get a bad cold from it.\u201d</p> <p>Heymann says it is too soon to know how the pandemic will pan out. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the destiny of this virus,\u201d he says. \u201cWill it continue to circulate after its first pandemic? Or will it, like some other pandemic viruses, disappear or become less virulent?

  "<p>In our time of social distancing, the desire for physical contact has never been so intense. And yet we are untouchable. This experience has had its more conspicuous consequences, such as the government scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/headlines-neil-ferguson-coronavirus-death-rate\">Neil Ferguson</a> breaking his own rules to meet his lover during lockdown. This notion of forbidden touch, unique and even shocking as it may be to us, has a multitude of echoes in literature. Cultural constraints and taboos on touch are reflected, overturned or used for dramatic purposes by writers throughout history, and our own bookshelves are newly rich with the comfort of identification. Who would have ever guessed that the plague-ridden, the apocalyptic or the edicts of Victorian England would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/01/the-end-of-coronavirus-what-plague-literature-tells-us-about-our-future\">quite such resonance</a>?</p> <p>The sensual is, of course, as much enhanced by restraint as diminished by it, and the whole canon of forbidden, throbbing longing in literature contains particular potency in the present. Often by necessity, desire is all, and consummation, if it ever happens, can be secondary in impact to the distanced gazes, tiny brushes and glances that precede it. Little is as sexy, or as frustrating, as restricted touch.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An exquisite suspense lies in the space between obedience and disobedience, uniformity and special status</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A physical gesture, however slight, is more often a turning point for characters than anything spelled out in dialogue. This was summed up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/13/iris-murdoch-100-books-full-passion-disaster\">Iris Murdoch</a> in <em>The Black Prince</em>: \u201cOnly take someone\u2019s hand in a certain way, even look into their eyes in a certain way, and the world is changed forever.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\">Keats</a> wrote that \u201ctouch has a memory\u201d, and the anticipation or the recollection of the physical is often where the excitement, fervour and true poetry lie. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/emily-dickinson-lyndall-gordon\">Emily Dickinson</a> expressed it: \u201cWithin its reach, though yet ungrasped / Desire\u2019s perfect Goal \u2013 / No nearer \u2013 lest the Actual \u2013 / should disenthrall my soul \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>The physical spaces between the lover and the loved are filled with suspense.

While she and Angel are still resisting a relationship made problematic by class differences and personal history, \u201cTess was trying to lead a repressed life, but she little divined the strength of her own vitality\u201d. <em>Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles </em>is a deeply sensual novel in which the two protagonists barely touch, yet the heroine\u2019s physical beauty, the fertility of their surroundings \u2013 the oozing valley, dairy farm, rank overgrown garden \u2013 all represent that very vitality as they circle and yearn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/24/helen-simpson-interview-great-unspoken-subject-between-couples-is-probably-whose-job-is-more-import\">Helen Simpson</a>\u2019s young lovers in her story \u201cBed and Breakfast<em>\u201d</em> don\u2019t even need to hold hands as their \u201cglances arrowing beams of sheepish delight\u201d alone make people turn to them and stare, while Sally Rooney\u2019s Connell and Marianne in <em>Normal People</em> are restrained from showing their real feelings because of a stringent social pecking order: \u201cConnell moves towards Marianne almost imperceptibly, and their arms touch. She want to pick up his hand and suck on his fingertips one after the other.\u201d She can do no such thing in public. The barrier in contemporary interactions is often a screen. In Kamila Shamsie\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/10/home-fire-kamila-shamsie-review\">Home Fire</a></em>, Isma notes: \u201cBut \u2018touch\u2019 was the one thing modern technology didn\u2019t allow, and without it she and her sister had lost something vital in their way of being together.\u201d</p> <p>Forbidden or disaster-laden touch has been thematically explored from the beginning of storytelling: think the apple of Eden, King Midas, Apollo and Daphne, Tantalus, Pygmalion and Thanatos myths, where touching can have calamitous consequences. Forbidden fruit grows everywhere: Christina Rossetti\u2019s \u201cbloom-down-cheek\u2019d peaches\u201d in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/25/poem-week-goblin-market-rossetti\">Goblin Market</a></em> tempt the buyer to touch as well as taste<em>.</em> Punishments and catastrophes abound, just as in times of cholera.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83d2ae968ce526630d4f4a12d5254b04cd99d50a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83d2ae968ce526630d4f4a12d5254b04cd99d50a/0_160_2425_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Kerr, left, Kathleen Byron and David Farrar in Black Narcissus (1947).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Kerr, left, Kathleen Byron and David Farrar in Black Narcissus (1947).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressb/Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plagues can be symbolic as well as real. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/albertcamus\">Camus</a>\u2019s <em>La Peste</em> (The Plague)<em> </em>has had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/albert-camus-novel-the-plague-la-peste-pestilence-fiction-coronavirus-lockdown\">starring social media role</a> ever since the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Von Aschenbach\u2019s gaze upon the young Tadzio in <em>Death in Venice</em> by Thomas Mann is obsessive, but the distance cannot be broached because of age, gender and a cholera epidemic. Poor Esther of Dickens\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\">Bleak House</a></em>, always on the margins of family and society, is ravaged by a disease assumed to be smallpox that leaves her further isolated. Of course, social edicts on physical engagement were more stringent in much of the 19th century than the century preceding and following it. And, in futuristic novels, oppressive regimes such as Margaret Atwood\u2019s Gilead<em> </em>in <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> severely circumscribe touch.</p> <p>\u201cMost classic novels were written in times when touch was much restricted and therefore it was much more significant when it happened,\u201d says John Mullan, author of <em>What Matters in Jane Austen?</em>. \u201cIn <em>Persuasion</em>, for example, there\u2019s this extraordinary moment, when Anne is invited into a carriage and Captain Wentworth \u2018without saying a word \u2026 quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage. Yes; he had done it. She was in the carriage, and felt that he had placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it.\u2019 It\u2019s a completely non-verbal exchange, which would be powerful now, but all the more in a period where you were allowed to link arms, but with gloves, and even wore gloves when dancing, so contact was just electric in that world.\u201d</p> <p>Carriages and cars instil an awareness of space and further hesitancy, and can therefore be the perfect arena for the most discreet contact.

  "<p>The coronavirus is tearing through Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander communities in California, fanning longstanding health disparities and killing community members at a higher rate than any other racial group in the state.</p> <p>Data from California\u2019s department of public health reveals that Pacific Islanders have contracted coronavirus at <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Race-Ethnicity.aspx\">nearly twice</a> the state\u2019s overall rate. As of 17 May, they have died from the virus at a rate 2.6 times higher than the state population \u2013 the highest death rate of any racial or ethnic group.</p> <p>The pattern extends beyond California. <a href=\"https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/pacific-islanders-in-oregon-have-the-highest-rate-of-covid-19/\">Oregon</a>, Utah, Washington and <a href=\"https://www.kuaf.com/post/coronavirus-spreads-arkansass-pacific-islander-community#stream/0\">Arkansas </a>\u2013 where many Marshallese work in meatpacking plants \u2013 have all seen similar trends.</p> <p>Public health experts have often said the group\u2019s relatively small size can skew the numbers, making percentages appear outsized. But to community members and advocates, that argument obfuscates a long history of overlooked needs and health disparities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Time and again we\u2019ve been told, \u2018Your numbers are so small, they\u2019re statistically insignificant'</p> <footer> <cite>Natalie Ah Soon, Regional Pacific Islander Task Force</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTime and again we\u2019ve been told, \u2018Your numbers are so small, they\u2019re statistically insignificant,\u2019\u201d said Natalie Ah Soon, co-chair of the Regional Pacific Islander Task Force. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that before.

The communities account for 537 of the state\u2019s 80,400 <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19PublicDashboard/Covid-19Public?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3Adisplay_count=no&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no\">confirmed coronavirus cases</a> and 28 of the 3,300 deaths attributed to the virus.</p> <p>The impact of Covid-19 among Pacific Islanders is exacerbated by the high prevalence of a range of pre-existing health conditions in the community, including diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol.</p> <p>Roughly one in five Pacific Islanders have been diagnosed with heart disease and they are 46% more likely than the general population to be diagnosed with cancer \u2013 a rate higher than any other racial group, according to <a href=\"https://mk0picopce2kx432grq5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020_0424-PICOPCE-COVID19-Press-Release.pdf\">an April report</a> from the Pacific Islander Center of Primary Care Excellence.</p> <p>High poverty rates, lack of access to healthcare, and higher than average rates of \u201cessential workers\u201d can compound risk and accelerate the spread of the virus among Pacific Islander communities, said the organization.</p> <p>Life in multigenerational households, common among communities of Pacific Islanders, complicates the challenge to maintain distance \u2013 especially if a member of the household works in the community and returns home to elders.</p> <p>\u2018Alisi Tulua, who is Tongan and a member of the national <a href=\"https://pi-copce.org/covid19response/\">Pacific Islander C</a><a href=\"https://pi-copce.org/covid19response/\">ovid-19 </a><a href=\"https://pi-copce.org/covid19response/\">Response </a><a href=\"https://pi-copce.org/covid19response/\">Team</a>, believes coronavirus is also spreading in the community because \u201cnobody is talking about it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of stigma around disease in our community. Tongans are faithful people, and there\u2019s been negativity attached to the narrative around coronavirus \u2013 a sense that, if you have it, God must be punishing you for something,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Ah Soon said the stigma and shame were consistent with commonly held beliefs in Samoan and other Pacific Islander communities and often created barriers to preventive healthcare and testing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re sick, there\u2019s a belief that it\u2019s probably because of something that we did to offend our ancestors. It\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to explain through a western lens, but it\u2019s very common,\u201d Ah Soon said.</p> <p>While it\u2019s clear the Pacific Islander community is heavily affected, incomplete data statewide prevents a comprehensive view.</p> <p>In some regions where data is available, the local discrepancies of Covid\u2019s impact are stark. In Los Angeles county, for example, officials say the infection rate for Pacific Islanders is four times that of the population; the death rate is more than six times greater.</p> <p>But in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to 87,000 Pacific Islanders, only five of nine counties \u2013 Alameda, San Mateo, Marin, Santa Clara and San Francisco \u2013 disaggregate data for Pacific Islanders, according to Melissa Jones, executive director of the <a href=\"http://barhii.org/\">Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative</a>.

Patients sometimes don\u2019t self-identify on hospital intake forms, and healthcare staff can report inaccurate information or leave sections blank, rendering racial and ethnic data imperfect, she said.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean counties can\u2019t choose to prioritize data collection and reporting, said Tulua.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a conversation with the chief science officer in LA county on a Wednesday and explained the need for more data. By Friday, it was published. It\u2019s absolutely possible for counties to do this,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Four hundred miles north, in Alameda county, the rate of coronavirus cases among Pacific Islanders is the third-highest among racial groups \u2013 behind Latinos and African Americans. Watkins-Tartt said she was concerned about the picture data revealed for Pacific Islanders, but she was not shocked.</p> <p>\u201cSeeing the data [for rates of coronavirus infection] was not completely surprising to us because we\u2019ve already seen it in chronic disease; we\u2019ve seen it in <a href=\"http://www.acphd.org/media/512412/ac_pacisl_2018.pdf\">infant mortality rates</a>.\u201d</p> <h2>Cultural traditions hang in the balance</h2> <p>Meanwhile, some Pacific Islanders are worried that coronavirus is not only threatening the health of their members, but also their customs.</p> <p>The night before the funeral for her 15-year-old nephew, Ah Soon couldn\u2019t sleep.</p> <p>Funerals are sacred events, their importance deeply ingrained in Samoan culture.

When an elder recently passed away in San Francisco, a death that wasn\u2019t attributed to coronavirus, Ah Soon said the funeral director warned the family that no more than 10 people would be allowed to attend the funeral and graveside service \u2013 and if they violated the rule, police would come to disperse the crowd.</p> <p>The death of Ah Soon\u2019s nephew, William Valelei I\u2019aulualo, wasn\u2019t attributed to coronavirus.

In 2016, San Francisco voters banned tents on public sidewalks, adding to the city\u2019s retinue of anti-homeless laws that are among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/02/san-francisco-boulder-homeless-crisis\">the most stringent in California</a>. Earlier that year, San Francisco played host to the Super Bowl, and in the months leading up to the festivities, more and more homeless people found themselves getting pushed by authorities out of the city\u2019s main stretches. Shelters \u2013 oftentimes tents \u2013 would end up confiscated, along with everything inside them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70cf928c44ab964dd194bd3613326a7a7b924afa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70cf928c44ab964dd194bd3613326a7a7b924afa/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco\u2019s first temporary sanctioned tent encampment for homeless people.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco\u2019s first temporary sanctioned tent encampment for homeless people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even after a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/16/supreme-court-wont-revive-homeless-camping-ban\"> court ruling</a> held that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment to enforce criminal laws against homeless people living on the street if a city did not offer enough shelters, the sweeps and tent confiscations persisted. The number of homeless individuals who lost everything they had because of the city\u2019s stance on tents was enough that housing advocate Leslie Dreyer started <a href=\"https://www.stolenbelonging.org/\">the Stolen Belonging Project</a>. \u201cThe city has focused on getting rid of visible homelessness for many years, and I don\u2019t think the general public really understood what it meant to throw a tent away,\u201d Dreyer said.</p> <p>Homeless individuals without a shelter were exempt when the shelter-in-place order came down on 17 March, but that didn\u2019t protect them from infection, or from possibly spreading the virus. Desperate homeless outreach activists began purchasing and handing out tents. Despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisarvinsf/status/1242597055303798786?s=20\">guidance</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to not clear encampments if there were no individual housing units available, sweeps <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NutCheese/status/1242584216358928385?s=20\">still continued</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the moment we gave out the first tent, we were asking where they safely could be and the city would only tell us where they couldn\u2019t be, not where they could be,\u201d said local activist Christin Evans.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be in the park. They can\u2019t be in business corridors. They can\u2019t be near residences,\u201d said Kelley Cutler, the human rights organizer for the Coalition on Homelessness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One day we woke up and the barriers were up \u2026 then one day, they locked the doors, they locked the gates, and no one was allowed in or out</p> <footer> <cite>Mick Conway</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Encampments of all sizes bloomed organically throughout the city. In the Bayview, a historically African American neighborhood in south-east San Francisco, tents went up in Martin Luther King Jr Park, 6ft apart from each other. Neighborhood not-for-profits provided residents with what they needed, and they had bathroom access on site.</p> <p>More than 100 tents had assembled in the plaza near City Hall before it became the city\u2019s first official encampment. According to some in the homeless community, a whisper campaign brought many to that location. Before the city got involved, those in the plaza created their own makeshift ecosystem, making do with what little they had. One man recalled someone putting a toilet seat on top of a bucket to make up for the lack of access to public restrooms.</p> <p>\u201cOne day we woke up and the barriers were up,\u201d said encampment resident Mick Conway, 49. \u201cOne day we woke up and the fences were up. The next day they put the green fabric [over the fence] up, and then one day, they locked the doors, they locked the gates, and no one was allowed in or out.\u201d</p> <p>Those that ended up inside the fence had the option to sign an agreement with the city stating that they would follow encampment rules and policies. Those that chose not to sign had to leave. The agreement says that the program is slated to end on 30 June.</p> <h2>Too little, too late?</h2> <p>For some, the security offered in this sleeping village is a respite. Encampment residents can sleep until noon without worrying about a neighbor calling in their presence as a nuisance. Conway said he likes \u201cbeing able to set up your tent and stay where you want instead of being harassed by the police and pushed off somewhere else\u201d. The green fabric gives the camp a semblance of privacy, and the Urban Alchemy staff stand watch at the doors and let in only residents and service workers.</p> <p>But the camp is also a caged spectacle. Pedestrians gawked at the fence, discussing it loudly as they passed. A man walking a chocolate labrador retriever stopped to peek through a gap in the green fabric, while another man slowed to film with a small camera. \u201cGo back to your <em>home</em>, sir,\u201d a member of the city\u2019s homeless outreach team said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3/0_0_3996_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tents line a sidewalk on Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin neighborhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tents line a sidewalk on Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin neighborhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a somber feeling inside,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIt\u2019s not happy. I don\u2019t want to compare it to a concentration camp or something of that nature, but it\u2019s definitely not the jolliest of places.\u201d</p> <p>Lena Miller, the founder and CEO of Urban Alchemy, is well aware that the village is, despite well-meaning intentions,<strong> </strong>\u201cshowcasing the horrors of poverty and hopelessness during the pandemic\u201d. She <a href=\"https://www.urban-alchemy.us/village?fbclid=IwAR3Q5k-P_9P34wqgxFRzzlBgN7Bp7tK-ONQ5FUIgfCIr8z30YgmdDy9ibd4\">asked</a> for artists to donate artwork to the camp, musicians to perform for the residents and art therapists and teachers to facilitate \u201chealing activities\u201d.</p> <p>But this wouldn\u2019t solve the issue that across the street from the sanctioned encampment, at least 10 more tents crowd the sidewalk. The residents in that encampment had a hand-washing station and a port-a-loo, but a few blocks up, where more people than tents packed the corner, they had nothing, some sleeping out in the open.</p> <p>\u201cThis is barely a Band-Aid,\u201d said Adam Reichart, 50, gesturing at the sanctioned encampment. Every morning, Reichart is woken up by a public works employee, who gives him three Kind bars in exchange for the cardboard box hut that he sleeps under for protection.<strong> </strong>Reichart, who has three tumors on his lungs, is one of the medically vulnerable on the streets for whom the city\u2019s hotel room program is designed. But 10 weeks in, he still can\u2019t get a hotel room.</p> <p>The city is planning on opening more sanctioned encampments. But homeless outreach advocates and service workers are frustrated. They had offered the solution of sanctioned encampments weeks ago, when the city made clear that it would not house all unhoused individuals in hotel rooms.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until 10 weeks into the stay-at-home order that the city listened. It wasn\u2019t until thousands of the homeless population suffered in the streets, with nowhere else to go. It wasn\u2019t until individuals like Jasmine Villereal had gone more than a month without a proper shower.</p> <p>Villereal smiled a heartbreaking, toothless smile before walking away from the green-cloth fence. \u201cRemind everybody you see to not stop caring,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>If you are a pensioner, you have been under virtual house arrest during the coronavirus crisis. You have been barred from any physical contact with your wider family.

Analysis conducted in 2017 by the Institute of Fiscal Studies showed that between April 2010 and April 2016, <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8942\">the value of the state pension increased by 22.2%</a>, compared with growth in earnings of 7.6% and growth in prices of 12.3% over the same period.</p> <p>The SMF argued that \u201cin the post-crisis world of slow, painful recovery, a triple lock ensuring a 2.5% minimum rise in pensions would constitute enormous generosity to pensioners, at a time when working-age adults face low or no wage growth and significant unemployment\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a seductive argument. The young are indeed taking the economic brunt of coronavirus, with youth unemployment already soaring. Graduates this year will be entering the worst labour market for decades. Why should they be the victims of austerity round two?</p> <p>Yet it ignores a basic fact about our very basic state pension in the UK. Yes, the triple lock means the value of the state pension has moved up in value. But it still remains one of the worst in Europe, and axing the guaranteed 2.5% increases will hit the poorest pensioners hard.</p> <p>Comparing state pensions around Europe is phenomenally difficult, but by any measure the UK\u2019s is pretty lousy. In 2019 <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/pensions-countries-comparisons/\">FullFact.org</a> tried to check figures circulating on Facebook, which suggested (at the time) that state pensions in France, Spain and Germany were double those in the UK.</p> <p>It could not determine exact figures, but did find evidence that an average UK pensioner\u2019s income from \u201cmandatory\u201d savings is worth 29% of their earnings at retirement, compared with 51% in Germany, 75% in France and 82% in Spain. In the UK, private pension savings will increase that figure substantially, but fail to meet the levels of France or Spain.</p> <p>The European country with a state pension most similar to the UK, Ireland, pays up to \u20ac248.30 \u2013 that\u2019s \u00a3221.31 at current rates \u2013 compared with the maximum of \u00a3175.20 in the UK. So Irish pensioners get 26% more than British pensioners, yet we are considering trimming ours back.</p> <p>There is much debate around \u201cintergenerational fairness\u201d which falls into the trap of \u201cus versus them\u201d. In truth, there are many, many rich pensioners \u2013 and many, many poor ones. A friend of mine revealed how he was staggered to discover that his recently-deceased elderly father\u2019s pension (from a final salary scheme) was more than \u00a360,000 a year. Yet he got the winter fuel allowance, free TV licence, free prescriptions and so on. But that\u2019s small beer in comparison with the huge tax giveaway he got \u2013 the pensioners\u2019 exemption from national insurance.</p> <p>Currently workers pay <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters\">12% NI on earnings above \u00a39,516 a year</a>, dropping to 2% on earnings over \u00a350,024 a year. But your liability ends once you reach state pension age. My friend\u2019s father saved saved more than \u00a35,000 a year from being exempt from NI.</p> <p>It\u2019s a big loophole (though of course the number of pensioners receiving \u00a360,000 a year or more is relatively small). Yes, NI is supposedly an insurance fund that pays for state pensions, but in reality that is notional only and the money goes into the general tax pool, paying towards the NHS as well.</p> <p>Maybe there should be a targeted lifting of the NI exemption \u2013 such as requiring that pensioners pay a half-rate of NI on incomes above a certain level, perhaps something like \u00a325,000 a year. It would still raise significant sums and ensure that only the better off contribute, while enabling us to maintain the triple lock and gradually lift more pensioners out of poverty.</p>",
  "<p><em>Formations in modern-day football, improved playing surfaces and the evolution of tactics have completely changed the role of the winger. Now it is more accurate to describe an attacking player who plays on one of the wings as a forward, because the modern-day \u201cwinger\u201d rarely hogs the touchline and often plays inside-out. Players such as Johan Cruyff, Luis Figo, George Best and Cristiano Ronaldo all excelled as wingers but their talent was such that their positions evolved to the extent that they are rightly remembered as supreme all-round footballers, not just gifted wide men. Those celebrated in this list get to the essence of what a winger used to be, delighting in trickery, seeing their job as that of an entertainer/provider and never more at home than when within a few feet of a white touchline.</em></p> <h2>1) Stanley Matthews</h2> <p>\u201cThe Wizard of Dribble\u201d set the benchmark for wide players when he emerged at Stoke in 1932. Wingers were mostly reactionary at the time, waiting to be rushed by defenders before knocking the ball past them to make good their escape. But in a reserve game against Manchester City Matthews revolutionised the role, racing at a rival before dropping his shoulder and veering away towards the byline without breaking stride. The modern attacking winger was born. Matthews was obsessed with honing his skills. He practised dribbling round chairs at home as a child. By his late teens he was making baffled defenders look like them. He added a second touch to his deceptive feint which is still taught by coaches today as the \u201cMatthews Move\u201d, a body swerve that does the same job as a step-over but requires only half the ego (not that Matthews didn\u2019t have one). His signature move helped him create countless crossing opportunities as he fed Stoke\u2019s leading goalscorer, Joe Mawson, in the promotion season of 1932-33.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac6a4c056b2ba196caaadc523aebf42a5db9f01f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac6a4c056b2ba196caaadc523aebf42a5db9f01f/0_0_2500_1917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blackpool\u2019s Stanley Matthews dribbles in the 1953 cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blackpool\u2019s Stanley Matthews drops his shoulder and skips past a Bolton defender in the 1953 FA Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stafff/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was more than 20 years later when Matthews had his finest moment on a pitch. As a 38-year-old he left 100,000 fans at Wembley agog after a masterclass in wing play, in which he made countless Bolton players swing and miss <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgPfwYqhmA0&amp;t=6m5s\">as he merrily skipped past them time and again</a> on the right. Stan Mortensen scored a hat-trick for Blackpool in the 4-3 win yet the match is remembered as the \u201cMatthews final\u201d. His individual brilliance was extraordinary for the time, with only Tom Finney coming close to matching his wing play in the 1940s and 50s. Matthews was a revolutionary in other ways too. He cut red meat from his diet to help prolong his career. It worked. He won the inaugural Ballon d\u2019Or at 41, became the oldest ever England international at 42, won the Football Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Footballer of the Year award for guiding Stoke back into the First Division at 48 and played in the top flight until he was 50.</p> <h2>2) Jimmy Johnstone</h2> <p>Scotland has a history of producing artful wingers almost as rich as its whiskies. Alan Morton, one of Scotland\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Wizards\">Wembley Wizards</a>, was a tiny touchline-hugging wonder whose dazzling displays for Rangers at outside-left helped the club win eight league titles in the 1920s, while Willie Waddell was a more dashing, direct wide man who dominated the right flank at Ibrox in the 1940s and 50s. But no discussion about wing wizardry would be complete without a tip of the hat to \u201cJinky\u201d Jimmy Johnstone, who won nine league titles and Celtic\u2019s only European Cup between 1962 and 1975.</p> <p>His height of 5ft 4in could have been a huge disadvantage on the pock-marked battlefields of Scottish football but it was perhaps his greatest weapon. His low centre of gravity meant he could throw an overgrown centre-back <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xheYfAYyRI8&amp;t=1m14s\">off his scent with just a wiggle of his hips</a>, while his feather-toed touch and acceleration were frightening for the time. In British football in the 60s only George Best had the balance and poise of Johnstone while dribbling. And while Best was more of a visionary playmaker who could shift positions, Johnstone delighted in teasing defenders as he skipped up the right touchline, hurdling and \u2013 yes \u2013 jinking, his way past them. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to entertain and to do that you\u2019ve got to practise at it,\u201d said Johnstone after his retirement. That dedication to ball control helped make him a Lisbon Lion in 1967, a year when he was also voted the world\u2019s third best player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) John Robertson</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>John Robertson was a very unattractive young man. If one day, I felt a bit off colour, I would sit next to him. I was bloody Errol Flynn in comparison. But give him a ball and a yard of grass, and he was an artist, the Picasso of our game.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The left-winger was Brian Clough\u2019s favourite footballer but he barely looked like one until Ol\u2019 Big Head turned up at Nottingham Forest in 1975. He was in and out of the team in his early years there until Clough encouraged him to stay wide and get forward more. \u201cRobbo, come and stand by me,\u201d Clough would instruct him from the sidelines. Out wide he could use tight space like no one else. He was a master of the waiting game, teasing defenders by appearing to be gassed before dangling the carrot, waiting for the bite and racing away with pace that defied his appearance. Perhaps his greatest strength was the fact that full-backs could not show Robertson on to his weak foot, because he didn\u2019t have one. He was as effective at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUvkQYBjJmw&amp;t=0m54s\">coming inside his marker</a> as he was at going outside. He<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoB4qLqwEzI&amp;t=0m45s\"> twisted defenders\u2019 blood</a> long before Fergie gave a name to such attacking torment and his crossing was sublime \u2013 no better than when he beat two Malm\u00f6 defenders with a soft-shoed shuffle up the line before <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUvkQYBjJmw&amp;t=0m26s\">curling an inswinging gift on to the head of Trevor Francis</a> for the winner in the 1979 European Cup final. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiWFMAf2rH0\">Scoring in the 1980 final</a> was not a bad feat, either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b234f21778d46bda6cd5f767ef72cad225bff63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b234f21778d46bda6cd5f767ef72cad225bff63/0_61_3392_3421/992.jpg\" alt=\"John Robertson\" width=\"992\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Robertson celebrates with the European Cup in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Garrincha</h2> <p>Great midfielders need to be able to see the bigger picture, how a move might develop, where space might open up or when the pace of the game might need to shift. For the great wingers of the past, none of this was true. Garrincha was pure spontaneity, playing like an angry wasp who would sting a defender once, then come back to do it again before buzzing away with the ball to hurt his next victim. He was the greatest dribbler of his generation, which is not bad for a kid born with a crooked spine and bent legs who many thought would never be able to play professional football. When Garrincha and Pel\u00e9 played together, Brazil never lost. He was inspirational in both Brazil\u2019s 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories. One of his nicknames was the People\u2019s Joy. Little wonder. Brazilians will tell you that the first <em>ol\u00e9s</em> heard at a ground came as Garrincha played the matador to the angry bulls he left snorting behind him as he went on his stop-start dribbles up the touchline. He was pure jazz and would be uncoachable today. Pel\u00e9 may be Brazil\u2019s greatest player but Garrincha\u2019s sparkling wing play gave the world <em>joga bonito</em>.</p> <h2>5) John Barnes</h2> <p>British football in the early 1980s was not the easiest place for a winger to thrive. The long-ball game was the preferred route for many teams and skilful, expressive players were finding it hard to make an impact. So when John Barnes burst on to the left-wing scene at Watford he was a breath of fresh air. The slight, tricksy wingers of the 1970s were dying out, with powerful speed merchants replacing them. Barnes possessed the ability to be both of these at once. He was as adept at beating a man with a delicious bit of skill or a pirouette as he was at bursting to the line and delivering a perfect cross. His dribbling <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SCyXGiJ-jc\">high-water mark came in an England shirt in 1984</a> when he beat Brazil at their own game at the Maracan\u00e3.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae46588973eb5a2021352a15adc72da04cb23ea5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae46588973eb5a2021352a15adc72da04cb23ea5/27_166_2926_2086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Barnes runs at Brazil at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Barnes runs at Brazil during England\u2019s 2-0 win at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in which he scored a supreme solo goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/15/peter-shilton-respect-diego-maradona-england-hand-of-god\">Peter Shilton might not still be talking about the Hand of God</a> had Barnes started the 1986 World Cup quarter-final, either. In just 16 minutes he almost turned the game, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTRWr9jZftw\">creating a goal for Gary Lineker</a> and causing turmoil in Argentina\u2019s defence with his graceful runs up the left. He could have been devastating over 90 minutes. His deliveries were always carefully thought out, too. He never saw his job as being just that of swinging the ball into the box \u2013 he knew it had to find a teammate <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmAo0uiarvA&amp;t=1m49s\">and it usually did \u2013 to devastating effect</a>. When Liverpool peaked in 1987-88 Barnes was majestic, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b7euMoetmY\">gliding past baffled defenders</a> as though he had arrived from the future. And that gets to the essence of Barnes. Even 30 years later, he could still grace the left wing of any team.</p> <h2>6) Ryan Giggs</h2> <p>Manchester United\u2019s history is studded with outstanding wingers: Billy Meredith, Steve Coppell, Jesper Olsen, Willie Morgan and Andrei Kanchelskis \u2013 not to mention Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and Best, who became more than just wide players as their careers progressed. The same could be said of Ryan Giggs. He often played centrally in his latter years but how do you remember him? Of course, it is of that electrifying early-career Giggs <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6gy2k-iDjk&amp;t=2m38s\">haring up the left wing</a> \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/04/sir-alex-ferguson-manchester-united-quotes\">like a cocker spaniel chasing a piece of silver paper in the wind</a>\u201d, as Alex Ferguson so brilliantly described him.</p> <p>He was never the most graceful dribbler but so what? He was devastating. His control while running at searing pace was sensational. When he was in full flow his slender frame meant he often looked like he was being blown off course, though a<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6gy2k-iDjk&amp;t=6m33s\"> couple of rapid changes of direction</a> would make it clear he was fully in control. He left countless full-backs feeling nauseous as he twisted them into knots \u2013 and his inswinging crosses to almost a quarter of a century of Manchester United strikers created countless goals. When pundits talk of \u201cManchester United DNA\u201d a counterattacking Giggs run and cross to create a goal is probably a pretty accurate image of it. He\u2019s English football\u2019s most decorated player, too. Quite right. His blistering wing play helped set the template for so much of Ferguson-era United\u2019s extraordinary success.</p>",

\n  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, announces jobkeeper on 30 March:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cToday, I announce that we are committing $130bn over the next six months to support the jobs and livelihoods of what we anticipate are being almost <strong>six million</strong> Australians, who will need that lifeline in the months ahead.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Around 900,000 employers and sole traders express interest, and then enrolments commence in mid-April.</p> \n  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, reports on 24 April that around 400,000 employers, covering 2.5 million employees have enrolled.</p> \n  <p>In his address to parliament on 12 May, Frydenberg says:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cThere are now more than 835,000 businesses employing more than 5.5 million workers who are formally enrolled in the program.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Then on 14 May, the treasurer announces the number of people on jobkeeper \u201cnow exceeds six million\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, after collecting the tax file numbers and other information on eligible employees, the ATO begins paying out jobkeeper earlier this month. Three fortnights of payments have been made so far, and the next is set to be paid by Sunday.</p> \n  <p>It is then that the ATO realises it is paying out much less than expected, and goes back to check the numbers. The total number of employers is right, but the employees is way down.</p> \n  <p>The ATO determines it was an incorrect response on the enrolment form that led to massively inflated employee numbers.</p> \n  <p>So it\u2019s not clear how the original number was determined, but I am sure there will be questions on it soon.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:43:57.580Z\">at 9.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec78c3f8f0864e579f15a62\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:25:51.399Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clive Palmer plans to sue WA over hard border</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The mining magnate and former senator <strong>Clive Palmer</strong> <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-22/clive-palmer-threatens-high-court-challenge-wa-border-closure/12276368\">says he is planning to take Western Australia to the high court</a> over the state\u2019s hard border closure, after being refused entry.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:32:46.581Z\">at 9.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec787468f0864e579f15a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:07:50.641Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australian stock market closes for the week, via AAP:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The ASX has finished the week on a sour note, dropping 53.4 points with every sector except tech stocks closing lower.</p> \n   <p>The Australian share market has closed lower, rejecting a move above 5,600 as traders turned cautious amid fresh US-China tensions.</p> \n   <p>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index finished Friday down 53.4 points, or 0.96%, at 5,497 points, while the broader All Ordinaries closed down 52.2 points, or 0.92%, to 5,608.7.</p> \n   <p>The Australian dollar was buying 65.36 US cents, down from 65.71 US cents at the close of trade on Thursday.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:11:50.116Z\">at 9.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec785ce8f0886ce4f5d8519\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T07:59:08.023Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Services Union is calling on the jobkeeper payment to be expanded now there\u2019s <em>a lot</em> less money being spent than forecast.</p> \n  <p>The assistant national secretary of the union, <strong>Linda White</strong>, said the payment should be extended to employees who were excluded because of the ownership structure of their employer, such as dnata and Air Niugini. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should have access to the same financial support as other Australians,\u201d White said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cDnata employees have been stood down without pay since March and are struggling to put food on the table for their families.

Instead of reporting how many employees were eligible, businesses reported how much they expected to receive for their employees.</p> \n  <p>In that way, one became 1,500.</p> \n  <p>We are not joking. Here is the official release.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Joint media release with the Australian Taxation Office</strong></p> \n  <p>Late yesterday, the ATO and Treasury advised the Government of a reporting error in estimates of the number of employees likely to access the JobKeeper program. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>The enrolment forms completed by 910,055 businesses who have self\u2011assessed as eligible under the scheme had indicated that this program would cover around 6.5 million eligible employees. <br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The ATO\u2019s review of these forms has found that around 1,000 of those businesses appear to have made significant errors when reporting the estimate of eligible employees on their enrolment form. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>The most common error was that instead of reporting the number of employees they expected to be eligible, they reported the amount of assistance they expected to receive. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>For example, over 500 businesses with \u20181\u2019 eligible employee reported a figure of \u20181,500\u2019 (which is the amount of JobKeeper payment they would expect to receive for each fortnight for that employee).</strong></p> \n  <p>This reporting error has come to light as the ATO and Treasury have been analysing the amounts being paid out under the scheme, reconciling these with the estimates provided by enrolled businesses of the likely number of eligible employees. It was not picked up by the ATO earlier as their primary focus in the first fortnight of JobKeeper payments was on ensuring that JobKeeper payments were paid promptly to those eligible for them, and not paid to those who were ineligible. These initial estimates from businesses of employees covered are not linked to payments, and so were not as carefully analysed.</p> \n  <p>Importantly this reporting error has no consequences for JobKeeper payments that have already been made to eligible businesses, as payments under the scheme depend on the subsequent declaration that an eligible business makes in relation to each and every eligible employee. This declaration does not involve estimates and requires an employer to provide the tax file number for each eligible employee. By contrast, the only use of the information collected in respect of the reporting error was to provide an early estimate of the number of expected employees likely to access the JobKeeper program.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:46:18.116Z\">at 5.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec756488f08a1782fa7f661\"

from stable to negative, but maintains its AAA rating from the Fitch ratings agency.</p> \n  <p>Ratings like this dictate how easy it for countries to borrow money, as well as the interest rates on those borrowings.</p> \n  <p>As AAP reports:<br></p> \n  <p>Fitch said it expects Australia\u2019s economic growth will fall sharply in 2020 and government spending in response to the health and economic crisis will cause large fiscal deficits and a sharp increase in government debt.</p> \n  <p>It forecast the $2tn economy to contract 5% this year driven by a plunge in economic activity during the second quarter due to virus containment measures.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhile these measures have effectively curbed the spread of the virus, they also constrained household consumption and reduced business sentiment and investment,\u201d Fitch said. </p> \n  <p>It expects a gradual economic recovery to begin in the second half of 2020 affirmed Australia\u2019s rating but said a downgrade is possible in the absence of a fiscal consolidation strategy or if there is economic or financial sector distress.</p> \n  <p>Fitch said fiscal deficits are set to swell at both the federal and state levels as a result of the discretionary fiscal measures such as the jobkeeper wage subsidy program and economic contraction. </p> \n  <p>It forecast the government deficit to rise to 6.9% of GDP in 2019-20 and 9.0% in 2020-21, from 1.2% in 2018-19.</p> \n  <p>Fitch\u2019s move follows a similar action by S&amp;P Global Ratings in April, when it downgraded the outlook on Australia from stable to negative as a result of the government\u2019s stimulus measures. <br></p> \n  <p>The federal treasurer,<strong> Josh Frydenberg</strong>, said Fitch\u2019s action is a reminder of the importance of maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur measures are temporary, targeted and proportionate to the challenge we face and will ensure Australia bounces back stronger on the other side, without undermining the structural integrity of the budget which Australians have worked so hard to restore,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n </div> \n <p

The states say their health advice is to keep the borders closed.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The active (known) Covid-free states are working on whether or not they can create their own travel bubbles, which would exclude NSW and Victoria, something NSW really does not want. It is opening up its state to travel, with even the ski resorts open for business. As it was always going to, the moment politics was thrown back into the mix, any sense of national unity between the leaders is very quickly dissipating. Still, national cabinet will be held next Friday and it\u2019s possible they can come to some sort of agreement, or at least a cease-fire, then.</p> \n  <p>It comes as South Australia eases some rules today: from Friday, cafes and restaurants can seat 10 customers indoors for meals along with 10 outdoors. The change has come earlier than expected and SA will also look to move to stage two ahead of schedule.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the commonwealth has announced it will be spending $1.8bn on local government projects, as it looks to kick start the economy with infrastructure investment. The economic recovery is the number one priority now, and you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more about it on Tuesday, when the prime minister gives his national press club address.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll cover all the day\u2019s events as they unfold.

As a disengaged student he captured my imagination with his passion for American lit texts and Shakespeare. He really brought them to life for me and completely challenged my (very limited at the time) world view that men could be sensitive, popular and educated at the same time. Sadly, I didn\u2019t grow up in the most diverse environment at the time! He was a breath of fresh air, never afraid to give an opinion or to challenge my personal mediocrity. He inspired me to go to university and be successful and engaging like him when all I wanted to do was coast through life as a 16 year old. <br> I\u2019m an English teacher now and I\u2019d like to think I rock a little bit of the party boy attitude and pedagogical style with my students as often as I can. I even find myself saying: \u201cwill ya bloody shoot oop!\u201d From time to time in his Wigan accent.   Thank you, Anthony. Legend!</p> </blockquote> <p>Laura Parker relives the heady days of Leeds in the 1980s:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Learning Spanish at Roundhay high with Mrs Dronfield changed my life. I went on to do Latin American Studies at university where I learnt Portuguese, spent a year in Brazil and was bitten by the travel bug. In the intervening three decades, I\u2019ve had the good fortune to live and work in many places \u2013 including for over 10 years in Bulgaria. There I met my Italian husband with whom I\u2019m now locked down in northern Italy.</p> <p>I can still muddle through a conversation in Spanish \u2013 which this weekend I will with my Spanish brother-in-law \u2013 and think of Mrs Dronfield every time I do. Thanks to her rigour, learning Italian was less painful than it might have been.</p> <p>I would just like her to know that in the hills of Piedmont here\u2019s an English woman speaking Italian and thinking of her brilliant Spanish teacher.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alison Leonard recalls a moral conundrum:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Olga Wilkinson inspired me. There were times when she discarded the syllabus entirely and challenged us directly with moral problems from history. For instance, when I declared myself a pacifist, she asked me whether, if I found myself standing next to Adolf Hitler and happened to have a gun on me, I would kill him and thus save millions of lives. (I was flummoxed, but went on to study philosophy at university.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Gillian Fitzgerald fondly remembers an early champion of equality in Liverpool:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We made xylophones in Mr Bleasdale\u2019s class. It was the age of sewing for girls, woodwork for boys, but not with Mr Bleasdale. I sawed, sanded and varnished pieces of wood, ready for Mr Bleasdale to tune each one. He drilled holes in each end, ready for twine to be threaded through. At last, our xylophones were ready. I\u2019ll never forget the thrill of playing a musical instrument I had made.</p> </blockquote> <p>Luke Bosman remembers language classes with Mike Clark:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was a shy lad who would naturally have preferred to sit unnoticed, to put my efforts into bookwork and to quietly succeed. Yet somehow he took this boy with a speech impediment (one of the reasons why I hated to speak) and helped me to grow in confidence, such that by the time I had finished my A-levels, for which he had also been one of my Russian teachers, I could speak confidently.</p> <p>When I qualified as a teacher, I had an interview at a school where, unbeknown to me, he was the head of department. One of the interview questions was, \u201cWhat motivated you to become a teacher?\u201d I was obliged to answer that my inspiration was sitting to the headteacher\u2019s left. I didn\u2019t get the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jerry Goddard goes back 50 years to a history class in Bedfordshire in the 1960s:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Patrick \u2018Harry\u2019 Eavis treated every pupil as if you were three-five years older than you were. Talk about high expectations. \u2018So retell the Martin Luther / Diet of Worms impasse with the pope. But why not turn your A4 page sideways and do it in an eight caption comic book style?\u2019 It made you pr\u00e9cis in a really creative way. I can remember him playing the violin and joining us sixth formers in carol singing, raising money for Oxfam. He was a liberal socialist and believed in community. <br> Did it do mean me any good? Well I\u2019m 67 and now retired after a lifelong career in education including teaching, training, writing, advising, directing and now a member of the board of a local university. What success I\u2019ve had in my career was because of trying to emulate his style.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Where was the Upside?</h2> <p>In the race for vaccines: eight volunteers produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/astrazeneca-could-supply-potential-coronavirus-vaccine-from-september\">Covid-19 antibodies</a> in a US vaccine trial, the first human trial results.

The hypocrisy was particularly pungent: even Scrooge didn\u2019t clap on the doorstep for those from whom he was squeezing every penny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Public patience for a government that is incompetent will not last long</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clearly in-house genius Dominic Cummings is losing his touch if he didn\u2019t see that one coming. Of course, the surcharge policy would have to be ditched. No government could be on the wrong side of health and care workers during a pandemic that has the nation clinging to doctors and nurses as its only protection. That would be true of a government that was handling things well. But it is triply true of a government handling things badly.</p> <p>No need to dwell on the excess deaths number, which suggests Britain will soon have lost as many people to coronavirus as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/almost-55000-excess-uk-deaths-during-covid-19-outbreak-says-ons\">lost civilians</a> in the second world war. Contemplate instead the current situation, in which the government has already eased the lockdown in England and plans to ease it more on 1 June, even though it has not yet built a robust system that can find, test, trace and isolate new cases.</p> <p>Maybe it will all come good on the night. Perhaps at 11.55pm on 31 May, a breathless Matt Hancock will rush towards the Downing Street microphone to announce, still panting, that the contact-tracing app is online and the last contact-tracer is in place. But for now this looks like a government that has seen a cart and a horse and put them in the wrong order. Surely, the first move was to build the system that would keep the lid on any future outbreak and only then \u2013 once the app was tested and working, once the tracers were not merely recruited but fully trained, once the local health organisations best placed to run testing were involved \u2013 start lifting the restrictions that have kept the virus under relative control.</p> <p>Instead, the government is now hastily <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-easing-the-uk-out-of-lockdown-is-a-confidence-game-and-the-pm-is-losing-11991899\">changing its story</a>, explaining that an app previously touted as essential is now merely \u201cthe cherry on the cake\u201d, so there\u2019s no need for us to worry if it\u2019s not ready yet. The focus now, they tell us, is on those human contact tracers. Except they\u2019re not fully up to speed either. No wonder the NHS Confederation <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52748564\">is warning</a> of \u201ca second surge\u201d if the lockdown is eased any further.</p> <p>Cart-before-horse has become the repeating pattern. Johnson dumped the simple \u201cstay home\u201d advice for the opaque \u201cstay alert\u201d \u2013 prompting the number of Britons who regard the government\u2019s messaging as clear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benatipsosmori/status/1263477716675973120?s=20\">to drop</a> from 90% to 56% \u2013 on 10 May while the daily death rate was still grievously high. He said people should be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to their workplaces, before those places had been retooled for physical distancing. The inevitable result was to nudge people back on to trains and buses \u2013 regardless of his suggestion that they should avoid public transport \u2013 before he\u2019d ensured a sufficient, accessible supply of the face masks that the best advice suggests are necessary for such travel. He\u2019s doing it again now on schools, announcing a return date of 1 June <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/05/reopening-schools-question-logistics-not-risks-teachers\">before</a> the extra teachers and classrooms are in place that would allow socially distanced teaching to be viable.</p> <p>Logic would dictate that you prepare first and, once that\u2019s done, you loosen the restrictions. Johnson\u2019s preferred method is to signal a relaxation, then scramble to put in place the mechanisms that might make that relaxation possible.</p> <p>The consequences of this \u201cact now, prepare later\u201d approach have been lethal. Witness the decision to release infected patients from hospital and back into care homes unequipped to receive them. Reporting by the BBC\u2019s Lewis Goodall <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1263219921124720640?s=20\">shows</a> that the more expensive homes had the staff, and the space, to keep the virus at bay and keep their residents alive; the cheaper ones worked staff round the clock with no PPE, and the disease duly ran riot. Incredibly, those well-resourced homes kept their residents alive in part by defying government instructions, imposing an early lockdown when the official advice was to keep the doors open.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/21/nhs-workers-bereavement-scheme-unfairness\">We forced the government to do right by NHS workers.

Some of that, the BMJ argues, goes back to decisions taken over several years, such as austerity and the \u201cdecimation\u201d of the country\u2019s local and regional public health capacity. That may predate Johnson\u2019s premiership, but it does not predate this government, which has been in power for a full 10 years. This is on them.</p> <p>So far the public has been patient. It has granted its leaders the benefit of the doubt, allowing that this is a global crisis not of their making. Crucially, it has wanted to believe that the government means well, even if it is stumbling. That\u2019s certainly been the perception of Johnson himself, who came so close to death at the hands of the virus. The surcharge row was a perilous moment because it shook that understanding, casting the government as lacking basic compassion.</p> <p>More such moments are coming. Why is it right that foreign-born porters, cleaners and care workers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1263501628692406272?s=20\">are excluded</a> from the automatic visa extension that has rightly been granted to doctors and nurses?

If I had any real choice over which food would send me hurtling down a winding path of involuntary memory, it would probably be something fancy and literary, like fresh New England clams, or the first bite of a ripe Comice pear. But Wotsits it is. And probably spaghetti hoops, Dairylea triangles, and Penguin bars, too.

Or homemade dumplings. Or, generally, photogenic meals containing at least four types of vegetable. Which is all very inspiring and motivational (if not overwhelming) for someone like me, who is always looking to improve and diversify her cooking skills. Especially when I\u2019m increasingly opting for meals such as tinned spaghetti on toast. Because real comfort foods are the ones you remember.</p> <p>Tinned spaghetti on toast is something my grandma (who was a great cook, before old age and dementia) used to make me for lunch, when I\u2019d go and stay with her as a kid. And it\u2019s a carb-on-carb delight I can\u2019t remember tasting since my 90s childhood. Triple carb, actually, if you count all the sugar in the tomato sauce. I remember the roughness of the piece of kitchen roll she\u2019d tuck into my collar when serving me this; a kitschy affectation, like something out of a 70s Italian restaurant. I remember the butter on the lightly charred white toast (it absolutely <em>has</em> to be white, for minimal nutritional value) melting into the neon orange sauce and creating something so much greater than the sum of its parts. This is an experience I\u2019ve felt compelled to recreate in lockdown. And I can confirm that spaghetti on toast is still food of the gods. The scared, comfort-craving gods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5196dad40887a67a074e4eca11f0e51b063e963d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5196dad40887a67a074e4eca11f0e51b063e963d/0_555_4692_2815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wotsits close-up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wotsits: \u2018The moment that faux cheese umami hits my tongue, I\u2019ll feel my pupils dilate.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>School lunchbox foods have also been making a comeback.

Especially \u2013 seeing as taste is such a potent memory stimulus \u2013 food.

  "<p>We may be teetering towards a vague genre of semi-normal \u2013 some pubs are serving takeaway pints, Mr Whippy is being eaten in parks \u2013 but as we gain back some small freedoms, we won\u2019t give up our new national hobby lightly. Many of us have learned the simple pleasure of spying. Actually, scratch that: spying, judging and sometimes even a little light dobbing. To the council, to the police or on social media. I\u2019m as guilty as everyone else. I love being shown evidence of a rule-flouter, because it makes me feel ever so righteous and holy. But as I packed two plastic glasses this week and set off on foot to toast a friend\u2019s birthday, I weighed up a new threat. I\u2019d stay four metres away for the full duration, and we could even fit in some Zumba stretches, but that wasn\u2019t what frightened me. It was more that if I went into the sunshine, I may be spotted by someone else in the sun who would get angry at me for taking a risk.<br><br>This dual-think is increasingly common.

Jane and her family had driven for an hour and a half to breathe some sea air and enjoy the feeling of sand on their toes. But when she got there, she found something quite harrowing: there were other families on the beach who were flouting the law. This summer, I reckon, all pub landlords, restaurateurs and shop owners will find their job specs stretched to include unofficial Covid-19 refereeing. Their work will involve one long, confused, tit-for-tat customer square-up. \u201cI am drinking a quiet pint in the sun with my uncle to help with his lack of vitamin D,\u201d some might say, but others will complain: \u201cThose people across the beer garden are simply on the piss \u2013 you need to make them leave.\u201d Or: \u201cI am keeping the local economy thriving by using the local bakery, but these other people who queue up for pastries are idiots.\u201d<br><br>One way of reopening restaurants I saw in America involved guests sitting in small outdoor greenhouses, in tables of four and shielded from other diners. But the problem with eating in glass houses is the other nitpicker diners throwing figurative stones. \u201cHow can table three be sharing a bread basket? We overheard them say they\u2019re not even in the same household!\u201d Heaven knows what we will do with children eating out in the new world, not least as none of us can agree on their place in proceedings at the best of times. Perhaps we\u2019ll return to the good old days of British childminding and leave them in the car with a packet of Salt\u2019n\u2019Shake and the window ajar. It was fine for me and the rest of Generation X. Absolutely no problems to see here.<br><br>I saw something freshly peculiar by the see-saw in the local park this week. A gran, her son and a toddler, all drinking brought-from-home cups of tea in the sunshine. They also had a bag of brought-from-home sandwiches. It was a lesser-spotted, cross-generational grouping! They scoured my expression nervously and hid the flask from my sight in case I took some sort of issue or called an authority. This slightly paranoid feeling of watching and being watched is getting more normal by the day.</p> <p>And as for some snooping friends, well, I didn\u2019t know they had it in them. A woman I know in her mid-50s, famed for her lively parties where the guest list stretches to hundreds, took to social media last weekend to complain that some of her neighbours were having a barbecue. Should I call the police, she asked rhetorically. \u201cIt\u2019s like they think lockdown is over!\u201d she said, clearly upset and, yes, possibly within reason. \u201cDefinitely call them!\u201d came the answer from many, including the kind of people who last year were being sick in her rhododendrons.</p> <p>This played on my mind for some days: how did this woman, who pre-Covid lived and let live, now know exactly who was in her neighbours\u2019 garden? Had she peered from her blinds to count and identify those attending? Had she totted up the cars out front or noted the supermarket bags while listening for the telltale clink of bottles? Or did she wait for the smell of hot charcoal fleeing westward from the neighbours\u2019 garden as clear evidence? And was she really bothered about Covid, or was she simply settling scores for the things that she really resented about next door? And if she taught them a lesson and complained to the authorities, would she be very surprised if some day soon the score would need to be resettled? Like many of us pointing the finger of judgment during these strange times, we\u2019ll soon find it pointing right back.</p>",
  "<p>I got a text from a friend at 2am one night in the summer of 2018. It said: \u201cWanna buy a ghost town?\u201d I thought it was a weird joke, but I clicked on the link and started reading about Cerro Gordo. It was a piece of American history straight out of a wild west movie: an abandoned 19th-century silver-mining town about 200 miles from Los Angeles. At its height, it had about 4,000 residents, mostly miners who spent their time seeking their fortunes and drinking a lot. There was a history of gun fights; at one point police were reporting a murder a week. There\u2019s a rumour that Butch Cassidy hid out there for a while.</p> <p>When the mines closed in the 1930s, almost everyone left and the abandoned town changed hands several times. Now there was just a caretaker called Robert who has kept watch over the town for 21 years, protecting it from the occasional looting attempt, and the whole town was for sale.</p> <p>I grew up in Florida and consider myself a bit of an entrepreneur. I own a backpacker hostel in Austin, Texas, which was built in 1892. I\u2019ve always liked that combination of hospitality and history. But I was 30 years old, the hostel was doing well and I was looking for a project that was more of a challenge. When I saw Cerro Gordo, I thought it would be incredible if people could stay there. So, I scraped together my life savings and convinced a few investors to get involved. On Friday 13 July 2018, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/photos-california-ghost-town-cerro-gordo-sells-for-1point4-million.html\" title=\"\">we closed the deal</a>.</p> <p>For the next year or so things went slowly; we waited for permits and tried to make a start on the renovations. Everything takes an age, because it\u2019s so hard to get people or materials here. When the coronavirus pandemic started, I got a call from Robert. His wife lives in Arizona and he wanted to be with her before lockdown began, so he asked if I could watch over the town to keep it safe from looters.</p> <p>I originally planned on staying a week or two. There are 22 buildings, including a church, hotel and general store; I thought I could repair some and we could start renting them out to visitors. Mother Nature had other plans.</p> <p>A snowstorm hit the night I arrived. My truck didn\u2019t even make it all the way; it was stuck, spinning out in the snow 500 yards before town. I left it in the middle of the single-lane road and walked the rest of the way.</p> <p>It snowed almost every day for 10 days. It got to the point where I could barely open my front door. The road here is precarious. It rises 4,500ft over seven miles, so it was now completely impassable.</p> <p>And then, because of the pandemic, California issued a \u201cshelter in place\u201d order, so there were two reasons I couldn\u2019t leave.</p> <p>The town has electricity, but no running water. All the food I brought with me is gone, but luckily Robert left a pretty large store of tins. I\u2019ve eaten a lot of out-of-date beans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/01/experience-drove-25000-miles-home-from-new-zealand\">Experience: we drove 25,000 miles home from New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have been here for more than a month now. I have a phone signal, but the internet isn\u2019t powerful enough to stream Zoom or Netflix. To pass the time, I\u2019ve been playing museum curator, finding time capsules from the town\u2019s history. A week ago, I found a briefcase, and inside were cheques from the 1920s, divorce settlements and love letters: the highs and lows of one miner\u2019s life.</p> <p>The thought of death is never far away; part of the town\u2019s atmosphere is its grim nature. The cemetery has about 1,300 graves; there are bullet holes in the walls of The American, the local hotel built in 1870, and blood stains from an infamous disagreement in its card room. I found a huge VHS collection left by the previous owners, including a copy of The Shining. I can\u2019t bring myself to watch it.</p> <p>If there is a silver lining, it is that the pandemic is forcing me to spend time here working on the buildings. I have taught myself to build a deck and to track animals; most are rabbits, but a bobcat visits my porch every night leaving big paw prints.</p> <p>Once the snow has melted, I will stay here because I would like to give Robert more time with his family, and the news doesn\u2019t make me want to go to a big city any time soon.

  "<p>Daniel Pillai first realised that life was about to change when he arrived at San Francisco airport on a business trip in February. Queuing at passport control, he noticed masked biosecurity staff checking the temperatures of incoming passengers. \u201cI realised this thing [coronavirus] was about to hit us, and it was only a matter of time,\u201d says the CEO and co-founder of BIPVco, a Welsh solar roofing company. \u201cOur business had all sorts of contingency plans, everything from fire to worst-possible scenario. But a health pandemic? That wasn\u2019t even on the radar, especially not for a company of our size.\u201d</p> <p>As at many small businesses across the UK, the Covid-19 pandemic forced BIPVco to reconfigure. The company had been manufacturing solar modules from its Newport factory since 2015, and currently employs 16 people. On 16 March, when the government advised that all non-essential businesses should cease activity to limit contagion, Pillai phoned his staff to tell them not to come to work the next day. At the same time, worries about his business started gnawing away. \u201cWe had many concerns: the welfare of our staff, letting customers down, plus the long-term viability of the business given that orders could disappear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"732d64e15c3538417ea4f1e3b54e1736148885a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/732d64e15c3538417ea4f1e3b54e1736148885a0/180_0_4732_5916/800.jpg\" alt=\"BIPVco CEO Daniel Pillai\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BIPVco CEO Daniel Pillai</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two months on, BIPVco has a skeleton team of six staff working on essential projects for the Welsh ambulance service and a local hospital. The rest of the team have been furloughed, with their jobs remaining safe until at least October, through the government\u2019s multi-billion pound job retention scheme, which has protected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/18/covid-6m-britons-fear-losing-their-jobs-despite-chancellor-measures\">7.5 million workers and 1m UK businesses</a>. These measures came four days after the factory shuttered its doors, and are described as \u201ca massive relief\u201d by Pillai.</p> <p>The biggest boon of the furlough scheme for Pillai is that it enabled BIPVco to retain experienced staff: the manufacture of photovoltaic solar modules for buildings and vehicles is a complex job requiring expert knowledge.</p> <p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been able to afford [to retain] our small, but specialised, staff, we could have lost them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would have put us back months, if not years, as it takes time to recruit talent with that level of skill.\u201d</p> <p>The employment package has also kept corporate coffers topped up. \u201cCashflow is the biggest issue for SMEs; even if you\u2019re profitable, [lack of] cashflow can kill you,\u201d says Pillai.</p> <p>Under the wage subsidy plan, employees get 80% of their salary (capped at \u00a32,500 a month) and bosses are given the option to make up the 20% difference; something Pillai has done with furloughed employees.</p> <p>Had the scheme not been introduced, Pillai says former industrial heartlands such as south Wales could have suffered millions of job losses. \u201cFrom a societal point of view, this scheme has been important as it\u2019s stopped many people going on the dole.\u201d</p> <p>One week after placing staff on furlough, BIPVco reinstated six workers when a pre-existing contract with the Welsh ambulance service (to fit solar panels on 40 ambulances) was declared \u201cessential\u201d. In April, the company started work on another contract: making solar panels for the new Grange University hospital, near Cwmbran. Working on such essential projects gives staff a \u201csense of pride\u201d, says Pillai.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f1ae628d50d117014cadec9c461604bcfde26ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f1ae628d50d117014cadec9c461604bcfde26ed/0_0_1512_1890/800.jpg\" alt=\"Worker at BIPVco\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The furlough scheme has enabled BIPVco to retain experienced staff with expert knowledge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their workplace safety, however, is paramount. Face masks and goggles are now a common sight at the factory, staff use individual spaces rather than communal areas, and all jobs are undertaken standing the mandatory two metres apart.</p> <p>Ensuring that furloughed staff are adjusting to life at home is also critical. Although employees are forbidden to undertake any work for their company while under furlough (including checking emails), they can speak with employers. \u201cI call our staff once a week,\u201d says Pillai. \u201cWe talk about their wellbeing, never work. People have been unbelievably understanding.\u201d</p> <p>BIPVco has also applied for a business support grant, part of \u00a3730m worth of national funding pledged to the Welsh government, and Pillai has welcomed the extension of the furloughing scheme. \u201cBeing an eternal optimist, I\u2019m hoping we won\u2019t need it and business will be back to normal soon. But in the eventuality that social distancing prevents firms returning to work for now, it\u2019s good to know it\u2019s there.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the financial assistance that the employment package has given small businesses (the government has received \u00a310bn worth of claims so far), Pillai believes it has helped in other ways too: \u201cThe fact the government has stepped in to support business in such an unprecedented way [makes] everybody feel it\u2019s a shared problem.

  "<p>Springtime is generally boom time for the hospitality industry. The four-day weekend of Easter, plus Mother\u2019s Day and two bank holidays in May, see many people celebrating with meals out. But this year in March, just as restaurants and bars began to get really busy, Covid-19 took hold.</p> <p>\u201cWe were on the crest of a wave,\u201d says Paul Elgee, director of Myra\u2019s Kaiseki, a restaurant in Dorchester. \u201cWe were fully booked, and with stock in ready for a big weekend, then we were told we needed to shut. The closure of the restaurant couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.\u201d</p> <p>As the pandemic swept through China, then Europe, at the start of 2020, there was confusion in the UK about the virus and the impact it would have. On 16 March, the prime minister simply advised the country to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other social venues\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until a week later that lockdown was put into place, meaning venues such as Myra\u2019s Kaiseki were forced to bring down the shutters.</p> <p>This small, fine-dining Japanese restaurant is part of an industry that before the outbreak of Covid-19 was valued at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/restaurants-stare-into-social-distancing-abyss\">\u00a372bn</a> in the UK. Though the closures were unavoidable, the process of doing so had the potential to devastate the trade\u2019s workforce.</p> <p>\u201cWe opened the family-run restaurant in 2016 and we\u2019ve built it up from nothing,\u201d says Elgee, who employs four people alongside his wife Myra, the chef. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with closure, it\u2019s like a dark cloud. But it was very important to us to retain our staff. It takes several years to build up a team of people you can trust and rely on \u2013 you can\u2019t replace people who have contributed a lot to the business. They aren\u2019t just another number to us, they are like family. They have to be looked after.\u201d</p> <p>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, subsequently announced a range of measures for UK businesses and workers to protect them during the economic emergency. The Small Business Grant Fund (SBGF) provides small businesses with grants of up to \u00a310,000, while the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) enables employees to be put on furlough while allowing employers to apply for a government grant that covers 80% of their usual wage, capped at \u00a32,500 a month.</p> <p>Elgee\u2019s first port of call was the team running Dorchester Business Improvement District, who, along with his accountants, suggested he apply for an SBGF through Dorset county council. The restaurant was awarded the full \u00a310,000 within a week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c50c7066e10408c37cf9579fe51427a090cc335f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c50c7066e10408c37cf9579fe51427a090cc335f/0_0_640_428/500.jpg\" alt=\"Paul and Myra Elgee. \u2018It takes several years to build up a team of people you can trust\u2019, says Paul\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul and Myra Elgee. \u2018It takes several years to build up a team of people you can trust\u2019, says Paul</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe grant gave us enough space to breathe so we could search for that silver lining and figure out what we could do in the circumstances. It also helped to tie things up with our suppliers and our staff, so we could close up in good order,\u201d he says.</p> <p>They were then able to furlough two of their staff through the CJRS. Of utmost importance to Elgee was being able to support his staff. \u201cThey will be secure and ready to come back when we can reopen,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel isolated with the problem, which was really important,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe were kept very well informed.\u201d</p> <p>But business owners \u2013 and the people who work in these bars, cafes and restaurants \u2013 are aware that there\u2019s no quick fix for the effects of the pandemic on their trade, and that things are still precarious.</p> <p>The job retention scheme has now been extended until the end of October, which has come as a relief to Elgee. \u201cAs far as the restaurant industry is concerned, we can\u2019t expect to recover immediately in July. It will take us a while to pick up again,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Elgee says he\u2019s fortunate to have the support of his landlord, who has agreed to suspend the business\u2019s rental obligations while the restaurant is shut. There\u2019s now pressure for this to become a nationwide standard so as to save even more jobs and livelihoods. A campaign for a <a href=\"https://www.hospitalityunion.co.uk/nationaltimeout\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Time Out</a> is asking that hospitality business rents to be paused until January 2021, when rental payments would begin again as normal.</p> <p>In the meantime, Elgee, like many other restaurant owners, is working out how Myra\u2019s Kaiseki can function in this new era of social distancing. \u201cWe sat quietly for a month and thought about it, looking at how we could adapt and create new revenue streams.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/22/i-call-furloughed-staff-once-a-week-how-one-company-is-coping-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">'I call furloughed staff once a week': how one company is coping during the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The restaurant has just started offering takeaways and a home delivery service, it\u2019s doing a weekly grocery run for its older isolating customers, and is delivering free meals once a week to NHS staff at Dorset county hospital.

But, with the right support, it is hoped that restaurants at the heart of their communities will survive.

  "<p>This pandemic is frightening for many people \u2013 especially those at the highest risk \u2013 and the need for effective prevention and treatment is pressing.</p> <p>When there is no direct evidence about what is best to do with a new disease, we need to create it. Clearly, that means recognising that some seemingly sensible interventions may not produce the intended effects. All of medicine is a bit uncertain (unlike maths, where proof is immutable). We can be very certain about some things (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-sarcastic\">drinking bleach</a> is harmful) and less certain about others (could <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52371688\">vitamin D</a> be useful?) Admitting uncertainty is something medicine historically finds difficult. But if we don\u2019t recognise the gaps in our knowledge, we won\u2019t research them. And good research has to be the way out of this.</p> <p>There are now thousands of research papers on Covid-19, but many of such poor quality that we shouldn\u2019t rely on them. This means extra care and critique is needed. And on that basis, we simply don\u2019t know if <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/vitamin-d-a-rapid-review-of-the-evidence-for-treatment-or-prevention-in-covid-19/\">vitamin D, for example, will help with Covid-19 </a> (although all UK residents get a <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/\">recommendation either to take or consider taking vitamin D</a> the evidence for benefit is either <a href=\"https://ec.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/ec/8/2/EC-18-0432.xml\">absent or small </a>with the exception of asthma). To know if it will help against Covid-19 needs rapid research \u2013 for instance, assessing the vitamin D levels of people with severe Covid-19 against similar people who have less severe Covid-19 or avoid getting it altogether, or asking a group of people at high risk to diligently take supplements, and monitoring what happens. </p> <p>As far as hydroxychloroquine goes, initial trials of this drug \u2013 which is typically used to prevent malaria (and has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">promoted by Donald Trump</a> as a possible cure for all things Covid-19) \u2013 were initially of poor quality, tiny, and with no control groups. Yet they were widely reported as showing it helped, while better quality trials that followed <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-what-do-the-clinical-trials-tell-us/\">showed it didn\u2019t</a>. Research is now focused on whether it might work as a <a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/news/covid-19-drugs-trial-rolled-out/\">preven</a><a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/news/covid-19-drugs-trial-rolled-out/\">tive measure</a>. Knowing what doesn\u2019t work is vital. It means that we can stop wasting resources on things that don\u2019t work \u2013 and avoid unnecessary side-effects. It\u2019s also clear that hydroxychloroquine has cardiac side-effects, a fact that needs care in monitoring. There is no such thing as an intervention that is free of side-effects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-doctors-whistleblowers-history-silenced\">Doctors have been whistleblowers throughout history. They\u2019ve also been silenced</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This doesn\u2019t just go for drug treatments. It should hold true for non-drug treatments. There is a clamour for everyone in public to wear a face covering. Does it work? Some research papers insist it does \u2013 offering reasons as to why fabric will stop the passage of viral particles from the mouth and nose. But what really matters is whether this would result in fewer people being infected. So far, three reviews of the evidence (which have yet to be peer-reviewed) have found no or slender evidence, at best, for any benefit. But a bigger concern is a lack of investigation of unintended consequences. Would people wearing face coverings manage not to touch their faces or would they subconsciously take risks, which results in more infections, not fewer? What does this mean for deaf or lipreading people, or those with cognitive difficulties? Hazards for some may be accepted if there are outweighing benefits for everyone \u2013 but, when the evidence is so slender, we need rational deliberation. </p> <p>Would policymakers assume face coverings work, and make decisions on, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/public-could-told-wear-face-18172932\">encouraging the use of public transport </a>on this basis without high-quality evidence to tell us this is safe? The truth is that we don\u2019t know, because we don\u2019t have the studies. The counter-argument is \u201cit\u2019s a global pandemic, we can\u2019t wait for the results of research\u201d. I would argue that because it is a global pandemic, we need good, rapid research even more: the results will be applicable to far more people than usual when a drug or potential preventive measure is tested, hence the need to get better evidence for everyone. And yes, the need is urgent \u2013 but this pandemic has no clear end in sight.</p> <p>We could do fast, pragmatic, real-world studies, supplying masks to a geographical area with encouragement and instruction on use, and monitor for comparative changes in infection rates, together with carrying out field studies to observe people\u2019s behaviour. Difficult, yes; but impossible, no. The World Health Organization has made it clear that we need research during pandemics (and drug trials have got off to an amazingly fast start), but this needs to hold true for things like face coverings too. What seems a sensible and obvious solution may not be. Harms and unintended consequences are everywhere, but are only reckoned with properly if we look for them.</p> <p>Medicine is now in the era of Covid-19. This could be a turning point: where we take the uncertainty we are facing and, rather than assuming that our interventions will work, everyone \u2013 citizens, patients, researchers and healthcare staff \u2013 comes together to reduce it.</p> <p>\u2022 Margaret McCartney is a GP who writes about evidence-based medicine; she is the author of The State of Medicine: keeping the promise of the NHS</p>",

We may never know the true nationality of \u201cpatient zero\u201d in Europe. And it doesn\u2019t much matter, because the true patient zero in our continent is Europe itself.</p> <p>From the first detection of the virus on European territory, Europe has been in a coma.</p> <p>Long lockdowns and home confinement concealed the gravity of the patient\u2019s condition. With the freedom to move around even within countries taken away, few dared to cross borders. Now, as countries ease restrictive measures, Europe\u2019s true state of health is becoming clear.</p> <p>This is a dystopian outcome for millions of EU citizens who live in \u2013 or regularly commute to \u2013 another EU member state. With only a handful of countries reopening their borders, an unprecedented patchwork of national restrictions, including border controls and quarantine rules, continues to make travel across the continent practically impossible. After weeks of home confinement, many of us remain trapped in our country of residence or in that of origin, unable to cross borders again. Some of us can\u2019t visit families, rejoin their loved ones, go to their places of work, or even get home.</p> <p>While EU member states have the legal right temporarily to reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public protection, and to lift them again, their decisions \u2013 as the French president Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2020/03/12/adresse-aux-francais\">pledged</a> \u2013 \u201cmust be taken as Europeans, at the European level, because it\u2019s at this level that we\u2019ve constructed our freedoms and protections\u201d.</p> <p>Yet despite <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_freemovement.pdf\">a timid attempt</a> by the European commission to coordinate the reopening of unrestricted cross-border movement within the union, the Schengen common-travel area remains in limbo, along with the lives of millions of EU citizens. If restrictions are easing, borders are not falling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/how-coronavirus-is-reshaping-europe-in-dangerous-ways\">How coronavirus is reshaping Europe in dangerous ways</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most EU countries maintain controls and quarantine regulations on new entrants.

Denmark is opening its borders to Germany, but <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20200515/danish-parties-ready-to-reopen-border-to-germany-but-not-to-sweden\">not to Sweden</a> \u2013 despite Sweden\u2019s southernmost region having a lower infection than across the Oresund bridge in Copenhagen.</p> <p>This chaotic mosaic of measures not only lacks any solid health justification \u2013 as repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-recommendations-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-covid-19-outbreak\">stated</a> by the WHO \u2013 but also contradicts what the European Union is about.</p> <p>EU citizens have the right to the same legal treatment across the union, free from any form of discrimination. So when France imposes mandatory quarantine on those arriving from Spain, but not from other countries, it is actually discriminating among EU citizens. This is equally true for Portugal whose borders are <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/portugal-to-help-emigrants-to-return-for-summer-vacations/\">selectively reopening</a> vis-a-vis \u201cthose countries with the greatest number of Portuguese\u201d. A similar discriminatory pattern also exists in Hungary which <a href=\"https://konzuliszolgalat.kormany.hu/information-on-hungarian-entry-requirements-due-to-covid-19-situation\">exempts</a> from its border controls the nationals of the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Austria, and Slovakia. Proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/what-is-the-future-for-travel-and-immigration-in-age-of-covid-19\">travel bubbles</a>, such as the Baltic bubble \u2013 allowing free travel between across the three Baltic countries also raise discriminatory concerns.</p> <p>Letting EU countries re-establish borders was wrong in the first place. Border controls \u2013 as well as selective quarantine regimes \u2013 reflect an artificial, misleading attempt at resorting to nationality as the dividing line between the healthy and unhealthy. The nation state is not the right geographical or administrative unit with which to counter a virus that is not only borderless, but also doesn\u2019t spread uniformly within any country\u2019s territory. That\u2019s why the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_freemovement.pdf\">recommended</a> lifting restrictions \u201cin areas with a comparable epidemiological situation\u201d \u2013 in other words regions, not countries.</p> <p>Ultimately the maintenance of border checks reveals an alarming lack of trust among EU countries, instigated by provisional data that lacks any comparability on how each of them handled the pandemic. Unwinding these different national measures will take some time and leave scars on \u201cpatient Europe\u201d. As such, they risk fuelling nationalist sentiments that were diluted by decades of European integration.</p> <p>As the summer approaches, the reopening of Schengen is driven more by the urge to let holidaymakers and tourists spend money than the need to ensure that EU citizens can pursue cross-border lives. But a border-free Europe is not the prerogative of tourists and interrail travellers. Free movement is an existential precondition for millions of citizens living, commuting, parenting and therefore regularly travelling between jurisdictions.</p> <p>The aim should not be the return to the status quo but to update and strengthen the travel-free zone to avoid it being suspended again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d1d524b7297911a69ee1d01a0812da5e308402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d1d524b7297911a69ee1d01a0812da5e308402/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A German border police officers checks the documentation of a driver at a checkpoint at the German-French border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A German border police officer checks the documentation of a driver at a checkpoint at the German-French border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Niederm\u00fcller/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We Europeans were sold a dream.

I think the CDC is going to put something out very soon, spoke to them today. I think they are going to put something out very soon.

Cut to seven months later and we\u2019re in eerily similar territory with the unceremoniously dumped Body Cam, a buzzy Paramount project that\u2019s been given a hushed digital launch instead, a response to the ongoing closure of cinemas but also perhaps the underwhelming box office of the aforementioned. While it\u2019s far from the firestarter it could have been, there\u2019s more to this than its release would suggest, an angry, slickly directed thriller that still manages to generate enough of a spark.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/20/the-lovebirds-review-netflix-issa-rae-kumail-nanjiani-michael-showalter\">The Lovebirds review \u2013 wacky Netflix murder-mystery romance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While there are clear commonalities between the two (black female lead, ripped-from-the-headlines subject matter, impoverished setting, uncomfortable racial tension), Body Cam takes the elements of a cop drama and implants them into a horror film, a brave gambit that halfway works, nobly trying something fresh by mashing together two genres that can feel rather stale. At times the film\u2019s two sides loudly clash, leaping from hokey to hard-boiled with unease, but in its finer moments, when director Malik Vitthal really finds his groove, there\u2019s a sense of dread that binds both genres, reminding us that a shadowy supernatural villain can be just as frightening as a reckless cop with a gun.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt1hodBObHw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lt1hodBObHw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>LAPD officer Renee (Mary J Blige) is headed back on the streets after losing her temper with a civilian who questioned the legitimacy of her blackness, a fuzzily explained altercation that took place not long after her young son died in a drowning accident. While we as viewers wait for Hollywood to come up with a tragic backstory for female characters that doesn\u2019t involve the death of a child, Renee finds herself embroiled in a confounding puzzle involving the grisly murders of cops she works with, each recorded in part via cameras.</p> <p>While other reviews, and bizarrely even the film\u2019s Wikipedia logline, have revealed the specificities of the mystery at the centre of Body Cam, I\u2019m inclined to be less obvious because while not exactly a twist, it\u2019s partly the not knowing that propels the plot, Richmond Riedel and Nicholas McCarthy\u2019s script prioritising the details of Renee\u2019s investigation over a parade of endless jump shocks. Where we\u2019re led roots Body Cam in reality, with a devastatingly familiar crime that starkly offsets what starts out as a film in danger of veering into #BlueLivesMatter territory. Like Black and Blue, Body Cam exists in a broken America we know all too well, and there\u2019s a pulsing rage felt throughout, established in an opening scene that has locals watch in dismay as another police officer evades conviction after killing an unarmed man of colour. The ghoulish force that haunts the community is a tangible manifestation of this anger and there\u2019s catharsis in how it strikes back.</p> <p>There are some effective scare sequences, the best of which comes near the start as Renee and her rookie partner (played by Death Note\u2019s Nat Wolff) look for clues in a creepy rundown house, with Vitthal maintaining a confident control over his pacing, achieving at least one deviously well-orchestrated jolt, but focusing more on a sustained atmosphere. Vitthal\u2019s accomplished direction is the film\u2019s inarguable ace while, sadly, his lead Blige is merely competent in comparison. She underplays, which at times works given her steely profession, but at other moments, it\u2019s a misjudged tactic, especially as she witnesses supernatural happenings on tape, a subdued expression barely registering the otherworldly horror in front of her. It\u2019s not exactly a bad performance but one wonders what a more skilled actor could have brought to the role, one more adept at balancing the extremities of the film, juggling an emotional backstory as well as dealing with the wilder, more fantastical elements.</p> <p>There\u2019s an ambitious attempt here to create the sort of mythology that could kickstart a franchise, an unlikely proposition given Body Cam\u2019s muted release. It\u2019s also sadly not the sharp, scary and socially aware genre mash-up it could have been given the ingredients, but watching Vitthal aim high and not quite make it is still preferable to watching so many other horror film-makers remain satisfied with lazy regurgitation. It\u2019s a failed gamble, but a gamble nonetheless.</p> <ul> <li><p>Body Cam is now available to rent digitally in the US and UK</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>When people ask me what kind of films I like, I never know what to say. I like everything! Total trash, high art, comedy, horror, British realism, Czech surrealism, Hong Kong action, Hungarian inaction, you name it. But if there\u2019s one kind of film I\u2019ve never really loved, it\u2019s westerns. Sure, I\u2019ve seen some great ones, but as a genre it has never really appealed. I\u2019m not American. I\u2019m not into guns. And the demonisation and slaughter of indigenous peoples doesn\u2019t really grab me.</p> <p>Most of all, I\u2019ve never really liked John Wayne. I think of him as the personification of humourless, swaggering, macho Hollywood conservatism: a supporter of McCarthyite anti-communist witch hunts, gun rights, the Vietnam war, Ronald Reagan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/20/john-wayne-racist-homophobic-views-1971-playboy-interview\">white supremacism</a>. (In a 1971 Playboy interview Wayne said, \u201cI believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility.\u201d) And I recall anecdotes about how he stole his whole drawling cowboy shtick off the veteran stuntman Yakima Canutt. He did have a great voice, though.</p> <p>All of this goes some way to explaining why I\u2019ve never seen The Searchers, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/searchers-ford-action\">its reputation</a> as the greatest western \u2013 if not one of the greatest movies \u2013 ever. I\u2019ve never seen any of John Ford\u2019s movies, in fact. Maybe if I watch it I\u2019ll finally fall in love with the genre? As Wayne might put it, that\u2019ll be the day.</p> <p>I broadly knew the plot of The Searchers already: white girl is kidnapped by Native Americans; John Wayne goes off looking for her. For a long time. I\u2019m not sure if he finds her but I\u2019m willing to bet he finds himself. I\u2019d factored in a little outdated prejudice, but oh my God, The Searchers is one of the most fantastically racist movies I\u2019ve ever seen!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/12/ive-never-seen-the-magnificent-seven\">I've never seen \u2026\u00a0The Magnificent Seven</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Things start out well enough. The opening shot is a wonder to behold. Here\u2019s the silhouette of a woman in the doorway of her wooden cabin, emerging on to a dazzlingly sunlit porch and one of the most iconic views in cinema: Monument Valley. The landscape throughout the film is jaw-dropping. America is just stunningly beautiful; add in Technicolor and VistaVision and it looks hyperreally perfect: cornflower-blue skies like a touched-up vintage postcard, the deep, rich hues of rock and wood. Ford makes terrific use of the landscape, rhyming the isolated peaks with his rugged, isolated characters in the frame. The horsework (that\u2019s a technical term) is also amazing: orchestrated streams of riders surge across the screen, scaling precipices and plummeting down them. The action is epic and all the more exciting for the lack of fakery (although is it speeded up?). There probably aren\u2019t enough skilled stunt riders to do this kind of thing any more.</p> <p>But then there\u2019s Wayne. Everyone is in high spirits when his character Ethan returns from the civil war (albeit under suspicious circumstances), until he reminds them what an unapologetic racist he is. When Ethan\u2019s adoptive nephew Martin \u2013 who is an eighth Cherokee \u2013 sits down at the dinner table, Ethan goes all surly. \u201cA fella could mistake you for a half-breed,\u201d he sneers. Ethan hates the \u201cInjuns\u201d with a passion, even before they come and ransack the family homestead and make off with two young women. He knows a surprising amount about their culture, but has no respect for it. When he finds a dead Comanche, he shoots out his eyes so that he won\u2019t be able \u201cto wander the spirit lands\u201d. He\u2019d fit right in at Abu Ghraib. I\u2019m not warming to him.</p> <p>As well as a racist, Ethan is an asshole. Not just to Martin; to everyone. He\u2019s quick to punch people or chuck stuff at them. He gets sulky when he\u2019s not in charge. He\u2019s also utterly lacking in compassion. Look how he delivers the news to fellow searcher Brad that he has found the corpse of his fiancee, Lucy. When Brad asks for more details, Ethan flies into a rage: \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Draw you a picture? Don\u2019t ever ask me!\u201d Like <em>he\u2019s</em> the real victim.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Ethan, though, The Searchers as a whole seems to hate them Injuns. The plot contrives to demonise them from the outset by barely identifying them as individuals and having them kidnap innocent white girls, thus affording Wayne and co a patch of moral high ground they don\u2019t really deserve. Running through the film is a deep-seated paranoia about racial purity. Any dilution of whiteness is considered mortifying, from Martin\u2019s \u201chalf-breed\u201d status to the traumatised captives Ethan helps liberate, but considers ruined by their exposure to the Comanches. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re white,\u201d a cavalryman says. \u201cThey ain\u2019t any more,\u201d snarls Ethan. The same applies to the missing Debbie; Ethan\u2019s obsession is driven by a desire not to rescue her, but to kill her for going over to the other side.</p> <p>There are only two significant Native American characters: Scar, the mysterious chief of the kidnapping Comanche tribe (intriguingly played by blue-eyed Jewish actor Henry Brandon) who at least gets to explain that he has lost sons to white enemies; and Look (Beulah Archuletta), the bride Martin mistakenly acquires during a bartering session. This is the only thing in the movie that makes Wayne\u2019s character laugh. Look inexplicably dotes on Martin, smiling coyly, batting her eyelashes at him and serving him coffee. He literally boots her out of his bed (which Ethan finds hilarious). Look is later killed in a raid, which is convenient for Martin\u2019s marriage prospects. Martin\u2019s whole romantic subplot is played as jaunty comedy, and doesn\u2019t really sit with well the heavy central story.</p> <p>In its defence, the film hardly portrays Ethan as a hero. He\u2019s clearly a psycho as well as a racist haunted by past traumas, ultimately becoming the \u201csavage\u201d he views the Native Americans to be. So you could argue The Searchers is more a study of racism than a racist movie. But is that good enough? When the hero\u2019s climactic moment of change is his decision not to kill his niece for not being white enough, that\u2019s not really saying a lot, is it? It\u2019s the old, \u201cIsn\u2019t it great how this objectionable racist has become slightly less racist?\u201d \u2013 a device that\u2019s still in use today (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/30/green-book-review-mahershala-ali-viggo-mortensen-peter-farrelly\">Green Book</a>). That might have made white America feel better about itself in 1956, with the second world war a recent memory and the civil rights struggle heating up, but it wasn\u2019t enough to wash the sour taste out of my mouth today.</p> <p>All the same, I have to admire Wayne for agreeing to play such an unappealing character. He commands the screen effortlessly, never overselling Ethan\u2019s torment and obsession. Is my dislike of him driven by my own prejudices? If so, I\u2019m no better than him. If not, then it\u2019s down to the strength of his performance. Either way, I was wrong. Reading up afterwards, I discover that during the shoot, Wayne found Beulah Archuletta crying alone in a tent one day. It turned out she was going to miss her son\u2019s wedding. Wayne promptly halted production and flew Archuletta back to California so she could attend. Perhaps there\u2019s a soul beneath that leathery machismo after all.</p> <p>The Searchers might not be the beginning of my love affair with westerns, but I\u2019m not some saddle-sore old grouch who\u2019s happy to plod on, stewing in my own resentment. No: like Ethan, I can change. Maybe there\u2019s another western out there that will cement my appreciation for the genre. I\u2019ll keep on searching. It may take some time.</p>",

  "<p>Liz Mitchell was on her laptop in her living room in Eugene, Oregon, when she got the news. Thousands of miles away, on a Taiwanese fishing boat, a fishery observer named Eritara Aati Kaierua had been found dead.</p> \n<p>Details were scant. The ship\u2019s name (Win Far No 636), the dead man\u2019s passport number, and where the boat was now headed: the port of Kiribati, a central Pacific island nation on the equator.</p> \n<p>But for Mitchell, president of the Association of Professional Observers (APO), it was sadly nothing new \u2013 another death, devoid of facts.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve recorded one or two deaths of fishery observers every year since 2015,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cAll with the same outcome: no information.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"169cd14a5c0569f4a7e883e6c5031f7f7c8aaf5d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169cd14a5c0569f4a7e883e6c5031f7f7c8aaf5d/0_0_600_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Mitchell\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Mitchell advocates on behalf of fishery observers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Liz Mitchell</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her non-profit organisation advocates on behalf of this little-known workforce of ocean watchdogs, who have suffered a rash of disappearances and unexplained deaths that experts say is no coincidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe playbook of each disappearance or death is the same. The news leaks out from unofficial sources. The families are told: \u2018We\u2019re looking into it.\u2019 They hear nothing. They express grief and anger and they are overwhelmed with questions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mitchell fired off emails about Kaierua to officials, urging investigators to examine the potential for foul play or medical neglect, and to preserve critical evidence. On 25 March, Kiribati police said a pathologist had found that Kaierua, a 40-year-old father of four, had died from a traumatic brain injury. They were treating his death as murder.</p> \n<p>The tragedy brought the tally of deaths or disappearances at sea among this vulnerable workforce to nine since 2015, including a Ghanaian observer whose disappearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/16/ghana-fisheries-observer-vanishes\">was reported</a> by the Guardian last year.</p> \n<p>Independent fishery observers have one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. They travel aboard fishing vessels, tracking catches \u2013 including any bycatch of endangered species \u2013 in order to preserve fish stocks. Their job, if done properly, can pit them against hostile crew, particularly if they spot activities such as illegal fishing, trafficking or shark finning. Harassment and intimidation are common.</p> \n<p>To make matters worse, jurisdictional responsibilities at sea are complex: many ships fish in international waters, or fly the flags of countries reluctant to bring prosecutions. There is no international protocol for investigating the death of an observer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"355e856d8bcff78fd17fa745d794c36a8e3d0d60\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/355e856d8bcff78fd17fa745d794c36a8e3d0d60/0_0_743_419/500.jpg\" alt=\"Eritara Aati Kaierua\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fishery observer Eritara Aati Kaierua reportedly died from a a brain injury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In many cases observers are operating unprotected, according to a<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200218124407.htm\"> report </a>in February by Greenpeace, the APO and the University of New York.

Following pressure from the US fishing industry, claiming observers carry a threat of infection, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issues temporary waivers on the federal requirement for fishing vessels to carry observers.</p> \n<p>In an open letter last month, 19 NGOs including Greenpeace and WWF expressed concern about this development, saying any relaxation of monitoring and surveillance of commercial fisheries would allow more illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which already accounts for $23.5bn (\u00a318.8bn) and one in five wild-caught marine fish.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"708bfb4f2e6eb43e63dda4036629f736150b4c4e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/708bfb4f2e6eb43e63dda4036629f736150b4c4e/0_0_2500_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Longline fishing vessels caught illegally transferring fish at sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Longline fishing vessels caught illegally transferring fish at sea.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The very reason fishery observers are needed \u2013 the difficulty of seeing what happens aboard ships in international waters \u2013 is also what makes them vulnerable. While global data is scarce, a 2016 survey of alleged incidents reported by US observers, obtained via freedom of information requests by the APO and Public Employees for Public Responsibility (Peer), found that reports of alleged harassment from 2013 to 2015 had <a href=\"https://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/assaults-on-fisheries-observers-more-than-double-in-two-years-with-no-reported-enforcement/\">more than doubled</a>, rising from 35 to 84. </p> \n<p>Preliminary findings of a similar survey for 2017 and 2018 suggest the problem is continuing.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is difficult to get a picture of trends at this stage, but I can say harassment is a continuing problem,\u201d says Kevin Bell, a staff lawyer at Peer based in Washington, DC.</p> \n<p>After reporting a spike in observer sexual assault and harassment claims earlier this year, the NOAA said it was hiring more investigators and victims\u2019 advocates to respond and had introduced a prevention programme.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the NOAA said the spike was reflective of it monitoring allegations for the first time. It reported 23 allegations of sexual assault and harassment against observers in 2018 and 15 in 2019.</p> \n<p>The deaths/disappearance of three observers, including US citizens Keith Davis and Josh Sheldon in 2015 and 2016, and Usaia Masibalavu, a Fijian who was working on a US-flagged vessel, also in 2016, prompted the NOAA to carry out a safety review in 2018.
