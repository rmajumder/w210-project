Asked about Obama \u201cslamming\u201d the administration for its response to the coronavirus outbreak, he said: \u201cI think President Obama should have kept his mouth shut.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, we know he doesn\u2019t like much this administration is doing. That\u2019s understandable. But I think it\u2019s a little bit classless frankly to critique an administration that comes after you.</p> <p>\u201cYou had your shot. You were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bushes set up of not critiquing the president who comes after you is a good tradition.\u201d</p> <p>There is indeed a tradition of former presidents not commenting on or attacking their successors in the Oval Office, but Trump is, to put it lightly, not part of the informal club which currently includes Obama, George W Bush*, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and has regularly attacked those who went before.</p> <p>Plus, Obama\u2019s views of Trump are pretty well known, if by indirect routes. For example, in a Hulu documentary about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign against Trump, the Virginia senator Tim Kaine is seen to say the then president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/obama-warned-trump-fascist-2016-hulu-film-hillary-clinton-sundance\">thinks Trump is a fascist</a>.</p> <p>In the remarks leaked to Yahoo News, Obama said he would be hitting the campaign trail for Joe Biden this fall. Biden leads Trump in swing states and national polls and Obama is a proven campaigner, to say the least. McConnell is presiding over a Republican Senate majority that looks increasingly at risk. Everything is politics, folks.</p> <p><em>*Fun George W Bush note: the 43rd president is widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/30/sidney-blumenthal-abraham-lincoln-donald-trump\">reported</a>, while on the podium at Trump\u2019s inauguration, to have leant over to a neighbour after the new president\u2019s dystopian \u201cAmerican Carnage\u201d speech and labelled it \u201csome weird shit\u201d.

If a man is under 70 and has diabetes or heart disease or kidney disease, which is a substantial proportion of the population, we need a clear message that nothing has changed.</p> <p>\u201cWe all know people at work who have these conditions. It is a given. These are exactly the people who we need to give clear guidance to.\u201d</p> <p>Someone who is on the minimum wage and has COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder), who is at high risk of sickness or death from coronavirus, may otherwise head back to work, Banerjee warned.</p> <p>Union leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/recipe-for-chaos-trade-union-leaders-warn-against-return-to-work-lockdown-coronavirus\">voiced concerns over</a> Boris Johnson\u2019s exhortations to people in manufacturing and other jobs that cannot be done from home to return to work from Wednesday.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics this week showed that people in some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/manual-workers-likelier-to-die-from-covid-19-than-professionals\">lowest-skilled occupations had the highest death rates</a>, with 21.4 deaths per 100,000 men. Men working as security guards had one of the highest rates, with 45.7 deaths per 100,000.</p> <p>In their study, Banerjee and colleagues have calculated the number of over-30s who have underlying conditions and are likely to die either from Covid-19 or because they are not seeking the treatment they need.</p> <p>They look at three scenarios: doing nothing in the hope of creating herd immunity, which would lead to up to 80% of the population becoming infected; mitigation, which was the strategy before the lockdown, when people were asked to keep their distance and wash their hands, which is presumed to have led to a 10% infection rate; and suppression during the lockdown.</p> <p>Returning to an infection rate of 10% would lead to 37,000 deaths over the year if the relative risk of dying is twice that people with underlying conditions usually run. It is 73,000 if the risk is tripled. The relative risk of death from the virus is currently uncertain.</p> <p>Prof Harry Hemingway, senior author, said: \u201cVaccines and drugs will take time to develop and evaluate. What works right now is two things. Firstly keeping the population infection rate as low as possible, and avoiding infection in the people at highest risk (direct effects of infection).</p> <p>\u201cSecondly we need to continue to deliver high-quality medical care to vulnerable people to prevent excess deaths in those who are not infected with coronavirus (indirect effects of the emergency).\u201d</p> <p>Sarah Harper, professor of gerontology at the University of Oxford, said it was an important paper showing how taking account of combinations of age and underlying conditions might show some people to be more vulnerable to Covid-19 than those on the official extremely vulnerable list.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, a man aged 66-70 years with no underlying conditions is not currently considered high-risk. Yet he has a higher background one-year mortality (1.07%) than that of a woman aged 56-60 years with one underlying condition (0.91%), who is considered high-risk. Similarly, it shows that generally women\u2019s mortality risk at any given age is the same as men\u2019s who are around five years younger,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe blanket and arbitrary use of age \u2013 for example age 70 as a rough cut-off for the high-risk mortality category \u2013 has been questioned by many already. This paper highlights the difference between men and women, and the importance of identifying underlying health conditions.</p> <p>\u201cImportantly, the authors suggest that this enables a publicly available tool for individuals to use to develop better understanding of who is at risk based on reliable health data. The association between population risk and individual risk is complex, but a transparent public health approach enabling people to understand the evidence behind government messages would be welcomed by many.\u201d</p> <p>It comes after warnings that the 2.5 million who are shielding themselves, and their family members, face an \u201cimpossible choice\u201d between paying the bills and their health. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">extended the furlough scheme</a> but the 2.5 million \u2013 as well as people living with them \u2013 do not have an automatic right to be paid via the scheme, it emerged.</p>",

But Barnhill had already advised police \u201cthat he did not see grounds for the arrest of any of the individuals involved in Mr Arbery\u2019s death\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/ahmaud-arbery-father-marcus-georgia-running\">'They lynched him': Ahmaud Arbery's father on the killing of his son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Weeks after Carr appointed him to the case, and just a few days before recusing himself on 7 April over a conflict of interest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/every-stone-will-be-uncovered-how-georgia-officials-failed-the-ahmaud-arbery-case\">Barnhill wrote that the McMichaels</a> \u201cwere following, in \u2018hot pursuit\u2019, a burglary suspect, with solid first-hand probable cause, in their neighborhood, and asking/telling him to stop.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears their intent was to stop and hold this criminal suspect until law enforcement arrived. Under Georgia law this is perfectly legal,\u201d Barnhill advised in the undated letter to Tom Jump, a Glynn county police captain. County officials released the letter last week.</p> <p>Johnson said she could not recall if she had told Carr\u2019s office that she had enlisted Barnhill\u2019s help before recusing herself. Barnhill had the case for about a month before he stepped aside under pressure because his son works for Johnson as an assistant prosecutor. The phone at Barnhill\u2019s office in Waycross rang unanswered Tuesday.</p> <p>Tom Durden, the district attorney in nearby Hinesville, next took the case and had it for more than three weeks before the video became public and he called in the GBI. On Monday, Carr replaced him with the Cobb county district attorney, Joyette M Holmes, one of only seven black district attorneys in Georgia.</p> <p>She is based in Atlanta, far from the coastal community where the shooting happened, and is \u201ca respected attorney with experience, both as a lawyer and a judge\u201d, said Carr, a Republican.</p> <p>According to the police report, Gregory McMichael said Arbery attacked his son before the younger McMichael shot him. The autopsy showed Arbery was hit by three shotgun blasts. All three shots can be heard on the video, which clearly shows the final shot hitting Arbery at point-blank range before he staggers and falls face down.</p> <p>Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, have been jailed since Thursday. Neither had lawyers at their first court appearances. With courts largely closed because of the coronavirus, a grand jury cannot be called to hear the case until mid-June.</p>",

Some restrictions are being eased, as confidence grows that the outbreak has been brought under control. There have been five deaths.</p></li> <li><p><strong>French Pacific Territories</strong>: The number of cases remains at 18 for New Caledonia and 60 for French Polynesia. In New Caledonia there have been calls for the borders to be closed to tourists until the end of the year to prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 infections. Meanwhile in French Polynesia authorities have said that anyone who is repatriated from France will have to go into quarantine for 14 days.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiji</strong>: With no new cases reported in three weeks, the total of infections in Fiji remains at 18, with no deaths. Fiji Airways has extended its ban on international flights until the end of June. The police have questioned the man who was the first confirmed case in the country amid allegations that he had provided wrong information to health authorities. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>: The number of confirmed cases remains at eight and authorities have stepped up antibody testing with the aim of testing 12,000 people. As of Monday, five people from three different mine sites had tested positive to the antibody testing. Samples from each of those cases have been sent for PCR testing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>West Papua: </strong>The cluster of cases associated with the Freeport mine continues to grow and this was reflected in the rise in cases reported in the province of Papua. The number of reported cases stands at 308 (as at May 11) with 7 deaths.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vanuatu: </strong>The country still has no infections. The director of health has said that there is still work to do to prepare in-country testing and management capacity ahead of repatriating stranded citizens and residents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Solomon Islands: </strong>There are no confirmed cases in the country. Work is ongoing to enhance readiness, including providing for in-country testing with GeneXpert cartridges that have been recently supplied by the WHO.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Samoa: </strong>There are no confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country but the economic impacts are being felt severely. Poverty is reported to have \u201csurged\u201d with the collapse of tourism. The industry is reported to provide 12% of employment in Samoa.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Tonga: </strong>Tonga has taken delivery of a third testing machine which has been donated by the WHO. There are no confirmed cases in the country and international borders remain closed.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nauru: </strong>This is one of the countries still receiving flights from overseas, although the service is limited to once per fortnight from Brisbane. There are currently around 30 people in quarantine across two sites.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Northern Mariana Islands: </strong>Increased levels of contact tracing have led to three new infections being identified.

As the country prepares to ease out of lockdown conditions, the state of emergency controller has transferred a number of powers to provincial authorities, including in Bougainville.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiji:</strong> Amid government claims of having screened around 700,000 people (around 75% of the population), with no new cases identified, authorities expect to declare the country Covid-free in the near future. The attorney general has called for Fiji to be included in a trans-Tasman travel bubble, citing Fiji\u2019s importance as a Pacific hub.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Solomon Islands:</strong> Authorities are struggling to ensure compliance with social and economic restrictions and have reported an increased number of breaches among the community. There has also been a noticeable drift of people returning to Honiara from provincial areas, including students to sit school exams and others who are looking for better economic opportunities than are available on outer islands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vanuatu:</strong> The council of ministers decided to <a href=\"https://dailypost.vu/news/30-day-soe-extension-approved/article_4c484408-90a7-11ea-98b2-cf6ba2d9da2b.html\">extend the state of emergency</a> for a further 30 days until 12 June as the country works to address multiple disasters including the impacts of tropical cyclone Harold in the north and a major ash-fall on Tanna in the south. Approximately 200 citizens and residents are stranded overseas awaiting details of how the government plans to repatriate them.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Samoa:</strong> The government has amended some of the state of emergency orders. Many aspects of daily life have resumed although subject to certain conditions. International borders remain closed. However, the government has announced that there will be four flights between Samoa and New Zealand during May for repatriation purposes only.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nauru:</strong> The government has provided a $A2.5m cash injection to Nauru Airlines to fund redundancy arrangements for 50 Brisbane-based staff. The company does not qualify for the Australian Jobkeeper scheme, which provides payments to stood down staff.</p></li> <li><p><strong>New Caledonia:</strong> The government is considering easing restrictions on the sale of alcohol from 1 June although this may be combined with a curfew focused on young people.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Northern Mariana Islands:</strong> It was reported on 7 May that community-based contact tracing was being suspended to allow for results to be returned in a more timely manner. The taskforce reported that 2,336 people had been processed during 11 days of testing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Niue:</strong> Despite no infections the government of Niue remains very cautious about exposure to risk and has extended all travel restrictions until August.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive this briefing as an email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-in-the-pacific\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus in the Pacific\" data-form-description=\"Get weekly insight from our expert journalists\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Australia and New Zealand</h2> <p>In Australia, there are just under 7,000 confirmed cases, but the country is regularly seeing fewer than 20 new cases a day.

Unable to congregate physically in Honolulu, Suva or other regional hubs, they have continued their discussions online, aided by a few shells of kava along the way.</p> <p>Don\u2019t want to miss an update? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/coronavirus-in-the-pacific-sign-up-for-weekly-email-updates\">Sign up to receive the Coronavirus in the Pacific weekly briefing</a> into your inbox each week.<br></p>",

He sparked a major online backlash, and trended on Twitter; US actor and writer Cindy Chu was among his critics, describing him as \u201csuper super racist\u201d.</p> <p>There was also extensive praise for him from those who find credence in his theories, though there is no consensus around the virus\u2019s origins, even its basis in Wuhan.</p>",

  "<p>Before they were care home residents, they were our factory workers, teachers, engineers and administrative workers.</p> <p>Some were singers, and some were boxers. Some were parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. Now they have died after contracting coronavirus in their homes.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that between 10 and 24 April, there were 4,343 recorded deaths from Covid-19 in residential care homes. Meanwhile, frustration among operators, staff and relatives that the government has underestimated the seriousness of the spread of the virus in care continues to grow.</p> <p>Here are the stories of some of those who have died.</p> <p><strong>Pete Carney, 77</strong></p> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Hartshill, Staffordshire<br><strong>Date of death: </strong>2 May 2020</p> <p>Carney, who lived at the Belong care home in Newcastle-under-Lyme and had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, first became ill with the virus in mid-April. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he was admitted to Royal Stoke university hospital on 22 April. It was the last time his daughter, who was by his side in the ambulance and casualty, would see him. He died on Saturday 2 May.</p> <p>Ruth Carney, 43, a television and theatre director, said her father was an inspirational figure for many. \u201cHe was a union man and believed in people being treated fairly. His drive and ambition is where I got mine from.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cMy next door neighbour was a builder and he got in touch and said, \u2018the reason I went to university is because of your dad, he made me believe I could\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Carney also leaves behind his wife of 54 years, Kath.</p> <p><strong>Margaret Parkes, 94</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e8ad419e70b7df6dce8cd05dc746c2e0e6dd93a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8ad419e70b7df6dce8cd05dc746c2e0e6dd93a9/0_0_2154_2988/721.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Parkes\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Parkes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Location: </strong>Didsbury, Greater Manchester<br><strong>Date of death: </strong>29 April 2020</p> <p>Parkes, who grew up in Wigan and was the middle child of five, died on 29 April shortly after contracting the coronavirus.</p> <p>She trained as a junior nurse at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, nursing the troops during the later years of the second world war. She received a Florence Nightingale scholarship to travel to the US, researching mental health and social care in Washington and New York in the 1980s.</p> <p>Mark Thomas, a 43-year-old filmmaker and lecturer, described his great aunt as the life and soul of any social occasion. \u201cMargaret\u2019s energy enthused everyone around her. Fatima, Marina and the team of carers who supported Margaret while she was at home always stressed how important she was in their lives and she also cared and supported them at times.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret has met the Queen twice, once as a nurse and as an NHS governor. \u201cIn my mind, they were two peas in a pod. Despite hailing from Wigan, Margaret always spoke the Queen\u2019s English and I always imagine they would have got on like a house on fire over a game of Bridge,\u201d Thomas said.</p> <p>The lockdown had triggered a wartime spirit, Thomas added. \u201cShe was always one for a challenge, having faced world war two, being a midwife in 50s rural Scotland, the polio epidemic, 80s New York and countless other major and minor events.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Beryl Wood, 89</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"76bb8e9026d55c268a02c5ea2ec36248df26615e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76bb8e9026d55c268a02c5ea2ec36248df26615e/222_63_485_607/400.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Wood\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beryl Wood</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Location: </strong>Style, Chesire</p> <p><strong>Date of death: </strong>11 April 2020</p> <p>Wood, described as a talented woman who excelled at crafts, died at Eden Mansions in Styal, Cheshire shortly after contracting the coronavirus.</p> <p>Born in 1930, the war was still fresh in her memory, her son-in-law Richard Panter said. She was widowed young and brought up two daughters, Kathryn and Alison, on her own whilst pursuing a successful career as a primary school teacher and head. \u201cShe absolutely loved children and being a grandparent was a role she fulfilled to a prize-winning standard,\u201d Panter said.</p> <p>Due to the lockdown, the family hadn\u2019t been able to visit Wood for five weeks before she died. \u201cHer funeral, constrained as it was by the restrictions, was a thing of simple beauty,\u201d Panter added.

He had three sisters, two of whom are still living.</p> <p>Rod married Monica Holmes, and the couple moved to Cheltenham where he worked as a maintenance engineer for Walker Crosweller for over 45 years. They had four daughters \u2013 Debbie, Tracy, Tina and Jo \u2013 as well as seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p> <p>He followed horse racing closely, still picking out winners from newspapers as he developed dementia, and played cricket for both Stanton and Cheltenham Cavaliers. \u201cHe could always be found wearing his Arsenal baseball caps with pride \u2013 he was a true Gooner!\u201d added his daughter Tracy Adams.</p> <p>When his wife died two years ago, his family made the difficult decision to place him in a home. Sandfields went into lockdown at the start of the coronavirus crisis, meaning his family were only able to speak to him over Skype chats.</p> <p>Although Adams spoke to him the night before his death, there didn\u2019t seem be anything \u201cserious to be concerned about\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the next morning we received a phone call and Tina could hear in the background he was in distress, calling for \u2018his girls\u2019, and within a very short period of time, he had passed away.\u201d</p> <p>The family, who do not believe Rod was tested for coronavirus, were only informed a week later that Covid-19 had been given as his cause of death. Although Adams said they felt care home residents had been \u201cseverely let down\u201d, she praised the staff who looked after her dad for their efforts.</p> <p>\u201cHe was warm, generous and honest. We are heartbroken and miss him very much.

I thought: \u2018Oh come on and ask for my number!\u2019, and in the end I think I put it in his top pocket.\u201d</p> <p>The couple moved to Hythe and then Dymchurch in Kent, where Gardiner often looked after their granddaughter while Kathy and her daughter worked full-time. \u201cHe absolutely doted on her. He always used to call her \u2018the wee one\u2019 in that lovely Scottish way of his, and still did until the day he died,\u201d said Kathy, a former palliative nurse.</p> <p>He spent the last two years of his life living at Warren Lodge care home in Ashford after his health deteriorated. Although his wife visited him daily before the coronavirus crisis, she wasn\u2019t able to see him for two weeks before his death because of the lockdown.</p> <p>When he became ill with suspected coronavirus, Kathy said she fought \u201ctooth and nail to try and get him home\u201d but was unsuccessful in her attempts. \u201cThey just wouldn\u2019t tell me either way, I asked them if he was at the end of his life and one minute they said yes and the next minute they said no,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey held the phone up to him and I could hear him struggling for breath and I just knew.

They had two children, and two grandchildren.</p> <p>Pitman, who had a \u201cbubbly personality\u201d worked as both a home help for people who were ill and new mums, and as a salesperson in a clothes store. She loved celebrations, including family weddings and graduations \u2013 \u201cany excuse to put on a good frock and have a sing and dance,\u201d said Bob Pitman. \u201cShe enjoyed life and her easy smile could light the world around her.\u201d</p> <p>When her husband died, \u201cshe picked herself up\u201d from her grief, and would take daytrips in her car to visit her son and daughter, and holidayed abroad with friends and family. \u201cShe grew into herself and enjoyed life,\u201d added her son.</p> <p>Although age caught up with her, affecting her ability to both drive and walk, as well as her memory and hearing, she retained good relationships with neighbours and her church group.</p> <p>Last year, she moved into a care home but was determined to make it to 100. In late February, she began experiencing symptoms associated with coronavirus \u2013 including a cough, breathing difficulties and lack of appetite.</p> <p>Her family were able to visit on the day she died, holding her hand as she passed away. \u201cIt was an effort too far for mum and her last words to us were: \u2018love you, love you, love you\u2019 with a smile,\u201d said Bob.</p> <p><strong>Helen Mary Sanders, 93</strong></p> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Anerley, South London<br><strong>Date of death: </strong>3 May 2020</p> <p>\u201cOutgoing, eccentric and optimistic\u201d Sanders was born in Blackheath, south London, but grew up in Hove after being evacuated to Somerset with her mother and two sisters during the war.</p> <p>She left school early, and moved back to London in the 1950s, where she found work in coffee bars on Brompton Road. Then, after becoming a single mother to Anya Louize in the 1960s, took up live-in housekeeping and caring jobs which she would take her daughter along to. They moved 13 times, but eventually were given a council flat in a tower block in Swiss Cottage in the 1970s.</p> <p>\u201cDespite being homeless several times, she shielded me from any despair she must have felt and made everything into a magical adventure,\u201d said Louize. \u201cI still have a paper Christmas tree she drew and pinned up when we couldn\u2019t afford a tree.\u201d</p> <p>In later life, Sanders, who dreamt of becoming a singer or a dancer, became an usherette in theatres and cinemas so she could watch the shows for free. She also sold collectables and bric-a-brac at the Portobello and Covent Garden markets, and resided in Belsize Park, where she could often be spotted in cafes in a pink or blue beret, talking to everyone.</p> <p>Into her 70s and 80s, she would trek across London to visit her \u201cadored\u201d three grandchildren, laden with gifts for everyone despite living hand to mouth. But when she could no longer manage at home after developing dementia, and needed 24-hour care, she moved to a care home close to her daughter\u2019s house.</p> <p>\u201cI took her out regularly but the carers told me she called for me every day, which was heartbreaking - my sense of guilt was immense,\u201d said Louize.</p> <p>\u201cI finally managed to get in and see her towards the end to say goodbye - I really appreciate it as so many have been unable to see their own loved ones. I am so grateful to the amazing staff who cared for her with such compassion and were so kind to me on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>The family have opted for a direct cremation while restrictions are in place on funerals during the pandemic, but plan to scatter her ashes out to sea in Brighton, where she loved to swim.

Kids who lived on the same street as us would constantly be round the house because she would constantly have a table with crafts out on it.\u201d</p> <p>It was only when Standard\u2019s dad, Ken, died in January 2015, that she realised how unwell her mother was. A couple of months later, Varley moved into Beauvale care home in Bingham, where she would still regularly receive visits from Standard, her husband, David, and their sons Charlie, 11, and Archie, 7.</p> <p>For much of the last five years, Varley remained fit and active despite her deteriorating mental health. \u201cShe\u2019d be setting the table, doing the laundry with the carers \u2013 she thought she was there as a carer for the other residents,\u201d said Standard.</p> <p>In mid-March, the home went into lockdown, although relatives were still able to keep in touch via Zoom meetings. Varley became ill in early April after two residents had tested positive for the virus.</p> <p>\u201cI was under no illusion. She was 80, she had dementia, she\u2019d not got that long. But she was still pretty well,\u201d said Standard. Before Varley died on 16 April, the home told Standard it would provide her with PPE so she could see her mother, but she did not make it in time. \u201cIt was absolutely heart-rending,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Now, Varley\u2019s family feel they are in \u201climbo\u201d, having opted for a direct cremation rather than a physically distanced funeral. But they hope to host a celebration of her life after lockdown where they will play recordings from the 1950s of her singing choral music. \u201cShe had this beautiful soprano voice. The records are crackly, but we\u2019re hoping to get them transferred,\u201d said Standard.</p> <p><strong>Jacques Kirk, 98 </strong></p> <p><strong>Location: </strong>St Albans, Hertfordshire<br><strong>Date of death: </strong>6 April 2020</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2188a3a3303f06871c3c3452a249da7600902a94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2188a3a3303f06871c3c3452a249da7600902a94/0_212_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacques Kirk, who died aged 96 in a care home in St Albans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacques Kirk, who died aged 96 in a care home in St Albans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: supplied by family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kirk, who was born in Australia in 1922 to an English father and French mother, was brought up in France from the age of two until the start of the second world war when his family fled to the UK.</p> <p>Although he was \u201cself-effacing\u201d, he went on to have a successful career in engineering despite not having a university education \u2013 starting with working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in Farnborough during the war.

We need more tee times than usual simply because of the restriction to two balls whereas people could typically play in fours.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy Tomlinson, the England Golf chief executive, admitted that most clubs would have liked more time to prepare but everyone in golf was \u201cworking their backsides off\u201d to make sure they were ready in some form to accommodate groups of two going out from early on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe are so excited that we can start again,\u201d he added. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, the majority of those 1,800 golf courses will be open on Wednesday. I don\u2019t know what the exact percentage will be but I think it will be very high. Golf clubs, no matter what their size, will want to get back on the journey to financial stability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/07/paul-jubb-andy-murray-british-tennis-talent\">Paul Jubb puts faith in Andy Murray as he plots unconventional path</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is golfer pressure, and not just from the 640,000 golf club members, but there\u2019s another two million who play golf avidly who want to get back to playing. So there\u2019s a great incentive for golf clubs to reopen.\u201d</p> <p>Tomlinson admitted that many courses will reap no financial benefit from the initial reopening process, with clubhouses and pro shops remaining closed until the latter stages of the lockdown exit plan.</p> <p>\u201cWithout exception, the golf courses in England have been exemplary throughout this time, but the majority of them are creaking under the financial strain,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have furloughed staff, they\u2019ve carried out essential maintenance, the general managers and clubs pros have worked together and worked with us in trying to make sure golf courses could reopen at any point.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, there will be no socialising at the 19th hole for a while yet, while the same tough social distancing guidance also means that post-tennis drinks are still a long way off too. As the advice on the LTA\u2019s website reminds players: \u201cDo not congregate after playing. No extra-curricular or social activity should take place.\u201d Even so, after seven weeks of being unable to hit a ball in anger, stepping on to court or the first tee will feel like blessed relief.</p>",
  "<p>Care home operators have accused the UK government of \u201ca complete system failure\u201d over testing for Covid-19 after officials repeatedly deflected responsibility for the task and left vulnerable residents unchecked.</p> \n<p>As ministers admitted it will be more than three weeks before all homes are offered tests, care home managers said lives have been put at risk and conditions for dementia sufferers worsened because of the government\u2019s failure so far to test hundreds of thousands of staff and residents.</p> \n<p>The programme was announced by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, two weeks ago but only tens of thousands of people have been tested.</p> \n<p>Public Health England (PHE), the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) have repeatedly passed the buck about who should carry out the tests, according to correspondence with care homes seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>In one email to a care manager sent on Thursday a CQC official admitted to \u201ccontinued confusion\u201d in the system.</p> \n<p>Matthew Nutt, managing director of Accurocare which runs homes in Oxford and Basingstoke, was told eight times by PHE that CQC was responsible for the programme and four times by CQC that it was PHE\u2019s job.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe left hand doesn\u2019t know what the right is doing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Last Thursday a DHSC official told him PHE was in charge and another said it was CQC. That contradicted what CQC told him 24 hours earlier: that its involvement in testing care staff ended on 25 April.</p> \n<p>His organisation has been trying to obtain about 200 tests since 28 April, when Hancock announced that testing for all care workers and residents would be available regardless of whether they are showing symptoms of coronavirus. So far he has received none.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday Hancock claimed \u201cthe performance on testing has been unbelievably positive\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has been a complete system failure,\u201d said Nutt. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we are going to get test kits. The government\u2019s plan to lift the lockdown says all homes will have testing by 6 June. It\u2019s far too slow.

Care home fatalities increased to almost 10,000 in the UK on Tuesday. </p> \n<p>When Nottingham Community Housing Association (NCHA) tried to get tests for its care home residents and staff, a PHE official said it didn\u2019t know anything about testing residents, before pointing them to the CQC. PHE then changed its mind again saying it would send the tests, but when they failed to arrive, PHE reversed again saying CQC was responsible.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is very frustrating because we can\u2019t effectively manage the risk without knowing [who has the virus],\u201d said Holly Dagnall, director of homes and wellbeing at NCHA.</p> \n<p>John Guy, chairman of the trustees of the Fairfield care home in Oxford, also said his facility had requested swabs for home testing four times since Hancock\u2019s announcement but none had arrived. Previously his staff had been told to drive 60 miles to Twickenham to a testing centre.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s shadow care minister, Liz Kendall, said the accounts revealed \u201ctotal chaos\u201d in the system.</p> \n<p>\u201cWeeks into this epidemic ministers still haven\u2019t got to grips with the basics of testing residents and staff,\u201d she said. \u201cReports from the frontline show total chaos as national bodies squabble over who is responsible, leaving care home managers and staff struggling to cope. The government\u2019s own \u2018recovery strategy\u2019 document says they won\u2019t guarantee every care home will even be offered testing until 6 June.

Gorham, who would go on to represent the Republic of Ireland 11 times, is wearing her old Dundalk shirt, because \u201cthat is how much it means\u201d.</p> <p>The game, which Corinthians won 7-1 on 10 May 1970, was played on the Raceway because women\u2019s football was still banned from association-affiliated grounds in Wales and became hugely significant for women\u2019s football on both sides of the Irish Sea.</p> <p>\u201cDundalk was a founding member of the Women\u2019s FA [in 1969], which governed women\u2019s football in England. It was the only club from outside England to be part of that event. Which was quite momentous,\u201d explains Helena Byrne, a librarian who has dedicated much of her free time to researching the history of women\u2019s football in Ireland. \u201cHow do a team from Dundalk, of all places, not Dublin, where we\u2019d had more soccer teams, become part of that?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21ef3dd5e9bb4c04a8ccd27c70b7d1f06c5e43bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21ef3dd5e9bb4c04a8ccd27c70b7d1f06c5e43bf/628_358_2178_1307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the 1970 Corinthians team, Margaret Shepherd, Anne Grimes, Pauline Quayle and Margaret Whitworth, meet the England women\u2019s coach, Phil Neville\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the 1970 Corinthians team, Margaret Shepherd, Anne Grimes, Pauline Quayle and Margaret Whitworth, meet Phil Neville, the England women\u2019s coach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dr Gary James</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As far as the limited research is able to show women\u2019s football was not \u201cas popular all over the island as it was in Britain,\u201d says Byrne. \u201cBecause Ireland was largely an agricultural society and traditionally soccer is seen as an urban sport.\u201d</p> <p>There is no evidence to suggest women\u2019s football was ever banned in Ireland as it was elsewhere in the early 1920s. The Belfast-based Irish Football Association and the newer Dublin-based Football Association of Ireland spent their energies grappling for jurisdiction over the whole island.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Republic of Ireland\u2019s Fianna F\u00e1il government brought in legislation that restricted the types of jobs women could apply for. \u201c[In 1937] we had the Irish constitution that stated that a women\u2019s place was in the home and the state would endeavour to do all they could to ensure that. That\u2019s still in our constitution,\u201d says Byrne.</p> <p>In England, women\u2019s football began to grow in industrialised workplaces during the war but, because women were staying at home in Ireland, the sport developed much later. \u201cWhen youth employment went up in the 1960s and more women started to work they got introduced to the indoor soccer leagues in the workplaces,\u201d says Byrne.</p> <p>\u201cEvery Sunday we would play our League of Ireland games before the Dundalk men\u2019s team and we would only play 30 minutes a half in those days,\u201d recalls Gorham. \u201cHalf-time, during the gents\u2019 game, we would go around with buckets and tickets and anything else we could find to sell. That\u2019s how we generated our finances.</p> <p>\u201cTo go to Prestatyn we held quiz nights and different events to generate the money together. It was quite expensive, most of us came from big families and our parents couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p> <p>Playing the Corinthians was an experience. \u201cWe were kind of shocked and stunned, because we never lost any of our games at home,\u201d says Gorham. \u201cBut the difference in the standards of the Corinthian Nomads and us was massive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68d278dadbf70db41eff6eb89f1104d274e2d422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d278dadbf70db41eff6eb89f1104d274e2d422/0_0_1112_1470/756.jpg\" alt=\"The programme from Dundalk v Corinthian Nomads in May 1970\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The match programme from Dundalk v Corinthian Nomads in May 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Football Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Byrne says a match report was titled \u201cLadies beaten but they impress\u201d.

The 7-1 seems like a thrashing, but actually it\u2019s quite a respectable scoreline because the Corinthians were that good. They would beat other teams 20-0, 15-0, 12-0.\u201d</p> <p>The Corinthians were a different level. This was the second generation of a team founded in 1949. They would play exhibition matches across the world, which included, in 1957, going abroad as England, \u201cto play in a European championship and win in Berlin with Bert Trautmann, the famous Manchester City goalkeeper, as their interpreter\u201d, explains Williams. \u201cYou cannot overestimate the importance of the Corinthians in postwar women\u2019s football.\u201c</p> <p>Dr Gary James, author of Manchester City Women: An Oral History, says: \u201cIt sort of gets imagined that we jumped from Dick, Kerr Ladies in the 1920s to what we have today, without understanding that actually these women that played for Corinthians and for Dundalk really fought against tradition, the establishment and everything else, simply to be able to play football.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is all they wanted to do and they did it to a high standard. \u201cI was talking to Lyons recently about the current Manchester City women and she said: \u2018Oh, some of the football they play, they\u2019re not as tactically aware as we were,\u201d says James.</p> <p>Williams adds: \u201cThey were so effortlessly better than their opponents that in some games they would play their defenders as forwards and forwards as defenders just to liven things up for themselves.

The announcement came shortly after Sunak told the BBC the UK recession was \u201calready happening\u201d what with the loss of jobs and rise in Universal Credit claims. </li> \n   <li><strong>There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, official figures indicated.</strong> This places the UK with the second-worst death toll in the world, after the US. The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, include deaths where Covid-19 was named on the death certificate as a factor. </li> \n   <li><strong>The care home death rate has almost halved in the past few weeks, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said</strong>. It came as new figures were released on care home fatalities, with the ONS revealing that about 40% of Covid-19-related deaths \u2013 2,423 \u2013 registered in the week ending 1 May in England and Wales were in care homes, the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March. The figures showed that at least 10,535 deaths to date have occurred in settings outside hospitals.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>People should use cars if they can\u2019t walk or cycle, in order to avoid using public transport, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said.</strong> For those who have to use public transport, new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers\">transport guidance</a> published by the government advised people to face away from each other if it isn\u2019t possible to keep a 2 metre gap between them. Shapps also said face coverings should be worn as a precautionary measure and that passengers should avoid rush hour, re-plan visits, use contactless payments where at all possible and wash their hands before and after their journeys.</li> \n   <li><strong>Further coronavirus outbreaks and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions without a robust strategy to suppress the virus, an independent group of scientists warned.</strong> The experts, convened by the former government chief scientific adviser<strong> </strong>Sir David King, urged ministers to reconsider the \u201cdangerous\u201d strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to clamp down on the epidemic.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Northern Ireland executive published its own five-step coronavirus recovery plan.</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/execuitveour-approach-to-decision-making.pdf\">12-page document</a> sets out the five steps, the first of which includes groups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining physical distancing, drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side.

It has not given an official explanation for this yet, but the chart showed the UK ahead of the other European countries featured in terms of total deaths and, as the days progressed, the gap between the UK and its neighbours was getting ever larger. In the past, when ministers have been asked about these figures, they have pointed out that the chart showed total deaths, not deaths per head, and that the comparisons were not necessarily valid because different countries compile data in different ways. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the data at the end of the press conference slide show amounted to a daily reminder that the UK has a poor record to defend.

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A study of staff at an NHS hospital has suggested that 3% of staff reporting as fit for duty in April were unknowingly infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Researchers at <strong>Cambridge University</strong> swabbed and tested more than 1,200 NHS workers at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge throughout April, with staff also asked about relevant coronavirus symptoms.</p> \n  <p>More than 1,000 workers reported that they were fit for duty during the study period, but 3% of them tested positive for Covid-19. <strong>Dr Mike Weekes</strong>, one of the authors of the report, said staff need to be tested regularly \u201cregardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Under closer questioning as part of the study, around one in five staff reported no symptoms, two in five had very mild symptoms that they had dismissed as inconsequential, and a further two in five reported Covid-19 symptoms that had stopped more than a week previously.</p> \n  <p>Weekes and his fellow senior author, <strong>Prof Stephen Baker</strong>, from the <strong>Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease</strong>, said hospitals needed to introduce screening programmes across their workforces. Weekes said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Test! Test! Test! And then test some more.</p> \n   <p>All staff need to get tested regularly for Covid-19, regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms \u2013 this will be vital to stop infection spreading within the hospital setting.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The study, published in the journal <strong>eLife</strong>, also explored possible routes of transmission of the virus through the hospital and among staff. Researchers looked at whether rates of infection were greater among staff working in \u201cred\u201d areas of the hospital, caring for Covid-19 patients.</p> \n  <p>Despite wearing appropriate PPE, \u201cred\u201d area staff were three times more likely to test positive than staff working in Covid-19-free \u201cgreen\u201d areas, the study indicated. It is not clear whether this genuinely reflects greater rates of transmission from patients to staff in red areas, as staff may have instead transmitted the virus to each other or acquired it at home.</p> \n  <p>Those working in the \u201cred\u201d areas were also swabbed earlier in the study, closer to when the lockdown was first initiated, so the higher rates of infection in this group might just be a symptom of higher rates of virus circulating in the community at the time.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T12:18:08.756Z\">at 1.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eba8fb88f08d99d46a15652\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T12:02:19.017Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Employers have welcomed the announcement to extend the furlough scheme too.

Without strong measures to suppress the spread of infections \u201cwe shall inevitably see a more rapid return of local epidemics and face the prospect of further partial or national lockdowns\u201d, the authors write.</p> \n  <p>The report, which includes 19 key recommendations, will be sent to Downing Street, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser who co-chairs Sage, the first ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee.</p> \n  <p>The experts call on ministers to reverse the 12 March decision to abandon efforts to test, trace and isolate cases of Covid-19, and to replace the existing centralised testing approach, which relies heavily on the private sector. In its place, the group call for a decentralised strategy that puts GPs and local health teams at the heart of the outbreak control. The report states that the \u201cover-dependence on outsourcing\u201d is unsustainable.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T11:16:07.358Z\">at 12.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eba6e898f08d99d46a154bf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T09:47:08.691Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mervyn King urges Sunak not to scale back furlough scheme</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Mervyn King</strong>, the former governor of the Bank of England, said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, should not scale back the coronavirus job retention scheme that allows workers to be furloughed. He said the government should continue to pay 80% of people\u2019s salaries (as it does now, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month), instead of reducing that to 60%, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/extend-furlough-scheme-or-face-spiralling-job-losses-rishi-sunak-told\">as the Treasury has been considering.</a></p> \n  <p>Asked what Sunak should do, King said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Keep it at 80%.</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t think it makes sense to regard this as the major cost of the Covid-19 crisis in economic terms.</p> \n   <p>These payments under government schemes are transfers from taxpayers in general to businesses, it will lead to an increase in national debt [but] we can finance that over a long period, particularly given the very low level of long-term real interest rates.</p> \n   <p>The real cost of this shutdown is not measured by the impact on the public finances but by the lost incomes and outputs in the economy, a cost which is likely to end up as an order of magnitude [though no one can really know this] of several hundred billion pounds. That\u2019s an enormous cost.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>King also said the \u201ceconomy ought to have recovered to a very large extent\u201d before Sunak considered ending the furlough scheme in a bid to avoid a wave of redundancies when the support is curtailed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8443c38ccddfebe0fcbb9b55ade6424ffea9665\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8443c38ccddfebe0fcbb9b55ade6424ffea9665/105_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mervyn King.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mervyn King.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/STV</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T11:17:54.923Z\">at 12.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eba6d248f080c7274539498\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T09:32:59.835Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>BBC Scotland\u2019s Disclosure programme has revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh in February, well before the first confirmed cases in the country, but that this was not disclosed to the public.</p> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s first confirmed coronavirus case, in Tayside, was announced on 1 March, but Disclosure, broadcast on Monday night, revealed an outbreak that began the week before, on 26 and 27 February, at a conference of international delegates for the sportswear company Nike.

Brave Boris still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/boris-johnson-is-back-but-has-he-changed-coronavirus\">gets a free pass for having gone into intensive care</a>, but Hancock\u2019s recovery is by and large ignored. He\u2019s just the schmuck that has to suck it up. He\u2019s in way too deep to get away with saying what he\u2019d always really thought: that Johnson was never fit to be prime minister. So he can only look on in envy at Jeremy Hunt for having had an uncharacteristic fit of self-worth by turning down a cabinet job and reinventing himself as one of the good guys. Jezza, the man who did more than anyone to cut back the NHS, now on the side of the angels. Who\u2019da thunk it?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/11/motor-misfires-as-pm-tries-to-steer-away-from-car-crash-of-night-before\">Motor misfires as PM tries to steer away from car crash of night before</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a time when Matt\u2019s eyes used to gleam with enthusiasm. When he believed he could really make a difference. That he had a sense of purpose. Tigger used to bounce out of bed, believing he was the man to teach the NHS to sing in perfect harmony. Now he knows better and there\u2019s only furtiveness and suspicion in his every move. Every day can only be worse than the one before. So when he was told he would be doing the morning media round to clean up after Boris\u2019s latest mess \u2013 you\u2019d have thought the prime minister might know the difference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/11/coronavirus-i-hope-hope-hope-we-will-have-a-vaccine-says-boris-johnson-video\">between a virus and a vaccine</a> \u2013 he knew what was in store.</p> <p>Not that Downing Street hadn\u2019t tried to make it easier for whatever poor sap drew the media short straw, by having refused to send a minister to be interviewed by Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan for the past 10 days. But Matt is now so far gone that he views even the comparatively less threatening BBC Breakfast with deep suspicion. All the presenter Louise Minchin wanted were some basic answers to some fairly straightforward questions. Why was it OK to meet in a garden centre and not a garden? Why was it OK for a childminder to look after kids <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/matt-hancock-tries-to-clear-up-confusion-over-coronavirus-advice\">but not other family members?</a></p> <p>Yet right from the off, Matt looked and sounded like a man on the edge. Just one wrong word and his eyes would go ice-cold. There was none of the usual charm, the going the extra mile to make himself plain. Just a series of bad-tempered, monosyllabic grunts. Hell, he was sick of hearing how bad things were for the rest of the country. How about someone think of just how shit he was feeling right now?</p> <p>Things got worse when Hancock moved on to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme where Martha Kearney was being the model of politeness. If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/dominic-raab-adds-confusion-over-changes-uk-lockdown-rules\">confusing Monday and Wednesday</a> was the worst mistake the government had made then things must be pretty damn good, Matt snapped. A nation blinked. Hancock never does sarcasm in public. No more Mr Nice Guy. And it wasn\u2019t a one-off aberration. He carried on with the same snippiness throughout, before his speech collapsed into meaningless disconnection. \u201cPeople understand the message,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople understand what \u2018stay alert\u2019 means, it means, er, and people understand that together we need to control the virus.\u201d</p> <p>It would have been better for Matt if the interview had been wrapped up there and then. Sadly, he re-found language in time to say we should be jolly proud that only 25% of our deaths had been in care homes, as that compared very favourably with other countries worldwide. Given that 10,000 have died in care homes that must rather imply that our death rate in hospitals and the community must be totally horrific compared with other countries. Whatever. The pathos was tangible. Even when Matt is trying to be helpful he still can\u2019t stop himself from handing over evidence for the prosecution. He is a man so near to the edge he can\u2019t even prevent himself from ganging up on himself. He needs a therapist urgently.</p> <p>Yet quantity theory has a way of evening things out. And Hancock\u2019s bad luck is proving to be Rishi Sunak\u2019s good luck. Everything the chancellor touches turns to gold right now. Which is just as well, as he\u2019s spending money like it\u2019s going out of style. Little more than two months ago, Rishi was earmarked for a B-list cabinet post in the Treasury but after Sajid Javid\u2019s hissy, he has found himself in the top job and blessed with access all areas to the magic money tree. Austerity? What austerity?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>His first Brexit budget proved to be little more than spare change compared with his eight \u2013 or is it nine? \u2013 subsequent coronavirus budgets. Today he was back in the Commons to answer an urgent question on extension of the government\u2019s furlough scheme. And Rishi was all smiles. Because though Boris doesn\u2019t have a clue how to stop the virus he has no qualms about spending money he doesn\u2019t know he hasn\u2019t got. So the chancellor got to take the credit for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">extending the furlough scheme for another four months</a> at the same rate of 80%.</p> <p>Here his charmed life continued. Because even though there were gaping holes in his statement \u2013 how much of the 80% would employers be expected to contribute? Would bosses use the end of July as an excuse to make some workers redundant? What about the self-employed? \u2013 no one seemed to want to take him up on any of them. Rishi had just casually blown another \u00a350bn. A 40th birthday present to himself. Remember the fuss about the \u00a313bn annual contribution to the EU? No one else does. That\u2019s how deep we\u2019re in the shit. But Rishi keeps floating to the top. When your luck\u2019s in, you ride that train to its very last stop.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Josh. I\u2019ve just seen a video in which many Australians appear to be smashing their televisions. What is happening please?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s all about a former reality TV star from Melbourne, his growing Facebook following, and protests against the coronavirus lockdown, media, vaccines, 5G and microchips.</p> <p><strong>Now I am even more confused.

Is this the same as that?</strong></p> <p>In the initial stages of the pandemic, debunked conspiracy theories blaming the 5G rollout for spreading coronavirus proliferated around the world \u2013 mainly on Facebook groups like this one. But while the people attacking those towers were likely also influenced by something they read on Facebook, they didn\u2019t come from exactly the same group.</p> <p>Still, although Facebook has banned posts connecting 5G with coronavirus, it wasn\u2019t hard to find posts on the group complaining about 5G, and connecting it with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/cedar-meats-knew-of-two-covid-19-cases-for-several-days-before-telling-staff-they-could-stay-home\">Cedar Meats outbreak in Victoria</a>.</p> <p><strong>How do people think 5G could even spread a virus?</strong></p> <p>The reasoning varies depending on the conspiracy you are reading, but the most common one seems to be that because 5G was being rolled out in Wuhan at the time of the outbreak, it must have had some role in it (it didn\u2019t). Other conspiracies falsely claim 5G \u201cpoisons cells\u201d or makes it easier to catch coronavirus.

With a bounty on his head and danger afoot in his hometown, he finds refuge in the forest of Aalst with his half-brother Tincke, who\u2019s living in a grubby commune of entry-level criminals under the trees.</p> <p>Tincke\u2019s gang are muddy, impoverished refugees from the town, stealing and whoring to survive. They have been cast out by an authoritarian mayor who feasts while they starve, who indulges public floggings in lieu of actual justice, and who hunts women to rape in the woods. Jan De Lichte takes umbrage to all of it, and decides to engage some redistribution of wealth with expert marksmanship and tactics learned on the battlefield.</p> <p>Sound familiar? While Jan De Lichte was certainly a notorious bandit of the 18th century, his reputation as the Flemish Robin Hood stems from his recreation in literature by the Flemish-language literary polymath, Louis Paul Boon, on whose 1957 novel De Bende van Jan de Lichte (The Jan De Lichte Gang) this series is based. Boon came from a working-class family, and left school by 16 to get a job painting cars; an autodidact and provocateur, he would eventually become a novelist, poet, art critic, journalist, Nobel finalist and even \u2013 infamously \u2013 a writer of pornography. But he was also a fierce organic socialist who never forgot where he came from, or his brutal experiences of poverty and war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/11/crash-landing-on-you-parachute-into-this-addictively-romantic-south-korean-soap-opera\">Crash Landing On You: parachute into this addictively romantic South Korean soap opera</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Boon has been criminally under-translated in English, and with Thieves of the Wood dubbed for Netflix, there are limitations on how much of his wit the dialogue can accommodate. But his powerful critique of oppression remains. Questions of natural justice and fairness are teased out through the character of Baru (Tom Van Dyck), a principled, reform-minded bailiff who hunts down good people doing illegal things while he serves the despicable Mayor who has law on his side.</p> <p>The production design is meticulous in its bleak palette of poverty, which provides texture to the frippery of wealth; scenes of aspirational bourgeoises in wigs eating candied things for breakfast contrast sharply to Jan, Tincke and gang stuck in the forest, swigging moonshine while layered in old coats and mud. There are touches, too, of Boon\u2019s adult eroticism that charge scenes of class tension. A close encounter between characters of different stations is electrified when one\u2019s breath visibly quickens through a silk mask; and in a carriage ride between the humble bailiff and a red-haired young woman in aristocratic dress, Baru fixates on her open red lips, the only part of her face he can see.</p> <p>The show has its challenges. With not every relevant event story dramatised, the pace is cracking \u2013 and the audience is expected to keep up. And \u2013 a warning - Thieves of the Wood is no artefact of a culture founded by Puritans; in its world, women whore without sentiment, wounds bleed, people get syphilis, romantic pairings have sex before kissing and even the hero is in palpable need of a bath. But Simoni invests his portrayal of Jan with such a ferocious combination of toughness and innocence that a bit of dirt on his body is hardly a deal-breaker.</p> <p>Stef Aerts is intense and fragile as Tincke, Charlotte Timmers simmers as the trapped H\u00e9loise and Van Dyck is a meticulous, repressed Baru. But the real star of this cracking adventure is a production design that revels in genre to the point that every shot looks as if painted by a Flemish master \u2013 and coats, wigs, hoods, even gloves have a character of their own. \u201cI like your shoes,\u201d the show begins, but I stayed for the hats.

The nurse took the little boy to her doctor friend who would plaster his arm at home, and I rummaged through an old carton of supplies to find some antihypertensives and an inhaler. The rape victim fled, confirming that I was not the therapist she needed. I finished my first shift wistful for the controlled environment of my hospital but conflicted that it, and other hospitals, would deny care to sick patients.</p> <p>One afternoon a woman arrived, cradled by two burly men. She was an elderly and frail refugee, riddled with cancer and lately unable to walk. I suspected her unrelenting pain was due to a fractured hip, and I proceeded to do what I did every day at work: provide analgesia, get an X-ray, check some basic bloods. But how? No public hospital would image her hip. The private providers wouldn\u2019t even entertain a call about a refugee.</p> <p>In desperation I called an eminent doctor who said he had no idea how to help and hung up quickly. I could smell his discomfiture \u2013 he knew all too well that the problem wasn\u2019t the fracture but the person who had the fracture. It was one of the most crushing moments of my career.</p> <p>With the patient in severe pain and night approaching, I approached the chief executive of the ASRC, Kon Karapanagiotidis, who had recently founded the non-profit group. He simply said to the hapless family: \u201cWe will never leave her in pain.\u201d</p> <p>I gasped at the magnitude of the promise, and was proven right \u2013 and wrong. The cost of repeated private scripts of morphine would seriously test the organisation, yet he kept his promise and never let on how the finances were driven to the brink. When our patient died, the family seemed almost relieved for our sake. \u201cNow you can save money.\u201d</p> <p>I learned how the issue of refugees divided opinion and sowed fear. One doctor would empathise while another would admonish me for wasting my time on a \u201cnon-academic\u201d pursuit. One pharmacist slipped me a trove of painkillers left behind by deceased patients while another warned me against jeopardising my career over \u201cthese people\u201d.</p> <p>A rare bright spot came when a pathologist, recalling his own refugee background, ran some free blood tests. Unfortunately the abnormalities he found couldn\u2019t be treated outside a hospital.</p> <p>This unforgettable story would become a turning point in my life because it was my first time witnessing the pitfalls of being a refugee with a terminal illness, even in a prosperous country. Some time later my state granted refugees the right to public hospital treatment, sparing subsequent patients the worst indignities even though their plight remained poor.</p> <p>Nearly 20 years later, refugees and asylum seekers face a different problem, the pandemic having left them in a particularly precarious position because they are ineligible for government subsidies. Many were gainfully employed but now there is no work. Others who had moved on from aid find themselves returning for assistance they were proud to have left behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9dcb6cfec6f02356181d5affada498643f5b457\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9dcb6cfec6f02356181d5affada498643f5b457/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women packing food bags at an Asylum Seeker Resource Centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Volunteers are busily packing foods and amenities for home delivery to avoid long journeys on public transport.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ranjana Srivastava</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My colleagues have decided to contribute to the cause of the people who are often our patients and whose stories we know all too well.

Then, to assuage the guilt, we mash them and add butter and sugar to bake a cake that may or may not be consumed. The waste is galling and I strive to improve. But now, allocating one sorry banana per bag, I wonder how a mother might explain its lonely presence.

  "<p>My colleague and friend Carol Ellison, who has died of cancer aged 58, was a scientist in the field of biological control of invasive species. This is a little-known but increasingly important tool in the management of alien weeds which, if unchecked, can destabilise ecosystems and constrain agriculture.</p> <p>Born in Croydon, south London, to Edward Ellison, a toolmaker, and his wife, Valerie (nee Rickard), Carol was a committed environmentalist from an early age. She graduated in biological sciences from the University of East Anglia and subsequently registered for an MSc in pest management at Imperial College London, during which she worked with me in Kenya as part of her thesis investigating the potential of fungal pathogens for the control of African grasses.</p> <p>After graduation in 1987, she joined our invasive species management team at <a href=\"https://www.cabi.org/\">CAB International</a> (Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International), based at Ascot, Berkshire, and continued her studies on invasive weeds for which she received her doctorate. During this period, in 1992, she met her future husband, Andy Croxford (now deputy director, Environment Agency).</p> <p>Thus began a fruitful career in a field that resonated with her environmental beliefs; undertaking extensive plant surveys in Africa, Asia and the Americas and forging many permanent friendships thanks to her warm and infectious personality. She was never happier than being in the field collecting plant pathogens, or unlocking the secrets of these often novel species in the CABI quarantine facilities back in the UK. </p> <p>Latterly, she was involved in organising surveys in India for biocontrol agents of the environmentally damaging Himalayan balsam for the UK, while at the same time juggling projects for the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and North America. Subsequently, a rust fungus from the Himalayas was approved for release by the UK government, making it the first plant pathogen to be introduced into Europe for management of an exotic weed.</p> <p>Despite her illness, Carol undertook an arduous programme of visits throughout the UK to organise releases, raise public awareness and present talks to societies on the benefits of this unconventional approach to weed management. She also gave interviews to the BBC, both on radio and television, in her typically engaging and professional manner. Her legacy will be the success of these projects and the scientists she mentored and inspired throughout the world.</p> <p>She is survived by Andy, whom she married in 2012, their sons, Jonah and Nathan, and her mother and her siblings, Linda, Peter and Steven.</p>",
  "<p>My friend Carol Sarsfield-Hall, who has died aged 94, spent her childhood in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, where her father was governor of Khartoum until his retirement in 1936. The scenic home in the Lake District she inherited from her parents, Robin (nee Clowes) and Geoffrey Sarsfield-Hall, was adorned with Sudanese weaponry, furnishings and pictures from Geoffrey\u2019s 27 years in the country. Prominent in this display was a rifle with the name Ali Dinar in Arabic on its silvered butt.</p> <p>Sultan Ali Dinar, celebrated in Sudanese history, was the ruler of Darfur who in 1916 declared holy war against the British and support for Germany during the first world war. Carol\u2019s father was assistant intelligence officer in the ensuing campaign in which Darfur was subjugated and the sultan killed.</p> <p>During the second world war, in which Carol\u2019s only brother was killed at Arnhem, the Sarsfield-Halls came in contact with Moral Re-Armament (MRA) through two Australian airmen who were billeted in their Keswick home for recuperation. They talked of a postwar world liberated from hate, fear and greed. This helped the Sarsfield-Halls take a sympathetic view of the African bid for independence. In the 1950s father and daughter were part of an MRA campaign in southern Africa that made the case for a multiracial philosophy of governance.</p> <p>After her parents\u2019 death Carol decided to return Ali Dinar\u2019s rifle to Sudan. In March 1985 the Sudanese ambassador invited her to lunch at the embassy in London. Formally handing over the weapon, she spoke of painful memories while concluding: \u201cI know my father loved the Sudan, and during the 27 years he was in the country made his contribution in many practical ways; but what he received in the way of friendship and appreciation is incalculable. I am glad to be able to express his gratitude today by returning this gun as a token of the lasting friendship between our two countries, particularly at this difficult time - and a bridge between our two faiths.\u201d</p> <p>Warm thanks came from the director general of antiquities in Khartoum, and Carol\u2019s restitution was reported widely in the Arabic newspapers.</p> <p>She was on a committee that arranged exchanges between British and Arab students. One year she invited Cumbrian friends to a lunch in her home for visiting leaders of Khartoum University Students\u2019 Union. Among them was a Darfur law student, descendant of Ali Dinar.</p> <p>Carol was a good friend to my wife and me for more than 50 years. We cooperated on initiatives with Sudan, where I taught for eight years soon after its independence.</p> <p>She had a deep Christian faith and a generous world outlook. Her home was open to the families of charity workers who could not afford holidays. All remember her with affection and gratitude.</p>",

Lawyers for Trump and attorneys for Democrats in Congress and prosecutors in New York presented their arguments by telephone. The world listened in.</p> <p>Trump did not release his tax returns during the 2016 election and has not done so since, despite promising to do so.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Trump is the first one to refuse to do that,\u201d Ginsburg said.</p> <p>Every president since Nixon, who was elected in 1968, had released tax information.

Those courts brushed aside the president\u2019s broad arguments, focusing on the fact that the subpoenas were addressed to third parties asking for records of Trump\u2019s business and financial dealings as a private citizen, not as president.</p> <p>Rulings against Trump could result in the release of damaging information during his campaign for re-election.</p> <p>According to practice, Chief Justice John Roberts spoke first. The other justices asked questions in order of seniority. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s two appointees to the 5-4 conservative majority, went last.</p> <p>Roberts asked Trump lawyer Patrick Strawbridge: \u201cDo you concede any power in the House to subpoena personal papers of the president?\u201d</p> <p>The Trump attorney said it was \u201cdifficult to imagine\u201d a situation in which that would be justified.</p> <p>However, in 1974 the justices acted unanimously in requiring Nixon to turn over White House tapes to the Watergate special prosecutor. And in 1997, another unanimous decision allowed a sexual harassment lawsuit to proceed against Clinton.</p> <p>In those cases, three Nixon appointees and two Clinton appointees, respectively, voted against the president who chose them. Ginsburg and Breyer were those Clinton appointees.</p> <p>For the justice department, Jeffrey Wall said allowing the House subpoenas would lead to presidents being \u201charassed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe potential to harass and undermine the president \u2026 is plain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not much to ask that before the House delves into the president\u2019s personal life it explains in some meaningful way what laws it is considering and why it needs the president\u2019s documents in particular. The subpoenas here don\u2019t even come close.\u201d</p> <p>Gorsuch expressed concern about lawmakers abusing the subpoena process and hunting for unlawful conduct by political rivals.</p> <p>Speaking to congressional lawyer Douglas Letter, Samuel Alito said: \u201cIn your view, there\u2019s no protection for the purpose of preventing harassment of a president.\u201d</p> <p>But the conservatives on the court were not in uniform sympathy with the arguments presented by Trump\u2019s lawyers.</p> <p>Kavanaugh asked: \u201cThe question \u2026 boils down to how can we both protect the House\u2019s interest in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency. How can the court balance those interests?\u201d</p> <p>Gorsuch questioned why the court would give Trump immunity in a criminal investigation when it did not give Clinton immunity in a sexual harassment lawsuit. In the 1997 case, lawyers for the plaintiff wanted Clinton to be questioned, Gorsuch noted, while in the Trump case the information is sought from third parties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">What is 'Obamagate' and why is Trump so worked up about it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sekulow responded that criminal cases result in a loss of liberty and are very different from civil lawsuits that could lead to monetary damages.</p> <p>Alito challenged Sekulow\u2019s assertion that a grand jury subpoena cannot be enforced against a sitting president in a case in which waiting for a president to leave office would undermine a criminal prosecution.</p> <p>Kagan, meanwhile, noted that where personal records are concerned, \u201cthe president is just a man\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat it seems to me you\u2019re asking us to do,\u201d she told Strawbridge, \u201cis to put a kind of 10-ton weight on the scales between the president and Congress, and essentially to make it impossible for Congress to perform oversight and to carry out its functions.\u201d</p> <p>A ruling is likely within weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Remember 3D? That thing where you paid more for films to look worse? During its rebirth, around the late 00s, it tainted the majority of mass-market films, regardless of genre or suitability, adding a murky filter and a hefty surcharge to the cinema experience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/09/terrible-name-terrific-sitcom-how-schitts-creek-became-a-surprise-hit\">Terrible name, terrific sitcom: how Schitt's Creek became a surprise hit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For me, bar a handful of rare examples (Gravity and The Great Gatsby perhaps), it was a gimmick that was used best when viewed as such. The self-serious worlds of Avatar and Harry Potter weren\u2019t bettered by the addition of a third dimension yet the relentless shock tactics of horror films such as Final Destination 5 and Piranha 3D brought an added layer of fun to films that were already well aware of their silliness. I\u2019ve had similar feelings about Netflix\u2019s decision to make certain shows and films interactive, transforming traditional narratives into choose your own adventures, allowing us to make decisions about where the plot might go with a collection of multiple-choice scenarios. Prior to Netflix\u2019s first example of this, 2017\u2019s Puss in Book: Trapped in an Epic Tale, similar technology was best implemented on the DVD release of Final Destination 3, which used the franchise\u2019s ever-present fear of a gory demise as added motivation for making the right choice, as we were handed control at various key moments. Spoiler: death was behind every door.</p> <p>Like the best uses of 3D, it worked because the film itself was as schlocky as the tech, one of the many reasons why I felt that the streamer\u2019s grandest interactive experiment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/28/black-mirrors-bandersnatch-charlie-brookers-meta-masterpiece\">Black Mirror\u2019s internet-breaking Bandersnatch movie</a>, was such a letdown. Despite some rather tiresome in-jokes, it was a humourless and portentous time-waster and the ability to make token decisions along the way felt more like a distraction from what was otherwise an almost parody-level example of the show at its very worst. Now while it\u2019s unlikely to cause even a fraction of the rabid Reddit detective attention aimed at Bandersnatch and its many rabbit holes, the unhyped new release of an extended special of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt showed for me how much fun the technology can be when paired with something more befitting. It\u2019s a throwaway experience but one that\u2019s fully cognisant of this, poking fun at the format while providing what would have been a perfectly entertaining episode of the sitcom without the ability to pick whether Kimmy\u2019s BFF Titus goes to the gym or takes a nap.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZWmRUxOj9g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LZWmRUxOj9g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The show, a manic, Tina Fey-created comedy about what happens to a woman after she\u2019s saved from a cult, was once one of the platform\u2019s biggest brags, a slick and inventive critic-pleaser that might not have matched 30 Rock\u2019s awards haul but provided the many fans of that show with a comforting continuation of sorts. It shared the same fast pace and expansive pop culture vocabulary while also touching, lightly, on often audaciously dark issues of trauma and recovery. By the time it ended last year, it had fully exhausted the novelty of its premise but even a weak episode was still more imaginative than most sitcoms on a good day and so the arrival of a frenetic new special, at a time when we\u2019re hungrier than ever for immersive distraction, is opportune.</p> <p>Kimmy, embodied as ever with exhausting effervescence by Ellie Kemper, is getting married to English royalty and we join her as she\u2019s picking her dress (do we want it to be fun or fancy?). Her fiance, Frederick, is played by Daniel Radcliffe, an actor who has often struggled to find his place post-wizarding world but his frantic energy works well here, playing a man whose background isn\u2019t quite as \u201cpeculiar\u201d as Kimmy\u2019s (\u201cYou win,\u201d he tells her) but who shares a surprising amount of similarities with her (even though she is \u201ccommoner trash\u201d compared to him). Three days before the wedding, Kimmy finds a book in her backpack that suggests that there might be another secret bunker, sending her on a multiple-choice quest to West Virginia. After the success of Bandersnatch at the end of 2018, Netflix was forced to briefly pause its umpteenth victory lap the following month when Choose Your Own Adventure publisher Chooseco <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/11/netflix-black-mirror-bandersnatch-choose-your-own-adventure-lawsuit\">threatened legal action</a>. The case has yet to conclude but there\u2019s a sly jab at the company during this, their biggest interactive offering since, as Kimmy\u2019s book The Mystery of the Mysterious Spy is a \u201cPick Your Own Journey\u201d, a joke reminiscent of 30 Rock\u2019s unlicensed Janis Joplin biopic featuring the memorable song Break Another Little Chunk of My Lung.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd21333904c49103db589125bb0069367ecdcbec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd21333904c49103db589125bb0069367ecdcbec/0_0_3240_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That moment, when characters pause or fill time until you make up your mind can feel clumsy in a drama yet in a sitcom, especially one as otherworldly as this, it\u2019s far less of a distraction. When applying interactivity to comedy, one also starts to question the motivation behind a decision, whether it\u2019s to progress the story or lead to farce (at one point, at a rural bar, we get to decide whether Titus knows the words to Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s Free Bird or pretends to). It\u2019s fun to explore both rationales and after going down enough dead ends, you realise that basing your choices on Kimmy\u2019s inherent goodness is the way to go.</p> <p>The tech works here because storytelling was never a major selling point of the show, the jokes were, so handing over responsibility to us doesn\u2019t feel like a creative sacrifice and branching out the story just allows for more one-liners and while they don\u2019t all land, a quick flip back or forward allows you to find something funnier instead. There\u2019s a <em>lot</em> here to unpack, a consuming activity to easily while away some considerable time, and who doesn\u2019t have plenty of that right now?</p> <ul> <li><p>The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs The Reverend is available on Netflix now</p></li> </ul>",

She absolutely loved children and being a grandparent was a role she fulfilled to a prize-winning standard.\u201d</p> <p>Owing to the lockdown, the family had not been able to visit Wood for five weeks before she died on 11 April, aged 89, at Eden Mansions in Styal, Cheshire. \u201cHer funeral, constrained as it was by the restrictions, was a thing of simple beauty,\u201d Panter said. Those in attendance were her two daughters and their families, her four grandchildren. \u201cIt had a wonderful peaceful quality, in contrast to the maelstrom outside, and we were all so grateful to be able to say goodbye. She would have really enjoyed it.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret Parkes, 94, who grew up in Wigan and was the middle child of five, was a teenager at the outbreak of the second world war. She died on 29 April shortly after contracting the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cShe recalled her mum getting angry at the radio when the news broke that England was at war because she\u2019d only just decorated the house. Her childhood piano lessons were stopped prematurely when a German bomber dropped its load and narrowly missed her as she was walking to her lesson,\u201d said 43-year-old Mark Thomas, a film-maker and lecturer, of his great-aunt.</p> <p>Parkes trained as a junior nurse at Addenbrooke\u2019s in Cambridge, nursing the troops during the later years of the second world war. She received a Florence Nightingale scholarship to travel to the US, researching mental health and social care in the 1980s in Washington and New York.</p> <p>\u201cWhen lockdown began, Margaret appeared in good form. I think it triggered a wartime spirit, and she was always one for a challenge, having faced WW2, being a midwife in 50s rural Scotland, the polio epidemic, 80s New York and countless other major and minor events,\u201d Thomas said.</p>",

We are also excited to continue our partnership with Fandango, and invest in more unique Made In Italy stories that we believe will resonate in Italy and around the world\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H28ZYGcXgc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6H28ZYGcXgc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The teaser trailer for The Lying Life of Adults.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Fandango were previously involved with the production of My Brilliant Friend, a co-production between HBO, the Italian national broadcaster RAI and Italian VOD platform TIMvision which has been broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK and was recently renewed for a third series.</p> <p>Ferrante has famously maintained her anonymity since the publication of her first novel in 1992. In 2016, an investigative journalist, Claudio Gatti, claimed that Rome-based translator Anita Raja was Ferrante, in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/03/unmasking-elena-ferrante-italian-journalist-claudio-gatti\">controversial \u201cunmasking\u201d</a>. In 2017, a study at the University of Padua concluded that Domenico Starnone, Raja\u2019s husband, was the actual author. Both Starnone and Raja have denied writing the works, which have sold over 15 million copies and been translated into numerous languages.</p>",
  "<p>Aged 76 and 78 respectively, the renowned artist couple Gilbert and George are of the age supposedly most in need of isolating against the coronavirus. Yet exploring the streets of London has been their life since they met as students in 1967 \u2013 taking photographs, picking up unusual objects, observing the people around them. There is no second home for them abroad or in the country \u2013 their only residence is the house on Fournier Street in east London where they have lived since the 1960s.</p> <p>So that is where they are holed up. And this week, they are releasing a series of glimpses into their lockdown life, as they unveil their video diary on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/whitecube/?hl=en\">White Cube\u2019s Instagram account</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gilbert and George: Our New Normal Walk\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Wearing their trademark suits, they walk with deliberation around a line of tables in their home studio. First they do a circuit in single file, then they walk past each other from opposite sides of the tables.</p> <p>In the foreground is an elegant varnished circular wooden table, laid with antique ceramics, twigs and plants. There\u2019s also a photograph of a young friend or relative on it. This picture surely symbolises everyone they feel cut off from. Gilbert and George are nothing if not social artists. Their art works are visceral documents of a changing Britain, from confrontational 1970s scenes of skinhead street life to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-28339211/hippie-crack-inspires-new-gilbert-and-george-exhibition\">a recent series that used empty nitrous oxide canisters</a> collected on their urban walks.</p> <p>They\u2019ve lost the world, but the walk goes on. Gilbert and George find spiritual solace and aesthetic order in the simple ritual of promenading together. For them, London is the only place worth walking in. As students, they used to hike for miles right through the city until they reached the countryside. Now they are isolated in their own house, walking around a table laden with personally significant objects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gilbert and George: Our New Normal Relaxing\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Now there is just one long work table. Gilbert lies on one side of it doing exercises in his suit. George sits on the other side in a rocking chair, equally suited, reading a book. George is an avid reader who has worked his way through most of classic 19th-century British fiction. So his coronavirus reading is probably quite meaty although I can\u2019t make out the volume\u2019s title. It is as if they are enacting the duality of mind and body. While Gilbert exercises his limbs, George prefers a mental workout.</p> <p>It turns out the funny, sad art of Gilbert and George is perfectly suited to capturing the \u201cnew normal\u201d. Formal and disciplined, yet always on the verge of surreal slapstick, their routines resemble a fraught attempt to maintain civilised codes in a chaotic world. Right now that\u2019s what we are all trying to do. Confined to their quarters, Gilbert and George appear to be acting out set routines to stop themselves going mad. Is the spectacle quietly heroic or is it a black farce by Samuel Beckett? That probably depends not only on how their series pans out \u2013 will their routines suddenly collapse into a New Abnormal? \u2013 but how the history we are experiencing unfolds.</p> <p>\u201cOurs is essentially a tragic age,\u201d wrote DH Lawrence in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/15/classics.dhlawrence\">Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover,</a> \u201cso we refuse to take it tragically.\u201d Gilbert and George in their diary of the New Normal act out that defiance. They refuse to pity themselves and don\u2019t even consider giving up. Their stoic adaptation of their habits is quietly moving. Can\u2019t walk through London? They will walk at home. Can\u2019t go out? They can still exercise body and mind. These patriotic artists present their own cheerful manifesto for the coronavirus spirit, the new East End proving as courageous as the old one was in the 1940s. And yet there is a tension to this endurance, an undercutting hint of the absurd. We\u2019re fine, their studied normality insists. Absolutely FINE.</p> <p>With its brittle poise, their diary is a perfect example of what makes Gilbert and George great artists of our times. They immaculately press on the nerves of this age of polite dread. And they offer the best advice they can in a scrawled final message \u2013 \u201cGilbert and George say: Don\u2019t get it!\u201d</p> <p>Gilbert and George\u2019s online diary is available at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/whitecube/?hl=en\">White Cube\u2019s Instagram</a>.

  "<p>A senior Home Office counter-terrorism official who was at Eton and Oxford with Boris Johnson has been parachuted in to take temporary charge of the newly established joint biosecurity centre, responsible for coronavirus threat levels.</p> \n<p>Tom Hurd has switched jobs on an acting basis to get the new centre up and running \u201cwithin days\u201d, officials said, though he remains a candidate to take over as the next director general of MI6 later this year.</p> \n<p>The 55-year-old, the son of the former foreign secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/douglas-hurd-warned-major-of-dangers-of-uk-isolation-papers-reveal\">Douglas Hurd</a>, has no obvious scientific background, having worked as a diplomat at the UN, as a Middle East specialist and latterly in security.</p> \n<p>Hurd and the prime minister have been described as friends.

It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Deenan Pillay, a professor of virology at University College London, said \u201cit does seem worrying that another structure will be set up\u201d outside the NHS and Public Health England, traditionally responsible for disease control.</p> \n<p>The biosecurity centre was announced by Johnson on Sunday night and will administer a five-tier coronavirus alert system, to advise Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, and those of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland if they sign up.

  "<p>Denying exiled Chagos islanders the right to return to their homes on the Indian Ocean archipelago is a continuing breach of their human rights and not just a historical injustice, the court of appeal has been told.</p> <p>The claim was made on Tuesday in the first legal battle over the territory in a British courtroom since the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/25/un-court-rejects-uk-claim-to-sovereignty-over-chagos-islands\">ruled last year</a> that the UK\u2019s assertion of sovereignty was illegal.</p> <p>The latest challenge has been brought on behalf of two former Chagos residents. Solange Hoareau, who was born on the island of Diego Garcia and transported to the Seychelles in the early 1970s, has never received any compensation for her exile. The other claimant, Olivier Bancoult, the leader of the Chagos Refugee Group, who now lives in Mauritius, was born on the island of Peros Banhos in the archipelago.</p> <p>The UK government refers to the islands as a British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Between 1,500 and 2,000 native islanders were forcibly deported in the early 1970s so that the largest island, Diego Garcia, could be leased to the US to use as an airbase. They have never been allowed to return home.</p> <p>By a majority of 13 to one, the ICJ \u2013 , the United Nation\u2019s highest court, found that the UK\u2019s decolonisation of Mauritius, of which the Chagos Islands were originally a part, had not been lawfully completed. It said the islands must be handed back to Mauritius \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Although the ICJ\u2019s ruling, commissioned by the UN general assembly, was only advisory, it was a damaging blow to the UK\u2019s international standing and, it is argued, has significantly altered the legal status of the UK\u2019s assertion of its sovereignty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/chagos_islands/giv-3902aWdtyWxAzKvM/\" data-alt=\"Chagos Islands map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/chagos_islands/giv-3902aWdtyWxAzKvM/\">Chagos Islands map</a> </figure>  <p>Addressing the court of appeal over a video link on Tuesday, Ben Jaffey QC, representing Hoareau, said: \u201cShe has never received compensation to any extent. No agreement was reached with Chagossians resettled in the Seychelles. If the UK is in effective control of the territory, it is required to observe human rights. There\u2019s no difference in principle between the [status of BIOT] and that of [UK] military bases in Afghanistan or occupied Iraq.\u201d</p> <p>The European court of human rights in Strasbourg has recognised that where states are in effective control of territory, even if it is geographically outside Europe, they can be held liable for breaches of human rights.</p> <p>Jaffey said: \u201cThe UK is in practical control of the territory. If Ms Hoareau wanted to exercise her rights [under the European convention of human rights] she would be arrested. The continued exclusion of Chagossians is a human rights issue, and it\u2019s an ongoing issue rather than a historical one.\u201d</p> <p>Hoareau, who is represented by the law firm Leigh Day, and Bancoult, who is represented by the firm Clifford Chance, argue that a decision taken by the UK government in 2016 not to support resettlement of the Chagossians was unlawful. The high court dismissed their claims in February 2019.</p> <p> Hoareau said last year: \u201cFor years, we have fought tirelessly to be able to return home to our islands and we will continue to do so. We have been dealt a blow today but we will fight on to try to hold the UK government to account for their shameful actions.\u201d</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>Though it majors in killing, coronavirus certainly enjoys a sideways glance at inequality. In April, we discovered that the British TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/10/working-ventilators-from-holby-city-set-donated-to-nhs-nightingale\">Holby City</a> owned only one fewer working ventilator than the African country Liberia. On Sunday, construction and manufacturing workers were told to get back to work by a man who skived off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">five consecutive Cobra meetings</a> during a wildly mushrooming global epidemic. Five! Boris Johnson couldn\u2019t even be bothered to turn up and grip the government\u2019s crucial early response to a deadly virus \u2013 are we supposed to believe he\u2019d be rushing back to finish a loft extension out of civic duty? He\u2019s not even prime minister out of civic duty.</p> <p>Still, that\u2019s showbiz. You miss one universal credit meeting and your benefits are stopped; you miss five Cobra meetings and you get to address the nation on its working responsibilities from a drawing room so vast you\u2019d need a hansom cab to traverse it. (When are we de-furloughing the hansom cabbies? I don\u2019t care if they are dead and from the 19th century: that\u2019s hardly a bar to this government assessing them as fit for work.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is mid-May. You now cannot optimise for both safety and the economy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system\">Johnson\u2019s Sunday address</a>, it was taped in advance, which at least spared people his involuntary smirk as they were apparently being told to trudge into work in 12 hours\u2019 time. In fact, for a man who prides himself on his public speaking \u2013 he also regards his hair as winsome \u2013 Johnson is increasingly a pre-record artiste. Unlike Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin, Boris Johnson is not what you\u2019d call a one-take performer. There\u2019s a strong sense that a performing seal could nail it quicker, and with marginally less alarming flipper gestures. His live appearances on Monday cast Johnson as the hapless waiter of public health. Word salad! I have a word salad! Did someone order the word salad? In Johnson\u2019s hands a Q&amp;A becomes a Q&amp;FA. You\u2019re getting nothing from this guy.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t help, of course, that the public doesn\u2019t like his new stuff. As you\u2019ll be aware, the government has changed its central message with all the silky skills of me DJing. \u201cRight, well, you\u2019ve had enough of that one \u2026\u201d [horrendous needle scratch] \u201c\u2026 let\u2019s see what you think of this, which I like to think of as a medley of six kinds of music \u2026 Hang on, where are you all off to?\u201d I suppose the worry with the government is that they will end up floor-clearing in a rather more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-advice-coronavirus-spread-work\">permanent way</a>.</p> <p>Anyway: \u201cStay alert, control the virus, save lives.\u201d Though the slogan reads like it was produced by an off-brand smartphone left running overnight in a Ukrainian bot farm, some of the detail feels even more random. Take the plan to require international arrivals to the UK to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-travel-industry-warns-against-nightmare-of-two-week-quarantine\">quarantine for 14 days</a>, which will start not even now, but at some unspecified point, soonish. This feels not so much like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, as allowing the horse to bolt, then turning to your wife a couple of months later and saying, \u201cTell you what might look nice: a stable. Let\u2019s get some plans drawn up. I feel like a door might be an idea? We could put it over there \u2013 where that horse we used to have used to be.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s something to do with Johnson\u2019s heavily foregrounded insistence on not rushing things, which also means we keep having to hear the phrase \u201cbaby steps\u201d from a man who tends not to stick around to see them. </p> <p>Then again, absurdities are everywhere. As of Tuesday\u2019s breakfast shows, it became clear that we have reached the stage of <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/12/edwina-currie-tells-piers-morgan-son-can-clean-house-claims-government-plans-are-common-sense-12690308/\">Edwina Currie</a> turning up to deliver lectures on how to impart information during a public health crisis. I mean really, who better, short of exhuming Ronald Reagan? (Although he says just as much about Aids today as he did when it mattered.)</p> <p>In the end, no matter how wheedlingly Johnson appeals to the \u201ccommon sense of the British people\u201d, it\u2019s hard to escape the sense that he\u2019s ruling carelessly on workers who don\u2019t get to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s my motivation?\u201d Their part in the war effort, and all that. And yet, without underplaying the strategic importance of whatever white elephant luxury apartment complex any labourers are currently working on, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re wondering whether they really are as key to the war effort as the guy running the entire war.</p> <p>If only Johnson had gone \u201cback to work\u201d, as it were, in February, instead of repairing to Chequers to sort out his divorce/remarriage/endless drama cycle. The government was told from multiple quarters that they would be playing a doomed game of catch-up if they didn\u2019t act fast in February and early March, when \u2013 had we wished to learn them \u2013 the lessons of other countries were already becoming available. Failure to do so has got us where we are \u2013 a place where we have tanked the economy AND STILL notched up the highest death toll in Europe, and the second highest recorded in the world. If you give us some stools, we\u2019ll fall between them. It is mid-May. You now cannot optimise for both safety and the economy. Yet they would in much greater part have gone together had we acted more quickly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues\">UK coronavirus live: Sunak extends furlough job retention scheme until end of October</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, alas, is the dramatically ironic way that time works in the coronavirus era. An action you did or didn\u2019t do doesn\u2019t have immediate consequences, but you reap its harvest on a lag. If you made a mistake several weeks ago, it doesn\u2019t show up at first, but the consequences are most surely in the post. Odd that Johnson didn\u2019t reflexively understand this concept, given his extensive experience with both ancient Greek tragedy and unplanned pregnancy.</p> <p>He does cut a faintly tragic figure now, released each morning by his handlers into St James\u2019s Park with a mug and told to do his business, then snuffle about until he finds the photographer. \u201cWe will be governed entirely by the science,\u201d he kept gibbering on Monday. We will be governed entirely by you, more\u2019s the pity.</p> <p>It all comes back to the idea of public service, on which the prime minister is also failing to play catch-up. You wouldn\u2019t find a single friend of Johnson\u2019s who would begin to pretend he got into politics out of some commitment to public service, or even the vaguest set of ideas about how things should be run. A certain amount of egotism comes as standard, of course, for holders of his office. But whatever people on all sides thought about a huge range of previous prime ministers, there was at least an element of public duty to them, however disagreeably to some they might have chosen to express it. To even suggest it of Johnson would be screamingly absurd and everyone knows it. There is literally nothing there except personal ambition \u2013 and we\u2019re all condemned to live within his limitations in a situation where they\u2019re at their very deadliest.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian journalist</p>",

With studio access and in-person collaborations impossible in lockdown, musicians are now all ostensibly bedroom artists.</p> <p>Home studios, from Prince\u2019s Paisley Park to Lee Scratch Perry\u2019s Black Ark, have long played pivotal roles in musical history, with the likes of Joe Meek, Brian Wilson and Paul McCartney also favouring them. More recently, Billie Eilish recorded her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/18/best-albums-2019-no-3-billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go\">multi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/18/best-albums-2019-no-3-billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go\">million-selling debut</a> in her family home, while Grimes\u2019 breakthrough LP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/28/grimes-visions-montreal\">Visions</a>, was made in her apartment. Kevin Parker records all Tame Impala\u2019s albums at home. Grime flourished from kids making beats on PlayStations or cheap software, and dance tracks are rattled out in bedrooms constantly; Grammy-nominated LA artist Steve Lacy even produces beats on his iPhone.</p> <p>In fact, WFH has become so commonplace in the industry that the practice has spawned its own genre: bedroom pop. Lapped up by a hip, disaffected teen audience, the style is dreamy, introspective and intimate, spanning across indie, pop, R&amp;B and emo, and it has been boosted by a Spotify playlist of the same name \u2013 one track, Death Bed by drowsy rapper Powfu and bedroom pop star Beabadoobee, has reached the Top 5 on the UK charts. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how bedroom pop has become a genre,\u201d says Mac DeMarco, whose lo-fi indie is famously made at home. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s probably my fault.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq4TEU-wHo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pzq4TEU-wHo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>At 30, DeMarco is something of an old-timer compared with Gen Z proponents such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/07/one-to-watch-beabadoobee-bea-kristi-space-cadet\">Beabadoobee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/07/clairo-live-electric-ballroom-london\">Clairo</a>.

She considers \u201cbedroom pop\u201d an evolutionary term, like indie becoming a sound rather than strictly the product of an independent label. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how it sounds than where it\u2019s made,\u201d she says. \u201cPop bangers are being made in bedrooms and bedroom pop-ish songs in studios.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the gloss of some modern day bedroom music, its origins were primitive. The late Daniel Johnston made tapes in his parents\u2019 basement, Liz Phair got signed from childhood bedroom demos and John Darnielle of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/26/mountain-goats-in-league-with-dragons-review-john-darnielle\">Mountain Goats</a> recorded with a $90 boombox. Mistakes were inescapable; grinding tape wheels became musical collaborators rather than defects. \u201cListening back a part would get slower and it was because I was turning the lyric pages with my toes,\u201d Darnielle recalls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af6349085c798adf3ea4bc1ccd364af0f5362b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af6349085c798adf3ea4bc1ccd364af0f5362b5f/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">During lockdown, John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats has made his first boombox album since 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lalitree Darnielle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The thrill of a recorded take minutes after completion of a song was big for Darnielle. \u201cJust going from D to G, I sound like someone who\u2019s scaled Everest,\u201d he says of the recordings. During lockdown Darnielle has made his first boombox album since 2002, Songs for Pierre Chuvin \u2013 he dusted off the old piece of equipment, stood it on one end to get rid of the loud rattle it had acquired, and went at it. \u201cIt was glorious,\u201d he says. \u201cI was an old-school Mountain Goats fan again.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://krecs.com/collections/calvin-johnson\">Calvin Johnson</a>, of K Records and the indie-pop band Beat Happening, set up Dub Narcotic studios in his basement in 1993. Miranda July, Built to Spill and Beck all recorded there. \u201cIt was to demystify that it\u2019s hard to record,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to record, just hit record. It\u2019s not about equipment. For the Beck record we had nothing, just inspiration.\u201d Years later, Greta Kline of Frankie Cosmos, often labelled bedroom pop, took influence. \u201cCalvin\u2019s approach made me feel like I could make music too,\u201d she says, \u201cto connect to a song without it being produced in an unachievable way.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Also, I\u2019m a control freak, I don\u2019t like to be on the clock and I don\u2019t play well with others</p> <footer> <cite>Mac DeMarco</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Embracing rough edges is not the same as making intentionally bad music, Johnson stresses. \u201cWe weren\u2019t saying: make it sound shitty. We were saying: make it sound as good as we can.\u201d Moore mirrors this. \u201cTake Beatles bootlegs. You don\u2019t think: that\u2019s unlistenable, listen to that background noise. That\u2019s an absurd thought.\u201d</p> <p>As technology evolved, so did the sound. In the digital age, lo-fi music was made to the warm hum of a laptop fan rather than the grainy whirr of spinning tape spools. In the 2000s, Ariel Pink was making psychedelic electronic music at home. \u201cI concocted a bubble for myself,\u201d says Pink, a disciple of Moore\u2019s. \u201cIt was me against the world.\u201d He describes himself as \u201cpeerless\u201d and says he was \u201calmost Nazi-like about not being into things other people liked. I wanted to sound from a different era. To convince people it was a degraded tape.\u201d</p> <p>This creation of an imagined sonic past became part of the zeitgeist, with Pink\u2019s unique style \u2013 dubbed hypnagogic pop \u2013 shaping the burgeoning home-recorded chillwave scene (typified by hazy, amorphous lo-fi tones). Ernest Greene of Washed Out was one of that genre\u2019s breakout artists. \u201cI was interested in bringing out this really nostalgic sensation,\u201d he reflects. While lo-fi music is often interpreted as possessing a deliberate indifference or disdain for clarity, it often reflects experimentation with the latest technology. \u201cIllegal rips of Ableton software were easy to get,\u201d Greene recalls, also crediting YouTube as a goldmine for tutorials and esoteric sonic influences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb49a31bea64ef4e9ea287c9883239ee8d7f3836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb49a31bea64ef4e9ea287c9883239ee8d7f3836/0_408_1200_1390/863.jpg\" alt=\"Ariel Pink.\" width=\"863\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was me against the world\u2019 \u2026 Ariel Pink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eliot Lee Hazel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aside from these practical benefits, what is the deeper appeal of home recording now? \u201cI\u2019m a cheap bastard,\u201d jokes DeMarco. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m a control freak, I don\u2019t like to be on the clock and I don\u2019t play well with others.\u201d Creative autonomy is another factor. \u201cWhen small new indie bands bring in producers, it\u2019s weird to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a painter and having someone else go to the store and choose your palette for you.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My studio feels like having an extra limb right now</p> <footer> <cite>Marie Ulven</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Home recording can bolster confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s less pressured,\u201d says Ulven. \u201cI can fool around and have nothing come out of it but in a studio there\u2019s expectations.

That rawness has been lacking in pop. It\u2019s resonating because it\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p> <p>For Darnielle, the approach gave him a lifelong ethos. \u201c[Having] nobody listening creates maximum freedom,\u201d he says. \u201cThat sets you up to write as though nobody is ever going to hear it, to only please yourself. You owe your craft your truth and that\u2019s never truer when nobody else is there.\u201d It gives DeMarco a focus on the purity of music. \u201cNew artists often get caught up in shit outside of just making music,\u201d he says. \u201cBedroom recording works so well because you can just do it.

  "<p>When James \u201cCharlie\u201d Mahoney and his older brother Melvin went to medical school in the 80s, black doctors were hard to find.</p> <p>\u201cWe remember what it was like when you didn\u2019t see anybody that looked like you,\u201d said Melvin, an internal medicine doctor who worked alongside Mahoney. Even now this group <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/workforce/interactive-data/figure-18-percentage-all-active-physicians-race/ethnicity-2018\">comprises only</a> 5% of the physician workforce.</p> <p>Mahoney wasn\u2019t a \u201ccrusader\u201d, Melvin said. Instead, he approached everything he did with calm resolve, eschewing hospital hierarchies, and leaving the door open for those who followed.</p> <p>Mahoney would go on to become a respected pulmonologist and pillar of his Brooklyn university hospital<strong> </strong>system<strong>,</strong> who led his team into the Covid-19 crisis. But he couldn\u2019t avoid the dangers that frontline workers face \u2013 particularly as a lung doctor treating a respiratory illness.</p> <p>Like many public hospitals in New York, Mahoney\u2019s workplace didn\u2019t have enough protective equipment at the onset of the pandemic and staffing was strained. The exposure was inescapable.</p> <p>\u201cHe was handling patients and codes<strong> </strong>[patients needing intensive intervention]<strong> </strong>every five to 10 minutes,\u201d said Purna Atluri, a gastroenterologist who worked with Mahoney for more than 20 years. \u201cHe was doing everything he could.\u201d</p> <p>Atluri was concerned about his friend because he was heavyset, a risk factor for the virus. But for weeks, Mahoney seemed healthy and mostly worried about his sister, who had experienced coronavirus complications.</p> <p>That would change in a matter of days.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of our legends \u2013 he\u2019s one of our giants,\u201d said neurologist and colleague Julien Cavanagh.</p> <p>Mahoney started working alongside his older brother when he was eight years old \u2013 at three jobs, no less. Growing up in military housing on Long Island, New York, they put in hours at a laundromat, German delicatessen and luncheonette.</p> <p>Even back then, people noticed quiet, intelligent Mahoney. \u201cHe was really loved by everyone,\u201d Melvin said.</p> <p>During college, Mahoney transported patients at Long Beach hospital \u2013 a job that revealed parts of the hospital that physicians often overlook. \u201cHe could see what it was like to be at a different level \u2013 he could see if a patient didn\u2019t get their food, or if someone took it away too quickly,\u201d Melvin said.</p> <p>A higher-up at the hospital recommended Mahoney for SUNY Downstate Medical School. He graduated in 1986,<strong> </strong>and worked at SUNY Downstate\u2019s Intensive Care Unit and the affiliated Kings County hospital,<strong> </strong>until the end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d511cfa7d8b7dce4112359ea1a5e89abeae32c44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d511cfa7d8b7dce4112359ea1a5e89abeae32c44/0_77_2916_2823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Mahoney. \u2018He would talk to housekeeping like he would talk to the chief of the hospital.

People called him a teddy bear, because he was kind and soft-spoken. But he was assertive if he noticed injustice \u2013 which, <a href=\"https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/strategy/ama-apologizes-black-doctors-past-racism\">like many</a> physicians of color, he experienced throughout his career.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where he would stand his ground,\u201d Chisolm said. \u201cHe told that to a lot of his residents who were people of color: you\u2019re just as smart as everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>Mahoney\u2019s steadfast, egalitarian nature made him a favorite among patients. His hospital system serves a majority black, low-income population with high rates of chronic disease. But he would never consider a patient\u2019s insurance status or hesitate to call in other specialists.</p> <p>Anything Mahoney learned, he taught. Cavanagh, who trained under Mahoney, said he could call him at 3am with questions about a patient, and never feel ashamed. But Mahoney demanded excellence.</p> <p>\u201cHe was someone you think of when writing your [patient] notes,\u201d Cavanagh said. \u201cHe was someone that you wanted to make proud.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was handling patients and codes every five to ten minutes</p> <footer> <cite>Purna Atluri, gastroenterologist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mahoney\u2019s teaching extended beyond work. He coached baseball and football teams in Baldwin, Long Island, where he and his ex-wife Lisa Johnson Mahoney raised three children: Stephanie, Jamie and Ryan.</p> <p>In January, Mahoney, had planned to scale back hospital hours. He went on a Caribbean cruise with his father and sister \u2013 one of 50 cruises in his lifetime.<strong> </strong>\u201cHe said, \u2018that\u2019s probably gonna be my retirement cruise,\u2019\u201d Chisolm said.</p> <p>Then the pandemic hit.</p> <p>Mahoney was well-trained to treat Covid-19 patients. And public hospitals, already stretched thin, were bracing for an influx of patients. So he went \u201crunning into the fire\u201d, Melvin said. Brooklyn has had 40,000 Covid-19 cases, and the virus hit black and Latino communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">the hardest</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time I saw him was at the beginning of the pandemic,\u201d Cavanagh said. \u201cI said, are we going to get through this? And he said, oh yeah, we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d</p> <p>But in early April, Mahoney started coughing and running a fever. On Easter Sunday, after Chisolm recovered, Mahoney\u2019s family noticed on a video chat that he didn\u2019t look well.

In its place, the group propose a decentralised strategy that puts GPs and local health teams at the heart of outbreak control.

You need your local GPs and local healthcare workers and all the rest of it in play.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThis is is moving from the national top-down testing we have now to something much more responsive and flexible. Infections come and go, that\u2019s how they work. You monitor for a signal locally, perhaps a few people in a care home, and then you take a local decision with the public health team to go and test more.\u201d </p> \n<p>As a first step, the government should rapidly invest in measures to stop the virus from spreading in high-risk settings, such as care homes and hospitals, prisons and migrant detention facilities, and homes that are overcrowded or contain multiple generations, the experts say.</p> \n<p>The report goes on to criticise the government\u2019s reliance on \u201cinaccurate, incomplete and selective data\u201d and confusing messaging, in particular the new \u201cstay alert\u201d message, and notes that ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/top-experts-not-asked-approve-stay-alert-coronavirus-message-whitty-vallance\">do not appear to be listening</a> to advice from behavioural science advisers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is not clear what people are meant to be alert for, nor indeed what they should do if they are alerted to something.

The strategic benefits to the US of \u2018stability in the Euro-Atlantic region\u2019 are also very real,\u201d they said.</p> <p>The former officers and defence ministers urged Russia to drop <a href=\"https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/80738\">infringements of the treaty</a>, cited by its US opponents as reasons for withdrawal: limitations on flights over the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad and the creation of an exclusion corridor along the border of the Russian-occupied regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>But if the US does leave the treaty, the statement argues its Nato allies should stay in the agreement, noting that European states perform 55% of the flights and are the subject of nearly 59% of Russian overflights. European states do not have the satellite-surveillance capacity of the US, so are particularly reliant on Open Skies flights, which can be carried out under cloud cover.</p> <p>It calls for the remaining parties to the treaty to meet within two months of a US withdrawal to discuss how the agreement would function without Washington. That would involve limits on what information Nato members could share with the US.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for western European governments, to be prepared for this,\u201d said Andreas Persbo, ELN research director. \u201cFor them this treaty has some value, and it would be in their interest to continue flying over Russia, and Russia would like to continue to overfly western Europe. The question is can that be maintained without Russia exacting too heavy a price from western governments.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I borrowed this Vivienne Westwood dress to wear to the opening of the V&amp;A\u2019s retrospective of the designer in 2004. I wore it with gold Miu Miu shoes and a Versace chain bag. Afterwards, I was asked if I wanted to buy the dress and I remember thinking: \u201cI really, really want to but I can\u2019t afford it!\u201d I think it was about \u00a3800 \u2013 and that was probably with a discount. I wasn\u2019t earning much at the time and I thought: \u201cThere\u2019s no way, I just can\u2019t.\u201d But I know that if I had bought it, I would have kept it for ever \u2013 so it was one that got away, basically.</p> <p>My daughters think I haven\u2019t changed my style since the 90s [when Lowe was the vocalist of the indie bands Powder and Lodger and part of the \u201cPrimrose Hill set\u201d, alongside Kate Moss, Jude Law and Sadie Frost]. If I was going on stage, I always felt I should make an effort. I wore a lot of sequin dresses and high heels. My peers were into short hair, jeans, bomber jackets and I remember one saying to me: \u201cI think you\u2019d get more fans if you didn\u2019t dress as glamorously \u2013 girls won\u2019t like you.\u201d But that was what I loved, that old-school glamour. Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor, Vivien Leigh, Lauren Hutton \u2013 they all dressed up and looked fantastic.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been very much my own person. Everyone I knew in the 90s was <em>so</em> thin and I\u2019m not. Skinny jeans don\u2019t suit me because I\u2019ve got hips and a bum. Attitudes to body image weren\u2019t so accepting when I was younger but I love voluptuous girls. When I\u2019m casting models for my range I\u2019m like: \u201cHang on, I don\u2019t want a size four \u2013 have you got any \u2026 12s?\u201d My daughter Daisy models a lot of my clothes. When I\u2019m designing interiors, I love things that have a story to tell. I adore anything steeped in history. The same with fashion: I\u2019m forever going to flea markets and antiques shops looking for the perfect vintage dress.</p> <p>There are six of us in my family and we are very strong characters, so I was worried about arguments during the lockdown, but we have not had one yet! We have just embraced this time: cooked meals, done dance classes, made candles, loads of quizzes on Zoom. I\u2019ve also been making Liberty-print facemasks, which everyone went nuts for on Instagram, so that has kept me busy.</p> <p><em>Pearl Lowe\u2019s latest collection is available at <a href=\"http://pearllowe.co.uk/\">pearllowe.co.uk</a></em></p>",
  "<p>In an extraordinary statement against a former president, the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has told Barack Obama to \u201ckeep his mouth shut\u201d over criticism of Donald Trump, calling him \u201cclassless\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">What is 'Obamagate' and why is Trump so worked up about it?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/obama-leaked-conversation-us-rule-of-law-at-risk-flynn-case-dropped\">remarks by Obama were leaked to Yahoo News</a> that were highly critical about Trump and his administration, seeming to break a convention in US politics that former occupants of the White House rarely criticize their successors.</p> \n<p>Speaking to alumni of his administration, Obama said he was worried about the \u201crule of law\u201d, in light of the justice department\u2019s decision to drop its case against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn. That\u2019s the issue at the heart of Trump\u2019s attempts to gin up an \u201cObamagate\u201d scandal, which on Tuesday morning he again claimed \u201cmakes Watergate look small time!\u201d</p> \n<p>Obama also said the response to the coronavirus pandemic had been \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d.</p> \n<p>McConnell was <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/497239-mcconnell-obama-should-have-kept-his-mouth-shut-on-trumps-coronavirus\">speaking</a> to Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump in an online fundraiser on Monday night.</p> \n<p>Asked about Obama \u201cslamming\u201d the administration for its response to the coronavirus outbreak, he said: \u201cI think President Obama should have kept his mouth shut.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou know, we know he doesn\u2019t like much this administration is doing. That\u2019s understandable. But I think it\u2019s a little bit classless frankly to critique an administration that comes after you.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cYou had your shot. You were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bushes set up of not critiquing the president who comes after you is a good tradition.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is a tradition of former presidents not commenting on or attacking their successors in the Oval Office, but Trump is not part of the informal club which currently includes Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and he has regularly attacked those who went before him.</p> \n<p>Plus, Obama\u2019s views of Trump are pretty well known, if usually by indirect routes and leaks to the press. For example, in a Hulu documentary about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign against Trump, the Virginia senator Tim Kaine is seen to say the then president thinks Trump is a fascist.</p> \n<p>In the remarks leaked to Yahoo News, Obama said he would be hitting the campaign trail for Joe Biden this fall to help him try to unseat Trump and make him a one-term president. Biden leads Trump in key swing states and national polling and McConnell is also presiding over a Senate majority that now looks increasingly at risk as Republican popularity dips.</p>",
  "<p>If you haven\u2019t yet heard, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the best-selling video game of 2020. In the two months since its debut on the Nintendo Switch console, ACNH has sold over 13m copies and cemented itself as the game of the moment, and probably the entertainment title of the coronavirus era.</p> <p>In Animal Crossing you\u2019ll find pop culture coming to life in an alternate adorable reality. Elijah Wood and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are playing the game and visiting virtual fan islands. There\u2019s a late-night talkshow, complete with studio set, hosted by screenwriter Gary Whitta. Streetwear label 100 Thieves launched their entire clothing line as a free download. NFL team Detroit Lions released their 2020 schedule through a hilarious video staged inside the game. Guy Fieri has finally created an actual Flavortown.</p> <p>As the fourth installment in the Animal Crossing franchise, New Horizons is the first to see this level of global success, far outselling the season\u2019s most highly anticipated AAA title Final Fantasy VII. But would this game have taken the world by storm if Covid-19 didn\u2019t?</p> <p>The answer boils down to one thing. Or entity. God.</p> <p>Bear with me here.</p> <p>For decades, we\u2019ve witnessed a decline in younger generations claiming religion and attending services. According to a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/2018/06/13/why-do-levels-of-religious-observance-vary-by-age-and-country/\">Pew study</a>, weekly worship attendance is most common where expected life is shortest. Millions of worlds have come crashing down with the coronavirus, and while belief in a God continues to drop, there remains a huge need for a heaven to escape to \u2013 a place where people can control how everything goes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is Animal Crossing a modern interpretation of a call to religion?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When you first begin your Animal Crossing game, you\u2019ll design a human character in your own likeness. The next step is to descend your progeny to your new island utopia, free from the pressures of the outside world. No global pandemic or murder hornets. No problematic political candidates or undead dictators. It\u2019s just your chosen one and a few adorable talking animal neighbors, all looking to start over.</p> <p>During the early zen garden stage of the game, you\u2019ll water flowers, mine rocks for minerals, pick fruit and reel in fish. At the end of your first ACNH session you can sit back like Thanos in retirement, watching the fruits of your effort take bloom. Forget seven days, you just birthed a new world in a couple of hours.</p> <p>From morning to night. Animal Crossing is your escape from the darkness of the real world. As your character becomes more intelligent, he or she will learn to craft the tools and objects that please you. The island you control is your reward for finishing that work video call, possibly taking place <em>during</em> that work video call.</p> <p>As you spread the word of ACNH to anyone who\u2019ll listen, a new circle of friends will emerge. In a weekly communal ritual every Tuesday night, you\u2019ll visit each other\u2019s islands on your \u201cAnimals Crossing\u201d Zoom and discuss how to intelligently design a more perfect paradise. While they show off their cute homes, hilarious fashion and physics-defying landscaping, you might give them a peek at your island\u2019s hedge maze and spooky new dungeon.</p> <p>You inevitably become a cruel God. As more animals take residence on your island you grow favorites. The cute, funny ones that approach and seemingly worship your character get preferential treatment and are showered with daily gifts. The needs of the boring and annoying ones are ignored. And when the residents you don\u2019t care for come to you in despair, you let them pack up and leave the island rather than see to their emotional needs. You might even ask Isabelle, the human resources shih tzu in Town Hall, to banish them. You can, because it\u2019s <em>your</em> island.</p> <p>Your final act of corruption comes when you enter the Stalk Market, an in-game Wall Street-style mechanism where your player purchases turnips each Sunday and during the week sells them off for a profit or loss of Bells, the in-game currency. Once you hit it big in Stalks, you risk shifting your focus to profits and productivity and market volatility. You\u2019re back to where you started before you ever turned Animal Crossing on for the first time: in debt. Uncertainty. Competition.</p> <p>Every Animal Crossing player is aware of losing sight of what makes the game a perfect escape \u2013 talking animals and the long, slow blossom of nature. They know the risk of forgoing the slow meditative tasks that brought them sanctity in the first place, when it\u2019s no longer worth their time to water the flowers, harvest the orchard, or catch butterflies.</p> <p>It\u2019s OK, maybe more than OK, for a video game to remind us of what matters. Playing God isn\u2019t a bad thing. It\u2019s OK for us to want to shape our world, even if that world is a fake island with talking animals.</p> <p>Is Animal Crossing a modern interpretation of a call to religion? Right now we\u2019re yearning for a sense of divine creation, a way to connect with the goodness and innocence of nature.</p> <p>We seek a congregation of like-minded believers to build something beautiful together. A promised land where everything is perfect, just like we deserve.</p> <p>Salvation doesn\u2019t have to occur inside a church or temple. For some it can be found in a Nintendo game designed for children, needed by adults.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rohit Thawani is a creative working at the intersection of tech and advertising.

  "<p>Regular gamblers have stepped up their betting during lockdown, prompting a call from the industry regulator for firms to introduce new measures to protect vulnerable people.</p> <p>The Gambling Commission found that, overall, gambling is down due to the absence of sporting events such as football, which typically attracts a high volume of occasional bettors.</p> <p>But data from the polling company YouGov found that nearly two-thirds of \u201cengaged\u201d gamblers \u2013 those who spend on three or more betting products a month \u2013 have increased the time or money they spend.</p> <p>Data collected from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling\">gambling</a> firms themselves shows that while the number of sports bets has fallen by 31%, online slot machines are up 25%, poker has jumped by 38% and betting on virtual sports has soared by 40%.</p> <p>The number of gambling sessions that last for more than an hour has also increased, by 23% year on year to 1.9m in March.</p> <p>The regulator published the evidence amid concern among MPs and campaigners about the industry\u2019s commitment to protecting vulnerable people, including by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/gambling-firms-social-messages-are-thinly-veiled-adverts-say-mps\">curbing advertising</a>.</p> <p>The commission said companies should now take further steps to protect people.</p> <p>These include ceasing to offer bonuses to customers displaying indicators of gambling-related harm and a requirement that firms interact with people who play for longer than an hour to ensure they are not in distress.</p> <p>The guidelines also say gambling firms should prevent reverse withdrawals, which is where a customer wins money, opts to withdraw it into their bank account, but then cancels the transaction and ploughs it straight back into another wager.</p> <p>Reverse withdrawals are a controversial feature of online gambling and are cited by the commission as indicating that someone may not be in control of their betting.</p> <p>Tighter player protection measures such as these could become a permanent fixture, depending on the outcome of a review, which the commission is bringing forward.</p> <p>The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: \u201cIt is vital that people are protected from the threat of gambling-related harm and I welcome these latest steps from the Gambling Commission.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will not hesitate to take further action if required.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOperators must use the data they hold to protect their customers and now, more than ever, it\u2019s vital that online operators really know their customers by monitoring how long they are playing for and understanding how financial uncertainty is impacting them and what they can afford to gamble with,\u201d said the commission\u2019s chief executive, Neil McArthur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are monitoring online operators closely and if we see irresponsible behaviour we will step in immediately, suspending licences if we need to.\u201d</p> <p>Under the guidelines, operators should also review the trigger points at which they carry out problem-gambling checks on new customers, whose typical patterns of play are not yet well understood.</p> <p>Where there is suspicion of a problem, the customer should be blocked pending affordability checks to ensure they are gambling within their means.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s reputation for its handling of the coronavirus epidemic has taken another global pasting after newspapers worldwide reported on what they described as confusion and internal divisions that are rapidly creating a crisis as big as Brexit for the UK.</p> \n<p>With many diplomats admitting that soft power reputations are being forged or destroyed during the pandemic, the European press in particular is taking time to point out that the UK is experiencing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-40000-official-figures-say\">worst death rate in Europe</a>, revealing a National Health Service that is underfunded and underprepared.</p> \n<p>The UK is also being singled out as the country that led on the theory of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-herd-immunity-yes-it-was-part-of-the-plan\">herd immunity</a> only to backtrack.</p> \n<p>One of the UK\u2019s diplomatic strengths has long been its international advocacy for global health, and its poor domestic performance may damage its influence worldwide.</p> \n<p>The German newspaper Die Zeit put the UK near the bottom of the league table, writing: \u201cIn Great Britain, the infection has spread unchecked longer than it should have. The wave of infections also spread from the hospitals to the old people\u2019s homes, which could also have been avoided. The government is now trying to pretend to the public that it has the situation under control.\u201d</p> \n<p>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung acknowledged the UK\u2019s special context: \u201cThe prime minister may be credited with having to fight a harder struggle than some other heads of government. Britain (and London in particular) is particularly vulnerable. As a former colonial power and Europe\u2019s air hub, it is in close contact with the world. Many Britons live in metropolitan areas where the virus spreads faster. With the state\u2019s National Health Service, the nation has also given itself a health system that is cumbersome, bureaucratic and has been underfunded for some time.\u201d</p> \n<p>It predicted: \u201cOnce the nation has returned to normal, more citizens than before may question faith in British exceptionalism. That will not immediately drive them back into the arms of the European Union.

Until now.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an editorial, Le Monde, the leading French daily, described Britain\u2019s new slogan as cringeworthy, given the UK had recorded the worst mortality figures in Europe.</p> \n<p>Its news report suggested the UK itself was \u201cfading\u201d and added: \u201cDespite Europe\u2019s worst mortality, probably too late entry into confinement and a blatant lack of preparation, the British have so far supported Johnson.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant also challenged the UK performance: \u201cAccording to many, testing, testing, testing is the motto. That has hardly happened in the UK for weeks, losing sight of the spread of the virus. This gap shows that the British were insufficiently prepared for the pandemic, despite the presence of expertise in this area. The country has been catching up in recent weeks. Much of the harm has already been done.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet criticised Johnson\u2019s ambiguity while the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson.html\">New York Times</a> said many had been left baffled, adding: \u201cHis proposals had run into a barrage of opposition, as critics pointed to gaps and contradictions in a plan that left many pondering basic questions such as when to return to work and how to get there.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-slowly-returns-to-work-11589226213\">Wall Street Journal</a>, owned by Rupert Murdoch, was more sympathetic, saying the UK faced the same trade-offs as countries worldwide, but warned: \u201cIt\u2019s quickly becoming a bigger political challenge for Prime Minister Boris Johnson than Brexit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and a great student of the soft power league table, <a href=\"https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/when-the-pandemic-recedes-the-world-may-see-the-rise-of-new-soft-powers-1.1014764\">recently wrote</a>: \u201cThis will be a defining period for national identities, as many of us are more attuned to what is happening globally and have more time to absorb it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe reputation of nations has been put under the microscope.

Several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that the president has been making unsubstantiated voter fraud comments for years, I expect that these comments will continue,\u201d said Richard Hasen, a professor of election law at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe comments are very worrisome because they increase the chances that the president\u2019s supporters would not accept the election results as legitimate should he lose in November.\u201d</p> <p>Hasen and other experts helped author <a href=\"https://www.law.uci.edu/faculty/full-time/hasen/2020ElectionReport.pdf\">a report </a>last month offering guidance on how to shore up confidence in the results of the 2020 election. The recommendations include getting states to develop emergency contingency plans well in advance and educating the public that election results might not be available on election night as officials count mailed-in ballots.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/america-voting-rights-vote-by-mail-republicans\">fighting over</a> how aggressively to expand efforts to vote by mail in November, but the fight over the availability of in-person voting is likely to continue to be an explosive issue. Faced with poll worker shortages and concerns about in-person gathering, election officials have severely cut back in-person voting. Parties and campaigns are likely to aggressively fight over which polling places close and where the new ones are placed.</p> <p>\u201cAll of those changes allow for someone frankly who wants to undermine our faith in the election system to say \u2018look at what they\u2019re doing to you. This is a corrupt system,\u2019\u201d said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly whenever there\u2019s a change in how we vote I think it can be unsettling for people, and they can question whether or not they can have faith in the system, and President Trump has seized that opening.\u201d</p>",

looking at the Covid response to include the impact on communities which were hit by the bushfires:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Centre Alliance member for Mayo, <strong>Rebekha Sharkie,</strong> from SA, and independent member for Indi, <strong>Helen Haines,</strong> from Victoria, have written to the committee chair, senator <strong>Katy Gallagher,</strong> asking the committee to hold special public hearings on the government response in communities hit hardest by the 2019-20 fires.</p> \n   <p>The hearings would call on witnesses from state and federal departments and agencies, including the national bushfire recovery agency, plus other groups and community representatives who can give a detailed picture of the delivery of relief and recovery efforts and the impact the Covid-19 restrictions and support packages have had on bushfire-affected communities.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 restrictions, while absolutely necessary from a public health perspective, have delivered a double economic and psychological blow to communities in my electorate and other bushfire-affected areas, and all of this has occurred in a matter of months,\u201d Sharkie said. </p> \n   <p>\u201cTourism operators in the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island were decimated by the fires and went from desperately calling for people to come and visit in order to help out to the government ordering Australians to stay home and stay away.</p> \n   <p>\u201cMeanwhile, with all the public attention focused on the Covid-19 response, our communities are telling us that the promised bushfire recovery support is not reaching the individuals, businesses and primary producers who need it in a timely manner.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time

  "<p>Our globalised world has been brought to a crashing halt by coronavirus.</p> <p>By April, over 90% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 7.1 billion people \u2013 lived in countries with coronavirus-related travel restrictions on people arriving from abroad,<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/01/more-than-nine-in-ten-people-worldwide-live-in-countries-with-travel-restrictions-amid-covid-19/\"> a Pew study found.</a></p> <p>And while local lockdowns are starting to ease in many countries now, the pause on international travel is likely to last far longer. With countries still focused on staving off a second wave of infections, there is little appetite for rapid reopening.</p> <p>\u201cTravel and immigration \u2013 for work, study, seeking asylum \u2013 is going to be disrupted much longer than our daily lives, in a way unprecedented in our lifetimes,\u201d said Prof Lindsay Wiley from the American University Washington College of Law.</p> <p>Senior figures in the aviation industry have already said they expect it to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">several years before passenger demand returns</a> to 2019 levels, if it ever does.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s tourism minister, Harry Theoharis, recently told the Guardian that although the country is desperate to protect its economy, long-haul flights to its islands and beaches are almost certainly out this year.</p> <p>Countries that acted fast to bring the disease under control \u2013 at least for now \u2013 are exploring ways to open up a limited \u201cbubble\u201d for their citizens to travel without restriction. The first to discuss the idea were New Zealand and Australia.</p> <p>Nine countries scattered across the world, but united in their successful handling of the virus are also actively seeking ways of setting up travel bubbles or corridors, broadening an unlikely alliance.</p> <p>In their second meeting via teleconference on Thursday, the leaders of Austria, Greece, Israel, Norway, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand agreed that as each begins to ease restrictions they could capitalise on low infection rates by creating tourism safe zones.</p> <p>Israel, Greece and Cyprus \u2013 tourist-dependent nations \u2013 are already discussing the idea in the eastern Mediterranean, and hoping to partially open up from July. On Wednesday the European commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/eu-reopen-borders-tourists-covid-19-recovery-plan\">is expected to recommend</a> a three-phase approach to reopening borders that brings together member states with \u201csimilar overall risk profiles\u201d.</p> <p>Any reopening would be very gradual however, with authorities prepared to shut back back down if the virus re-emerges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b3bb0f88b67ab4f1a0b9aa44b3d081898913baf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b3bb0f88b67ab4f1a0b9aa44b3d081898913baf/0_0_4552_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers walk through the United Airlines terminal at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers walk through the United Airlines terminal at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA month in an epidemic is a very long time,\u201d said Cyprus\u2019 chief virologist professor Leondios Kostrikis.</p> <p>And beyond these bubbles, travel is likely to be severely curtailed either by outright bans, or by quarantine rules. The UK, a laggard on quarantining by international standards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\">outlined its own plans at the weekend</a>. The incubation period of the disease means most countries are requiring two weeks isolation on arrival.</p> <p>If that is enforced in both departure and destination countries, it would mean a month under lockdown in total, in order for travellers to spend any time working or relaxing somewhere else \u2013 effectively putting an end to most business and tourism travel.</p> <p>These partial or total closures, while they may protect public health, come with a huge economic cost to countries dependent on tourism or other types of travel, like international students flying in for a university education. That burden might help attempts to reaccelerate opening of borders.</p> <p>\u201cFor a place like Hawaii or Iceland, or maybe New Zealand, you are talking about pretty dramatically restructuring your economy not to be dependent on inter-state or international tourism [and travel],\u201d said Wiley.</p> <p>\u201cYou can protect yourselves by isolating the entire jurisdiction, but then you have to think through how you restructure your whole economy if you aren\u2019t going to allow travel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb9fae6c6050fee125c7282e0aac0d0254de3c4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb9fae6c6050fee125c7282e0aac0d0254de3c4b/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People observe social distancing on a shuttle bus at Franjo Tudjman Airport in Zagreb, Croatia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People observe social distancing on a shuttle bus at Franjo Tudjman Airport in Zagreb, Croatia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet even partial, controlled re-opening to travel carries risks. The disease\u2019s long incubation period means the most up-to-date information on current infections may still miss the latest clusters; countries that seem disease free may be nursing fresh undetected infections.</p> <p>New York\u2019s outbreak provides a recent example of how ineffective travel bans can be; it appears to have been driven by cases from Italy, brought in after the US government halted entry of people coming from China but not from Europe.</p> <p>\u201cMy worry is that travel bans become a distraction from appropriately managing local transmission, that\u2019s what happened in the US, where we could have had a policy of \u2018test trace, isolate\u2019, and the focus was on the travel bans instead,\u201d said Alex Phelan, professor at Georgetown University Centre for Global Health, Science and Security.</p> <p>\u201cAs it demonstrated, if you are going to be putting bans in place against countries, you are always going to be acting on data that is out of date.\u201d</p> <p>And no travel ban is absolute; global supply chains mean people will continue travelling to transport goods, and most land borders are somewhat porous, so viruses can slip across with smuggled goods.</p> <p>\u201cWe human beings often have tried to forestall epidemics by shuttering, by drawing up the drawbridge, and there is no question that travel can spread some types of disease. But it\u2019s also much harder than we imagine to contain,\u201d said Wendy Parmet professor of law, public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern University.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is extraordinarily contagious. New Zealand is an island (nation), they may be the one place that can. I certainly don\u2019t think the US can, or the countries on the Eurasian continent can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73ab245cde900e06c9845aad3ce7918eccafe9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73ab245cde900e06c9845aad3ce7918eccafe9ec/0_2_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wears a face mask as she walks past the Colosseum in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman wears a face mask as she walks past the Colosseum in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Percossi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other options to try to restart travel before a vaccine is developed could include tests shortly before travel either for antibodies to prove immunity, or for the disease itself to prevent infected people travelling.</p> <p>There is precedent for requiring either immunity or virus-free status for travel; travellers coming from places with yellow fever are <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ith/ith_country_list.pdf\">required to have a vaccination certificate</a> for the disease to enter countries from Australia to India and Mexico.</p> <p>At a time of concern about the climate impact of flying, there are suggestions that some of the slide in travel could and should become permanent. And some businesses are already embracing the savings in costs and carbon that have been forced on them.</p> <p>\u201cWe had over 4 billion air passengers globally before the lockdown,\u201d said Monika B\u00fcscher, professor of sociology at Lancaster University, whose research work includes decarbonisation of transport. \u201cNow all the business travellers are learning to zoom, and business analysts suggest that 25% to 30% of the workforce will be doing this (permanently) by 2021.\u201d</p> <p>France has said its bailout of national carrier Air France will be dependent on the airline <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/air-france-bailout-domestic-flights/\">eliminating short domestic flights</a> where the trip could be made by train.</p> <p>And the enforced end of travel may change expectations around business travel in a positive way, said Prof James Faulconbridge, head of the Department of Organisation, Work and Technology at Lancaster University.</p> <p>\u201cMany of those meetings never needed to happen through travel anyway, but there was a sort of expectation, a working practice that associated travel and going to meet people as a way of doing business, a sign of commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Mass international travel only emerged a couple of decades ago; it is possible that habits could change dramatically again.</p> <p>\u201cIts easy to forget that it was only around the turn of the century that levels of travel we now accept as normal started to emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a reset that changes our presumption around travel is not as radical as it might appear.\u201d<br></p>",

Kaput. Last week the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s managing director of women\u2019s cricket, Clare Connor, admitted there may be no international women\u2019s cricket this summer. With a limited number of biosecure venues (Old Trafford and Southampton, with possibly one other in the mix), the ECB has decided that pragmatism wins \u2013 it will make the more lucrative men\u2019s game the priority.</p> <p>Not only that, but women\u2019s cricket seems to have lost control of the \u00a320m of funding promised for the next two years by the ECB last October. The ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, testifying to the digital, culture, media and sport subcommittee last week, confirmed the money would no longer be ringfenced: the family silver has been pulled out of the cupboard and shown to the pawnbroker, everything is now on the table.</p> <p>Connor will be \u201cdevastated\u201d if there is no women\u2019s international cricket this summer; as will the young players at grassroots level who fell in love with the game during the 2017 and 2019 World Cups, the professionals whose years at the top are so fragile and short, those who had gambled financially on Hundred contracts, and those in the middle who were hopeful of getting one of the 40 professional contracts designed to help bridge the gap between professional and amateur women\u2019s cricket and stop them drifting off to other careers. Those contracts, promised for early summer, are now delayed, with talk in the air of a much reduced retainer instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the female county players have been invited to a Zoom call with Connor on Thursday; it cannot come soon enough for many. The left-arm spinner Alex Hartley, who lost her England central contract in January, has spoken out about a lack of clarity.</p> <p>\u201cMy big issue with this is that everything I\u2019m reading in the papers and on Twitter and the internet is the first I\u2019ve ever heard of anything,\u201d she told the Wisden Podcast. \u201cFrom my point of view, losing my England contract and then being told: \u2018You can still be a professional cricketer from April, and then there\u2019s the Hundred, you\u2019ll earn a decent wage\u2019 \u2013 now it\u2019s 7 May and I haven\u2019t heard a single thing. I\u2019m jobless, I\u2019ve got no income, no car, I\u2019ve got a mortgage. It\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m going to have to get a job.\u201d</p> <p>She is not alone. As one up-and-coming young county player put it: \u201cThe thought of no cricket this year is actually quite upsetting as I want to keep pushing myself to get in as far as I can. This year for women\u2019s domestic cricket was so important as it all changes next season with the regional teams. Doing well this year would help me get a professional contract, which is my ultimate aim. I do understand the prioritising of men\u2019s cricket but the women\u2019s game is on the rise so it\u2019s gutting that it would be set aside.\u201d</p> <p>However, for all the undoubtedly awful personal stories of disappointment and financial strain, and intense frustration of a nascent game held back, is it OK to be thankful in a broad-brush way that, for the sake of women\u2019s cricket, this crisis did not happen five years ago? That the \u00a3380m coronavirus black hole the ECB is looking at may mean the men\u2019s game temporarily takes priority but it categorically will not mean the women\u2019s game disappears.</p> <p>For all their past brush-offs, the paring back of the county system and the delays to the setting up of the centres of excellence, the ECB has made a public commitment to the women\u2019s game, even during the crisis. \u201cNothing about Covid-19 dilutes our vision for the game in this country and that is for a gender-balanced game,\u201d Harrison said this month. \u201cThere is no question about our ongoing ambition for women\u2019s cricket; we will do what is in our power to protect it.\u201d</p> <p>So thank you to the 2017 World Cup and that game-changing final at Lord\u2019s, thank you to the Women\u2019s Big Bash, to the Kia Super League (God rest its soul), to Ellyse Perry and her many wondrous talents, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpa40s_Q44M\" title=\"\">Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s 171 not out</a>, to Sarah Taylor\u2019s swift hands, to the 85,000 people who turned up to the MCG for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/08/australia-claim-fifth-womens-world-t2o-title-with-crushing-win-over-india\" title=\"\">the women\u2019s T20 World Cup final</a> just a few weeks before lockdown began.</p> <p>Though it is no consolation for those whose contracts have now disappeared, women\u2019s cricket is now too big to fail. It has too much potential for growth, too many interested parties, too many sponsors (Toyota, McDonald\u2019s, Bunnings, Harvey Norman and Adidas for the T20 World Cup), too many influential voices, and is too important for potential funding streams, too politically sensitive.</p> <p>Its green shoots are tougher than they look, it will find a way to spring back when the soil is a little warmer, the season more welcoming.

If we employ a few biodiversity-boosting tricks, we can keep the nature party in our backyards going for good.</p> <h2><strong>Feed the birds, not the squirrels</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57be160e742dde7e6491b67333eb9e21e8031e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57be160e742dde7e6491b67333eb9e21e8031e95/0_0_3085_2057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldfinches at a bird feeder full of niger seeds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldfinches love niger seeds, which squirrels will avoid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Muckley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British Trust for Ornithology says that Britons spend between \u00a3200m and \u00a3300m a year on bird-feeding products. \u201cHalf of households at some point feed birds in their garden,\u201d says Fellowes. It\u2019s one of the key ways we can commune with nature, and during cold winters it can help birds survive.\u201d But during the breeding season, roughly March to June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/10/daylight-robbery-grey-squirrels-stealing-millions-of-pounds-of-bird-seed-a-year\">putting food out can attract nest predators</a>, too. \u201cSquirrels and magpies are the two most common,\u201d says Fellowes. In one of his studies, more than 44% of feeders were visited by squirrels.</p> <p>As such, investing in a pest-proof feeder is important. Fellowes recommends those that close if a squirrel, or anything heavier than a small bird, lands on them. <strong> </strong>This does not mean bird tables should be banned, but Fellowes recommends \u201cputting small volumes out regularly, clearing it up and putting out food the squirrels don\u2019t like\u201d. Goldfinches love niger seed, for example, which squirrels eschew.</p> <h2><strong>Keep feeders clean</strong></h2> <p>\u201cDisease can spread through feeders every now and again,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/19/greenfinch-england-disease\">Our greenfinch population was badly affected by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/19/greenfinch-england-disease\">trichomonosis</a> that was probably spread via bird feeders. It\u2019s not definite, but all the circumstantial evidence points in that direction.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Install nest boxes and bricks</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32a2cbcd01545289651bdcf7f24ae827beacd475\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32a2cbcd01545289651bdcf7f24ae827beacd475/0_0_4576_3432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A blue tit takes flight from a bird box in Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A blue tit takes flight from a bird box in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos G Lopez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When people get nest boxes, says Fellowes, \u201cthey get very keen and they can put cameras in the boxes. It\u2019s fantastic: nature on your doorstep that you can really connect with.\u201d</p> <p>Birds such as blue tits and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/08/joking-apart-great-tit-born-survivor-country-diary\">great tits</a> would naturally nest in nooks and crannies in woodland trees, so boxes are important in cities, especially if you live in a modern development. Fellowes recommends WoodStone, brick or woodcrete boxes. Not only will they last longer, he says, but also, \u201cif you have wooden nest boxes, woodpeckers can raid them and predate the chicks\u201d. Of course, this would happen in the wild, too, but it is a bit of a buzzkill if you are enjoying the chicks.</p> <p>Fellowes suggests trying boxes for a variety of birds: \u201cYou can get nice ones for robins, nuthatches and sparrows, which haven\u2019t been doing brilliantly \u2013 a lot of that seems to be around losing nesting sites.\u201d You can buy swift boxes, too, and even bricks made specifically for swifts or bats, if they are in your area (they tend to be near water in urban zones). Nest boxes need to be cleaned out at the end of the year. \u201cAs fantastic as it is to watch leopards in South Africa or cheetahs in the Serengeti, that\u2019s not our nature,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cThe nature on your doorstep is just as interesting and worthy of attention.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Resist insecticides</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4a89c5804bbd982039d37bcb47c8bac01390c46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4a89c5804bbd982039d37bcb47c8bac01390c46/0_0_3855_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ladybird pupae\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allowing the natural insect population to grow will attract ladybirds, which will then eat aphids.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andi Edwards/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Birds can\u2019t feed their chicks the seed you put out. Chicks need bugs, so it is not a good idea to kill them. \u201cUrban birds tend to have fewer offspring than ones in the countryside,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cThat\u2019s probably to do with the amount of insects that are available to feed on in the breeding season.\u201d</p> <p>Unless you are competing in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chelseaflowershow\">Chelsea </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chelseaflowershow\">flower show</a>, he says, \u201cyour garden can deal with a few aphids. And if you allow natural insect populations to grow, you will attract ladybirds, which eat aphids and have crashed in numbers.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Plant for </strong>invertebrates</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d81c20d62b795ca387287a86af05cf98ca91478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d81c20d62b795ca387287a86af05cf98ca91478/0_171_3666_4263/860.jpg\" alt=\"Hollyhocks\" width=\"860\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flowering plants such as hollyhocks are essential for bees, hoverflies, moths and butterflies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ewa Ahlin/Getty Images/Johner RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We, and the cute animals we love, cannot survive without insects. And invertebrates, from bumblebees to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/butterflies\">butterflies</a>, can be awesome in themselves. \u201cThey will do much better if you have a range of plants,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cIdeally, a good mix of native species, because our insects are more likely to feed on those.\u201d Plants with flowers that need to be pollinated are essential for bees, hoverflies, moths and butterflies; try to ensure that something is flowering in each season. <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/science/conservation-biodiversity/wildlife/plants-for-pollinators\">The RHS\u2019s website offers guidance</a>. \u201cThe traditional English cottage garden is an absolute haven for insects,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with things like foxgloves and hollyhocks.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Plant caterpillar food, too</strong></h2> <p>You can\u2019t have butterflies and moths without caterpillars. \u201cAs we have simplified and tidied our gardens, we have provided fewer plants that the caterpillars can do well on,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cSome of the most beautiful species feed on nettles and brambles, and most people won\u2019t want those in their gardens. At this time of year, holly blues are laying their eggs on holly.\u201d They feed on ivy, too. So let a little corner of your space stay wild.</p> <h2><strong>Dig a pond</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16ba4febc41de57ddfbfc06a7aa3b3ebc377bb46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16ba4febc41de57ddfbfc06a7aa3b3ebc377bb46/0_0_5152_3438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two small children filling up a pond with a hose\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creating a pond is the best thing you can do for garden biodiversity \u2013 and you can make a mini version from a bucket or an old sink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 10,000 Hours/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fellowes suspects that, if you have room, this is the biggest thing you can do for insects \u2013 \u201cand all biodiversity in your garden. Ponds across the UK have been disappearing at a massive rate.\u201d They are vital for swallows and swifts, as well as amphibians such as frogs, toads and newts and insects including dragonflies, damselflies and water boatmen. Size is not important. Mini ponds can be made in a bucket, an old sink or something similar. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds\u2019 website <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/give-nature-a-home-in-your-garden/garden-activities/createaminipond/\">explains how to make one</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Plant a tapestry lawn</strong></h2> <p>Lionel Smith, a colleague (and former PhD student) of Fellowes, has spent years developing a nature-lover\u2019s alternative to a lawn. \u201cLawns are really not very ecologically friendly,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cNot much lives in them and, if you fertilise, mow and water them, they\u2019re a net CO<sub>2</sub> contributor, rather than a typical plant that helps absorb CO<sub>2</sub>.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/tapestry-lawns/lionel-smith/9780367144036\">the tapestry lawn</a> \u2013 was to plant squares of different hardy, perennial flowering plants. \u201cThey knit together and you end up with this wonderful lawn that you can walk on, lie on and enjoy,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cIt is full of flowers and is absolutely fantastic for insects \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t grow more than about six inches high.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Embrace weeds</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61c1abcb580aa41fc308ebfe630294112d8a6936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61c1abcb580aa41fc308ebfe630294112d8a6936/0_0_4288_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vibrant cottage garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You don\u2019t have to let your garden become a jungle, but it is beneficial to grow plants close together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacky Parker Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Covering up the spaces between neatly arranged ornamental plants with bark chippings is not great for biodiversity, says Fellowes. If you want to control what plants grow in your beds, it is healthier to grow your chosen plants more densely together \u2013 another reason the cottage garden explodes with nature. Perhaps you won\u2019t balk when a dandelion pops up when you know that pollinating insects love them.</p> <p>\u201cI would never suggest anybody must follow my unkempt way of gardening,\u201d says Fellowes. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a neat freak, think about how you can get your aesthetics while using species that will also benefit wildlife. Anything positive you do will have an effect. You don\u2019t have to let your garden turn into a jungle.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t poison slugs</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI absolutely wouldn\u2019t use pellets or the powders that you can put out to kill slugs, simply because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/09/if-we-love-hedgehogs-why-let-them-vanish\">hedgehogs can eat them</a> and be poisoned,\u201d says Fellowes. The old beer-trap method is a more responsible way to kill slugs. There are endangered species of slugs, says Fellowes, \u201cbut you won\u2019t be getting those in your garden\u201d.</p> <p>Slugs are excellent food for hedgehogs, amphibians, beetles and birds, so you may consider them worth having in that respect. There are humane traps, too, so you could relocate your slimy garden chompers to somewhere they will be more welcome.</p> <h2><strong>Get your </strong><strong>cat a bell</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26e2b86499e1ca97430bba90a9798676f1101cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26e2b86499e1ca97430bba90a9798676f1101cd4/0_0_3200_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A black cat hunting in a garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Try to keep cats indoors at dawn and dusk \u2013 and get them a collar with a bell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Upton/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fellowes is always doing research on cats. A few years back, Fellowes\u2019 team calculated that domestic cats in the UK were killing about <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049369\">185m </a><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049369\">prey items a year</a>. \u201cAbout a million birds a week,\u201d he says. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says that <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.2454#d3e516\">domestic cats </a><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.2454#d3e516\">rank third globally </a><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.2454#d3e516\">among alien species threatening </a><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.2454#d3e516\">vertebrates</a>. </p> <p>It is hard to know whether they are currently contributing to species decline in the UK; they may have done their worst long ago. Either way, they are certainly killing a lot of animals and not even eating them. (If you think your cat is an exception, be aware that studies have found that cats bring home only about 20% to 30% of their prey.)</p> <p>Keeping cats indoors as much as possible is recommended, especially at peak hunting times (dawn and dusk) and if you live near a nature reserve. Also, putting warning bells on collars, says Fellowes, \u201ccertainly reduces predation rates\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Leave piles of pruning</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f7fc4a0bf8d0b2234e12f95f8a193150b68b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f7fc4a0bf8d0b2234e12f95f8a193150b68b79/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden compost heap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A compost heap can double as a home for small mammals, amphibians and invertebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mtreasure/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dump them on a compost heap, or just leave them in piles to rot down, and make a home for small mammals, amphibians and invertebrates such as centipedes \u2013 \u201cjust like in natural woodland\u201d, says Fellowes. They could take months to break down, so you have to think carefully about where to leave them.</p> <p>Similarly, leaving a little pile of chopped wood will attract stag beetles and solitary bees. Alternatively, you can buy homes for the bees from garden centres. \u201cThey\u2019re at their peak at this time of year,\u201d says Fellowes. The homes \u201cattract leaf-cutter bees, which are really cool to watch\u201d. Slow worms love compost heaps, too, and one of Fellowes\u2019 few sightings of a grass snake was in his own suburban compost heap.</p> <p>The thing to avoid in all of this, says Fellowes, is becoming judgmental. Decking, for instance, may not be the best thing for nature, but if you need it for practical reasons you can still invite nature in with bird boxes and thoughtful planting. \u201cThese are things that we can all do,\u201d he says.</p> <p><em>30-Second Zoology </em><em>by Mark Fellowes is published by Ivy Press</em>. <em>To order a copy for \u00a313.04 (RRP \u00a314.99), go to</em> <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/30-second-zoology-9781782408536.html\">guardianbookshop.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

More particularly, it <a href=\"https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/trump-v-vance/\">raises the question</a> of whether the president can refuse to comply with Vance\u2019s subpoena in order to shield those records.</p> <p>The other two <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-mazars/\">involve</a> the question of whether a congressional committee has the legal power to subpoena Trump\u2019s accountant and some of his lenders.</p> <p>President Trump\u2019s term in office has been marked by repeated <a href=\"https://forensicnews.net/2019/10/28/stonewalled-the-numbers-behind-the-trump-administrations-refusal-to-cooperate/\">refusals</a> to comply with subpoenas, whether from law enforcement officials or from congressional oversight committees.

That he will be joined in this argument by Noel J Francisco, solicitor general of the United States, is further indication of the complicity of the attorney general, William Barr, in this effort to create an environment in which this president can behave with impunity.</p> <p>In their view, article II and the supremacy clause, mean not only that the president cannot be indicted or put on trial for committing a crime, but also that he cannot be subject to any criminal investigation during his term in office.</p> <p>In the other two cases, the president\u2019s lawyers will <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/is-trump-above-the-law-supreme-court-case\">contend</a> that the constitution limits Congress\u2019s authority to investigate the president.</p> <p>And, as if these theories of presidential immunity were not extreme enough, Trump\u2019s lawyers will try to persuade the court that the constitution immunizes not only the president himself but also the businesses that he owned before becoming president as well as people they hire to handle their financial affairs.</p> <p>The president\u2019s lawyers <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/10/23/second_circuit_court_of_appeals_trump_v_vance_oral_argument.html?spot_im_comment_id=sp_v0xu5oCZ_531871_c_MOcgFb&amp;spotim_referrer=newsfeed\">made</a> these same claims before the federal district court for the southern district of New York and second circuit court of appeals, neither of which were <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/19-3204/19-3204-2019-11-04.html\">persuaded</a> of the wisdom and legality of these positions.

Thus he memorably <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-roberts-said-there-are-no-trump-judges-or-obama-judges-clarence-thomas-didnt-get-the-memo/2019/06/28/00ec5db0-99c6-11e9-8d0a-5edd7e2025b1_story.html\">spoke out</a> when President Trump impugned the integrity of a ninth circuit court of appeals judge calling him an \u201cObama judge\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts responded by insisting that \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges \u2026 [only] dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d</p> <p>The outcome of the cases argued on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.dailyrepublic.com/all-dr-news/opinion/state-national-columnists/commentary-trump-tax-return-case-hinges-on-justice-roberts/\">hinges</a> on the chief justice\u2019s willingness to make good on those words when the stakes for the future of America\u2019s constitutional design are high. It will also depend on his skill in marshaling the court to join him.</p> <p>The stakes in the cases are heightened by the failed effort to impeach the president and remove him from office. Having survived that effort to hold him accountable for obstruction of Congress and abuse of power, Trump is all the more emboldened in 2020. If he were to prevail in the current cases, little would be left of America\u2019s vaunted system of checks and balances. The country would inch closer to the fulfillment of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/lazy-authoritarian/609937/\">authoritarian designs</a>.</p> <p>The president <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/lazy-authoritarian/609937/\">has worked hard</a> to appoint to the supreme court justices and to other federal courts Trump-friendly judges, believing that they would provide legal cover for his often corrupt arrogation and abuse of power. Tuesday will provide an important glimpse into the justices\u2019 thinking and a chance to see whether they will muster the wisdom, courage and commitment to prove him wrong, and to defend the rule of law.</p>",

Toss it into a wide, shallow, nonstick pan. Open the anchovies carefully and pour their oil into the pan over the onions, then put the anchovies to one side. Set the pan over medium heat and gently cook the onions for seven to eight minutes, stirring intermittently to disturb them, so they cook evenly and do not stick.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cut the mushrooms into roughly 3mm-thick slices. Add these to the pan and stir. Tip in the anchovies and break them up roughly with a wooden spoon, then stir in the herbs. Add the butter or oil, and cook for a further 10 minutes, turning the heat down to low when the mushrooms start to soften.</p> <p>Finish with the vinegar, stirring it through. Season to taste with black pepper \u2013 it will be salty enough with the residual anchovy \u2013 and serve over your carb of choice: mashed potato and pasta both work well.</p> <p>This is one of those dishes that is even better the next day, so if you have any left over, leave it to cool, then chill in the fridge; warm back through thoroughly to serve.

Add the fish and vegetables to the cheese sauce and fold through gently.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Grate the bread into crumbs (or pulse in a small blender). Spoon the fish, veg and sauce into a small ovenproof tin \u2013 a 450g loaf tin or 20cm cake tin is perfect. Top with the breadcrumbs and sprinkle lemon juice on top. Finish with a very generous scattering of black pepper.

Alden Global Capital, a New York-based hedge fund infamous for purchasing, then gutting, newspapers across the US, owns a 32% stake in Tribune Publishing.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sun is one of the most important civic institutions that really belongs to everyone in Baltimore,\u201d said Matthew Gallagher, president and chief of the Goldseker Foundation, one of the leaders of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.saveourbaltimoresun.com/\">Save our Sun</a>\u201d effort which hopes to buy the newspaper.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible platform for keeping the public informed, for sharing news and information, for provoking civic discussion. And we think that if it was controlled and in local hands that were really focused on its long term viability and vitality, that it would be very important to the city\u2019s future.\u201d</p> <p>The Goldseker Foundation, along with the Abell Foundation, represent $400m in endowed assets, Gallagher said. Gallagher would not comment on the state of negotiations with Tribune, but said the groups had been in contact with the Sun\u2019s owners.</p> <p>The Sun won its most recent Pulitzer in spite of long-running efforts by its owners to reduce the size of the newsroom. In 2009 the Sun<a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2009-04-30-0904290118-story.html\"> lost a third</a> of its newsroom staff, and continued downsizing through to November 2018, when the newspaper<a href=\"https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/the-sun-newsroom-receives-buyout-offers-from-tribune-publishing/\"> offered buyouts</a> to journalists.</p> <p>The groups backing the Save our Sun campaign, which include the Washington-Baltimore News Guild and the NewsGuild-CWA, believe time is of the essence.</p> <p>Alden Global Capital, which oversaw the reduction of staff at the Denver Post by 70% over a seven-year period, purchased its 32% of Tribune Publishing last year, and is expected to increase its stake this year.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible sense of urgency,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cThere\u2019s some significant milestones coming up.\u201d</p> <p>Alden has the option to increase its stake in Tribune Publishing at the end of June, while media experts have warned that the coronavirus could be catastrophic for the news industry.</p> <p>In April, Penny Abernathy, the Knight chair in journalism and digital media economics at the University of North Carolina, told the Guardian \u201chundreds\u201d of news organizations<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-newspapers-impact\"> are likely to close</a>, as advertising money dries up. Since then scores of newspapers have announced layoffs, and several have printed their last editions.</p> <p>Even before the virus outbreak, journalism was in a perilous state.</p> <p>About 1,800 newspapers closed between 2004 and 2018, as the number of people buying print editions dropped.</p> <p>As the journalism industry attempted to adapt to a world where people get their news online, Google and Facebook gobbled up the digital advertising that was barely keeping news organizations afloat.</p> <p>If Save Our Sun is successful in prizing the Baltimore newspaper from Tribune, its buyers intend to switch the Sun to a non-profit organization.

The coach will use words like \u201cheart,\u201d \u201chonor,\u201d and \u201cteamwork\u201d. Everything that happens on the court or field after that is a bit of a letdown because victory \u2013 whether on the scoreboard or of the spirit \u2013 seems inevitable after the speech. To movie audiences, these moments may seem corny, but in real life, when someone you admire and respect speaks, their words can have a great impact. I certainly listened when coaches I respected, <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2018/05/25/kareem-abdul-jabbar-coach-wooden-book\">such as John Wooden</a>, spoke at crucial points during my career. Inspiring people to be their best is what great coaches \u2013 and great politicians \u2013 do. It\u2019s one of the qualities that makes them great.</p> <p>For the past few months, this country has faced a formidable opponent in Covid-19. It\u2019s been kicking our butts across every state and the statistics are only getting worse. America has a deep bench of expertise and we know how to come together as a team when we need to. Yet, faced with uncomfortable truths and frightening inconsistencies in leadership, we\u2019ve started to unravel here and there. Rather than pull together in a crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">we\u2019re fighting each other</a>. And that\u2019s leading to even more deaths.</p> <p>One thing we could use right now is a passionate rallying speech from our president that inspires us all to do the right thing, not just for ourselves, but for our country. It is the speech Trump should deliver, not because he wants to be reelected, but because it would address the country\u2019s major concerns, end the political squabbling, provide a reasonable plan going forward, and give Americans confidence that their government is working to protect their health and economic concerns. It needs to be the speech of a statesman not a, well, Trump. If I were Trump\u2019s speechwriter, using the lessons I learned from great talks I heard in my basketball career, this is what I would give him to deliver:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/15/the-way-americans-regard-sports-heroes-versus-intellectuals-speaks-volumes\">The way Americans regard sports heroes versus intellectuals speaks volumes | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAmerica has faced many enemies before, both foreign and domestic. The goal of those enemies has always been to destroy not just America itself, but the ideal America stands for, which is equal treatment and opportunity for all who live here, regardless of wealth, ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. Covid-19 is an enemy that doesn\u2019t care about politics or social justice \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunistic organism that just wants to feed and spread. It doesn\u2019t want to destroy America. But if we\u2019re not careful, it might achieve that anyway.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are defined by how they act, not during the good times when kindness and compassion are easy, but during the tough times, when helping a neighbor could cost us. A crisis reveals whether we are heroes or villains. Ernest Hemingway said, \u2018Courage is grace under pressure,\u2019 and I believe that Americans are ready to demonstrate their courage through grace.</p> <p>\u201cThat has to start with those of us in government who are entrusted with the task of fighting this enemy. The only way we can justify the people\u2019s trust is by being completely transparent in our mistakes, successes, and plans for the future.</p> <p>\u201cWe have made mistakes. My administration did not act quickly enough in recognizing the serious threat that Covid-19 posed. We should have, but we didn\u2019t. No excuse is offered because no excuse is acceptable. That delay led to a domino effect of playing catch-up in developing enough testing and in getting necessary medical supplies to health care facilities. But we have learned from our mistakes and those of other countries as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus has worsened already unacceptable racial and economic disparity in this country. The death rate among the black and Latinx communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">is significantly higher than among white communities</a>. I will do everything in my power to change that. The virus is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/us-election-coronavirus-voting-trump-biden\">attacking our democratic process</a>, threatening to keep people of color and those economically challenged from being able to cast their votes in November. I will do everything in my power to ensure every eligible voter\u2019s voice will be counted.</p> <p>\u201cAs for those out there who use our national crisis as an excuse to marginalize others or do harm to others because of their race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, not only do I not support you, I will do everything in my power to see you are prosecuted. Because the whole point of the president\u2019s power is to use it to protect those who need it most. And if that offends you, then don\u2019t vote for me.</p> <p>\u201cAs of right now, my administration is fully committed to one mission: keeping our people physically healthy while also protecting the country\u2019s economic health. Balancing those two crucial, yet sometimes competing goals is the greatest challenge this country has faced in decades. No one has definitive answers because this situation is unique. However, it is our pledge to never put lives at risk just for the sake of unnecessary economic policies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/texas-reopen-economy-coronavirus-covid-19\">Any decision regarding opening businesses</a> or reducing shelter-in-place will be data-driven, based only on the information gathered by the country\u2019s leading scientific and medical experts, not partisan appointments.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/could-covid-19-be-manmade-what-we-know-about-origins-trump-chinese-lab-coronavirus\">No one knows definitively how the virus originated</a>. But investigating the source is crucial to further understanding how it works and spreads and may help us to battle other viruses in the future. Countries need to work together to gather this information, not to place blame or levy accusations or seek reparations, but rather to help humanity survive. Toward that end, I pledge no actions will be sought against any country involved.</p> <p>\u201cTo ensure that my focus remains on this task, I will not participate in any campaigning for the 2020 presidency. I will continue to run for the office, but I will let my actions alone be my campaign. How I conduct myself as your leader over these next few months is my campaign.</p> <p>\u201cI will make no campaign speeches, I will not <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/donald-trump-s-attacks-joe-biden-risk-blowing-back-him-n1203316\">talk disparagingly of my opponent</a> or his surrogates. There will be no activity regarding the border wall or other divisive issues. We all need to work together to overcome this threat in the here and now, without one eye perpetually on November. <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/abraham-lincoln-house-divided-speech\">President Lincoln said</a>, \u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand.\u201d That is even more appropriate now, 162 years later, as we face an increasing death toll and a declining economy. America is fighting for its survival \u2013 not just as a country, but as an ideal. And nothing is more important than proving to ourselves and the rest of the world that our shared ideals are powerful enough to overcome any enemy, seen or unseen.\u201d</p> <p>That is the speech of a president determined to lead us during our darkest days and uncertain future. It requires abandoning all notions of ratings and personal aggrandizement to just focus on the welfare of the people in their moment of deepest need. It requires someone who loves the country more than their career. It requires greatness.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>There are no silver bullets, clever models or easy answers for how to control the coronavirus. But neither is it rocket science. Governments have three choices in how they respond. The first and most difficult path is to contain the virus through a programme of mass testing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-app-could-be-ditched-for-different-model-after-trials\">contact tracing</a> and isolating. This requires a huge effort: building a large infrastructure to monitor cases of the virus and identify hotspots, ensuring this system runs efficiently, providing adequate PPE to everyone who needs it, and deploying border controls to vet who is entering the country.</p> <p>The second path is far simpler. It involves slowing the spread of the virus by using timed cycles of lockdown and release, with the government issuing guidance on how much social distancing is required. But the side effects of this path are very costly: it risks wrecking the economy, straining health and social care systems, and creating social unrest. The third and easiest path available to governments is simply to do nothing. The virus sweeps across the population, the economy remains open and whoever makes it through is lucky to still be alive.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost impossible to decipher which path the UK government has chosen. Over the past months, its response has vacillated from the third approach to the second and, more recently, to the first. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-coronavirus-roadmap-sow-confusion\">Boris Johnson\u2019s address on 10 May</a> made clear he has recognised the dire position in which the UK finds itself, the government\u2019s confusing new advice \u2013 that people should \u201cstay alert\u201d to the virus, work from home when possible, but go to work if working from home isn\u2019t possible \u2013 exemplified the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/dominic-raab-adds-confusion-over-changes-uk-lockdown-rules\">mixed messages</a> coming from the government.</p> <p>The confusion turns on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/johnson-address-shows-he-has-been-swayed-by-hawks-in-his-cabinet\">internal struggle</a> between two opposing camps. The first seems to think the government should attempt to get over the worst of the pandemic by allowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-goes-it-alone-over-coronavirus-we-can-only-hope-the-gamble-pays-off\">the virus to spread through</a> the population, albeit at a slower pace to ease the strain on the NHS, and by creating more hospital and mortuary capacity to cope with a spike in deaths. The second camp wants to drive down the number of coronavirus cases and reduce the rate of infection \u2013 or R \u2013 to as close to zero as possible. It recognises the uniquely dangerous nature of this virus, and the emerging evidence that it can cause <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21251899/coronavirus-long-term-effects-symptoms\">long-term health complications in survivors</a> and that immunity may only be temporary.</p> <p>These are clearly two different goals, with two different strategies behind them. The confused messaging from the government is a worrying illustration of the lack of consensus on which of these objectives and strategies should be adopted, both within Westminster and <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/\">across the four nations</a>.</p> <p>But this debate misses a more fundamental point: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">containment (the first path) is the best strategy</a> for public health, the economy and society. The decision in early March to shift from containing to mitigating the virus was disastrous on all three of these fronts. By the time the government introduced a lockdown, the number of coronavirus cases had already increased exponentially, making prolonged quarantine necessary.</p> <p>Now, the key challenge facing the government is to replace this lockdown with a package of public health interventions involving mass testing, surveillance and real-time data to identify clusters of the virus and quarantine those who are infected. This will mean providing adequate PPE to those who need it, enforcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/two-week-coronavirus-quarantine-to-be-announced-for-uk-arrivals\">border controls</a> and instigating a phased relaxation of social-distancing measures. Rather than putting everyone under lockdown, these measures would give health authorities information about the spread of the virus, allowing them to identify hotspots and target interventions where they\u2019re needed.</p> <p>Without these measures in place, the past seven weeks of lockdown will have been completely pointless. As quarantine measures are lifted, the virus will continue to spread, the number of daily cases will rise and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/doctors-warn-of-second-coronavirus-wave-as-uk-lockdown-weakens\">second peak</a> will become inevitable. Everyone agrees that we need to get out of the lockdown as soon as possible, but doing so will require massive investment in public health infrastructure. Countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia have already built this capacity, allowing them to ease measures while retaining control over the virus and identifying who has it, who has had it and who could be exposed to it.</p> <p>The social costs of lockdown are severe. Seven weeks in, we\u2019ve witnessed the increased use of food banks, delayed care for those needing NHS services, the closure of schools, rising cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">domestic abuse</a> and bankruptcy among small-business owners. So why has the government made such little progress in building the public health infrastructure necessary to control the virus and ease the lockdown? You could be forgiven for thinking that the lockdown was simply a way to reassure the public that the government was \u201cdoing something\u201d. We need to be asking: what measures has the government put in place to ensure we\u2019re in a better position to release the lockdown and prevent a second wave?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-coronavirus-roadmap-sow-confusion\">Boris Johnson's coronavirus 'roadmap' will only sow confusion | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone wants to know when the lockdown will end and life will go back to \u201cnormal\u201d. The better question to ask is how we ease lockdown measures in the coming months and years while preventing a second wave of infections and keeping R well below one.<strong> </strong>There are a number of endings to this story. First, an accessible and affordable vaccine could become available within the next 18 months; second, the government could embark on a resource-intensive and gruelling campaign to eliminate the virus, particularly if emerging data proves coronavirus is as dangerous as diseases such as smallpox and polio; or third, antiviral therapies could become available to treat Covid-19 that make it a mild illness, so the population would gradually and safely build up natural herd immunity. </p> <p>But on our current path we seem destined for a disastrous ending. Lifting lockdown without the public health infrastructure in place to contain the virus will allow Covid-19 to spread through the population unchecked. The result could be a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable, and an individual gamble for those exposed to the virus. This should be avoided at all costs.</p> <p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",
  "<p>After Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">\u201cvague\u201d and \u201cconfusing\u201d</a> address to the nation on Sunday evening, stressing that \u201canyone who can\u2019t work from home\u201d should be \u201cactively encouraged to go to work\u201d, the nation appeared divided between those who felt it would make little difference and those who felt Johnson was sending blue-collar workers to their deaths. The truth is somewhere in-between.</p> <p>Blue-collar workers \u2013 and low-paid white-collar workers \u2013 were already in a bad position. And Johnson\u2019s speech, as well as the shambolic interviews and unaccountable briefings that have accompanied it in lieu of timely detail, have made it worse.</p> <p>Men in low-paid occupations like elementary construction workers, on assembly lines, and working as security guards, cleaners and bus drivers, are dying at far higher rates than their managers and professional men, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020\">new figures from the Office </a><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020\">for National Statistics</a> revealed on Monday \u2013 though exactly how much this is due to occupational exposure cannot be fully explained at this stage, the ONS cautioned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/top-experts-not-asked-approve-stay-alert-coronavirus-message-whitty-vallance\">Top experts not asked to approve 'stay alert' coronavirus message</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the figures are, perhaps, grimly unsurprising. Even before the lockdown started to fray, only <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/dont-buy-the-lockdown-lie-this-is-a-government-of-business-as-usual/\">half of workers were working from home</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/30april2020\">one in </a><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/30april2020\">four were still travelling to work</a>. The rules for the first phase of lockdown were communicated as poorly as the new ones. There was a widespread impression, given by some vague and rather unscrutinised talk by government ministers, that only \u201ckey workers\u201d were allowed, or required, to go to work. And that every part of the economy, bar the \u201cessential\u201d parts of it, had been \u201cclosed down\u201d. But neither of these things were true.</p> <p>There was no law laying out a different set of rights and requirements for key workers, and the only definition was in a hastily produced, non-statutory list aimed at parents, which was so broad it included 10 million workers. And \u2013 as a government spokesperson confirmed to me \u2013 there was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/revealed-thousands-at-risk-from-covid-19-in-dangerous-call-centres/\">no guidance that implies only</a><a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/revealed-thousands-at-risk-from-covid-19-in-dangerous-call-centres/\"> essential work </a><a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/revealed-thousands-at-risk-from-covid-19-in-dangerous-call-centres/\">can continue</a>\u201d. Indeed, the guidance said it was important for business to carry on, only shops and leisure facilities were closed. All other businesses, from offices to construction sites to factories, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/dont-buy-the-lockdown-lie-this-is-a-government-of-business-as-usual/\">were allowed to continue to operate</a>, and \u2013 with decisions about furloughing also left entirely at employers\u2019 discretion \u2013 many did.</p> <p>Now the government messaging is catching up with the current legal reality. And those of us lucky enough to still be able to work from home are now realising how ugly that looks.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/revealed-thousands-at-risk-from-covid-19-in-dangerous-call-centres/\">call centre workers reported on by openDemocracy</a>, travelling by public transport to workplaces with crowding, air conditioning and even hot-desking, carrying out entirely non-essential work such as telesales and debt-chasing, or filling in spreadsheets because the bosses \u201cdidn\u2019t want to pay them for doing nothing\u201d.</p> <p>One worker, who sold investment products, said he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to die for \u00a39.30 an hour\u201d. The majority of them felt terrified and furious they were being made to go in even though they could in theory do their job from home. There had already been outbreaks of symptoms among call-centre staff \u2013 and, tragically, deaths \u2013 according to the union representing them.</p> <p>Some said they had even had to move out of home, so worried were they of catching the virus and passing it on to vulnerable members of their household. Others were in a vulnerable group themselves \u2013 but had no new protections or rights to stay home. There are no new statutory rights to enforce distancing and PPE at work in England \u2013 though there are in Wales and Scotland.</p> <p>And it\u2019s now clear that that these gaps in the protection for workers continue into stage two of the Covid-19 response, and will affect ever more workers. The revised guidance for employers, released on Monday night, is just that \u2013 guidance rather than legally binding requirements, even as penalties on individual citizens who break the rules in their daily lives are increased. The guidance is also littered with references to enforcing social distancing \u201cwherever possible\u201d, and to \u201cminimise\u201d, \u201cmitigate\u201d and \u201creduce\u201d rather than \u201celiminate\u201d risks \u2013 though it does advise employers to work with unions, and has been greeted as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d by the TUC. But, shockingly, the guidance contains no clear legal duty to permit vulnerable workers and those with vulnerable household members to stay home or even stay distanced at work, merely exhortations to \u201cconsider\u201d, \u201cassess\u201d and \u201cpay particular attention to\u201d such workers\u2019 needs. Much, including publication of risk assessments by larger employers, is \u201cexpected\u201d, but not mandated.</p> <p>It\u2019s also clear from Monday\u2019s cabinet office paper, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884171/FINAL_6.6637_CO_HMG_C19_Recovery_FINAL_110520_v2_WEB__1_.pdf\">Our Plan to Rebuild</a>, that the government will start to \u201cwind down economic support schemes while people are eased back to work\u201d, ramping up the financial and moral pressure on workers to resume their jobs.</p> <p>The lack of new enforceable rights workers with childcare needs, those who rely on public transport, those who have vulnerable household members and don\u2019t happen to have a spare room to isolate in, all give an impression of a government run by men with no idea what home life is like for the majority of people.</p> <p>Or work life, for that matter. The idea that we \u201cchoose\u201d whether we go back to work, and that (as Johnson suggested in parliament on Monday) everything can be sorted out by a friendly conversation with one\u2019s employer, ignores the reality of precarious work for many people, who feel invisible to the public and disposable to their bosses. For whom furlough may have already been granted and then snatched away \u2013 or refused all along.</p> <p>Some people may have a union to give them confidence to enforce their rights under existing legislation, including Section 44 of the Health and Safety at Work Act (which may give the right to leave if an employee reasonably believes they or their family are in imminent danger) or equalities legislation (which may protect employees whose bosses are being totally unsympathetic about childcare issues). But after another decade of tough anti-union legislation, fragmented workplaces and casual employment relations, many will not know about, or have access to, the sufficient support.</p> <p>A government spokesperson told me there would be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/dont-buy-the-lockdown-lie-this-is-a-government-of-business-as-usual/\">a number of legal cases</a>\u201d after this is over, about whether bosses were right to make people go into work or not.

One is that Covid-19 was passed to humans via the eating of bats (or pangolins infected by bats, as has also been suggested).

This is one of the factors that have led others to suggest that the virus came from one of two Wuhan laboratories studying coronavirus in bats, either in a man-made form or via a lapse in the biosecurity of animal specimens. Donald Trump and members of his administration have pushed this theory, though the scientific community has near-unanimously rejected the idea it could have been manmade. It is not even clear if Wuhan is the area where the virus originally transferred from animals to humans, and there is still no scientific consensus on the source of the outbreak.</p> <p>Very few, if any, high-profile people have publicly conflated all of these debated areas, though other music stars have attacked the Chinese over wet markets.</p> <p>Paul McCartney, a longtime vegetarian and animal rights activist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/14/paul-mccartney-calls-for-medieval-chinese-markets-to-be-banned-over-coronavirus\">said in April</a>: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, it is a little bit medieval eating bats \u2026 They will not close down these wet markets, that got us into this trouble in the first place \u2026 It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if this is the only thing it seems like you can blame on those wet markets. It seems like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/new-virus-china-covid-19-food-markets\">Sars</a>, avian flu, all sorts of other stuff that has afflicted us \u2026 and what\u2019s it for? For these quite medieval practices. They need to clean up their act.\u201d</p> <p>Queen\u2019s Brian May also linked the eating of meat to the spread of the disease, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/15/brian-may-blames-meat-eating-for-rise-of-coronavirus\">saying</a>: \u201cThis pandemic seemed to come from people eating animals \u2026 it\u2019s time to re-examine our world in a way that doesn\u2019t abuse other species.\u201d</p> <p>Adams has consistently released music since his breakthrough in the early 80s, and his commercial peak came in 1991 with the single (Everything I Do) I Do It For You, still the longest-running UK No 1.

  "<p>It is a bright April afternoon, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/yung-lean-stranger-review-sad-songs-by-a-hip-hop-enigma\">Yung Lean</a> is strolling down a Stockholm street, iPhone aloft. The rapper \u2013 real name Jonatan Leandoer H\u00e5stad \u2013 is fresh from a boxing session and heading to his favourite cafe for a post-workout meal. \u201cCheck this out \u2013 there\u2019s people walking around!\u201d he says, rotating his phone to reveal a moderately busy main road. As we speak, Sweden is one of the few European countries not in coronavirus lockdown, and watching the 23-year-old interacting with unmasked strangers as he goes about his business borders on the surreal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet this is by no means the most jarring thing about our video encounter. That would be H\u00e5stad himself, who is smiley, switched-on and, save for the neck tattoos that creep from his collar, thoroughly conventional in appearance. He in no way resembles the sullen teen in a bucket hat whose atonal raps about sex, drugs, sadness and Oreo shakes won him a global following and a critical mauling in the mid-2010s. A 16-year-old white, middle-class Swede embracing gritty rap glamour and peddling a gaudy early-internet aesthetic, Yung Lean was treated as a novelty; these days, H\u00e5stad is having the last laugh. Rather than a lost-in-translation curio, he is now considered a pioneer in emo-rap, the hugely popular strain of hip-hop in which mumbled lyrics about intoxication and alienation meet trap beats, spaced-out instrumentals and melodic hooks. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSSch--j1I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AbSSch--j1I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI was definitely ahead of my time, but I don\u2019t think I single-handedly changed the route of modern hip-hop,\u201d says H\u00e5stad as he lunches alfresco. He attributes his prescience partly to watching early trailblazers such as Lil B and Chief Keef and realising \u201cthis is going to stick for the next 10, 20 years\u201d, but also to his unique mix of influences. \u201cOne of the bands that I was inspired by as a kid was [90s rockers] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broder_Daniel\">Broder Daniel</a>, who are really big in Sweden \u2013 the first [Swedish] emo band.\u201d He was also \u201chit the hardest\u201d by the introspective side of gangsta rap \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJtHdkyo0hc\">Geto Boys\u2019 Mind Playing Tricks On Me</a>, the \u201csad 50 Cent songs\u201d. Alongside his Sad Boys production collective, he consolidated his influences into a sound. \u201cIt all came together,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIt made sense.\u201d</p> <p>It was a hunch borne out by the style\u2019s enormous popularity, but such vindication has one unfortunate side-effect: what was once shockingly distinctive now sounds relatively humdrum. It is a problem H\u00e5stad tackles head-on on his upcoming fourth album Starz by considerably expanding his remit. Running alongside his melancholic signature sound are bouncy pop-punk, shoegaze and industrial rock. The result is a record that is meatier and more rounded than any of H\u00e5stad\u2019s previous work.</p> <p>Starz is also the first album H\u00e5stad has made sober \u2013 or something close to it. Emo-rap has been ravaged by drug-related casualties \u2013 major figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/16/death-lil-peep-us-prescription-drugs-epidemic-hip-hop-rapper\">Lil Peep</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/08/rapper-juice-wrld-dies-age-21-chicago\">Juice WRLD</a> have died in recent years \u2013 and H\u00e5stad\u2019s own substance abuse issues led to him being admitted to a psychiatric ward in 2015, then, eventually, adopting a more clean-living lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, we did drink a little codeine when we recorded [Starz],\u201d he shrugs. \u201cBut the main thing is that I stopped drinking and doing other drugs.\u201d His early songs were characterised by narcotic references (his moniker plays both on his name and the codeine-based cocktail), but H\u00e5stad doesn\u2019t think drugs are a \u201cbig part of Yung Lean\u201d, claiming he only focused on them in order to give himself a USP. \u201cI did think: \u2018What\u2019s going to make a difference between me and other rappers?\u2019 I thought it was funny, a 16-year-old kid rapping about coke.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4416b2f63ccce10e1ec94df978e451b8c7a6780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4416b2f63ccce10e1ec94df978e451b8c7a6780/0_173_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yung Lean performing in Glasgow, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lean, mean...

He is clearly amused by aspects of the project \u2013 calling his crew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/10/yung-lean-review-sad-boys\">Sad Boys</a> was something they were \u201cjoking about\u201d before they actually did it \u2013 but equally adamant that the whole thing is straight-faced. \u201cSome people thought it was ironic and some people were like: \u2018He\u2019s genuine, he\u2019s just a bit strange.\u2019 And in real life, I was genuine and a bit strange!\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was never a clown, always more of an outsider.\u201d He certainly wasn\u2019t satirising hip-hop by rapping badly on purpose, as some have suggested. Instead, he is keen to stress his long-term dedication to the art, recounting teenage escapades such as freestyling for hip-hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. \u201cWe knew they were in town, and I was really hungry to be a rapper. My friend filmed it and I started rap-battling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krayzie_Bone\">Krayzie Bone</a> \u2013 I was this annoying 15-year-old kid with curly hair.\u201d </p> <p>Despite H\u00e5stad\u2019s lifelong love of rap, he has actually made some of his best work in completely different sonic universes. He records atmospheric punk with his band D\u00f6d Mark and last year, under his Jonatan Leandoer96 alias, released an album called Nectar, a brilliant scramble of C86 indie, new wave and garage rock. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw7k84_q2D0\">latter project</a>, says H\u00e5stad, was motivated by a drive to sing lyrics that were \u201cbrutally honest\u201d.

His work included a stint working as a contractor for the Canadian government, which was using satellite reconnaissance technologies to help in arms control verification. It opened his eyes to the \u201chidden underworld of government signals intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was aware that there were tools and methods that allowed one to interrogate the internet directly that could gather evidence that was largely beneath the surface of it all. And these methods \u2026 weren\u2019t being deployed for what I thought were these really interesting questions about abuse of power or attempts by governments and corporations to control the information space that we live in,\u201d Deibert said.</p> <p>In 2001 he established the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. The group\u2019s mission \u2013 in the words of one researcher \u2013 is to investigate threats to the online communication of vulnerable populations, whether it is examining the use of commercial spyware, highlighting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing\">security concerns of the video conferencing app Zoom</a>, or reporting on Chinese censorship of online chat rooms.</p> <p>No single episode sums up the group\u2019s unique approach better than the case they discovered in August 2018: a mystery hack that would later emerge as a possible clue in the state-sanctioned murder of a journalist.</p> <p>That summer, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/author/bmarczak/\">Bill Marczak</a><a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/author/bmarczak/\">, one of Deibert\u2019s senior researchers</a>, called him with a startling discovery: an apparent live hack of an individual in Quebec from a server that the team believed was associated with Saudi Arabia. All the team knew was that the individual whose phone was apparently being hacked used two internet service providers, including an obscure one that was associated with a local university near Montreal.</p> <p>Deibert and his team believed that Saudi Arabia had likely already gained access to the individual\u2019s phone, and could be monitoring their calls, messages and emails.</p> <p>Deibert sent Marczak to Montreal as the team started to search the internet and contact experts with an unusual question: who in the area might be of interest to Saudi intelligence?</p> <p>\u201cWe had a list of several people.

The company has disputed the allegation but has declined to comment on specifics, except to say that Khashoggi was never personally targeted by the firm\u2019s spyware.

  "<p>The sun is shining in Braga and, to prove the point, Carlos Carvalhal angles his computer\u2019s camera to present the view outside. \u201cBefore this situation, I hardly even knew I had flowers in my garden,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it is over, I believe I will look at my flowers all the time.

First he rented a friend\u2019s flat, visiting his family at lunchtimes and dining with them at a safe distance outdoors, using disposable cutlery. Now he has moved back in, but with restrictions: avoiding common areas and, as he puts it, \u201cliving together but separately\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/11/league-games-every-day-la-liga-outlines-plan-for-return-to-action-on-12-june\">'Games every day' \u2013 La Liga outlines plan for return to action on 12 June</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same can be said, to some degree, for Carvalhal\u2019s working arrangements. Portugal\u2019s Primeira Liga has designs on returning at the end of the month and, after the national state of emergency ended on 2 May, football clubs were allowed to train. Carvalhal manages Rio Ave and has had to adapt to physically-distanced training. This week they have been allowed to practice in groups of three or four; footballers are, he says, \u201canimals of competition\u201d so it takes imagination and optimism to attempt an imitation.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I don\u2019t like the challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are using our brains all the time. But we must be so creative, trying to simulate the game. How can I make the players, when one is there, another is over there, and another is 20 metres further away, think they are playing a football match? And how can they do tactical work and organisation? It\u2019s an interesting test.\u201d</p> <p>Carvalhal emphasises he and his players are back in business willingly, although that disposition might be challenged now seven players at other clubs have tested positive for Covid-19. On the first day of training he was photographed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carloscarvalha2/status/1257302627571822594\" title=\"\">wearing a face mask and a protective shield</a> to further cover his eyes and nose. He feels proud that, whenever he ventures into the centre of Braga, 80% of the public are covering up too. \u201cOne of the reasons why we don\u2019t have too much chaos in our health system is because people in Portugal have respected the rules,\u201d he says. A death toll of below 1,200 compares well with other western European countries.</p> <p>But can football live up to the moment? It seemed so initially. Carvalhal believes the sport was ahead of the public and even the government in preparing for coronavirus before the league paused in March. Handshakes were banned in the final round of games, during which Rio Ave drew 1-1 at nearby Porto. He tells the story of a scouting trip to watch Boavista, who were their next opponents, at which he bumped into some friends from outside football and shocked them by demanding they keep their distance. When he found out his parents, in their 80s, were still visiting shops and cafes he phoned them \u201cand I said to them, screaming: \u2018Please go home, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b7cc0f84f7b4c6d0066bf856af7d464963abe4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b7cc0f84f7b4c6d0066bf856af7d464963abe4a/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rio Ave goalkeeper Pawel Kieszek competes for the ball with Porto\u2019s Tiquinho Soares during the game on 7 March\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rio Ave goalkeeper Pawel Kieszek competes for the ball with Porto\u2019s Tiquinho Soares during Rio Ave\u2019s last game, on 7 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is unease about the plans to recommence, though. The problem, he believes, is that Portuguese football relies so heavily on television money that it faces an existential crisis if live matches are not fulfilled. According to Uefa\u2019s most recent benchmarking report, that revenue stream made up 32% of a relatively modest \u20ac440m league-wide aggregate. Treading a high wire between health concerns and the needs of a precariously poised industry is an excruciating proposition.</p> <p>\u201cWe know we\u2019ll be taking some risks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we need to save football in Portugal. If we don\u2019t play, there will be chaos in all the clubs. Nobody has pressurised us, but we understand the situation. At the same time, the state of emergency is over. So my hope is that if we go about our work with respect for the rules then maybe we can give an example to society.\u201d</p> <p>He would rather not play behind closed doors but thinks traditionally mid-ranking operations such as Rio Ave may benefit as clubs alter their sights for recruitment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about money, but about respecting society,\u201d he says. \u201cIf businesses don\u2019t have much money then clubs won\u2019t want to spend a lot and give a bad example. There will be a year where clubs have some reluctance to make big transfers, so the middle market will move more than the top market.\u201d</p> <p>Since taking over in May 2019 Carvalhal has turned Rio Ave into a better team.

  "<p>For months the ranchers had laid the groundwork; grazing and exercising a select crop of half-tonne fighting bulls to be transported to arenas and festivals across the country.

Long reviled by animal rights campaigners who see it as cruel and outdated, bullfighting\u2019s fight for survival has triggered a fierce debate over its future in Spanish society.</p> <p>\u201cThe bullfighting sector is \u2013 and will be \u2013 one of the most affected by the dramatic situation that we\u2019re living through,\u201d bullfighter Cayetano Rivera said recently on social media, after dozens of events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/non-running-of-the-bulls-san-fermin-festival-suspended-over-covid-19\">including Pamplona\u2019s running of the bulls,</a> were cancelled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a583a72ece2fdf0750b5e76bb3e54c31b4f9edc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a583a72ece2fdf0750b5e76bb3e54c31b4f9edc/0_123_1714_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bullfighter Cayetano Rivera in the ring in Jaen, southern Spain, in October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bullfighter Cayetano Rivera in the ring in Jaen, southern Spain, in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SALAS/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the virus threatening to wipe out much of the season, which runs until October, he appealed to Spaniards to consider the tens of thousands of people thrown out of work as the industry struggles. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget the many people and families who depend, either directly or indirectly, on the bullfighting world to live.\u201d</p> <p>The estimated loss of income so far is at least \u20ac700m (\u00a3797m), said Mart\u00edn, who also heads the Fundaci\u00f3n del Toro de Lidia, which was created in 2015 to defend the industry. \u201cEven more concerning is that we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be able to restart our activities,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, the animals continue to eat. You have to take care of them and the employees.\u201d</p> <p>The industry is in discussions with television networks about broadcasting bullfights behind closed doors \u2013 a measure Mart\u00edn hopes could help the beleaguered industry.</p> <p>But with little chance that crowds will be allowed to return to the streets for bull fiestas or into arenas for bullfights, he was steeling himself for his worst-case scenario: cancellation of the entire season. \u201cWhat industry could survive a year and a half without any income and still cover its costs?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98130aff6d11762dea70dec8ef20014d975ff0d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98130aff6d11762dea70dec8ef20014d975ff0d1/0_74_3305_2660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal rights activists protest against bullfights before the San Fermin annual running of the bulls in Pamplona in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Animal rights activists protest against bullfights before the San Fermin annual running of the bulls in Pamplona in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Bl\u00e1zquez Dom\u00ednguez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A handful of ranchers have already given up, he said. \u201cThere are breeders that have slaughtered all of their animals \u2026 I know there was a week where more than 400 were killed.\u201d</p> <p>The economics of that make little sense, as it can cost up to \u20ac5,000 to rear a bull while the slaughterhouse pays \u20ac500, he noted. But for those who have bulls that will outgrow the strict age limits on bullfighting and street festivals if they are not used this year, it is one of the few options.</p> <p>The Uni\u00f3n de Criadores de Toros, which represents the interests of some 345 breeders of fighting bulls, estimates that more than 7,000 bulls had been raised for this year\u2019s season.</p> <p>The industry has turned to the Spanish government for help, outlining a list of requests that include a rollback of the sales tax on fighting bulls and grants to help breeders. \u201cWe want them to treat us as they would any other cultural industry,\u201d said Mart\u00edn, citing the economic spinoffs for hotels, restaurants and bars generated by events.</p> <p>Their request has been met with stiff opposition. More than 100,000 people <a href=\"https://www.animanaturalis.org/NoBullfightingBailout\">have signed an online petition</a> urging the government not to use public funds to prop up bullfighting.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous \u2013 particularly at this moment, when there are families that don\u2019t have enough to eat and hospitals that have been decimated by cutbacks,\u201d said A\u00efda Gasc\u00f3n of AnimaNaturalis, an animal rights group that is one of the organisations behind the petition. \u201cPublic funds should not be used to promote and pay for spectacles based on the abuse and mistreatment of animals.\u201d</p> <p>Similar petitions have been launched in Portugal and France, where the local bullfighting industries have also asked for government help. \u201cBullfighting is facing the most critical moment of its existence,\u201d the petition noted. \u201cWe have a unique opportunity \u2026 to build a world without bullfighting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The assertion is borne out by Spain\u2019s last economic crisis, which saw cash-strapped municipalities shift funds away from festivals involving bulls. In 2007, one year before the financial crash, Spain held 3,651 events featuring bulls. Just over a decade later, this number had more than halved, <a href=\"http://www.culturaydeporte.gob.es/actualidad/2019/05/190509-estadisticas-asuntos-taurino.html\">with 1,521 such events held in 2018.</a></p> <p>Spain\u2019s economic minister, Nadia Calvi\u00f1o, predicts that Spain\u2019s GDP <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-spain-economy/update-2-spanish-gdp-pummelled-by-coronavirus-pandemic-to-contract-9-2-in-2020-idUSL8N2CJ1CX?rpc=401&amp;\">could shrink by 9.2% this year </a>and animal rights groups are pushing for bullfighting to be cut off from public funding.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is the total abolition of this practice of torturing animals as a form of spectacle,\u201d said Gasc\u00f3n. \u201cOne way to do that is to choke off their subsidies \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t get rid of the industry completely but it would reduce it to 5% or 10% of what we have today.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For eight hours a day, from March until May, research biologist Will Hawkes surveys huge swarms of insects landing on the Karpaz Peninsula on the north-east corner of Cyprus. \u201cThis place is a migratory hotspot for millions of painted lady butterflies, drone fly hoverflies, seven-spot ladybirds and vagrant emperor dragonflies \u2013 it\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d says Hawkes, a PhD student at the University of Exeter\u2019s Genetics of Migration lab who first studied the phenomenon here a year ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis island is a pit stop for millions of insects that fly at high altitudes over the sea then come to land to rest as they migrate, possibly thousands of kilometres from the Middle East to western Europe. It\u2019s just astonishing that these creatures migrate such long distances and in such vast numbers in order to find the right food to eat and to reproduce in environments at particular temperatures,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne grass fly we found at Cyprus is just 2mm long, so, for their body size, these migrations are quite incredible. Most of the time they\u2019re completely invisible to us,\u201d adds Hawkes, who explains that the distances travelled by insects flying via Cyprus are as yet unknown. The <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/do-dragonflies-migrate-across-the-western-indian-ocean/227EEFD644DBD0E5220AF176D6958192\">furthest insect migration recorded</a> is the 18,000km journey of the 4cm-long globe skimmer dragonfly between India and Africa.</p> \n<p>Hawkes\u2019s PhD supervisor, Dr Karl Wotton, describes his research at Karpaz as significant. \u201cMigration hotspots like this are a window into processes that normally go on unseen, high above our heads, as huge amounts of insects make seasonal movements,\u201d says Wotton. \u201cThis Cyprus hotspot shows how distant ecosystems can nevertheless be connected. It\u2019s part of an emerging global picture of insects on the move.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fae485469b6e8981115453e20c7dee4c3149d95b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fae485469b6e8981115453e20c7dee4c3149d95b/0_0_9728_3784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyprus study\" width=\"1000\" height=\"389\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Karpaz Peninsula on the north-east corner of Cyprus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Hawkes Photography</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hawkes collects insects flying along a gully using a butterfly net in a \u201cVictorian-style study\u201d, then puts them into an insect cage to identify the species before releasing them. He also sets up tiny cameras to record insects flying past for timed periods at set intervals \u2013 back in the UK, he spends weeks manually counting the numbers in every shot, frame by frame.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can record thousands of insects flying past per minute \u2013 it\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d says Hawkes who, by returning annually, is building a long-term data set to let scientists observe trends and patterns over time. \u201cSome butterfly, dragonfly and hoverfly migrations have previously been studied but very few studies look at the bigger picture of insect migration. There are huge gaps in our knowledge; we\u2019re genuinely at the very beginning of understanding these insect migrations.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6319/1584.abstract\">Radar studies show</a> that 3.5 trillion insects (3,200 tons of biomass) migrate annually above southern Britain alone, as published in the journal Science. \u201cMany of these insects are key pollinators and play a major role in pest control, so they\u2019re absolutely vital to agriculture simply due to their sheer numbers,\u201d says Hawkes. \u201cFlies are the most numerous migrants and they have such an enormous impact on the biodiversity of our ecosystems and pollination of crops and plants.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d40412d0336dfc040293ec4a9575587dc44764dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40412d0336dfc040293ec4a9575587dc44764dd/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marmalade hoverfly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A marmalade hoverfly.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Hawkes Photography</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In July 2019, Wotton, a senior lecturer at Exeter, revealed in the journal Current Biolog<em>y</em> that <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982219306050\">1</a><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982219306050\">-4 billion hoverflies</a> migrate into and out of southern Britain each year. As larvae, these hoverflies consume 3-10 trillion aphids, a species that would otherwise be damaging to crops. As adults, hoverflies eat nectar and pollen and are second only to bees in terms of their importance as pollinators.</p> \n<p>Wotton recorded that migrant hoverflies each carry on average 10 grains of pollen, flying up to 100 miles a day. By transferring pollen between different populations of plants as they travel, migratory insects help maintain a diverse gene pool for wild plants and crops, increasing resilience to changes in environmental conditions and the effects of climate change.</p> \n<p>Remarkably, insects are multigenerational migrants \u2013 one full circuit involves between three and six generations of adults moving north from springtime to late summer, followed by one generation travelling back south during the autumn migration. The adults die once eggs are laid, before larvae hatch, so these long-distance migrations are not learned behaviours. \u201cThese migrations are purely genetic. Insects use the sun as their compass and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098220800362X\">only migrate on days when the winds are favourable</a>,\u201d says Hawkes, who also surveys insects flying along the valleys in the Pyrenees mountains on their autumn migration south. \u201cIt\u2019s also likely that when a huge volume of adults dies at the end of each leg of the journey, their biomass provides a seasonal input of nutrients in each location which could be a key food source for other species.\u201d</p> \n<p>But with plummeting insect populations, conserving biodiversity has never been more crucial. A global review published in the journal Biological Conservation found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\">more than 40% of insect species</a> are declining and a third are endangered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3067f14e-e499-4fb2-9302-b5196c99632f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Insects are crucial to the health of functioning ecosystems that are vital for food production and security. Pollinators like bees get a lot of attention because three quarters of crops producing fruit and seeds for human consumption depend on them, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/I9527EN/i9527en.PDF\">according to the Food and Agriculture Organization</a>. Other types of insects include herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids and predators that are crucial to ecosystems humans rely on to survive, acting as pest controllers, recycling nutrients and performing other tasks.</p>\n    <p><b>How do humans harm insects?<br></b>Habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, the climate crisis and over-harvesting are all human-caused issues that put pressure on insects, say experts. The heavy use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers is the primary driver of harm to insects by humans, according to the first <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320718313636\">global scientific review of the literature in 2019</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>How bad is it?<br></b>Bad. Insect populations around the world are plummeting, with 40% of species declining and a third endangered, according to the same literature review. On average, insect biomass on Earth has fallen 2.5% a year for the last three decades or so, which could mean they vanish within the next 100 years.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens if insects become extinct? </b><br>The survival of mankind would be at stake. With no insects to pollinate the crops humans rely on to eat or perform vital functions in ecosystems, humans would be in trouble.</p>\n    <p><b>What can we do about it?</b><br>Insect experts have devised a roadmap for conservation and recovery. In the short term, humans must phase out pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and reduce light, noise and water pollution. In the long term, scientists have called for an international body to monitor the health of insect populations and action taken to help them.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMigratory insects are vulnerable to habitat loss beyond the boundaries of one country, and climate breakdown could affect the migration routes and ranges of these insect species so we need to take a more global, holistic view of conservation,\u201d says Hawkes, who believes farmers can make an enormous difference by reducing the use of pesticides and leaving field margins to grow wild.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see the difference in numbers of insect types between a patch of wildflowers at the edge of a field and the middle of a crop \u2013 we need to move away from monoculture towards agro-ecology.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eae600924fd792015e9feec243a1b12984cef65\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eae600924fd792015e9feec243a1b12984cef65/0_0_6199_4133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spraying pesticide\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reducing the use of pesticides by farmers would make a huge difference to biodiversity.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Matt Shardlow, chief executive of invertebrate conservation charity Buglife, warns that spray drift and soil transport of pesticides into field margins pose a risk and that wildflower-rich habitats should be prioritised in urban areas, on road verges and railways, away from crops sprayed with pesticides.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re restoring wildflower grassland to increase the availability of pollen and nectar for dispersing wild insects along a network of insect pathways called B-Lines throughout the British countryside and towns,\u201d says Shardlow, who is keen to persuade the authorities and EU partners to roll the network out across Europe.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese <a href=\"https://www.buglife.org.uk/our-work/b-lines/\">B-Lines</a> will enable better dispersal of migrants and enable more species to start dispersing north again \u2013 something that\u2019s prevented by increasingly fragmented habitats and the polluted nature of intervening land.\u201d</p> \n<p>On an international scale, further research is required before the science of this Cyprus migration hotspot can influence policy and conservation management. \u201cWe need further understanding of the biology of the species involved, natural variation in numbers and the routes taken before any strong recommendations can be made,\u201d Wotton says.</p> \n<p>\u201cConservation of entire migratory tracks takes collaboration between farmers, conservationists and politicians,\u201d Hawkes adds. \u201cWe need to think beyond borders and consider how habitats link together along these migratory routes.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt an international level, we need politicians to realise that insects are playing a vital role so that governments create consistent policies that protect the diversity of insects and the plants they rely on.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p> \n<p><br></p>",

She is looking after her children, aged three and six, as well as trying to run her lab, give lectures \u2013 including a new one on Covid-19 immunity \u2013 and check in with her research students. She often notches up 16-hour days of work and childcare.</p> <p> She is quick to point out that her husband has taken on a lot at home too, but because she earns less, and can be more flexible about when she works, the bulk of the childcare falls to her.</p> <p>\u201cIt made sense for me to be on domestics from 9 to 5,\u201d she says. \u201cI suspect, around the country, couples have had the same sorts of conversations we had. It probably reflects systemic ways in which men\u2019s and women\u2019s jobs often differ.\u201d</p> <p> She is concerned that women might be falling behind in the race to publish their research, and argues that even if all universities and funders agreed to make allowances for researchers who couldn\u2019t publish during lockdown, those with caring responsibilities would still be left behind because others had had extra time to progress their research.</p> <p>Wilsdon, however, says that in his more optimistic moments he hopes some good might come out of the lockdown for women, and that universities might be forced to confront calls for more flexible working.</p> <p>\u201cAll the juggling and the hidden labour of domesticity that is part of many academics\u2019 real lives is now being brought into view ,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe when those things are raised in the future, universities will be better at understanding.\u201d</p>",

He\u2019s anchored off Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean \u2013 a less pleasing prospect than it sounds. Hurricane season officially starts on 1 June and the island, as Crothers is acutely aware, is \u201cbang in the middle of the hurricane belt\u201d \u2013 hit hard by Dorian last year, and Irma in 2017. Neighbouring countries and islands that might afford protection are shut. Crothers\u2019 only safe option is a solo sail home to Ireland.</p> <p>In one sense he\u2019s not alone. An estimated 500 boats are crossing the Atlantic to Europe in the coming weeks. From the South Pacific to the Indian Ocean, thousands of people are trying to sail home or find shelter.</p> <p>While stranded cruise and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-tests-us-navy-ship-sailors-national-guard-military-guam-uss-theodore-roosevelt-a9429056.html\">navy ships have made headlines</a>, far less attention has been paid to the plight of hundreds of families and individuals on small boats. As countries closed borders, numerous vessels were refused entry to their port of call. Even boats that had been safely anchored before the pandemic were suddenly considered a foreign yacht in territorial waters. Sailors in Portugal and Spain were ordered to return to home ports in the United States or Canada \u2013 a dangerous proposition without planning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvEUa77nwc6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Families with young children have been threatened with arrest, having their boats seized, or being towed out to open water for trying to anchor in sheltered bays, looking for food and water. Thousands have been left with nowhere to go and are undertaking risky passages. People sailing the coasts of Sri Lanka, India, and through the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden to the Horn of Africa, report being forced out to sea by navy gunboats patrolling coastlines. Many have been charged exorbitant prices for life-sustaining supplies as they rapidly run out of cash. Daria Blackwell of the Ocean Cruising Club (OCC) says risky journeys have become common: \u201cOne boat arrived in South Africa, was turned away and had to continue on to St Helena [a journey of more than 1,200 nautical miles] running short of food, fuel and water,\u201d she says. It was headed for the US but, with non-citizens onboard, not guaranteed entry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/no-one-comes-the-cruise-ship-crews-cast-adrift-by-coronavirus\">\u2018No one comes': the cruise ship crews cast adrift by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only place people can expect to be accepted \u2013 and therefore safe \u2013 is their home country. But that presents a problem of epic proportions. Many sailors are far from wealthy: their home is their boat, they hadn\u2019t planned for a sudden ocean passage, and now have to cross in conditions they wouldn\u2019t otherwise attempt. Lockdown means it has been impossible to source spares or safety gear ahead of the trip, while travel restrictions have meant many can\u2019t get anyone to join as crew. And while most insurance policies stipulate certain crew numbers for the crossing, they also deny storm cover to boats left in hurricane zones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02128394bc9df62eed290811b9ac12efb7e16543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02128394bc9df62eed290811b9ac12efb7e16543/0_0_5313_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bar mascot at the Sint Maarten Yacht Club wears a face mask while it is closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The normally busy Sint Maarten Yacht Club Bar &amp; Restaurant is currently occupied by a lonely mascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MG Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many others, Crothers has to choose the least worst option \u2013 face hurricane season or cross alone \u2013 both without cover. Even food provisioning is tricky. In Sint Maarten food shops have only recently reopened. \u201cMy other concern is trying to socially distance while getting supplies for the trip,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m in the age bracket where I can\u2019t afford to get [coronavirus]. Or to get ill in the middle of the Atlantic.\u201d </p> <p>In these difficult circumstances, sailors are turning to one another for support. They are a resourceful breed \u2013 offshore cruising demands it, given the myriad problems that can arise in the middle of the ocean. The OCC has connected more than 150 boats in the west Atlantic heading for Europe: they\u2019re sharing information and offering support on the crossing. This is not an organised flotilla \u2013 boats are leaving from as far afield as Antigua, Jamaica and Mexico to destinations ranging from Russia to the UK, Sweden to Greece. Skippers will make their own decisions on routes and speeds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I go over, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s hard enough for an able man to get back on board \u2013 but with one hand?</p> <footer> <cite>Garry Crothers, sailor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However they\u2019re jointly tracking journeys, so if problems arise there\u2019s some prospect of help from others within range. In the first groups to leave, two boats with emergency medical workers and one with a surgeon onboard have offered assistance with medical support while at sea; one boat has helped another with water supply.</p> <p>Crothers has signed up to the list. He is an experienced sailor, but hasn\u2019t done a transatlantic alone. The longest single-handed trip he\u2019s done so far is five days. \u201cCorrection,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my trips are single-handed.\u201d After a car crash and years of pain, he had his left arm amputated in 2017. \u201cMy biggest worry is fixing things one-handed,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good, but it\u2019s difficult without dropping things, and trying to hold on to the boat.\u201d</p> <p>His first heading will be north, a route many are taking towards Bermuda. Once he has reached the high pressure area, he should pick up westerly winds to sail slowly towards the Azores. From there, he\u2019ll head for Northern Ireland, taking more than three weeks. He has to sail conservatively. \u201cBecause if I go over, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s hard enough for an able man to get back on board \u2013 but with one hand?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/atlantic-zip/giv-39025v67Kbg8JJ2F/\" data-alt=\"Crothers' journey home\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/atlantic-zip/giv-39025v67Kbg8JJ2F/\">Crothers' journey home</a> </figure>  <p>The Azores have been a beacon of light in the Atlantic during this crisis. The archipelago, about 800 nautical miles off the coast of Portugal, is of huge strategic importance for boats crossing west to east. Countries along the Atlantic\u2019s eastern shores \u2013 Morocco, Senegal, Spain, Portugal, France \u2013 have been turning away boats looking for shelter. Island nations such as Cape Verde, off the coast of Africa, lack infrastructure and healthcare to deal with Covid-19, so are more understandably off limits. As Blackwell points out, \u201cPeople are so panicked in countries that don\u2019t have adequate healthcare, they will do anything to protect themselves.\u201d But grateful sailors have been reporting that they could anchor in Horta, the Azores\u2019 port, with access to fuel and water. The islands have a long history of welcoming boats on transatlantic passages, and maritime institution Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f30de8b2248e6c3967e9f8a48981f5212ca6a1cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30de8b2248e6c3967e9f8a48981f5212ca6a1cf/0_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men wearing masks and high viz jackets outside Peter Cafe Sport, Azores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: petercafesport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As welcome as this is, lying at anchor doesn\u2019t afford full protection from weather, or the opportunity to rest, make repairs and plan in the middle of exhausting passages. Which is why sailors have been lobbying governments. <a href=\"https://floatmagazin.de/leute/stranded-in-madeira-sailing-corona-crisis/\">Sailor and journalist Ole Sal</a> has formally applied to the regional governments of Madeira and the Azores, and to Portugal, France and Spain, to provide safe havens, arguing that the lack of open ports is \u201cincreasing the risk of loss of life and damage to vessels\u201d. In Lisbon, yachtmaster Veronique Claus has written to Portugal\u2019s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, on behalf of 30 international boats. \u201cCertainly for those who are anchored in unsafe and non-sheltered waters, the situation is life-threatening,\u201d she says, noting that two yachts have already been lost after breaking anchors.</p> <p>Crothers will pass near the Azores, but may not stop if restrictions mean he has to stay on anchor; dozens of others, however, including Britons <a href=\"https://ellieandjohn.com/\">Elena and John Nye</a>, are counting on the stopover for fuel and water (their small boat won\u2019t carry enough). The 33-year-olds, \u201crelative newcomers\u201d to sailing, set off from the British Virgin Islands for Norway on their 34ft sailboat, and hope to rest in the Azores before the onward journey. The Caledonian canal \u2013 a shortcut through the north of Scotland \u2013 is now closed, so they face a difficult passage via the Shetland Islands, where gale-force winds and perilous seas are common. They should get some shelter in the Western Isles, as the UK is operating some key ports and marinas for transit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/what-four-years-at-sea-taught-me-about-our-relationship-to-the-ocean\">What four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those heading east towards Spanish and Portuguese coasts, and into the Mediterranean for France, Italy, Greece and elsewhere, it\u2019s a mixed picture. Select ports are allowing entry with authorisation, but authorities are policing territorial waters vigorously and it could be costly to get it wrong. In Athens, several Greek crews sailed into a port during lockdown, were fined \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,380) each by the coastguard and branded pirates in the national press.</p> <p>The Nyes are taking comfort from other boats making similar journeys. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring that there are others in the same daft situation,\u201d John says. \u201cIt feels really good that in case of problems we can find out where the nearest boat is.\u201d</p> <p>Crothers, whose final destination is Derry, Northern Ireland, is more circumspect. He is looking forward to a pint of Guinness, but the journey is long, and the illusion of strength in numbers falls away when you\u2019re crossing the ocean in very different boats, with different speeds and routes. \u201cUltimately,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re alone out there.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>If recent experience is anything to go by, Boris Johnson\u2019s recent decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/recipe-for-chaos-trade-union-leaders-warn-against-return-to-work-lockdown-coronavirus\">to allow people to return to work without clear guidelines</a> in place to limit the chance of people contracting Covid-19 is likely to lead to many speaking out about poor workplace practice. </p> <p>Already, the pandemic has sparked reports of NHS workers being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">warned, threatened or disciplined</a> for speaking up about the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing for coronavirus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/06/over-170-carers-call-uk-whistleblower-helpline-during-coronavirus-crisis\">similar worries</a> raised in the care sector. It underlines the need for a shift in attitudes in UK workplaces to whistleblowers, underpinned by an overhaul of the law to afford them greater protection, according to Elizabeth Gardiner, the new chief executive of the whistleblowing charity, Protect.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we would like to see is a proactive duty on employers to protect whistleblowers from being victimised,\u201d she says. \u201cThat would be the sort of cultural shift that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p> <p>A good organisation will want to hear when things start going wrong, say Gardiner. \u201cThreatening people not to raise very important issues and saying \u2018your job is at risk\u2019, means that people won\u2019t hear about those concerns. If they\u2019re that important, we need to hear.\u201d</p> <p>In the first month of lockdown, more than 260 callers contacted the charity\u2019s confidential helpline: reports include people being threatened or bullied for trying to raise Covid-19-related concerns with managers. \u201cForty percent of [those] calls were Covid-related \u2026. and 60% of all of those calls were either from the health or social care sector,\u201d says Gardiner.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard \u2026 about the lack of PPE, as well as from support staff concerned about social distancing and being required to come into work when they could work from home. Some care home staff have told us they have been forced to go into work when they should really be self-isolating, but no other staff are available to help, and we\u2019ve had calls where care home staff were told they could not bring in their own PPE for use.</p> <p>Gardiner is particularly concerned that despite the health secretary Matt Hancock saying all health workers should be<a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/hancock-staff-should-be-free-to-speak-out-over-coronavirus-concerns/7027467.article\"> able to speak out</a>, \u201cwe\u2019ve heard direct from some care sector workers who have been threatened with disciplinary action if they persist in raising concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, the charity was among the international signatories to <a href=\"https://protect-advice.org.uk/coalition-plea-to-make-whistleblowing-safe-during-covid-19-and-beyond/\">a letter</a> that called on public authorities and institutions across the globe to protect anyone exposing \u201charms, abuses and serious wrongdoing\u201d, not least when extraordinary powers have had to be rushed through to cope with the pandemic.</p> <p>Does Gardiner not think it surprising that NHS workers feel the need to contact the charity at all, given the introduction of NHS England\u2019s <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/freedom-to-speak-up-whistleblowing-policy-for-the-nhs/\">freedom to speak up policy</a> following Sir Robert Francis\u2019s <a href=\"http://freedomtospeakup.org.uk/the-report/\">review of whistleblowing</a> in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-scandal-guide\">Mid Staffs hospital scandal</a>? After all, it led to <a href=\"https://www.nationalguardian.org.uk/about-the-ngo/\">trained guardians</a> being put in place to ensure that NHS workers can speak up about any issues affecting their ability to do their job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Chinese inquiry exonerates coronavirus whistleblower doctor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a change in the culture in the NHS: the right messaging going out from the top and the introduction in every trust in England of somebody whose role it is to make sure that there\u2019s a place you can turn to,\u201d says Gardiner. \u201cThat\u2019s really important and I don\u2019t think we should underestimate how important those changes are.<br><br>\u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet, and there is more to be done. Whenever we hear a story that people are being victimised in the NHS it is really troubling, because it\u2019s such an important area and we\u2019ve seen what harm can be done when it goes wrong.\u201d<br><br>Yet despite a slew of scandals over the years, too many of those who speak up still face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/15/whistleblowers-need-independent-office-to-protect-them-say-mps\">bullying, suspensions or forced dismissals of whistleblowers</a>. Last year the charity handled <a href=\"https://protect-advice.org.uk/our-impact-over-2019/\">calls from 3,188 individuals</a> from across the private, public and voluntary sector. These reflected a range of concerns including working practices (19%), financial malpractice (14%), the abuse of a vulnerable person (15%), and patient safety (10%).</p> <p>All employers need to heed whistleblowers as an early-warning system and have effective arrangements in place \u201cnot just those in large, heavily regulated sectors like health and financial services,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want organisations to be more accountable to their staff and to see better outcomes for whistleblowers who really are acting in the best interest of us all. Let\u2019s not forget the Wuhan doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Li Wenliang</a> who first spoke out about the deadly coronavirus but was silenced by police and investigated for \u2018false rumours\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c54125278a33840a55d99cd58f525f7973334206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c54125278a33840a55d99cd58f525f7973334206/0_152_4587_2753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial for Dr Li Wenliang, a whistleblower in Wuhan who died of the coronavirus after being investigated for spreading \u2018false rumours\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial for Dr Li Wenliang, a whistleblower in Wuhan who died of the coronavirus after being investigated for spreading \u2018false rumours\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the problem are the gaps in the law. Instead of dealing piecemeal with the myriad loopholes in the <a href=\"https://protect-advice.org.uk/a-guide-to-pida/\">Public Interest Disclosure Act </a>1998 (PIDA), the charity wants to see it reformed. Currently it is not protecting enough workers and only covers a person once they have blown the whistle and only if they can then prove that they have suffered detrimental treatment as a result. This needs to change, says Gardiner. She was involved in drawing up a <a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/public-concern-at-work/wp-content/uploads/images/2019/11/05160222/Protect-Whistleblowing-Bill-Nov-2019.pdf\">draft bill last autumn</a> which the charity wants to see adopted by government to catch up with international best practice<strong>,</strong> such as <a href=\"http://europeanmemoranda.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/files/2019/10/20191002_AppA_-_HoC_Letter.pdf\">recent EU legislation</a>.<br><br>The proposals in the draft bill, include adding a long list of workers \u2013 such as job applicants, self-employed people and interns \u2013 currently exempt from legal protection, with little or no recourse at an employment tribunal if they have experienced detrimental treatment for whistleblowing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/12/platitudes-bame-health-workers-covid-19-british-asian-gp-protecting-staff\">Platitudes won't stop more BAME health workers and patients dying of Covid-19 | Zara Aziz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Gardiner fears that these measures alone will not do the trick. The charity wants the government to create a whistleblowing commissioner post with the powers to determine and impose significant penalties \u2013 financial or otherwise \u2013 to concentrate minds of organisations or regulators that mishandle whistleblowing and fail to adhere to policy. \u201cI\u2019d love to say, all we need to do is to insist that employers put effective whistleblowing arrangements in place,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen that even [in] a very highly regulated sector like finance, things still go wrong and so I think there is a need for a carrot and a stick approach.\u201d<br><br>Gardiner would like \u201cdifferent sanctions for different sectors, depending on what is appropriate\u201d. Meanwhile she hopes attitudes and employment practices will change. \u201cWe hope out of this terrible pandemic, there will be greater value placed on the care workforce and the care home sector will look to re-evaluate the role whistleblowing can play in keeping staff and residents safe.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, she wants society to realise that it\u2019s everyone\u2019s business to speak up. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to hear if somebody\u2019s telling you there\u2019s something going wrong?

I have a great deal of empathy for the people and businesses suffering financially through the pandemic. I understand it because it is almost identical to the financial suffering that rural and regional communities suffer in the face of drought. It\u2019s distressing to know that it is out of our control and to not know how long it will last or whether we can financially survive long enough to see it out and still be able to recover.</p> <p>Covid-19 is a sudden upheaval and drought is a slower disruption, but the net impact of loss of income to the entire sector is just as devastating. Agricultural businesses have already suffered income loss for years. These drought losses have flowed through communities resulting in business closures and population declines \u2013 not just on farms.</p> <p>Recently on <a href=\"https://iview.abc.net.au/show/7-30/series/0/video/NC2001H071S00\">ABC\u2019s 7.30 </a><a href=\"https://iview.abc.net.au/show/7-30/series/0/video/NC2001H071S00\">program</a>, the agriculture minister David Littleproud dismissed an assertion that the bush might be missing out compared with the coronavirus stimulus. He claimed that the government had provided $8.5bn in drought support to just under 90,000 people and $320bn as coronavirus support to 25 million people, thereby suggesting the bush was getting a much better deal. According to Littleproud, \u201cdrought communities have had a double lick, and we unashamedly don\u2019t apologise for that.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s true that the number of farm businesses continues to decline and less than 90,000 farm businesses remain in Australia. But they are supported by many more enterprises and indeed entire communities. The agricultural sector supports roughly 1.6 million jobs and contributes around $155bn to the national economy, depending on how you measure it.</p> <p>The $8.5bn is little more than a political promise used to overstate what is really being done.</p> <p>The impact of drought is not limited to farmers any more than the impact of Covid-19 is limited to the people who actually get sick. Littleproud\u2019s comments demonstrate either a profound disregard for, or misunderstanding of the true nature of drought and how it really affects the sector he is supposed to represent.</p> <p>In truth many people and businesses who deserve drought support were deemed ineligible and workers who lost their jobs, on and off farms, were not supported beyond the normal safety net.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/13/the-nff-and-governments-drought-strategy-is-like-shuffling-the-deck-chairs-on-the-titanic\">The National Farmers' Federation\u2019s drought strategy is like shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic | Pete Mailler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Against the speed and scale of the coronavirus response, drought support to rural communities now looks pretty pathetic. Among other things the big ticket items of drought support include: welfare to farm households through a process that seems designed to deter applicants; low interest loans to encourage more debt; and \u2013 my favourite \u2013 $5bn allocated to <em>future</em> drought mitigation.</p> <p>I am not suggesting that the people receiving the coronavirus stimulus are undeserving of support. I am merely incensed that people who lost their livelihoods to drought seem, in the governments\u2019 eyes, somehow less deserving than people suffering the same imposition due to Covid-19. In comparison with the coronavirus stimulus the drought response is more than disappointing.</p> <p>Governments are failing rural and regional communities when our viability is arguably strategically more important to the prosperity of the entire nation than ever before.</p> <p>The Covid-19 stimulus measures demonstrate what is possible when governments are genuinely motivated to address a problem. It is essential that the same capacity and commitment is deployed in response to drought throughout and past the timeframe and impacts of the current pandemic.</p> <p>\u2022 Pete Mailler is a grain and cattle farmer from northern New South Wales</p>",

In Australia, Victoria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.distance.vic.edu.au/\">Virtual School</a> also goes back more than a century. </p> <p>These open schools were created to serve isolated communities but now provide a service to the whole school sector. Any teacher, and anyone else, can access the support provided.</p> <p>If the UK had an Open School, what would it look like? We believe it needs to be a free-standing, independent institution offering high-quality self-learning, tutored courses and resources in every subject. It should explain how teachers in schools could incorporate these resources into their teaching. It could create a forum for networking for students of all ages, learner to learner, school to school, across districts, regions, nationally and internationally.</p> <p>It could sponsor innovatory projects \u2013 particularly in response to the challenges of creating genuinely inclusive learning. And it could build a network of tutors, inside and outside schools, skilled at offering enrichment activities to the many, but also expert at helping youngsters who have fallen behind.</p> <p>At the primary level, an Open School would be a huge support for those teachers who do not have a background in the subjects they teach (languages, mathematics and science, for example). It would be especially important for older students. There are tens of thousands who, for health or social reasons, need teaching outside the formal school context.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/28/i-am-deeply-scared-for-so-many-children-diary-of-a-headteacher-in-lockdown\">\u2018I am deeply scared for so many children\u2019: diary of a headteacher in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At secondary age, students might have some subjects taught in a conventional way and others through the Open School. Every student would have a much richer range of learning opportunities than those offered by their own school\u2019s timetable. What better way to address the motivation challenge of the adolescent years?</p> <p>And schools might start to feel different. The preoccupation with crowd control, behaviour, even exclusion, could become part of history in a move towards individual, personalised timetables.</p> <p>There would be a cost, but against the vast sums the chancellor is working with it would be pocket money to set up. And we could start now. The BBC, and organisations such as Oak National Academy, offer a core. An Open School would have the very best resources from a range of providers.</p> <p>Some subjects, mathematics, for example, might be given priority. Others would follow. Get the decisions right about structure and the Open School could be fully set up by the end of next year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/openuniversity\">Open University</a> could advise on infrastructure. Maybe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/03/bbc-launches-daily-educational-shows-keep-children-studying\">BBC</a> should take a lead. This would be an institution and a resource for all time. The Open University astonished the world with the quality of its resources and courses. An Open School would match that achievement.</p> <p><em>\u2022 S</em>ir Tim Brighouse was the London commissioner for schools. Bob Moon is emeritus professor of education at The Open University</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global cases approach 4.2 million</strong></h2> <p>The number of people known to have died since the pandemic began has reached at least 286,330, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 4,177,584 people are known to have been infected. The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic.</p> <h2>South Korea\u2019s Seoul nightclub cluster grows to 64</h2> <p>In the country so often<strong> </strong>cited as a beacon of success in tackling the coronavirus, 64 cases have now been connected to a cluster in Seoul\u2019s nightclub district that was visited on 1 May by a man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/south-korea-struggles-to-contain-new-outbreak-amid-anti-lgbt-backlash\">in his late 20s</a> before he tested positive for the virus, Yonhap reported. Since mid April, the country had been adding fewer than 15 cases per day, including some days when there were no domestic infections.</p> <h2><strong>China reports no new domestic cases after spike on weekend</strong></h2> <p>China reported zero new domestic coronavirus infections on Tuesday, after two consecutive days of double-digit increases fuelled fears of a second wave of infections. A new cluster reappeared over the weekend in the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic first emerged, while the northeastern city of Shulan was placed under lockdown Sunday after another outbreak emerged. On Monday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported 17 new cases, five of them in Wuhan. Seven of the new cases were imported.</p> <h2><strong>New York City\u2019s death toll may be 5,000 higher than official toll</strong></h2> <p>Between 11 March and 2 May, about 24,000 more people died in the city than researchers would ordinarily expect during that time period, a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. That\u2019s about 5,300 more deaths than were blamed on the coronavirus in official tallies during those weeks.</p> <h2><strong>Fauci to tell US senate reopening early risks \u2018needless suffering and death</strong></h2> <p>The New York Times reported that Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US expert on infectious diseases and a key member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, will on Tuesday tell the US senate that reopening the economy early risks \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/us/coronavirus-updates.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur#link-5ce318a3\">needless suffering and death</a>\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Trump accused of racism over press conference comments</strong></h2> <p>The president was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/trump-us-latest-coronavirus-reporters\">criticised for telling an Asian-American journalist to direct her questions on the US\u2019s epidemic to China</a>, instead of to him.

It was a remarkable, treasurable experience: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/22/titian-love-desire-death-review-national-gallery\">his group of \u201cpoesie\u201d paintings</a>, based on stories from Ovid, had last hung together 400 years ago. Two days later, the museum closed its doors. By then, most commercial galleries in the UK, and many public institutions, had shut. The drift to digital began soon afterwards. Visual arts organisations launched so many podcasts and IGTV broadcasts and film streams and viewing rooms and talks from the archive that it has sometimes been overwhelming.</p> <p>This week, the most social, crowded, people-watching-oriented event of the global visual art calendar \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/friezeartfair\">Frieze art fair,</a> in its New York iteration \u2013 is happening on devices everywhere. It has transformed itself into an online shop with art as the scrollable produce. The Asos effect is amplified by the fact that prices, for once, are displayed for all to see. A <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/creed-work-no-890-dont-worry-ar01149\">Martin Creed neon spelling out the words DON\u2019T WORRY</a> could be yours for $150,000 (\u00a3118,000).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enEv3XIUhfM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/enEv3XIUhfM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Adam Chodzko\u2019s digital work for the exhibition The Botanical Mind</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The reopening of art institutions still seems a distant prospect for many parts of the world \u2013 and the idea of the hyper-crowded blockbuster show even more so. So has the moment for digital art arrived? Artists \u2013 many of them locked out of studios and with projects, residencies and exhibitions having evaporated \u2013 are improvising with the means at their disposal. At least those, of course, who aren\u2019t sick, or caring for others, or running up face masks on their sewing machines (like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_P9FL-lJfJ/\">Stephanie Syjuco</a>, the California-based artist, who has been producing around 100 a week for use by frontline community workers). </p> <p>Many are getting used to working in new ways, some of them digital. But this is what artists have always done. As Martin Clark, director of Camden Arts Centre in London, says: \u201cI used to work at Tate St Ives. There it\u2019s really noticeable that when you get to the war years, paintings became really small \u2013 because there wasn\u2019t much canvas around. Everyone\u2019s work changed to accommodate the material conditions. In a way, what\u2019s happening now is no different.\u201d (For his own institution, accommodating the conditions has meant launching an online version of a now delayed exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.botanicalmind.online/\">The Botanical Mind</a> \u2013 a site rich with texts, recordings and images, plus a new digital work by Adam Chodzko.)</p> <p>Some forms of digital experimentation are survival strategies. <a href=\"http://www.matthewburrows.org/home\">East Sussex-based painter Matthew Burrows</a> began <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/artistsupportpledge/?hl=en\">#artistsupportpledge on Instagram</a> to help artists financially, given that many fragile livelihoods have been destroyed by loss of projects, residencies and second jobs. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/artistsupportpledge/\">Artists post work to sell for no more than \u00a3200</a>. Whenever they make \u00a31,000, they pledge to spend \u00a3200 on another artist\u2019s work \u2013 and so on. It has raised an estimated \u00a320m for artists and makers worldwide.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVycau9O1Qs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVycau9O1Qs?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVycau9O1Qs\">Watch Lawrence Abu Hamdan\u2019s Once Removed on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Supporting artists financially was also part of the idea behind <a href=\"https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/transmissions\">Transmissions</a>, organised by artists Tai Shani, Anne Duffau and Hana Noorali, under the auspices of Somerset House Studios in London. Every Thursday evening at 9pm until the end of May, artists invited by the trio are putting on a kind of TV show. (Episodes are not archived \u2013 be there <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/transmissions2020\">on Twitch</a> or catch the Friday morning repeat.) Episode one, put together by Shani, Duffau and Noorali, started with a magical journey through the cosmos to meet a beneficent goddess; episode two, by Sophie Jung, had anarchic echoes of old-fashioned Saturday-night light entertainment, Basil Brush and all. Putting art out online in this way, says Shani, is using the internet \u201cmore as a carrier or vessel for work than a conceptual point\u201d. </p> <p>Like many artists, Dubai-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/01/silence-or-death-turner-finalist-lawrence-abu-hamdan-on-recreating-a-horrific-syrian-jail\">Lawrence Abu Hamdan</a> (along with Shani, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/03/turner-prize-2019-lawrence-abu-hamdan-helen-cammock-oscar-murillo-and-tai-shani-shared\">one of the artists who won the 2019 Turner prize</a>) posted most of his film-based works to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5v2iHIhsbFLqk1OrIKWosA\">YouTube</a> during lockdown, though there are significant losses when works made for a gallery sit on the flat, unforgiving rectangle of a digital screen \u2013 not least that the viewer may be tempted to switch to Netflix at any second. \u201cThe first few minutes of Once Removed are deliberately almost boring,\u201d he says, referring to a recent work about a young Druze man who understands himself to be the reincarnation of a relative who died in the Lebanese civil war. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work so well online.\u201d (It is very much worth sticking with.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-IUeVCA9Gl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

But, she decided, not before \u201cdocumenting the mess\u201d. Fortunately, she was in temporary possession of a film camera that could not be returned to its owner owing to lockdown, and so she got to work. The Mess Can\u2019t Clean the Hand is a creepy, noirish little film that seems to encapsulate the domestic anxiety around clutter and mess. The hand itself is an agent of chaos \u2013 perhaps even contagion \u2013 rather than Marie Kondo-like order. (The flat remains untidied at the time of writing.)</p> <p>Ben Vickers, the chief technology officer at London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery, is soon, along with colleagues, to publish a report completed before the pandemic, titled Future Art Ecosystems. One of the open \u2013 and unanswered \u2013 questions posed by the document is: \u201cWhat would a major public art institution look like without physical exhibition or performance spaces?\u201d That seems a particularly resonant line of inquiry right now. But it\u2019s also clear that digital art has a long and complex history. What used to be called \u201cnet art\u201d can trace its roots back to an era before the web \u2013 to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/07/civilization-new-york-magazine-sending-art-in-the-post\">1960s mail art movement</a>, for example, when artists sent work by post. Organisations including New York-based <a href=\"https://rhizome.org/art/artbase/\">Rhizome</a> have been supporting and preserving art made to be seen online for years. Some organisations better known for their physical exhibitions, such as Dia Art Foundation, have long been working with digital art, and now may be the time to discover some of these older <a href=\"https://www.diaart.org/program/artistswebprojects\">web-based commissions</a>, which date to 1995.

One thing, though, that he\u2019s spotted on a personal level, is the appeal of virtual reality at a time when much of his life, professional and social, has been conducted through the aching flatness of Zoom. He has been \u201cmeeting\u201d with the artist <a href=\"http://www.jakobsteensen.com/\">Jakob Kudsk Steensen</a> \u2013 who last year made an augmented-reality tour of Kensington Gardens called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx_9suUViKk\">The Deep Listener</a> for the Serpentine \u2013 in a VR environment. \u201cI\u2019d given up on VR a year or so ago, but the greater sense of presence you get is a relief now there\u2019s only the flat screen. Curators are starting to think about how you could host a public event with VR, how you could really deploy it well.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://glasgowinternational.org/\">Glasgow International</a> \u2013 the biennial festival that should have taken place in late April, but has now been delayed until 2021 \u2013 launched a small, well-judged digital programme that will stay online through May. It combines old, new and swiftly reworked art by some of those commissioned to show in the physical lineup. It begins with a simple audio work, <a href=\"http://georginastarr.com/georgina_Starr_Yesterday_whistle.htm\">Yesterday, by Georgina Starr</a>, a recording of her whistling the Beatles song, that she made in the empty corridors of the Slade School of Art when she was a student in 1991. Heard now, the solitary voice echoing from a deserted space seems appropriately melancholic.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/apr/12/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk\">Alberta Whittle</a>, meanwhile, quickly reworked the film she had been making \u2013 about the Forth and Clyde canal as a metaphor for the migration of people over waterways. Now it speaks directly to the moment, drawing together the threads of the Home Office\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d, the Windrush scandal, and the role of immigrants as frontline NHS workers. According to Richard Parry, the festival director, some aficionados of this well-loved festival gathered together on Zoom for an unofficial opening party, with drinks and group viewing of the online works: a sense of community despite the odds.</p>",
  "<p>So enduring is that image of Twiggy \u2013 side-swept hair, heavy eyes, delicate neck \u2013 that it\u2019s strange to think she was a model for only four years.</p> <p>But Twiggy is an expert at reinvention (or \u201cbranching out\u201d as her joke goes). The schoolgirl known as Lesley Hornby became Twiggy, the face of the 1960s, recognised then and now by a single name. At 21, she became the all-singing, all-dancing star of Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 film The Boy Friend, which won her two Golden Globes. She has performed on Broadway, recorded albums and been a TV presenter. In her 60s, she turned fashion designer, with several collections for Marks &amp; Spencer. Last year, she was given a damehood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6446d327d0a96a37ed5a08c7038641d92f5db09f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6446d327d0a96a37ed5a08c7038641d92f5db09f/0_0_2106_2320/908.jpg\" alt=\"Twiggy in 1965.\" width=\"908\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twiggy in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger-Viollet/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What can be next? Podcasts, of course. At 70, she is about to launch Tea With Twiggy, in which she will interview famous friends including Joanna Lumley, Elaine Paige and Christopher Biggins \u201cabout their careers, their pasts, their childhoods, and things they\u2019re doing at the moment\u201d, she says. The lockdown has been an opportune moment to get started on it. \u201cThere are so many horrible stories on the news,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted people who could tell lovely stories and be funny.\u201d</p> <p>I speak to Twiggy by phone; she\u2019s in the flat she shares with her husband, the actor and director Leigh Lawson. She is missing her family the most during lockdown \u2013 her daughter had a baby in February, Twiggy\u2019s fifth grandchild (her stepson has three). \u201cI got to hold him the day he was born, then I got to visit about four days later,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then by March \u2026\u201d We all know what happened next. She video calls her grandchildren, and sends them the recordings she and her husband make of them reading stories. \u201cApart from that, we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ve got each other, Leigh and I,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She is a good talker and generous with her laughter \u2013 until a question displeases her. But you don\u2019t, I suppose, survive for more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/19/twiggy-at-60-interview\">five decades in the public eye by being a pushover</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s remarkable she never lost the plot after all these years in the spotlight. \u201cI was so straight it\u2019s boring,\u201d she says, and laughs. It was the late 60s when she was launched into international fame, but she insists she never took drugs. \u201cThe worst thing I did was smoke cigarettes.\u201d She didn\u2019t even drink wine until she was in her late 20s. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. I grew up in Neasden, we drank tea.\u201d</p> <p>Twiggy was the youngest of three daughters. She remembers a happy childhood , although one where her mother, Nell, would occasionally be admitted, sometimes for months at a time, to a psychiatric hospital. \u201cI think today [she would have been] diagnosed as bipolar,\u201d says Twiggy. \u201cI had the most amazing dad, Norman, who I loved and adored. He was from Lancashire, very sensible, very down to earth, very calm. So when Mum \u2026 I think anyone with bipolar, they\u2019re not ill all the time, they can go months or even years being absolutely fine and then something happens that makes them plummet into depression. But my dad was there.\u201d Her sister Shirley, who was 15 years older than her, would also step in, \u201cso I was very protected really. It wasn\u2019t until I grew up and looked back and thought it must have been really hard on Dad.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/aug/11/observer-archive-twiggy-12-august-1966\">Observer picture archive: Twiggy, 12 August 1966</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twiggy was close to her mother. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go anywhere without my mum. It\u2019s amazing what happened to me because I was so shy and insecure.\u201d She says she \u201cnever even thought\u201d of becoming a performer. But she loved fashion and had pictures of the model Jean Shrimpton on her bedroom walls \u201calong with the Beatles\u201d, so had vague ambitions to become a model or fashion designer.</p> <p>Her sister, Vivien, was seven years older, \u201cand I can still remember in detail clothes she made and really wanting to be like her\u201d. Twiggy was a mod and was allowed out to a club in Harrow on Saturday nights as long as she was home by 10.30pm. \u201cWe\u2019d look at all the other mods and see what they were wearing and then try to copy that. I used to make a lot of the stuff. That was the huge influence on me, fashion-wise. Then, by the mid-60s, just before I was discovered, people like Barbara Hulanicki gave us Biba.\u201d The boutique for young women in Kensington \u201cbecame my obsession. Because before that, you could either buy clothes from children\u2019s shops or you could buy women\u2019s clothes from department stores.\u201d</p> <p>Twiggy wasn\u2019t allowed to wear makeup, but at the weekends she and her friends would practise doing their faces. She made her eyes look like the ones painted on her rag doll, just playing around, but it became her look. \u201cIt used to take me an hour and a half to do, I had three pairs of false eyelashes on the top. I\u2019m amazed I could open my eyes.\u201d She laughs. \u201cThen I used to paint the lines underneath. So in 1966, when I was plucked from anonymity into the madness it became, that was my look.\u201d</p> <p>She was discovered when a newspaper fashion journalist came across some photographs of her modelling a new cropped hairstyle for a celebrity hairdressers\u2019. \u201cWithin a month, I was all over the newspapers, I was getting offers to go to Paris. I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like it. I loved it, it was brilliant.\u201d The following year she went to New York, and became even more famous. \u201cSonny and Cher gave me a party in Hollywood,\u201d she recalls. She remembers being searched at the airport for drugs. \u201cI think they figured that anyone from swinging London must be \u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. \u201cBut you know, it\u2019s probably why I survived, because I was so straight.\u201d</p> <p>The fashion world, like others, has been rocked by allegations of sexual assault in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Twiggy has said before that she never experienced any harassment, partly because she had a manager, Justin de Villeneuve (an art dealer and photographer who changed his name from Nigel), who travelled everywhere with her. \u201c\u201cMy dad had worked in the film industry, so he obviously saw things that went on. And he said: \u2018If you\u2019re going to go to these studios and travel, you have to have somebody with you.\u2019 So I was never ever hit upon.\u201d A lot of the women who experienced the worst of it were trying to make their way into the industry and were more vulnerable, she points out \u2013 Twiggy had already very definitely made it.</p> <p>De Villeneuve was also Twiggy\u2019s boyfriend. They had met when she was 15 and he was 25. Does she look back and feel that was exploitative? \u201cIt\u2019s not an area I cover so you can look it up in books if you want,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d In her 1997 autobiography, she writes: \u201cLooking back he should never have taken me out, I was far too young and he was far too old.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2adf6676f3eabb26514443fc5ef40f2d7f1861e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2adf6676f3eabb26514443fc5ef40f2d7f1861e1/0_0_2269_3328/682.jpg\" alt=\"Twiggy in The Boy Friend ... \u2018I\u2019d have been a bit of a fool to turn it down.\u2019\" width=\"682\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twiggy in The Boy Friend ... \u2018I\u2019d have been a bit of a fool to turn it down.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also writes that it has irritated her that over the years the story has been that \u201cJustin was the Svengali and I was the dumb blond\u201d. Instead of being the delicate, naive person her appearance back then would have you believe, she was steely. There is a clip of an interview with her from 1970. Responding to an inane question about a curvier shape being back in fashion, she replies, cool-eyed: \u201cThe bosom has never been out. That would mean that women have been out, which is ridiculous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She also said she was \u201cvery bored\u201d with modelling.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suddenly stop one day and think: \u2018I\u2019m not going to model any more,\u2019\u201d she says now. But by then she had met Ken Russell, the film director. She went along to lunch with him \u2013 it was an informal audition \u2013 and when she turned up, Paul McCartney was also sitting at the table. \u201cEvery teenage girl had a favourite Beatle and mine was Paul McCartney,\u201d she says. \u201cThree years before, I\u2019d been one of the screaming girls at one of his concerts. I had to go and sit at this lunch, opposite the most famous film director in England and my idol and try and be normal and interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Russell, she says, \u201cbecame like my mentor\u201d. She would go to his house and watch old musicals with him and his wife, Shirley. He cast her as the star of The Boy Friend, an extravagant musical, for which Twiggy had singing and dancing lessons for a year. It\u2019s an extraordinary first film to do. \u201cI\u2019d have been a bit of a fool to turn it down,\u201d she says. She would win two Golden Globes for the part and later, one of her co-stars, Tommy Tune, would cast her in his 1983 Broadway production. \u201cAt least with a film, I was not frightened of cameras, I had worked in the modelling industry for four years. But to go out on a Broadway stage in front of 2,000 people every night and sing and dance, that\u2019s scary.\u201d It was, however, \u201cthe greatest professional thing I\u2019ve ever done because it proved to me that I could do something that I thought I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/28/arts.artsnews\">The moment that made Twiggy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Did she have a plan for her career? \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think you can. You can have a goal of what you want to do, but you can\u2019t plan it because you\u2019ve got to be offered parts.\u201d Twiggy was certainly well-connected \u2013 there are great stories in her autobiography about meeting Fred Astaire, and running away from Phil Spector\u2019s house. She worked with David Bowie and attended Hollywood parties with Elizabeth Taylor. Although she worked fairly steadily throughout the 80s and 90s, she never quite reached the heights of her early career. \u201cI did a couple of films that were duds, everyone does. But I think I\u2019ve had a brilliant career. And more importantly I\u2019ve had a very happy life.\u201d </p> <p>The closest there has been to Twiggy, in terms of exposure and era-defining influence, has been Kate Moss (they are friends). Both have been blamed in their time for pushing an aesthetic of extreme thinness. It\u2019s not fair to single out the model \u2013 it\u2019s the industry in which they work that is at fault \u2013 but how does she feel about the conversations around body image now? Does the fashion industry still need to change and focus more on different shapes? \u201cWell, it has, hasn\u2019t it, there are so many more ads now,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with older models, they\u2019re using middle-aged and older women in commercials. I don\u2019t think the high fashion industry will ever go completely away from slimness but I think other parts of the industry have started to use different shapes and sizes, and I think they should.\u201d Her range for M&amp;S, she points out, went from a size eight to a 22.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2def4828421f4edbf05f8c0e46f3dcb98afeaa28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2def4828421f4edbf05f8c0e46f3dcb98afeaa28/0_162_3425_2055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twiggy with Noemie Lenoir, Erin O\u2019Connor and Laura Bailey in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twiggy with Noemie Lenoir, Erin O\u2019Connor and Laura Bailey in 2015 for an M&amp;S campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M&amp;S Library/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2009, an advert for an eye cream, featuring Twiggy, was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority for being misleading because it had been airbrushed. \u201cThat was nothing to do with me.

If they take it away and do the stuff, it\u2019s absolutely nothing to do with me.\u201d There\u2019s a growing number of younger women, I say \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of the actor Jameela Jamil \u2013 who refuse on principle to be airbrushed, because of the unrealistic messages it sends women. \u201cI have no idea, it\u2019s up to them. I don\u2019t have any control over that,\u201d says Twiggy, sounding increasingly prickly. We go back and forth a bit. Does she mind that she is airbrushed? There is a pause. \u201cI think we should get off this subject because you\u2019re getting really boring,\u201d she says.</p> <p>So I ask her what she wants to do next, though the atmosphere doesn\u2019t really recover. She was about to go into the studio to record a new album, which she wants to get back to at some point. She still loves fashion design and has been doing more knitting and sewing during these lockdown days, much like in her teenage years. \u201cI wonder what she would say to her 16-year-old self now. \u201cOh, just go for it. And enjoy it. I think I did most of the time.

  "<p>By the time the schools closed in late March, my GP consulting room in Edinburgh had been emptied of clutter, its surfaces rendered easy to wipe down with disinfectant. It felt as if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/were-clearing-the-decks-a-gp-on-watching-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfold\" title=\"\">decks had been cleared</a>. There are almost 4,000 patients at my practice on the south side of the city, close to the university. As the lockdown began, my colleagues and I were spending our time phoning two or three hundred of the frailest, as well as the 30 or so who had been advised by the government to \u201cshield\u201d from the virus until July at least. On the phone we made sure they understood the advice to stay in and that they had arranged food deliveries for the coming weeks. We checked they had a \u201ckey information summary\u201d \u2013 an electronic pr\u00e9cis of their principal medical issues \u2013 available for paramedics, A&amp;E and hospital staff to access should they become unwell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/25/gp-doctor-edinburgh-coronavirus-pandemic-podcast\">'The past six weeks have been unlike anything I\u2019ve known': a GP on how the pandemic has changed his work \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the first few weeks of the year, the pandemic had been a dreaded but distant anxiety. I had little sense of how severely it would hit us, and how much planning would be enough. The speed of its arrival was startling, and the past six or seven weeks have been unlike anything I\u2019ve known in general practice.</p> <p>Everything about the way we work has been transformed. The number of face-to-face encounters with patients has dropped by 90%. Home visiting is both more time-consuming (because of the requirement for personal protective equipment, or PPE), and perfunctory (to cut contact time). Dread has given way to fatigue, but not to complacency. I\u2019m worried that too few people are being tested, that the test itself is often inaccurate and that our PPE provision is inadequate. The health gap between rich and poor, already wide from a decade of cuts to councils and benefits, is being stretched wider.</p> <p>Now that restrictive lockdown measures are starting to be eased, cases will surely climb. My GP colleagues and I have all seen some patients with Covid-19, but because of the effectiveness of the lockdown, fewer than forecast in those dark days of March. Two of our patients have died of it \u2013 about the same proportion, 1 in 2,000, as have so far died of the virus nationwide.</p> <p>The agility of the NHS in response to the crisis has been impressive. Our practice has four GPs and two nurses; all still travel to and from the clinic every day, and the four receptionists are still fielding and triaging calls. The appointments book is filled as usual, but now with names for the clinicians to phone back, rather than with appointment times for patients to come in.</p> <p>The NHS is notorious for its slow uptake of technology \u2013 I still use fax machines and pagers daily \u2013 but we can now text patients\u2019 phones with a link to open a video call to our aged desktop PCs. There are still clinical problems for which a physical examination is imperative: those I do at the practice if the patient is fit enough to come in, or at their home if they\u2019re not.</p> <p>Either way, I wear a mask, apron and visor, and two pairs of gloves. As aspiring GPs we were taught to value the subtleties of human communication \u2013 to carefully attend to body language, to silences, to the way a patient holds or evades eye contact. In a mask and visor, I feel less like a GP than an old-school surgeon, oblivious and insensitive.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Two \u201cCovid hubs\u201d were set up in Edinburgh just before lockdown came in: one for telephone triage and one for face-to-face assessments. (A third was opened a week or two later, but then closed, because there weren\u2019t enough patients to justify it.) The idea was to keep patients with coronavirus away from their usual GP surgeries, where risk of cross-infecting others was high.</p> <p>I spent the evening of 19 March at the telephone triage hub, when cases were still climbing steeply, with a glued-and-Sellotaped headset, one finger in my uncovered ear, speaking to patient after patient reporting the same pattern of symptoms: a dry irritating cough (as the virus irritates the upper airways), lack of smell (as the nose becomes infected), headache, a tight chest, fever, and a bone-weary, sagging exhaustion. A few complained of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, as the virus upset the digestive tract. And fear: everyone was frightened by what they had heard about this virus.</p> <p>The sickest patients were directed to the other Covid hub for a face-to-face assessment, and I began work there the following week. There is an efficient system in place to keep staff and other patients safe: each patient is met at the door by a nurse in mask, gloves and apron, and has their name and date of birth checked. The patients are given a mask and gloves to put on themselves. They are led down a corridor to the assessment room \u2013 a freshly mopped, stripped-out clinical space \u2013 and offered a seat. The doctor waits outside the room, puts on mask, apron gloves and visor, and goes in once the patient is alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09217278c12a4c06396e13454f3b8e9b7432cab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09217278c12a4c06396e13454f3b8e9b7432cab5/0_0_7831_5221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh under lockdown in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edinburgh under lockdown in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My training as a GP emphasised the importance of building empathy and rapport, but on shift in the Covid hub I stay as far from the patient as possible until the moment of actually examining them, even taking their medical history from the far side of the room. I remember seeing a middle-aged man there who had flown in from Italy not long before lockdown. Another who had caught the virus at his mother\u2019s funeral. A builder who\u2019d had a sick workmate on the last site he worked before lockdown. A young mother who thought she\u2019d caught it on the train from London.</p> <p>On shift one Thursday evening, we all stopped at 8pm to listen for the sound of clapping, but the clinic is surrounded by hospital buildings, and the night was silent. \u201cIt makes my toes curl anyway,\u201d said one of my colleagues. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad when it stops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the one time of the week I get to see all my neighbours.\u201d For me, those Thursday rituals are far more about people cheering one another, than they are about thanking the NHS.</p> <p>Scotland was at an earlier stage in the spread of the disease as lockdown came in; even so, nationwide distancing measures should have come in earlier \u2013 by early April, with the upswing in cases steepening, we could all see that. Making call after call, seeing patient after patient, I thought how we\u2019d been like toddlers on the beach, watching the waves edging ever-closer up the sand, but still squealing with shock when the water rolled over our toes.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 3 April, Boris Johnson, at home isolating with coronavirus, posted a video online. He was visibly overbreathing, interrupting his sentences to take brief gasps. Two days later, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/the-strange-lead-up-to-boris-johnsons-admission-to-hospital\" title=\"\">admitted to hospital</a>, and on 6 April he was moved into intensive care. The BBC was publishing flow charts of how the transition of power would work if the prime minister died.</p> <p>The trajectory of his illness was by now familiar: a week or so of flu-like symptoms, and then, between day seven and day nine, just as most patients start to improve, the onset of worsening breathlessness. Covid-19 has been called a \u201cbiphasic\u201d illness, for these two phases \u2013 the first \u201cvirological\u201d, as the body confronts the virus, and the second \u201cimmunological\u201d, as misdirected messages from the immune system thicken the lungs and the lightest, airiest part of the body becomes sodden with fluid.</p> <p>In my part of Lothian, there are usually two cars providing emergency GP home visits at the weekends and in the evenings. A few days after Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital, I was out in Car 2, driving to a visit in the most urgent triage category, which means getting to the patient within one hour. The experience was a fairly typical snapshot of what it\u2019s like to make home visits as a GP right now. On the phone, the patient had said that after a week of flu-like symptoms he was breathless even when lying on his sofa, and had a fever. It was early evening as I drove to his house. Westering sunlight was turning the suburban streets golden and blackbirds were singing in privet hedges. I phoned the patient from the car for directions. His breath came in gasps, his sentences interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d I asked. Yes. \u201cCan you sit near the door?\u201d Yes. \u201cJust to warn you, I\u2019ll be wearing an apron, mask, visor, gloves. I\u2019ll give you a mask and gloves to wear, too.\u201d OK. \u201cIf you sit near the door, it\u2019s easier for me \u2013 I won\u2019t have to come all through the house to find you.\u201d OK.</p> <p>I ignored the twitching curtains of the neighbours, the kids out on their bikes. Earlier in the shift, leaving another home visit, a patient had asked me, \u201cCan you shout to the neighbours that I <em>don\u2019t</em> have Covid?\u201d Now I stood at the back of the car, opened the boot, and began The Great Faff \u2013 another new protocol to get accustomed to. Thermometer, oxygen sensor, stethoscope, all placed into a clear plastic bag. Apron on, mask on, gloves on. Then a second pair of gloves over the first. The apron flew about in the wind. (Some of my colleagues have been sellotaping the thin flapping plastic to their legs.) Visor on last \u2013 its frame was 3D-printed in green plastic, with clips for attaching a head strap to the back, and a clear acetate shield to the front. On the inside of the forehead band was written Car 2 in permanent marker.</p> <p>At the patient\u2019s front door, which was ajar, I breathed in the smell of stale cigarette smoke. The man was sitting on a stool just inside the door, elbows on his knees, bracing his chest with his arms to better move air in and out of the lungs. He was wearing grey pyjamas that had lost a couple of buttons.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d He grunted an acknowledgement. \u201cCan you manage on with one of these?\u201d I handed him the mask, but he couldn\u2019t tie the strings of it. Wishing my forearms weren\u2019t bare, I leaned over him, holding my breath, and knotted the ties at the back of his head and neck.</p> <p>I counted his breaths \u2013 fast, at 28 per minute. I put a digital thermometer in his ear and it flashed red with an impressive fever. I put an oxygen sensor over his finger \u2013 by shining light through the skin, it can gauge the oxygen content of the blood. His was worryingly low. His pulse, even sitting down, was galloping along at more than two beats a second.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"55489bde84ecbe841c8006736662ba1a7c51a72e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55489bde84ecbe841c8006736662ba1a7c51a72e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Western General hospital in Edinburgh.

This satellite ward was set up for non-Covid patients to halt patient to patient transfer of the virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCould you stand up for me?\u201d I asked. We shuffled awkwardly on the small landing in a doleful dance. He turned his back and I lifted his pyjamas to place my stethoscope on his back. The sound of air through his lungs was accompanied by a quiet hissing sound, like sizzling fat. The sound of pneumonia. In his case, pneumonia probably caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going outside, then I\u2019ll phone you about what happens next,\u201d I told him. I picked up the clear bag with my stethoscope, oxygen sensor and thermometer, and stepped out, trying to hold central to my awareness and every action that there was virus on the walls, the door handle, my gloves and all my equipment.</p> <p>Out on the doorstep I gulped down the fresh air, then it was back to the rigmarole: topmost layer of gloves off and into a waste bag. Still wearing my underlayer of gloves, I took a chloride wipe and began to clean all the equipment \u2013 stethoscope, oxygen sensor, thermometer \u2013 and placed them into yet another clear plastic bag, ready for the next patient. The wipe went into the waste, then my apron. Next it was the visor\u2019s turn to get cleaned, and afterwards I placed it on the ground to dry. Then undergloves off, mask off, the clinical waste bag tied off and sealed, and back into the car.</p> <p>With the donning and doffing of PPE, and cleaning all the equipment, home visits now take far longer than they used to. I\u2019d be happier wearing a gown in addition to the gloves, mask and visor \u2013 it would better protect my arms, trunk and legs from droplets carrying the virus. But for now, there are no gowns available. A few days earlier, I had looked through the supplies of gloves and masks that had been delivered to my practice from central government stores: the masks were stamped with the name of a Canadian company, manufactured in China, and distributed by another in Germany. My gloves were all manufactured in Malaysia or Vietnam. If we\u2019re to get this equipment to the people who need it in the UK, we need manufacturers here \u2013 and production should have started in January.</p> <p>From the car I dialled the man\u2019s number again. All those years learning about personal consultation styles, and now I was breaking bad news by telephone from a car parked outside. As I waited for him to pick up, I glanced at the car mirror. My forehead was stamped with Car 2 in reverse, transferred in sweat from the visor headband.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s likely that you have coronavirus,\u201d I heard myself say, \u201cand that it\u2019s affecting your lungs, causing pneumonia. That\u2019s why you feel so breathless.\u201d Silence. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange for an ambulance to come and take you to hospital.\u201d</p> <p>I waited. His breathing was audible. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to ask?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long for?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Heading on to see the next patient, I passed the ambulance I\u2019d just called, on its way to collect him. The paramedics both waved, and I waved back \u2013 one, who wasn\u2019t yet wearing his mask, smiled. One of the few consolations of this pandemic is its grim camaraderie, a new fellowship among the fear.</p> <p>Later on I walked along from the GP clinic to the A&amp;E department to see how my patient had fared. One of the nurses called up his x-ray on the screen: the lungs should be light and spongy, the blackness of air clear against the white of the ribs, diaphragm and heart. But an \u201cinfiltrate\u201d had clouded his lungs. Where there should have been a black void, there were speckled galaxies of white.</p> <p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d the nurse asked me.</p> <p>\u201cMid-50s,\u201d I said. \u201cLike the prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOverweight?\u201d she asked. I nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all like that, up in ITU,\u201d she said. \u201cStrange days.\u201d We paused together for a moment in silence in front of the x-ray, before she had to attend to another patient, as did I.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Throughout April, I watched maps online showing the number of cases growing worldwide, with red dots bloomed into wide circles, like spores in a petri dish. Between 1 April and 15 April they doubled from 1 million to 2 million; deaths tripled from 50,000 to 150,000. Epidemiological studies <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52055546\" title=\"\">were published</a> showing that without limitation on its spread, the coronavirus has the potential to cause 30 million deaths, comparable to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\" title=\"\">Spanish flu of a century ago</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the lack of testing in the UK, even among healthcare staff, was becoming alarming. One of my colleagues came down with Covid-19 symptoms on a Friday, couldn\u2019t get tested until Monday, and by Wednesday evening we were still waiting for her result. Five days from symptoms to result, five days of not having a GP working. Five days, as well, of the GP\u2019s husband \u2013 a hospital doctor \u2013 not working, as he, too, had to self-isolate.</p> <p>If doctors or nurses receive a negative result, and feel well enough, they can go straight back to work. But there are doubts about the effectiveness of the test \u2013 even high-quality studies estimate that it\u2019s accurate <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/comparative-accuracy-of-oropharyngeal-and-nasopharyngeal-swabs-for-diagnosis-of-covid-19/\" title=\"\">only about 70% of the time</a>. We\u2019re just hoping that if there\u2019s insufficient virus in our throats and noses to detect, then there\u2019s insufficient to pass it on to others.</p> <p>As hospital cases plateaued in April, the virus began to take hold in nursing homes. There are two nursing homes on my practice\u2019s patch in Edinburgh; one had an outbreak affecting four or five patients, but it was swiftly and professionally contained. None of the residents died of it. The staff reassured me they had sufficient PPE. I began hearing stories of nursing homes that weren\u2019t so lucky \u2013 that had seen every resident infected, and a quarter had died. I also heard of homes that had no protective masks or gloves.</p> <p>At the same time, it was obvious that, in the wider community, lockdown was helping slow transmission. The numbers in ITUs (intensive therapy units) dropped consistently from a peak around 9 April. We GPs were sent a message of praise from the hospital, thanking us for doing so well at keeping people away. But it was becoming harder to field patient frustration at the shutting down of much of what the NHS used to do. No outpatient clinics, no colonoscopies, no sexual health services, no routine x-rays \u2013 so much has been put on pause. Even cancer services have been stripped back to essentials, and many routine lab tests have been cancelled to create capacity for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that though the lockdown has slashed transmission, it is provoking a silent epidemic of despair. Panic attacks, sleeplessness and plunging moods are all difficulties GPs are encountering daily \u2013 tough conversations to have at the best of times, but even tougher on the phone. Within our area of the city, we already know of suicides triggered by bankruptcies and business closures; and of marriages breaking down. Alcohol-induced injuries are up, as are injuries from assaults. Between 23 March and 12 April, there were 16 deaths from domestic violence in the UK \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\" title=\"\">more than triple</a> the still-shocking figure from last year. A police officer friend told me that domestic abuse support lines were experiencing a 30-40% increase in traffic. <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\" title=\"\">Samaritans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.childline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Childline</a>, too, were receiving high volumes of calls. A domestic abuse hotline for NHS workers had been inaugurated \u2013 intended to support both health workers at risk, and to offer advice should they suspect patients of being abused. When I check routine blood tests on my patients, I have been seeing new flares of liver irritation, which suggest rising levels of alcoholism.</p> <p>Many whose mental health was already tenuous before the crisis now feel unmoored, desperate and angry. The inescapable uncertainty that comes with the disease is particularly difficult to live with, and I\u2019m grateful, as a GP, to at least have reliable work. For those whose jobs offered identity and a sense of purpose, being furloughed has been a tragedy exacerbated by forced disconnection from friends and family. Many children, my own included, are missing the structure and social life of school, and every day I hear of more best-laid plans being added to the bonfire of this global crisis.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The UK maintains relatively few critical care beds in comparison with its neighbours. Before this crisis, there were around 40 ITU beds in Lothian for a population of 850,000.. Now that number has been increased to 113. With the new critical beds added, the UK is at roughly the same levels as pre-pandemic Italy and Bulgaria. </p> <p>The peak of Covid-19 bed occupancy in Lothian\u2019s ITUs was on 9 April, when there were 42. Ten days later there were 30, and they stand now at 11. A friend who is an ITU consultant in the Midlands told me that only four in 10 of his patients who are intubated due to Covid-19 survive it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f10a6747074c55fc847d15aaf213f1fa1fa26c1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f10a6747074c55fc847d15aaf213f1fa1fa26c1e/0_0_3500_2223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boarded up restaurant in Edinburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boarded up restaurant in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Sunday 10 May, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\" title=\"\">relaxed some lockdown measures</a> for England, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland kept their own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\" title=\"\">stricter measures</a> in place. Johnson encouraged a return to work, but asked people to avoid public transport, and said that driving to work and to places for exercise would be permitted. I asked my ITU friend what he thought of the speech. \u201cNo mention of facemasks in public? Everybody in their cars? I think it\u2019s an experiment at the expense of the English,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On 7 May, the first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, had extended our lockdown, shortly after recommending the use of \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d on public transport, in shops and in places where physical distancing isn\u2019t possible. On 10 May, she announced that she had \u201casked the UK government not to deploy their \u2018stay alert\u2019 advertising campaign in Scotland\u201d. The message in Scotland, Sturgeon said, was not \u201cstay at home if you can\u201d, but \u201cstay at home full stop\u201d.</p> <p>The lockdown has already had profound social and economic consequences. It\u2019s likely that unemployment is going to soar this summer, and unless robust housing legislation is put in place, so will evictions. On my occasional work at the <a href=\"https://www.edinburghaccesspractice.scot.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Access Practice</a>, a GP clinic providing health services for Edinburgh\u2019s homeless population, I\u2019ve seen how they\u2019re preparing for a surge in need.</p> <p>In late March, the Scottish government, public health officials, charities and local authorities came together to mitigate the worst of the pandemic\u2019s effects on homeless people, with an initiative brokered by the charities <a href=\"https://www.streetwork.org.uk/\">Streetwork</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bethanychristiantrust.com/\">Bethany Trust</a>. By the evening of 24 March, 80 of the city\u2019s rough sleepers had moved into rooms in one of the city\u2019s empty hotels. With homeless shelters closing to minimise the spread of Covid-19, another hotel was opened as a temporary night shelter. Mobile outreach clinics were set up in each hotel, and rapid detox and methadone programmes initiated for those who needed them.</p> <p>I was due at the outreach clinic in one of the hotels last week, but just before attending, I came down with a viral headache. I felt weak, nauseated and feverish, so instead of going to the clinic I went to a test centre, where a knitting needle of a swab was plunged into the depths of my nose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/were-clearing-the-decks-a-gp-on-watching-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfold\">'We're clearing the decks': a GP on watching the coronavirus pandemic unfold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While waiting for the result, I phoned Rankin Barr, the service manager of Streetwork, to arrange a visit to the outreach clinic, and asked him about the effects of the lockdown. \u201cThe people presenting for emergency shelter are not your traditional rough sleepers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are coming from domestic problems, relationship breakdowns \u2013 with lockdown they can\u2019t stay with family, can\u2019t go to B&amp;Bs.\u201d We spoke of how much had been done so far \u2013 of the rapid setting up of clinics, of food provision, immigration advice and vaccination programmes, and how the city council was even now procuring more emergency accommodation for the emerging social crisis. The calamity of the pandemic has triggered a new attitude and approach to the city\u2019s chronic housing shortage. \u201cThis virus has changed everything, but there\u2019s an opportunity from now to do things differently,\u201d Barr told me. \u201cThe city and public health authorities are completely on board. We just can\u2019t lose all the vital work that\u2019s been done.\u201d</p> <p>My result came through: negative. I felt better, and will be able to visit the outreach clinic later this week. On the phone recently, I asked one of the doctors organising treatment for the homeless, John Budd, how many cases he\u2019d had to deal with. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lucky so far \u2013 unbelievably, there has only been one confirmed case. That\u2019s perhaps symbolic of just how marginalised the homeless are from society. But when it enters this relatively closed community, it will spread like wildfire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this virus is like Voldemort,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWe know it\u2019s out there, we just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming back.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Retirement is treating Pat C Rollo well. Just weeks after the coronavirus pandemic closed his workplace for good, he has moved into a modern apartment in south Florida and enjoys long, leisurely walks watching the yachts on the Intracoastal Waterway before heading home for a nap. He even has a new name \u2013 Lambo, short for Lamborghini \u2013 as a reminder of the fast-paced industry in which he once worked.</p> <p>It was a swift, and fortunate, transformation for a racing greyhound who never distinguished himself in 97 outings over 20 months under the Rollo moniker, yet always seemed to enjoy the thrill of chasing an electric hare around the track at the Daytona Beach Racing and Card Club.</p> <p>When Daytona\u2019s owners, starved of paying customers due to the Covid-19 lockdown, brought down the shutters on 20 March after 71 years of live greyhound racing, Lambo and 600 other greyhounds suddenly found themselves not just out of work, but instantly homeless. Thanks to a hastily scrambled caravan of volunteers from the Awesome Greyhound Adoptions agency willing to drive the 420-mile round trip from Boynton Beach, several dozen dogs traveled south to temporary foster homes or, as in Lambo\u2019s case, permanent new digs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"90061b0602caa6c0417a2ea31afe29b03a805a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90061b0602caa6c0417a2ea31afe29b03a805a6f/0_60_591_1167/506.jpg\" alt=\"Pat C Rollo, aka Lambo,\" width=\"506\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat C Rollo, aka Lambo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Portela family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re keeping each other going,\u201d says Lambo\u2019s new owner, Courtney Portela, 38, a bartender from Boynton who also lost her job in the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m helping him out by showing him a good new life, and he\u2019s helping me out by keeping me motivated at a time when everything\u2019s up in the air,\u201d she says of the three-and-a-half-year-old she calls her \u201c45mph couch potato\u201d.</p> <p>Portela saw on the news that Florida\u2019s greyhound tracks were closing because of the pandemic and that dogs were in need of homes, but that doesn\u2019t reflect the magnitude of the challenge that has befallen the state\u2019s network of adoption agencies almost instantaneously.</p> <p>Other long-established greyhound racing tracks in Naples and Sanford closed permanently in short order of Daytona, the former having soldiered on with televised races but no spectators for several weeks before bowing to the inevitable. Meanwhile, circuits in West Palm Beach, St Petersburg and Jacksonville suspended operations indefinitely with their futures uncertain. It left 1,500 greyhounds, by many estimates, in need of immediate rehoming. Roughly another 3,000 are still in kennels at the remaining three venues, all of which must close by law at the end of the year anyway when Florida becomes the 41st state to outlaw commercial dog racing.</p> <p>In truth, the popularity of a wagering activity legalized in 1931 as a mechanism to replenish state coffers depleted by the Great Depression has been declining for years. The anti-racing group Grey2K USA says gambling revenues dropped 57 % from 2006 to 2016, spectatorship has dwindled and a state that once attracted cultural icons such as Frank Sinatra and Babe Ruth to dog race meetings, boasted 20 tracks in its late-1980s heyday and still had 11 tracks two years ago, is down to its final three.</p> <p>Even so, Amendment 13, the 2018 ballot initiative that ended dog racing by a two-to-one majority, and which was reaffirmed by a federal judge last month, allowed for an orderly, rolling program of closures by January 2021. The intention was to allow the volunteer groups time to absorb the dogs instead of being overwhelmed all at once, but coronavirus has upended that situation.</p> <p>\u201cWith tracks closing earlier than expected, it\u2019s a perfect storm of greyhounds needing homes at one of the worst times in US history,\u201d said Dennis Tyler, president of Greyhound Pet Adoptions of Central Florida. \u201cFortunately most of the groups in Florida scattered dogs across the country to different groups that could take them and start the adoption process, but Florida is saturated with greyhounds as far as local adoptions.\u201d</p> <p>Rescue groups hastily assembled teams of volunteers to drive hundreds of dogs to sister agencies in California, Tennessee and New England. Others, from the Naples track in particular, will race on for the time being, in Arkansas or at Iowa\u2019s sole remaining track in Dubuque, before eventually being rehomed as pets.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a much better place to be doing it,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cYou can disperse them to Canada and northern states.

  "<p>At three minutes to midnight four weeks into NSW\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, I decided to dye my hair pink.</p> <p><strong> </strong>It turns out a lot of other people had the same idea, even celebrities: 90s superstars like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9781880/light-pink-hair-color-celebrities-in-quarantine\">did it</a>, as did the rising musical star <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_C6hy1B_Pt/\">Dua Lipa</a>. Even Cardi B tried on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_8lGyYAJBt/\">a pink wig</a>.</p> <p>So I had a problem. The <a href=\"https://www.priceline.com.au/l-oreal-paris-colorista-washout-pink-hair-80-ml\">temporary pink dye from L\u2019Oreal Paris </a>that<strong> </strong>I\u2019d<strong> </strong>usually see at my local Priceline and Chemist Warehouse was sold out, and couldn\u2019t be ordered online due to \u2018low/unknown stock\u201d.</p> <p> After several Google searches, I bought a bottle of <a href=\"https://www.muvo.com.au/products/ultra-rose-shampoo\">Ultra Rose Shampoo</a> from the Australian brand Muvo. It promised to temporarily dye my hair a shade of pink. The intensity would depend on how long I left it in. Although it hasn\u2019t sold out, Muvo\u2019s business development manager, Christa Silvia, says it has sold more over the past few weeks but has also increased its marketing.</p> <p>Several hairdressers confirm they\u2019ve seen a surge in clients dyeing their hair bright shades of blue, pink and purple while stuck in home isolation.</p> <p> Unnatural hair colours might seem like a youthful folly, but Blake James, owner of salon Mr Burrows in Sydney, says lockdown is the first chance many of his older clients have had to try something new. At home they aren\u2019t bucking their workplaces\u2019 strict dress codes.</p> <p>The forced period at home has also given first-time dyers the chance to \u201cget confident with the change themselves, before having to be confident with it in front of other people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwRJVVwgoIT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

She had no intention of hiding it. </p> <p>Worried about how her university students would cope with transitioning to online classes, Joyce thought she would \u201cgive them something just to come in and break the ice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo I came into class, they looked at me and said, \u2018Oh my god, what have you done with your hair!?\u2019 It really did achieve its purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Although Joyce says she \u201cnever really wanted to go pink before\u201d, she did have a pink-tinted conditioner in her cupboard. Using it has done more than pique her students\u2019 attention. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s changing me. I tend to be an extreme introvert and quite frankly, I don\u2019t want the lockdown to end,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut I just think it\u2019s fabulous. I want to dress up and go out for the first time in \u2026 years.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Joyce, I had been thinking about dyeing my hair since I was 18. Going pink was the reward I dangled in front of myself to get through every law school exam, a metaphorical way of liberating my future self from being an exhausted, regimented student. But I never did it.</p> <p>In popular culture, a major hair change is often precipitated by a major life change (usually a breakup). Blake confirms there\u2019s an element of truth to this. A lot of his clients ask for a dramatic transformation after switching jobs or ending relationships.</p> <p>\u201cI had long hair down to my shoulders,\u201d he confesses. \u201cAnd I just shaved it off three weeks ago \u2026 I have a staff of 17 people.

  "<h2><strong>What started \u2018Obamagate\u2019?</strong></h2> \n<p>On Friday, former US president Barack Obama expressed disquiet at the justice department dropping charges against Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired in early 2017 for lying about conversations with the Russian ambassador. On a recording obtained by Yahoo News, Obama warned that the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/obama-leaked-conversation-us-rule-of-law-at-risk-flynn-case-dropped\"> \u201crule of law is at risk\u201d</a>. He also described Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>So Trump took the moral high ground and kept a dignified silence?</strong></h2> \n<p>Not quite. He spent Mother\u2019s Day diving into the rightwing fever swamps and unleashing a barrage of tweets and retweets assailing his predecessor. One said simply \u201cOBAMAGATE!\u201d (the suffix \u201cgate\u201d is a frequently used play on the Watergate scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon).</p> \n<p>Another linked to a post that declared, \u201cBarack Hussain Obama is the first Ex-President to ever speak against his successor, which was long tradition of decorum and decency.\u201d Trump added: \u201cHe got caught, OBAMAGATE!\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">Trump claims Obama committed 'biggest political crime in American history'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Got caught doing what, exactly?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump also retweeted Buck Sexton, a rightwing podcaster who asserted that \u201cthe outgoing president used his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. The president then added his own commentary: \u201cThe biggest political crime in American history, by far!\u201d</p> \n<p>In other remarks on Thursday last week, Trump claimed without evidence that Flynn had been targeted by the Obama administration in an attempt to take down Trump himself. He bandied around terms such as \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201chuman scum\u201d.</p> \n<p>Flynn, a retired general, pleaded guilty to making false statements in a charge brought by then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He now insists he did not lie and wants to back out of the plea.</p> \n<p>Trump and his supporters have seized on recently disclosed FBI documents from interviews with Flynn, claiming they show he was the victim of \u201cdirty cops\u201d. One handwritten note from the FBI\u2019s then-director of counterintelligence said: \u201cWhat\u2019s our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Can this really be pinned on Obama?</strong></h2> \n<p>A fact check by the Associated Press concluded: \u201cIt is true that the investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, and into Russia in particular, began during the Obama administration. But it continued well into Trump\u2019s own administration. The investigation into Flynn was taken over by a special counsel who was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, Trump\u2019s own deputy attorney general.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe internal FBI correspondence that has emerged in the last two weeks also doesn\u2019t reveal agents saying that the goal of the investigation was to take down a president.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>So what exact crime is Trump accusing Obama of committing?</strong></h2> \n<p>The president himself does not seem to know. \u201c\u2018Obamagate\u2019,\u201d he ruminated in the White House rose garden on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time. It\u2019s been going on from before I even got elected. And it\u2019s a disgrace that it happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked by a Washington Post reporter for the second time to name Obama\u2019s exact offence, Trump replied cryptically: \u201cYou know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clear as mud, then.</p> \n<h2>Could this be a distraction from something?</h2> \n<p><br>Some critics believe Trump is desperately trying to deflect attention from his confused and faltering response to the pandemic, as the US death toll tops 80,000 and the economy suffers the worst job losses since the Great Depression. They could also be a way of undermining Obama\u2019s vice president, Joe Biden, whom Trump will face in November\u2019s presidential election.</p> \n<p>And they are indicative of a longstanding obsession. Trump effectively began his political career by pushing the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the US and therefore should not be eligible for the presidency. He has devoted huge efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/donald-trump-barack-obama-legacy\">undoing his predecessor\u2019s legacy</a>, for example attempting to kill the Affordable Care Act, pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accords and slashing environmental and other regulations.</p>",

Those are great developments.</strong> But unfortunately they do not mean that America\u2019s testing regime is on par with other countries. </p> \n  <p>For one thing, the United States is a huge country, with a population about seven times that of South Korea. Many more tests need to be conducted here. It\u2019s also telling that the White House says that less than 10% of tests are positive. Does that mean that a smaller proportion of Americans are positive \u2013 or that the US is testing the wrong people? </p> \n  <p>Unlike South Korea, Vietnam, China and other countries that have had success at containing the virus, the United States has not, in most places, stood up consistent contact tracing for positive cases \u2013 meaning that the country has a blind spot to outbreaks, and that the selection of patients tested is relatively random. </p> \n  <p>As for the death rate in the United States versus Germany and other places \u2013 unfortunately, unlike Germany and other places, the number of confirmed deaths in the United States, a number the US appears to track less carefully than Germany, is still climbing.</p> \n  <p><strong>If you go hunting you don\u2019t brag about how many times you shot \u2013 you brag about how many ducks you bagged. Trump is bragging about shots fired. </strong>And his numbers of tests do not seem to represent numbers of people tested \u2013 repeat tests for certain people, such as health care workers and other people on the front lines (and people in positions of power in Washington) make the per capita number in the United States larger than it is in fact. In fact, most people do not have access to testing through the workplace, and quality daily testing is not in reach for most of America. </p> \n  <p>Finally, unlike other countries, the United States has not paired its testing program with a supported isolation program. That means that outbreaks can accelerate undetected, as health officials mostly are not searching the network of contacts of positive cases, and people in contact with positive cases, who could be asymptomatic carriers, <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T21:01:46.580Z\">at 10.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb9bb638f080c72745390cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T20:57:09.092Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For a second time, Trump was asked why the White House staff is able to be tested daily when that is still not available for the American people.

Alexander will chair a key Senate hearing on Tuesday remotely, just as Fauci and fellow doctors Robert Redfield and Stephen Hahn will testify before him remotely.
