There has been a lot of progress in ramping up testing capabilities, with pretty much all countries on the continent now theoretically able to test their citizens for the disease. As elsewhere however, there are shortages in the key chemicals needed for the tests, and that\u2019s causing problems.</p> \n  <p>This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the highest number of cases and has adopted a strategy based on aggressive screening and testing to try to stamp out any clusters and outbreaks of the disease before it can spread.</p> \n  <p>Officials in South Africa have yet to decide whether to extend the lockdown in South Africa, now in its third week.

One possibility may be to lift some restrictions but maintain strict rules to limit social distancing, but, they say, nothing is decided.</p> \n  <p>Other governments across the continent will face similar decisions in coming days and weeks.

The other person who runs or cycles just behind this leading person in the slipstream then moves through that cloud of droplets.</p> \n   <p>The slipstream is the zone that arises right behind a person when they are walking or cycling, and which pulls the air a bit along with this moving person, as it were.</p> \n   <p>Cyclists like to position themselves in the slipstream of others to reduce their air resistance. But someone who walks or runs also has such a slipstream. We have seen that no matter how that zone forms, droplets end up in that air stream.

  "<p>Brown hares and chickens were revered as gods rather than reared for food when they were first introduced to Britain in the iron age, archaeological analysis suggests.</p> <p>In research that shows modern-day Easter festivals were not the first to celebrate chicks and bunnies, a team of experts from the universities of Exeter, Leicester and Oxford have found evidence that the animals were buried with care and intact in the period that preceded the Roman invasion of Britain.</p> <p>Historical evidence suggests Britons of the period associated the animals with deities and considered them too special to eat. Commentarii de<em><strong> </strong></em>Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar\u2019s firsthand account of the Gallic wars, says \u201cthe Britons consider it contrary to divine law to eat the hare, the chicken or the goose. They raise these, however, for their own amusement or pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Radiocarbon analysis of hare and chicken skeletons from a number of sites in Hampshire and Herefordshire backs up that assertion, showing that the two species were introduced simultaneously to Britain between the fifth and third centuries BC. Excavation has previously revealed the animals had been carefully buried without being butchered.</p> <p>Prof Naomi Sykes from the University of Exeter, who is leading the research, said: \u201c\u201cEaster is an important British festival, yet none of its iconic elements are native to Britain. The idea that chickens and hares initially had religious associations is not surprising as cross-cultural studies have shown that exotic things and animals are often given supernatural status.</p> <p>\u201cHistorical accounts have suggested chickens and hares were too special to be eaten and were instead associated with deities \u2013 chickens with an iron age god akin to Roman Mercury, and hares with an unknown female hare goddess. The religious association of hares and chickens endured throughout the Roman period.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, archaeological evidence shows that as their populations increased, they were increasingly eaten, and hares were even farmed as livestock. Rather than being buried as individuals, hare and chicken remains were then disposed of as food waste.\u201d</p> <p>The cross-disciplinary academic team, whose objective is to investigate the origins of Easter traditions and the animals that have come to be associated with it, has previously revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/18/ben-fur-romans-brought-rabbits-to-britain-experts-discover\">the first rabbits were introduced</a> to Britain not by the Normans, as was previously thought, but by the Romans, who arrived in the first century AD.</p> <p>Hares and chickens were both farmed for food during the Roman occupation of Britain, but in the economic collapse following the Roman withdrawal in 410AD rabbits became locally extinct and the populations of chickens and brown hares crashed.</p> <p>Historical and archaeological evidence show rabbits were reintroduced to Britain as an elite food by the Normans in the 11th century. Rabbits were increasingly common in the 19th century, probably contributing to their replacement of the hare as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/apr/23/easter-pagan-roots\">the Easter </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/apr/23/easter-pagan-roots\">bunny</a> when the festival\u2019s traditions were reinvigorated by the Victorians.</p>",

this will provide a short-term source of additional liquidity to the government if needed to smooth its cashflows and support the orderly functioning of markets, through the period of disruption from

  "<p>Coronavirus is man\u2019s work. At least, that appears to be the government\u2019s assessment of it, for in the three weeks of daily Downing Street press briefings, not once has a woman minister been allowed out to be front-of-house compere. Priti Patel, Liz Truss and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey have become all but invisible. Missing in action. They might as well not exist.</p> <p>For the third time this week it was Dominic Raab \u2013 the de facto prime minister while Boris Johnson is in intensive care \u2013 who did the business for the government. And, to be fair, he\u2019s getting visibly better at it. He looks less unstable and more the man who can easily see out 24 hours of close police interrogation over unsolved missing persons cases. Though he might have struggled if anyone had questioned him about the disappearance of the home secretary.</p> <p>It also helped that the foreign secretary didn\u2019t have any news, other than the grim daily death statistics, to impart. So he could stick to doing what he knows best, which is spilling out a random series of words, only some of which amount to fully coherent sentences. At some point in his career, the black-belt martial arts specialist is going to have to realise that the brain is also a muscle. Coming up with lines like \u201cWe are focusing on the things we need to focus on\u201d may sound impressive at cabinet meetings, but doesn\u2019t translate well to those of us who speak human.</p> <p>Still, after Raab had spent the best part of five minutes telling everyone to stay at home for Easter \u2013 the No 10 lectern had been helpfully updated with this new logo \u2013 it did become clear why Patel might have dodged a bullet by being excluded from this briefing. Because Raab went on to deliver a long thank-you to all the NHS staff, care workers, hospital cleaners, delivery drivers and supermarket staff who were keeping people alive and the country running: the very people who would never have been let into the country if the home secretary had been allowed to implement her points-based immigration system a few years earlier. For Priti, ideology is all. She didn\u2019t vote to take back control to have an immigrant clean a hospital floor or operate a supermarket checkout.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know who the key workers really are,\u201d said Raab. Indeed we did. And to the surprise of many Tory MPs, they weren\u2019t the hedge-fund managers or party donors they had imagined. Here Raab\u2019s legendary ability to dissociate came in handy. Because back in 2010, he, Patel and several other leading Tories wrote a book, Britannia Unchained, in which they advocated increased austerity, doubling down on laissez-faire economics and branded the Brits as some of the idlest people in the world.</p> <p>But some things don\u2019t change. Asked if the government might care to show its gratitude to the key workers with a cash bonus once the pandemic was over, Raab became evasive. Money, what money? Wasn\u2019t it enough for these workers to have saved the country before being asked to leave? At times like these, Dom could almost be a double for David Brent. \u201cThe bad news is that some of you will lose your jobs. On a more positive note, the good news is that I\u2019ve been promoted \u2013 so every cloud, eh?\u201d</p> <p>Not that Raab seemed overly keen to emphasise the extent of his new powers as de facto prime minister. If anything, he tried to downplay them, suggesting that all cabinet decisions were now more like tantric meditation sessions. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the answers provided by that process can be less than crystal clear. Raab was as evasive on what the government strategy for determining the timing of the end of the partial lockdown might be \u2013 journalists have long since given up asking for an actual date \u2013 as he was on why the government had had to increase its overdraft with the Bank of England. Where was Rishi when you needed him?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: how have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The biggest unanswered question, though, was the one that has been left hanging over every press conference. Why is Germany handling the crisis so much better than us? Some projections suggest the German death rate from the coronavirus will be about 10% of ours. What\u2019s their secret? Raab, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance all just shrugged their shoulders. They had no idea. Or none fit for public consumption.</p> <p>You could almost sense the desperation in Dom\u2019s voice as he pleaded one last time for calm over Easter. Being in charge isn\u2019t nearly so much fun as he had imagined. He\u2019s missing Boris badly. Weirdly, I am too. At least with Boris you get some kind of hopeful bollocks. With Raab you just get bollocks. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.</p>",

  "<p>Northern Ireland authorities confirmed on Thursday that abortions can now be carried out in the province\u2019s hospitals, following threatened legal action by pro-choice groups.</p> <p>Health officials signalled that terminations could go ahead after allegations that local anti-choice politicians were stalling implementation of a ruling that provided for services to be introduced by the end of March.</p> <p>No such services had been put in place as of Thursday, prompting pro-choice groups to plan legal action. The Guardian understands that a woman seeking a termination and a doctor had been lined up to sue the health department for allegedly blocking the implementation of new legal abortion services.</p> <p>Abortion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/21/northern-ireland-set-to-legalise-abortion-and-same-sex-marriage\">became legal in Northern Ireland\u2019s hospitals in October</a> for terminations in most cases up to 12 weeks.

Pro-choice campaigners have argued that the regional assembly at Stormont has no powers to block or stall provisions for legal abortions because Westminster passed the legislation.</p> <p>It is understood that those behind the proposed legal action were going to raise claims in court that senior civil servants had told local health trusts that no abortion services could be put in place until the Stormont executive discussed the issue. They say the advice would have been exposed as misleading because it ignored the fact that the new law was already in place and imposed by Westminster regardless of what the executive did on the matter.</p> <p>The Department of Health at Stormont confirmed late on Thursday afternoon that services for lawful abortions were now being introduced.</p> <p>A spokesperson said that having received legal advice \u201cregistered medical professionals in Northern Ireland may now terminate pregnancies lawfully.\u201d They pointed out that the regulations require such terminations be carried out on Health and Social Care premises.</p> <p>The Department of Health also acknowledged that the coronavirus crisis had had an impact in its decision.</p> <p>Pro-choice organisations have argued that the so called \u201cescape valve\u201d of English clinics and hospitals, where thousands of Northern Irish women used to obtain terminations before the law was reformed last year, was closed because of Covid-19.</p> <p>They pointed out that the only route to clinics in Liverpool and Manchester is a freight ferry from Belfast to Birkenhead, which takes eight hours across the Irish Sea. Women who chose that option would also have virtually nowhere to stay, given that the coronavirus lockdown had forced hotels and guest houses to close.</p> <p>\u201cThe interim arrangements currently in place involve abortion services continuing to be provided in England, with no costs incurred by local women availing of these services. This arrangement has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the severe reduction in travel options,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>Alliance for Choice welcomed the department\u2019s apparent U-turn.</p> <p>Emma Campbell, AFC\u2019s co-convenor said: \u201cThe confirmation we have received today means that Northern Ireland health trusts will now provide early medical abortion in Northern Ireland. This will prevent hundreds of women and pregnant people from having to travel needlessly to clinics in England placing themselves at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell said confirmation was also needed that care beyond 12 weeks would also be available for those who need it as per the regulations. Northern Ireland also needed a telemedicine care programme for patients in crisis pregnancies and healthcare workers who are self-isolating.</p>",

Sadly, the claim is untrue. In caterpillars, partially formed adult structures \u2013 wings, antennae, legs \u2013 can be seen clearly before pupation, if the animal is dissected. This was demonstrated as early as 1665 by the Dutch entomologist Jan Swammerdam, and was decisive in convincing thinkers that the caterpillar and the butterfly are the same organism, rather than the butterfly emerging from the decay of a dead caterpillar. </p> <p>However, other insects do indeed show the mysterious metamorphosis Solnit describes \u2013 flies. In maggots, the future adult fly organs are merely tiny patches of tissue; they are assembled into their adult forms in the pupa in ways that are still the subject of scientific investigation.

His commitment to his profession was strengthened by his own illness. During his first year as an attending physician, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He survived, but it returned when he was 38. Both testicles were eventually removed \u2013 he called it \u201cthe mutilating surgery\u201d. Even so, he resolved to offer others the second chance that he himself received twice.</p> <p>This, and an incident when a man tried to kill Gabrin at his ER, choking him so that he \u201cstarted turning purple in the face\u201d, helped lead to Gabrin\u2019s unique professional philosophy. He described it in his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Back-Burnout-Frank-Gabrin-ebook/dp/B00EBUC5HQ\">book</a>, where he explained how medics can overcome burnout and feel greater compassion for their patients.</p> <p>A huge shift in his life came a few years ago, when at a nightclub he met Arnold Vargas, a Peruvian who had lived in the US for a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e13a16e69280d641ab57bb5a4b4bafb77d0a7bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e13a16e69280d641ab57bb5a4b4bafb77d0a7bc/0_252_1242_744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arnold Vargas and Frank Gabrin. \u2018I saw [Gabrin] the happiest with Angel,\u2019 said Soffer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arnold Vargas and Frank Gabrin. \u2018I saw [Gabrin] the happiest with Angel,\u2019 said Eddy Soffer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arnold Vargas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI saw [Gabrin] the happiest with \u00c1ngel,\u201d said Soffer, using Vargas\u2019s middle name, as Gabrin did. \u201cAll his fear dissipated and he became his true self.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it gave me a second chance,\u201d said Vargas, now 28. \u201cHe showed me the light \u2013 how beautiful my life can be.\u201d He had been miserable, in a rut, yet Gabrin pushed him to train in massage therapy and to apply for US citizenship. There was an age difference, but to Vargas, who<strong> </strong>felt enriched by Gabrin and his experiences, it was irrelevant. \u201cI was always thinking, \u2018I just want to make you happy,\u2019 and he did the same for me.\u201d</p> <p>They married in August 2019 at city hall in New York.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s not going to be this way forever\u2019</h2> <p>When infections in New York surged <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/hospital-stats-shed-best-light-on-exactly-when-novel-coronavirus-arrived-in-nyc/2335603/\">in March</a>, Gabrin posted a picture of ambulances crowding a hospital bay on Facebook. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Oh my God, this is the moment Armageddon happens,\u2019\u201d said Debra Vasalech Lyons, another old friend. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, it\u2019s still manageable, but it\u2019s not going to be this way forever.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/profile.html#profTab=0&amp;ID=330395&amp;loc=NEW%20YORK%2C%20NY&amp;lat=40.7143528&amp;lng=-74.0059731&amp;name=st%20john's%20episcopal&amp;Distn=19.4\">St</a><a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/profile.html#profTab=0&amp;ID=330395&amp;loc=NEW%20YORK%2C%20NY&amp;lat=40.7143528&amp;lng=-74.0059731&amp;name=st%20john's%20episcopal&amp;Distn=19.4\"> John\u2019s Episcopal</a> in Queens, one of two hospitals where Gabrin worked at the time, was among local facilities \u201cdealing with challenges around PPE\u201d, said the New York city council member Donovan Richards.

He told Lyons that he was attempting to wash an N95 mask to make it last several shifts, and that the only gloves available were too small for his hands and ripped.</p> <p>Lyons mailed him gloves in the correct size from Florida, where she lives, and ordered four gallons of hand sanitizer for him. On Facebook, Gabrin wrote about concocting his own sanitizer from vodka and aloe vera plants.</p> <p>The heads of the two emergency rooms where Gabrin worked both said they had sufficient supplies of protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cI know for one thing he wasn\u2019t speaking about a lack of PPE at St John\u2019s,\u201d said Dr Teddy Lee, the ER chairman there.</p> <p>\u201cIf for a second I thought that was our problem at East Orange I would tell you otherwise,\u201d said the ER chairman, Dr Alvaro Alban.</p> <p>On 25 March, when Gabrin arrived home, \u201che said, \u2018Baby, something bad happened tonight,\u2019\u201d Vargas recalled. A coronavirus patient with whom Gabrin formed a deep connection had passed away. Gabrin took a shower and cried, then he and Vargas offered a prayer for the person\u2019s soul.</p> <p>The next morning, a Thursday, they both had symptoms, and self-quarantined. \u201cIt was me using the same mask for four days in a row that infected me,\u201d he texted Lyons.

  "<p>Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, has warned that baseless \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are swirling around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> crisis following claims that America\u2019s official death toll from Covid-19 has been overstated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-live-trump-economy-unemployment-latest-updates\">Coronavirus US news: New York breaks its record for largest single-day Covid-19 death toll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fauci, who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, said he had seen unfounded conjecture attach itself to previous crises and dismissed the emerging idea, largely promoted by high-profile figures in rightwing media, that the US\u2019s Covid-19 death toll is being inflated by unrelated medical conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that that\u2019s the case at all,\u201d Fauci told NBC on Thursday. \u201cI think it falls under the category of something that\u2019s very unfortunate \u2013 these conspiracy theories that we hear about. Any time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\">official Centers for Disease Control (CDC) count</a>, by the end of Wednesday there had been 12,754 deaths in the US due to the Covid-19 virus, from a total of 395,011 people who have been confirmed as infected.</p> <p>The number of deaths has more than doubled over the past week, with New York continuing to be at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-live-trump-economy-unemployment-latest-updates\">heart</a> of the crisis after experiencing more infections than the whole of Spain, <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\">along with 4,000 deaths</a>. On Tuesday, 779 people died from the coronavirus in New York state, a one-day record. New Jersey also set a one-day record, with 275 deaths, while Louisiana announced 70 further deaths on that day, matching its worst daily toll.</p> <p>Public health experts have criticized a severe lack of planning by the Trump administration for the US becoming the global coronavirus hotspot, with a dearth of testing and equipment leading to hospitals being overwhelmed in places and states desperately scrambling to source ventilators, masks and gowns.</p> <p>But several media figures who are sympathetic to the president have started to question the official death toll, claiming it is being distorted for political purposes, by including in the statistics people dying of other causes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35a9bd7430318e60226deb6a97408416fee9dec0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35a9bd7430318e60226deb6a97408416fee9dec0/43_0_2379_2974/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tucker Carlson: \u2018When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tucker Carlson: \u2018When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a>\u2019s Brit Hume, who has previously tweeted that New York\u2019s \u201cfatality numbers are inflated\u201d, appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s late-night show on Tuesday to claim that any person with the virus is being counted as a Covid-19 death \u201cregardless of what else may be wrong\u201d. Carlson responded by saying, \u201cThere may be reasons people seek an inaccurate death count,\u201d adding: \u201cWhen journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u201d</p> <p>The rightwing radio host <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=007466294097402385199:m2ealvuxh1i&amp;q=https://www.theguardian.com/media/rush-limbaugh&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA4Ifk59voAhVRlXIEHdKGAeAQFjABegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1K2VCGcFQQhok9U4MRzbL-\">Rush Limbaugh</a>, who received the presidential medal of freedom from Trump, previously dismissed Covid-19 as similar to the \u201ccommon cold\u201d but changed tack recently to claim: \u201cIt\u2019s admittedly speculation, but \u2026 what if we are recording a bunch of deaths to coronavirus which really should not be chalked up to coronavirus?\u201d</p> <p>Trump regularly echoes theories espoused on Fox News and previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45521414\">dismissed</a> an official death toll of 3,000 people in Puerto Rico in the wake of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria. However, the president has yet to follow suit by questioning the Covid-19 figures, telling reporters that he thinks the states have been \u201cpretty accurate on the death count\u201d.</p> <p>According to Deborah Birx, the response coordinator on the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, a person who goes into hospital to be treated for Covid-19 and has a pre-existing condition that eventually causes them to die, this is counted as a Covid-19 death. This is slightly different from Hume\u2019s claim that someone dying for whatever reason is counted in the toll if they also have the coronavirus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm\">According to the CDC</a>, about 90% of people recently hospitalized with the coronavirus had at least one underlying medical condition. Black people and older people are disproportionately being hospitalized because of the virus, due to their increased rate of other conditions such as diabetes, hypertension or respiratory problems.</p> <p>It is in fact more likely that the coronavirus death toll is much higher than the official figures suggest, rather than it being inflated. The CDC has acknowledged its count is an \u201cunderestimation\u201d because it only tallies cases where Covid-19 has been confirmed in a laboratory test.</p> <p>Epidemiologists say a widespread lack of initial testing in the US means many people died without being counted, while even now some people who die at home or in nursing homes are not being tested for the virus.</p> <p>In New York City, more than 200 people are dying at home each day during the pandemic, according to city officials, a very much higher rate than usual. Bill de Blasio, New York City\u2019s mayor, has estimated that about 100 to 200 people a day who die at home in the city are not being included in the official virus death count. But the federal government insists the overall figures are largely accurate.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is more of a chance of missing some that are really coronavirus deaths that are not being counted,\u201d Fauci told NBC. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that number is significant enough to really substantially modify the trends that we are seeing, at all.\u201d</p>",

Hoey said water temperatures were above 30C. Usual temperatures were 27C and 28C.</p> <p>Corals bleach when they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Corals can recover if bleaching is only mild but if temperatures are very high for prolonged periods, corals can die.</p> <p>On 18 March, the US government\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program produced analysis of heat stress over the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea showing \u201csignificant amounts of heat stress\u201d.</p> <p>Townsville-based Dr William Skirving, of Coral Reef Watch, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAll the Australia reefs outside of the GBR will have had significant amounts of bleaching and many would have had significant amounts of mortality.\u201d</p> <p>Hoey said unlike reefs closer to shore in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the reefs in the Coral Sea were largely unaffected by pollution and fishing pressures.</p> <p>\u201cBut they are extremely susceptible to climate-induced stresses,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hoey said it was \u201chard to predict\u201d how many corals would die.</p> <p>These more remote reefs, he said, relied on their own corals to spawn and regrow, unlike the more tightly packed reefs of the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>He said: \u201cAny coral mortality will take a lot longer to recover from because there is hundreds of kilometres between these reefs and so there\u2019s unlikely to be a lot of connectivity between them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause of their isolation we have a lot to learn about these reefs, but we would still expect any fish and other organisms relying on the reefs to have been affected, particularly those relying on the corals for food and shelter.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Leck, WWF-Australia\u2019s head of oceans, said it was concerning that Coral Sea reefs had bleached because they were regarded as more resilient, as they benefitted from cool water upwelling and very clear water.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe fact they have bleached shows how extreme the underwater heatwave was in the Coral Sea. It shows how close we are to a tipping point with climate change and coral reefs.</p> <p>\u201cThe reefs in the Coral Sea are less well known, except amongst the high-end scuba diving community. They\u2019re a jewel in the crown for many divers around the world to come and visit.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Stephen, managing director of Mike Ball Dive Expeditions, has been visiting the Coral Sea reefs since 1995.</p> <p>He said there were still many amazing places to visit on the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea and \u201cgiven time\u201d he said he thought the reefs would recover.</p> <p>\u201cThese [Coral Sea] reefs rise from the sheer depths in very clear water,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge soft corals and sea fans dominate the depths and sharks abound, giving the diver a real sense of being in the abyss.</p> <p>\u201cYou can hang off a wall that\u2019s 1,000 metres and there you feel pretty insignificant. People enjoy the vastness of it.\u201d</p> <p>The 2020 bleaching was a \u201creset point for many of us\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe do need to step back and have a look at what we are doing to the planet.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t take a good look at ourselves and do something about our CO2 emissions then things will get out of our control. There is a chance to do something about this.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Adam Schlesinger, who has died aged 52 from complications of Covid-19 infection, found critical kudos and a dedicated following with his band Fountains of Wayne, released a string of albums of airy and wistful pop with the band Ivy, and achieved some of his highest-profile success with his work for theatre, films and TV.</p> <p>His first big breakthrough came with writing the title song to Tom Hanks\u2019s film That Thing You Do! (1996), the story of an American pop group trying to cope with Beatlemania. Schlesinger\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPMLG8mnCRM\">title song</a>, the solitary hit of the film\u2019s fictional band the Wonders, was not only zingingly catchy, but perfectly captured the sound and feel of pop music in 1964.</p> <p>\u201cI was definitely a Beatles freak as a kid, and for a long time I only listened to the Beatles,\u201d Schlesinger recalled. \u201c[The film\u2019s producers] said it should sound like an American band that was blown away by the Beatles and was trying to imitate them.\u201d Life imitated art, and That Thing You Do! reached No 41 on the Billboard chart and 22 in the UK. Schlesinger was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for best original song.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/01/adam-schlesinger-fountains-of-wayne-dead-coronavirus\">Singer Adam Schlesinger, of Fountains of Wayne, dead at 52 of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This coincided with the early days of Fountains of Wayne. Schlesinger, playing bass, formed the band with the singer and guitarist Chris Collingwood, whom he had first met when they both attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. They were named after a lawn ornament store in Wayne, New Jersey, a clue to Schlesinger\u2019s keen eye for the banal minutiae of American life. His songs would take in black humour (\u201che was killed by a cellular phone explosion\u201d), the love lives of TV news anchors, the glamour of Hollywood as viewed from lowly Hackensack, New Jersey, and the American dream of social climbing (\u201cSeth Shapiro got his law degree / He moved to Brooklyn from Schenectady, \u201993\u201d).</p> <p>The group signed to Atlantic and released their self-titled debut album in 1996. The sleek and infectious single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmqswLKKYyU\">Radiation Vibe</a> reached the Top 20 on the US alternative chart, but major sales eluded them. After their second album, Utopia Parkway (1999), also flopped, despite enthusiastic reviews, Atlantic dropped them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eada7343d64cc2f526b5f90bf8981526792a1a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eada7343d64cc2f526b5f90bf8981526792a1a7/39_197_4229_2536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Schlesinger, left, with Fountains of Wayne bandmembers Chris Collingwood, Jody Porter and Brian Young, in Brussels, 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Schlesinger, left, with Fountains of Wayne bandmembers Chris Collingwood, Jody Porter and Brian Young, in Brussels, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was not until 2003 that they made a new album, now with S-Curve records. This was Welcome Interstate Managers, which gave the group their most successful single, Stacy\u2019s Mom, sung from the viewpoint of a teenage boy infatuated with his girlfriend\u2019s mother. A deliberate homage to the Boston band the Cars, it made No 21 on the US pop chart and 11 in the UK, but made its biggest impact with its video for MTV, which referenced the teen movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High and featured a titillating performance as \u201cMom\u201d by the model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/mar/12/weekend7.weekend1\">Rachel Hunter</a>. The song earned two Grammy nominations.</p> <p>This was the peak of the group\u2019s visibility, even though Traffic and Weather (2007) found them breaching the US Top 100 album chart for the first time, and their last outing, Sky Full of Holes (2011), reached 37. The album was a struggle to make, owing to friction between Schlesinger and Collingwood, and spelled the end of the group.</p> <p>Born in New York City, Adam was the son of Barbara (known as Bobbi, nee Bernthal), a publicist, and Stephen Schlesinger, an executive at the grant-making John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. He grew up in Manhattan and then Montclair, New Jersey, where he attended Montclair high school. At Williams College, he earned a BA in philosophy.</p> <p>He played in several bands with Collingwood before they split up after graduation, Schlesinger moving back to New York. He first met up with Andy Chase in 1991 after answering his newspaper ad for a songwriting partner, which paved the way for the formation in 1994 of the trio Ivy, which ran in parallel with Fountains of Wayne. The band\u2019s third member was the Parisian Dominique Durand, who had never sung before but slotted in perfectly on vocals.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZLfasMPOU4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Video for Stacy\u2019s Mom, by Fountains of Wayne, 2003</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ivy released six albums between 1994 and 2011, building a committed following with their mix of alluring indie-pop with a distinctly British influence, as well as a hint of French exotica.

They also struck up a rapport with the film-makers the Farrelly Brothers, who used their music in There\u2019s Something About Mary (1998) and Me, Myself &amp; Irene (2000).</p> <p>Schlesinger managed to slip in a quick stint with Tinted Windows, a band which included the former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, Hanson\u2019s Taylor Hanson and Cheap Trick\u2019s drummer Bun E Carlos and released an album in 2009.</p> <p>He enjoyed more film-related success with his contributions to the soundtrack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/24/culture.reviews1\">Josie and the Pussycats</a> (2001) and the Hugh Grant-Drew Barrymore vehicle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/09/comedy.romance\">Music and Lyrics</a> (2007), for which he wrote the masterly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qrkapxFihM\">Way Back Into Love</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/02/fountains-of-wayne-adam-schlesinger-coronavirus\">Fountains of Wayne's Adam Schlesinger: a bona fide pop genius</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With David Javerbaum, he wrote the music for the musical Cry-Baby (also 2007).

She had her first big hits playing<strong> Beverly Marsh</strong> in Stephen King\u2019s 2017 thriller, It, and a younger Amy Adams in Sharp Objects in 2018. The following year, she landed the lead in Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase.</p> <p>Lillis was seven when her stepdad first asked her to star in his class film project. But it wasn\u2019t until she was in high school, finishing the filming of It \u2013 her first feature movie \u2013 that she finally figured out she wanted to act long-term.</p> <p>Now she is starring the Netflix adaptation of Charles Forsman\u2019s I Am Not Okay With This.

If we were able to meet in person as planned, we would have gone to Lillis\u2019s favorite Brooklyn diner. She would have ordered pancakes or waffles and a side of sausages, and a vanilla egg cream (seltzer, milk, whipped cream and syrup, in case you were wondering).</p> <p>Instead, we meet over Zoom, of course, but she tells me she still got dressed up for the chat. For her, that means swapping out two-day old pyjamas for one of her more colorful outfits (she usually just wears black) \u2013 a black top with flowers on it and a scraggly yellow jacket. Her characteristic short, ginger hair is tucked behind her ears and she\u2019s wearing a huge grin on her face.</p> <p>In I Am Not Okay With This, that ear-to-ear grin is normally seen whenever her best friend, Dina, is around, because she is in love with her. The rest of the time Sydney Novak can be seen fuming, watching the contents of store shelves, libraries and entire forests come crashing down at the behest of her uncontrollable teenage emotions. They are dark, deep, contorted. So contorted, in fact, that Novak ends up accidentally blowing somebody\u2019s head off at the end of the series.</p> <p>I ask her about her own real-life emotions: is there an emotion she would get rid of given the chance? \u201cOh God, my anxiety.

Before interviews, she anticipates what questions she might be asked and writes her answers.</p> <p>Lillis gets anxious about social interactions. She tells me she looks up to her twin brother, Jake, because she sees him as being effortlessly sociable.

Everyone has hardships, no matter how large or small, so I just try to use as much of those as possible.\u201d</p> <p>But in her real life, Lillis is very protected.

Pinto does potentially face 30 years in jail if found guilty of 90 charges, having been extradited from Hungary in March 2019 for allegedly attempting to blackmail an investment fund. And Pinto\u2019s lawyers confirmed that the 31-year-old, whose website played a crucial part in providing evidence which led to Manchester City\u2019s Champions League ban, as well as numerous investigations into tax evasion and corruption in football, is \u201cbanned from using the internet.\u201d</p> <p>That leaves poor Pinto condemned to read things like Big Papers and the back of cereal packets during his house arrest. But maybe there is some light at the end of the plushly-carpeted corridor. \u201cRui Pinto\u2019s defence welcomes this decision and trusts that further steps will be taken for the freedom of our client,\u201d parped his lawyers.

As a fellow West Ham fan, on a cold, wet and windy Wednesday night in December 1996, through torrential rain and horrendous traffic I eagerly drove up the M6 from Birmingham to watch Stockport v West Ham in a Milk Cup fourth-round replay. The Hammers took the lead through our talisman, Julian Dicks, and just a minute later our star striker, Iain Dowie, rose majestically to plant a powerful header into the corner of the net. Unfortunately it was our net, but a great finish nonetheless. West Ham imploded and Brett Angell fired in what was to prove to be Stockport\u2019s winner just a couple of minutes later.

The journey was otherwise trouble-free, until we got to within half a mile of Euston, where the train stopped and didn\u2019t move again for about two hours. When we finally arrived at 3pm, the police proceeded to escort us on a three-mile walk to the stadium.

  "<p>Coronavirus is the great leveller. Rich or poor, we have all been plunged into turmoil, insecurity and isolation, bonded together by our inability to imagine what life will be like in two weeks, let alone two months. Tell that to Jhon, a 46-year-old chef at the Warrington Hotel, a plush pub in the leafy west London district of Maida Vale. On 18<sup> </sup>March, he and two kitchen porters were sent a letter from their bosses announcing \u201csome extremely difficult decisions\u201d had to be made that meant their positions had \u201cbeen made redundant\u201d. No furlough, no 80% wage subsidy for his \u00a310-an-hour pay packet; a man with four children to support has been thrown into extreme hardship.</p> \n<p>It gets worse. Rather than being paid for their outstanding holiday, the workers have been ordered to use it up during their notice period: a straightforward violation of the law. When their trade union, the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), asked the pub\u2019s owners why the workers were being dismissed \u201cdespite having the ability to pay the wages and its bills after the government\u2019s help package\u201d and announced legal action, the only reply they received was \u201cNoted\u201d.</p> \n<p>What does he feel when we\u2019re told \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d, I ask him. \u201cI feel angry, it\u2019s just not true,\u201d Jhon tells me through a translator: he is a migrant worker from Colombia. \u201cThe owners of the hotels and the other businesses are only looking for profit, leaving everyone else unprotected. They don\u2019t care about us.\u201d He\u2019s always been a responsible, loyal employee, he says, since he started working at the pub seven months ago. Now he feels angry, helpless, \u201cshocked at the lack of humanity by these people at the top\u201d, worried about rent, bills, and \u201csimple things like buying food\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For some, this is both a national and personal disaster, a present defined by turmoil and of futures snatched away</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Coronavirus is not some grand leveller: it is an amplifier of existing inequalities, injustices and insecurities. We hear the constant invoking of the second world war: but despite the horror of Nazi bombs, the living standards and health of poorer Britons <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/9728#1\">benefited from rationing </a>and full employment. In the age of Covid-19, the rubble of economic collapse will fall on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/young-people-have-paid-enough-spare-them-from-footing-the-coronavirus-bill\">those who suffered the most from the last crash</a>: the young, the precarious, the low-paid.</p> \n<p>If you are wealthy, you have savings; you may own your property outright, or at least have relief in the form of a mortgage holiday. Renters on the other hand, who even in normal times part with a huge portion of their wage bills, now have the National Residential Landlords Association wagging its fingers in their faces, telling them that the pandemic is not a \u201cgreen light\u201d for them not to pay their rent. Many find themselves asking what exactly they\u2019re meant to pay their rent with.</p> \n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14795\">Institute for Fiscal Studies notes</a>, the better-off may actually increase their savings as spending on forbidden activities falls; but poorer households spend much more of their limited income on necessities, leaving them vulnerable to sudden falls in their incomings. Indeed, millions who spend their lives treading water now face being sucked under by strong currents.</p> \n<p>The wealthy are also more likely to be able to work from home. In the United States, a study of mobile data reveals that the wealthy are moving around less than the least well-off: they can afford to self-isolate and did so quicker than their poorer fellow citizens. As the New York Times headline aptly put it: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-stay-home-rich-poor.html\">\u201cLocation Data Say It All: Staying at Home During Coronavirus Is a Luxury\u201d</a>. It is no different here, of course: while managers conduct high-powered meetings on Zoom, their cleaners still travel across cities on early-morning buses to clean half-empty offices.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the issue of space. While many middle-class children play in expansive gardens, much of the urban poor find themselves locked away in overcrowded accommodation, risking a police reprimand if they loiter around parks. Those with violent partners or abusive parents, or, for LGBTQ youth, all too often hostile families, have nowhere to go. For some, home is a sanctuary; for others, it was a place of fear before the pandemic, and now it is a prison.</p> \n<p>Finally, nurses, care workers, bus drivers, supermarket workers are rightly designated the title of \u201ckey worker\u201d, but what compensation for years of being undervalued, underpaid and now at particular risk of exposure to a potentially lethal illness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"37912254-39d8-4da4-af8f-4d0155124114\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/41BnWrYGD5o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So save us the platitudes of coronavirus as the great leveller; abandon this sickly myth that we are all in this together. For some, this is a time of grand inconvenience, of undoubted stress, of a self-evident loss of freedom. For others, this is both a national and personal disaster, a present defined by turmoil and of futures snatched away. </p> \n<p>The BBC\u2019s Emily Maitlis was rightly lauded last night for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6wIcpdJyCI\">debunking the myth that coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6wIcpdJyCI\">is a great leveller</a>. That it went viral shows the popular appetite there is not to whitewash our grotesque social inequalities. As the IWGB\u2019s general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee put it in a letter to Jhon\u2019s employers at Golden Brick Pubs: \u201cHistory will look back on this moment, and those who had the means but nevertheless failed to do everything possible to assist and protect the most vulnerable, will be judged harshly.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the pandemic is over, when a vaccine shields us from this cruel disease, the rich will still prosper, while the struggling and insecure will be expected to pay: they already are.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>For Scottish comedian and Love Island narrator <a href=\"https://iaindoesjokes.com/\">Iain Stirling</a>, nothing compares to live standup comedy. \u201cTelling the audience something that you find bizarre or idiosyncratic about your life and psyche, and having a roomful of people going: Ha ha ha!

She acknowledges that standup online can be very difficult to pull off without an audience in the room because you usually \u201cride their laughter like a surfer\u201d.</p> <p>Her cabaret gives a platform to comedians, musicians and dancers who may not otherwise have the technical knowhow to share work and successfully find audiences online. She decided to put together a variety bill for locked-in audiences because that\u2019s the entertainment she remembers watching at home with her family as a child \u2013 though you\u2019d imagine that those TV cabaret shows didn\u2019t feature, as hers does, a man named Pudding wearing a gimp suit. Pudding is Adams\u2019 boyfriend, comedian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IamRichWilson\">Rich Wilson</a>.

He says that, as well as donating to funds for freelance creatives, it can also be productive to \u201cinvest in something creative and funny\u201d. Ash became involved in comedy production as a way of dealing with grief after his mother died in 2016. \u201cI decided I wanted to be a part of making people happy, bringing laughter to them,\u201d he says. During lockdown, \u201cnow more than ever we need something to laugh at, to be joyous about\u201d. </p> <p>The nimble world of online comedy content, which can be swiftly created, widely shared and is vital as clubs remain closed, could introduce a new wave of comedians to audiences. Ash points to the boom in bedroom music production in the 90s and how it created a revolution. \u201cMaybe this could be a moment for comedy, too. I certainly hope so.\u201d</p>",

The capitalisation of \u201cSpecial Tone\u201d. The term \u201cI find hard to find\u201d. The implication that the plot was slightly too complex for her. The fact that she is posting a critical rave for a film that not only contains a climactic scene where Robert Downey Jr frantically pulls a bagpipe from a dragon\u2019s bum, but is currently on schedule to be the biggest commercial flop of the year.</p> <p>After all, Britney\u2019s assessment of the film is quite the outlier. Compare her Dolittle rave with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/dolittle-review-robert-downey-jr\">the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw review</a>, which called the film \u201chorribly inert\u201d. Or <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/dolittle/\">Empire</a>, which deemed it \u201clacklustre\u201d. Or <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/dolittle-review/\">Total Film</a>, which described it as \u201clifeless and dead-eyed\u201d. Or <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796763817/dolittle-does-a-lot-all-of-it-terribly?t=1586439138653\">NPR</a>, who decided it was less a film and more \u201ca crime scene in need of forensic analysis\u201d. Perhaps Britney was expecting less of Dolittle. Perhaps she uses a different set of criteria to evaluate cinema. Perhaps she watched the wrong film by accident. We may never know.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dolittle\">take a look at Rotten Tomatoes</a> and you\u2019ll find that her view is much more closely aligned to the public than the critics. The professionals gave Dolittle a miserable 15%. The general public, on the other hand, awarded it a mighty 76%. And Britney\u2019s post \u2013 essentially \u201cnice animals, good clothes, bit confusing in places\u201d \u2013 reads exactly like a 76% review. In layman\u2019s terms, this means that Spears has her finger on the pulse of public opinion. She understands what we want, and she always has, because she is one of us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b3b007d170b81145f3730d2b141190ad7608203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b3b007d170b81145f3730d2b141190ad7608203/0_84_1353_1689/801.jpg\" alt=\"Spears with her then boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, at the premiere of Crossroads in 2002.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spears with her then boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, at the premiere of Crossroads in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And, don\u2019t forget, Dolittle is a flop. Far fewer people went to see it than anticipated, so there\u2019s a real chance that Spears\u2019 praise will inspire hundreds of thousands to seek it out. It might even dig the film out of the mire a little. For a successful actor such as Spears (no, really; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/27/features\">her 2002 film Crossroads</a> made its budget back five times over, making it a much hotter commercial property than Dolittle) to reach down and help an underdog like this shows a lot of class.</p> <p>Now we just have to sit back and wait to see what she reviews next. Will she continue to buck the critical trend, by slagging off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/09/uncut-gems-review-adam-sandler-idina-menzel\">Uncut Gems</a> or embracing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/09/playmobil-the-movie-review-borderline-dopey-kids-adventure\">Playmobil: The Movie</a>? Will she maintain her dedication to focusing on underperforming releases, by reviewing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/16/uglydolls-review\">UglyDolls</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/26/the-goldfinch-review\">The Goldfinch</a>?

  "<p>The environmental changes wrought by the coronavirus were first visible from space. Then, as the disease and the lockdown spread, they could be sensed in the sky above our heads, the air in our lungs and even the ground beneath our feet.</p> <p>While the human toll mounted horrendously from a single case in Wuhan to a global pandemic that has so far killed more than 88,000 people, nature, it seemed, was increasingly able to breathe more easily.</p> <p>As motorways cleared and factories closed, dirty brown pollution belts shrunk over cities and industrial centres in country after country within days of lockdown. First China, then Italy, now the UK, Germany and dozens of other countries are experiencing temporary falls in carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide of as much as 40%, greatly improving air quality and reducing the risks of asthma, heart attacks and lung disease.</p> <p>For many experts, it is a glimpse of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\"> what the world might look like without fossil fuels</a>. But hopes that humanity could emerge from this horror into a healthier, cleaner world will depend not on the short-term impact of the virus, but on the long-term political decisions made about what follows.</p> <p>After decades of relentlessly increasing pressure, the human footprint on the earth has suddenly lightened. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/03/how-is-the-coronavirus-affecting-global-air-traffic\">Air traffic halved</a> by mid-March compared with the same time last year. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">road traffic fell</a> in the UK by more than 70%, to levels last seen when the Beatles were in shorts. With less human movement, the planet has literally calmed: seismologists report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/lockdown-has-cut-britains-vibrations-seismologists-find\">lower vibrations from \u201ccultural noise\u201d</a> than before the pandemic.</p> <p>Key environmental indices, which have steadily deteriorated for more than half a century, have paused or improved. In China, the world\u2019s biggest source of carbon, emissions were <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-has-temporarily-reduced-chinas-co2-emissions-by-a-quarter?utm_content=bufferae67b&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">down about 18%</a> between early February and mid-March \u2013 a cut of 250m tonnes, equivalent to more than half the UK\u2019s annual output. Europe is forecast to see a <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and-conservation/2020/04/carbon-emissions-are-falling-sharply-due-coronavirus-not-long\">reduction of around 390m tonnes</a>. Significant falls can also be expected in the US, where passenger vehicle traffic \u2013 its major source of CO<sub>2</sub> \u2013 has fallen by nearly 40%. Even assuming a bounceback once the lockdown is lifted, the planet is expected to see its first fall in global emissions since the 2008-9 financial crisis. </p> <h2>Fossil fuels</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"889fba677dd3931004ef7756e92e1c416b163da6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/889fba677dd3931004ef7756e92e1c416b163da6/0_189_5670_3402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quiet M25\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London\u2019s usually busy M25 orbital motorway on Monday, during what would normally be a busy afternoon rush hour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Stevenson/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no doubt that these lockdowns are hitting the fossil fuel industry. With fewer drivers on the roads and planes in the air, the price of oil has slumped almost two-thirds since last year. Car sales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/06/car-plant-shutdowns-may-cost-auto-industry-more-than-100bn-covid-19\">fell by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/06/car-plant-shutdowns-may-cost-auto-industry-more-than-100bn-covid-19\">44% in March</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/rail-journeys-at-5-of-normal-levels-as-uk-stays-home-due-to-coronavirus\">motorway traffic down 83%</a>. So many more people are learning to teleconference from home that the head of the Automobile Association in the UK <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rharrabin?lang=en\">advised the government</a> to switch infrastructure investment from building new roads to widening internet bandwidth.</p> <p>This is potentially good news for the climate because oil is the biggest source of the carbon emissions that are heating the planet and disrupting weather systems. Some analysts believe it could mark the start of a prolonged downward trend in emissions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/the-fossil-fuel-industry-is-broken-will-a-cleaner-climate-be-the-result\">the beginning of the end for oil</a>. Others strike a more cautious note about the fuel that has dominated our lives and polluted our atmosphere for the past century.</p> <p>\u201cThe drop in emissions is global and unprecedented,\u201d Rob Jackson, the chair of <a href=\"https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/\">Global Carbon Project</a> said. \u201cAir pollution has plunged in most areas. The virus provides a glimpse of just how quickly we could clean our air with renewables.\u201d But he warned that the human cost was too high and the environmental gains could prove temporary. \u201cI refuse to celebrate a drop in emissions driven by tens of millions of people losing their jobs. We need systemic change in our energy infrastructure, or emissions will roar back later.\u201d</p> <p>Hopes that the pandemic will accelerate the transition to a cleaner world are already running into a political wall: the \u201cshock doctrine\u201d of disaster capitalism outlined by the author and activist Naomi Klein. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/06/naomi-klein-how-power-profits-from-disaster\">her book</a> of the same name, the Canadian writer describes how a powerful global elite exploits national crises to push through unpopular and extreme measures on the environment and labour rights.</p> <p>This is what is happening in the United States and elsewhere. Oil company executives have lobbied Donald Trump for a bailout. Under the cover of the crisis, the White House has rolled back fuel-economy standards for the car industry, the Environmental Protection Agency has stopped enforcing environmental laws, three states have criminalised fossil fuel protesters and construction has resumed on the <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/pipeline-protest-laws-coronavirus_n_5e7e7570c5b6256a7a2aab41?ri18n=true&amp;ncid=engmodushpmg00000004&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb25zZW50LnlhaG9vLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANVh9Z1r8cniwbiPw8wGX9-DyggqrQ2GzqrQm2V1XSgYaCkw3c3RynWOz6yUotd3SXxg1RsXJfSdAshrEgBWVesW5znkrLWDi1A4JlbEisw1LFHrVoy0cD3IolXZRAHM6KTmyorwWWbnNHjv1gEiittw1WVv6Rf4mKtpPL4jgZC1\">KXL oil pipeline</a>. The US government\u2019s massive economic stimulus bill also included a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/business/airlines-bailout-outlook-coronavirus/index.html\">$50bn bailout</a> for aviation companies. Environmental groups are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">urging</a> the UK and European Union not to do the same.</p> <p>If governments prime the economic pumps with the intention of a return to business as usual, environmental gains are likely to be temporary or reversed. China provides some indication of what can be expected. With no new cases in Wuhan, the lockdown is being eased and energy use and air pollution have been rising since the end of March.</p> <h2>Wildlife and biodiversity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be1c59653e3f484bc9165392aadef9557561438\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be1c59653e3f484bc9165392aadef9557561438/0_13_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coyote near Golden Gate Bridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coyotes have recently been spotted on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, while our species is in temporary retreat during the lockdowns, wildlife has filled the vacuum. This year will almost certainly see a much lower <a href=\"https://www.mammal.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RoadDeaths2001Report.pdf\">toll for roadkill by cars and trucks</a>, which \u2013 in the UK alone \u2013 annually takes the lives of about 100,000 hedgehogs, 30,000 deer, 50,000 badgers and 100,000 foxes, as well as barn owls and many other species of bird and insect. Many councils have delayed cutting the grass on roadside verges \u2013 one of the last remaining habitats for wildflowers \u2013 which should bring a riot of colour to the countryside this summer and provide more pollen for bees.</p> <p>Coyotes, normally timid of traffic, have been spotted on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Deer are grazing near Washington homes a few miles from the White House. Wild boar are becoming bolder in Barcelona and Bergamo, Italy. In Wales, peacocks have strutted through Bangor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/31/llandudno-goats-herd-running-riot-coronavirus-lockdown\">goats through Llandudno</a> and sheep have been filmed on roundabouts in a deserted playground in Monmouthshire.</p> <p>This is presented as the comedy in our tragedy. Cartoonists have depicted throngs of tourist animals gawping through city windows at humans under lockdown. Commentators are even talking of the \u201cpost-human\u201d era \u2013 a mocking rejoinder to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\">the idea that we live in Anthropocene</a>, a period of human domination that is reshaping the planet. Humour does not get much blacker. We are laughing at our own decline \u2013 and assuming that nature will be the beneficiary.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners say that is a dangerous misconception. The picture is different across our unequal world. Rich, industrialised nations are seeing a temporary recovery of nature because there is so little of it in the first place. Poorer countries, on the other hand, especially in the southern hemisphere, fear an increased threat to wildlife because the pandemic means they have less money and personnel with which to conserve endangered species and habitats.</p> <p>In the Amazon rainforest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/03/brazil-amazon-protection-coronavirus-fire-season\">environmental authorities are reining in monitoring and protection operations</a>. In the Masai Mara and Serengeti, nature reserves are taking less tourist revenue, which means they are struggling to pay rangers. Conservation groups fear this will open the door to more illegal poaching, mining and logging, especially now that local people are losing income and need new ways to feed their families.</p> <p>\u201cIn the short term it would be dangerous to think that a downturn in economic activity is a benefit to nature,\u201d said Matt Walpole of Fauna and Flora International. \u201cThere are significant risks.\u201d</p> <p>Potentially offsetting this is reduced demand for many natural resources, but it remains to be seen whether home isolation of half the world\u2019s population affects the appetite for consumer goods.</p> <h2>A new future?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d98384a32caffc4da15db2b54a21373919007aca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d98384a32caffc4da15db2b54a21373919007aca/0_426_6519_3911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Security guards patrol road near market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Security guards patrol a road next to the closed Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The respite for nature will be less important than what follows. That is already being decided in closed meetings while the public is locked down at home. Meanwhile, global conferences intended to find solutions to environmental problems, such as the Cop26 UN climate talks originally scheduled for Glasgow at the end of this year, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">postponed</a>.</p> <p>UN leaders, scientists and activists are pushing for an urgent public debate so that recovery can focus on green jobs and clean energy, building efficiency, natural infrastructure and a strengthening of the global commons.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the big political battle,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the Paris agreement. Leading scientists have jointly signed an <a href=\"https://clubofrome.org/impact-hubs/climate-emergency/open-letter-to-global-leaders-a-healthy-planet-for-healthy-people/\">open appeal</a> for governments to use recovery packages to shift in a greener direction rather than going back to business as usual.</p> <p>Ultimately, the most important environmental impact is likely to be on public perceptions. The pandemic has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/covid-19-climate-crisis-governments-coronavirus\">demonstrated</a> the deadly consequences of ignoring expert warnings, of political delay, and of sacrificing human health and natural landscapes for the economy. Of new infectious diseases, 75% come from animals, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Compared with the past, they pass more rapidly to humans through wildlife trafficking and deforestation and then spread across the globe through air travel and cruise-ship tourism. China \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest market for wild animals \u2013 appears to have recognised this by banning the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52125309\">farming and consumption of live wildlife</a>. There are growing calls for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/ban-live-animal-markets-pandemics-un-biodiversity-chief-age-of-extinction?CMP=share_btn_tw\">global ban on \u201cwet markets\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The pandemic has also shown that pollution lowers our resistance to disease. More exposure to traffic fumes means weaker lungs and greater risk of dying from Covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/air-pollution-linked-to-far-higher-covid-19-death-rates-study-finds\">according to scientists at Harvard University</a>. As the UN\u2019s environment chief, Inger Andersen, put it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nature-is-sending-us-a-message-says-un-environment-chief\">nature is sending us a message</a> that if we neglect the planet, we put our own wellbeing at risk.</p> <p>Since the start of the pandemic, it is not just from space that the world looks different. The unthinkable is now thinkable. Positions are shifting. Libertarian governments are curtailing freedoms more drastically than wartime leaders. Austerity conservatives are approving trillions of dollars for healthcare and emergency spending. Small-state advocates are being forced into massive interventions. Leading business publications are calling for a deep reform of capitalism. Most importantly, the political focus has shifted from individual consumption to collective wellbeing.</p> <p>These 100 days have changed the way we think about change. Ultimately, whether this pandemic is good or bad for the environment depends not on the virus, but on humanity. If there is no political pressure on governments, the world will go back to unsustainable business as usual rather than emerge with a healthier sense of what is normal.</p> <p>For the <a href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/852.html\">French philosopher Bruno Latour</a>, one thing we have learned is that it is possible in a matter of weeks to slow the economy, which until now had been considered inconceivable due to the pressures of globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe incredible discovery is that there was in fact in the world economic system, hidden from all eyes, a bright red alarm signal, next to a large steel lever that each head of state could pull at once to stop \u2018the progress train\u2019 with a shrill screech of the brakes,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>This makes ecological calls to move off a path of endless resource consumption more realistic, maybe even more desirable. But Latour warns that this unforeseen pause could easily allow powerful interests to seize more control ahead of the bigger battles looming over the climate and biodiversity. \u201cThis is where we must act,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the opportunity works for them, it works for us too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s 1992, and two lowriders walk into a Penthouse Players record release party at the Hollywood Athletic Club. They did not arrive together, but as two of the only Chicanos at the party, they were quickly introduced. Both steeped in the 1990s hip-hop zeitgeist, they bond over music, art and the beloved Los Angeles pastime of custom lowrider cars. Bedazzled in intricately designed, glinting candy paint with wire-spoke wheels, whitewall tires and bouncing hydraulics, a lowrider isn\u2019t just something you own, it\u2019s something you are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/livestreaming-beat-battles-lockdown-skepta-timabaland-self-isolating\">'He dominated me!' The livestreaming beat battles shutting down lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Estevan Oriol and Mister Cartoon (n\u00e9e Mark Machado) are born and bred Angelenos \u2013 Oriol from West LA and Cartoon from San Pedro. They lived similar yet separate lives until 1992, when their paths collided and their ascension to hip-hop eminence began, explored in detail in the new Netflix documentary LA Originals.</p> <p>\u201cThe world\u2019s kind of small in lowrider culture,\u201d says Cartoon, who was given his nickname in high school because of his animated personality. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what networking was but that\u2019s what I was doing when I met Estevan at a record release party I had done the cover art for. When I found out he was a lowrider too, we instantly connected.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in south Los Angeles, Cartoon seamlessly transitioned between various creative endeavors. Discovering a preternatural skill for drawing at a young age, his parents \u2013 who owned a lithograph printing company \u2013 wholeheartedly supported his craft, emboldening him to pursue a career in art. What began with pen on paper soon evolved to spray paint on walls, airbrush on T-shirts and prints on paper before finally arriving at ink on skin.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_01QJYDavw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y_01QJYDavw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In addition to designing the logos for Cypress Hill and Eminem\u2019s Shady Records, Cartoon has etched the hides of pop culture royalty such as B-Real, Kobe Bryant, Eminem, 50 Cent, Travis Barker, Justin Timberlake, Beyonc\u00e9, Danny Trejo and Snoop Dogg, some of whom are featured in the film. His style became iconic because he was one of the first artists to diverge from the ever-popular flash style of tattoo, wherein a numbered series of traditional designs hung on the wall that patrons picked on the spot. Cartoon\u2019s tattoos were \u2013 and still are \u2013 custom, seminal and distinct. Fusing his Mexican heritage, lowrider aesthetics and hip-hop culture with the fine-line style of tattoo art that was born in California prisons, he quickly found a niche</p> <p>\u201cThe tattoo world is different from any other art form,\u201d says Cartoon. \u201cIn every other style of art, especially graffiti, if you take somebody\u2019s shit, you\u2019re a biter, you stole it. With tattooing, you can borrow anybody\u2019s artwork and put it on as a tattoo because you don\u2019t sign them \u2013 it\u2019s all borrowed, inspired by other cultures and artists and combined with the tattoo artist\u2019s own style.\u201d</p> <p>Though Cartoon\u2019s most well known canvas is skin, one can also marvel at his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-DjMHKhzPw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">latest mural</a> painted on the exterior of the Chicano landmark Casa Vega, a family-owned, historic Mexican restaurant located in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. Open since 1956, Casa Vega is a local institution that has seen patrons such as Marlon Brando and Quentin Tarantino in its glossy, tufted red booths.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in West LA, Oriol was living a parallel existence. The son of renowned activist, artist and photographer Eriberto Oriol, he was genetically predisposed to living the life of a creative. Though lowrider culture was his passion, he found work as a bouncer for a hip-hop club. It was there he became a friend to a clique of hip-hop pioneers which eventually led him to becoming a tour manager for Cypress Hill and House of Pain</p> <p>Nearing the eve of his launch into the rap touring world, his father gave him a gift that, unbeknown to Estevan at the time, would reroute the trajectory of his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e46dd0efb09e930e5e3c408aae68a7b4f8c2d008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e46dd0efb09e930e5e3c408aae68a7b4f8c2d008/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from LA Originals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from LA Originals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe first camera I got was a Minolta 35mm,\u201d Oriol, who also directed the documentary, reflects. \u201cIt was given to me by my dad and was his spare camera. He was also a photographer, but was kind of over photography by that time. He said, \u2018Hey man, I got this extra camera. You\u2019re doing your lowriding stuff and going on tour with House of Pain so you should take pictures of all that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI started out real slow, taking pictures of my people in the lowrider community, then also of House of Pain,\u201d Oriol continues. \u201cAt first, I felt really uncomfortable bringing out a camera and putting it in people\u2019s faces but after a while I started getting used to it and it became easier. I was the only person taking photos on these tours at the time.\u201d</p> <p>What began as capturing moments for posterity became a full-blown career. Since touring with House of Pain and Cypress Hill nearly 20-years ago, Oriol has become a photography heavyweight, his work often showcasing the gritty microcosms of LA that are diametrically opposed to the Hollywood glamour often projected to the world at large. Additionally, he has directed several music videos making him as much a fixture of the hip-hop community as the rappers themselves.</p> <p>Oriol\u2019s photography portfolio boasts an impressive lineup of athletes, artists, celebrities, and musicians alongside his unpolished, often black-and-white captures of Skid Row\u2019s homeless community as well as Latinx, gang, and tattoo cultures. He has photographed rap deities such as Dr Dre, Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Big Pun, Rick Rubin and the Beastie Boys, as well as the portraits of Al Pacino, Dennis Hopper, Robert De Niro and Floyd Mayweather. Still a lover and champion of film photography, Oriol\u2019s work shows that in Los Angeles, glamour and grit are not mutually exclusive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B54oz5Oh2rG/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In 2013, Oriol sued clothing retailers H&amp;M and Brandy Melville, which used the image without his permission. According to Oriol, the judge ruled that a hand gesture cannot be trademarked by comparing it to the peace sign. Another finger gesture comes to mind, but the peace sign is the more diplomatic choice for comparison, despite the unfortunate ruling of the case.</p> <p>When Oriol and Cartoon finally merged their creative psyches, a super duo was formed. Though both were successful apart, together they created an empire. After Oriol made Cartoon his first tattoo gun, out of a Walkman motor and a Bic pen, taught to him by a friend who made one in prison, Cartoon\u2019s career flourished.</p> <p>They went on world tours with hip-hop giants, photographing and tattooing them along the way. They established a creative agency called Soul Assassins that was unfortunately shuttered shortly after the market crash in 2008. They partied, they hustled, they traveled, they created, they never stopped lowriding, and now, they\u2019ve made a documentary about it all. One of the most important tenets of their ethos, however, which is scarcely publicized is their community outreach.</p> <p>\u201cWe are always helping out the community, we just don\u2019t publicize it,\u201d Oriol explains. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for a pat on the back, we\u2019re doing it more because I have family members who have been homeless and friends and family members that were drug addicts. I donate my time, I donate clothes, I donate money, I donate food to homeless people and mentally ill people. And now also, we give jobs to convicted felons who can\u2019t find work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing outreach in schools for 20 years also,\u201d Cartoon adds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t show that in the movie, \u2018cause it\u2019s just what we do.

  "<p>After the massive 2019 hits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/avengers-endgame\">Avengers: Endgame</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/spider-man-far-from-home\">Spider-Man: Far from Home</a>, it seemed a safe bet that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would go on for ever. The high-flying blockbusters with their tight costumes, digital effects and insouciant quips could pack cinemas until the apocalypse. There would never again be a year without superheroes.</p> <p>Sadly, the apocalypse has come sooner than expected. Superheroes can fight secret quasi-Nazi conspiracies, invading aliens and android armies. But they are ill-equipped to fight the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>. Superheroes on screen have saved the world repeatedly. But, in this real-life crisis, the MCU\u2019s vision of empowerment via teaming up to blast things to smithereens seems woefully inadequate.</p> <p>The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the film industry. Like most major releases, MCU films scheduled for spring and summer have been delayed until autumn, or pushed into next year. Black Widow has been moved from 1 May to 6 November, and the new date will mean the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvels-phase-4-has-been-delayed-1288535\">longest pause</a> between MCU releases since The Incredible Hulk (2008) was followed two years later by Iron Man 2.</p> <p>The date changes reflect the logistical challenges of showing movies at the moment. Beyond that, though, the superhero genre feels irrelevant in a pandemic. Superheroes have always been given oomph and whoosh, not by disease but by war. The first huge success in the superhero genre came soon after the start of the second world war. In one of his early adventures, Superman, the first superhero, <a href=\"https://curiosity.com/topics/how-superman-fought-nazis-and-the-kkk-and-won-in-real-life-curiosity/\">captured</a> Hitler and Stalin to end the war. Other patriotic heroes such as the red-white-and-blue-clad Captain America and Wonder Woman regularly thumped Nazis and Japanese infiltrators on the home front.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a9e5c51e7ec812cce5c2cf81b3c806cff362bc7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9e5c51e7ec812cce5c2cf81b3c806cff362bc7f/158_275_3118_3743/833.jpg\" alt=\"Wartime defender \u2026 Wonder Woman.\" width=\"833\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wartime defender \u2026 Wonder Woman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sabena Jane Blackbird/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Superhero comics in the war years could sell <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=yT1jDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=superman+war+hundreds+of+thousands+of+copies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1W6f_5DAgu&amp;sig=ACfU3U0s_JBmhAkAOC-e0LoS1lN2Sj4FUw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGhbjCxNboAhUDV80KHY_BB94Q6AEwCnoECA0QLA\">hundreds of thousands of copies</a> an issue \u2013 a level of popularity the genre didn\u2019t see again until the post-9/11 \u201cwar on terror\u201d. Iron Man (2008) showed Tony Stark blasting away evil terrorists in the for ever war in Afghanistan, while Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019 imagined our hero gaining control of an army of drones more powerful even than America\u2019s own deadly stockpile. Over the 11 years between those two films, the MCU franchise <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/317408/highest-grossing-film-franchises-series/\">grossed</a> $22.5bn.</p> <p>The appeal of superheroes in wartime is straightforward. They\u2019re an empowerment fantasy of strength, violence and victory. MCU plots can be more or less clever, but the films rely on images of muscular men and women punching or blasting large numbers of bad guys until the bad guys fall over, or else stand up to be punched and blasted some more. The MCU narratives, with their incessant crossovers and team-ups, are about powerful people banding together to thump the snot out of their enemies. They\u2019re popular at moments of militarism because their approach to problems is militaristic. There are enemies out there, and you beat them with a combination of unity and overwhelming force.</p> <p>But overwhelming force is little use against a virus, and teaming up physically is harmful. Invulnerable superheroes swoop across vast distances to confront their foes in endless, glorious battle. In contrast, our virus response involves immobilisation, isolation and enforced inactivity as the economy collapses and we wait anxiously to start coughing. Instead of empowering fisticuffs, we\u2019re called to help others and ourselves through deliberate self-disempowerment.</p> <p>If there is heroism, it\u2019s the heroism of enduring as everyone becomes less super. Disaster movies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/contagion-film-review\">Contagion</a> or zombie films are too eventful to capture our apocalypse of immobility. But they get a lot closer than superhero narratives. It\u2019s hard to imagine yourself saving the world when you can barely imagine leaving the house to visit your loved ones.</p> <p>So will the virus finally take the wind out of the cape of the superhero genre? The answer is probably not. It\u2019s true that, even before the virus hit, there were signs that the superhero craze might be slowing down \u2013 DC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/05/birds-of-prey-and-the-fantabulous-emancipation-of-one-harley-quinn-review-margot-robbie\">Birds of Prey</a>, released earlier this year, for example, was a <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2020-04-05/birds-of-prey-box-office/\">financial disappointment</a>. But US wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East grind on, tentative <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52199398\">peace proposals</a> notwithstanding. And fans certainly remain excited about forthcoming MCU sequels.</p> <p>Coronavirus won\u2019t end the MCU permanently. But the enforced pause is a reminder that superheroes as a genre frame problems and solutions in specific ways, responding to specific historical conditions. Iron Man can snap his fingers and eliminate Thanos\u2019s invading army. But there\u2019s not a lot he can do when a poor government response exposes the public to a dangerous pandemic. It\u2019s fitting that superheroes have gone silent at the moment. They were never designed to save us from this.</p>",
  "<p>We knew this was coming. In her 1994 warning to the world, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/200682/the-coming-plague-by-laurie-garrett/\">The Coming Plague, Laurie Garrett</a> concluded: \u201cWhile the human race battles itself, fighting over ever more crowded turf and scarcer resources, the advantage moves to the microbes\u2019 court. They are our predators and they will be victorious if we, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, do not learn how to live in a rational global village that affords the microbes few opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>If you think her language hyperbolic, consider the more sober analysis from the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22553895\">US Institute of Medicine in 2004</a>. It evaluated the lessons of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">2003 S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">ars outbreak</a>, quoting Goethe: \u201cKnowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.\u201d It concluded that \u201cthe rapid containment of Sars is a success in public health, but also a warning \u2026 If Sars reoccurs \u2026 health systems worldwide will be put under extreme pressure \u2026 Continued vigilance is vital.\u201d</p> <p>But the world ignored these warnings.</p> <p>Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government between 2012 and 2019, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00919-3\">recently recalled</a> \u201ca practice run for an influenza pandemic in which about 200,000 people died. It left me shattered.\u201d But did the experience trigger government action? \u201cWe learnt what would help, but did not necessarily implement those lessons,\u201d Boyd said.</p> <p>Austerity blunted the ambition and commitment of government to protect its people. The political objective was to diminish the size and role of the state. The result was to leave the country fatally weakened. Whatever the reasons for failing to act upon the lessons of Sars and influenza simulations, the fact remained, as Boyd summed it up, \u201cwe were poorly prepared\u201d.</p> <p>The global response to Sars-CoV-2 is the greatest science policy failure in a generation. The signals were clear. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/hendra-virus-disease#tab=tab_1\">Hendra in 1994</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19108397\">Nipah in 1998</a>, Sars in 2003, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html\">ers in 2012</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing\">Ebola in 2014</a>; these major human epidemics were all caused by viruses that originated in animal hosts and crossed over into humans. Covid-19 is caused by a new variant of the same coronavirus that caused Sars.</p> <p>That the warning signs went unheeded is unsurprising. Few of us have experienced a pandemic, and we are all guilty of ignoring information that doesn\u2019t reflect our own experience of the world. Catastrophes reveal the weakness of human memory. How can one plan for a random rare event \u2013 surely the sacrifices will be too great? But, as the seismologist Lucy Jones argues in her 2018 book <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/554995/the-big-ones-by-dr-lucy-jones/\">The Big Ones</a>, \u201cnatural hazards are inevitable; the disaster is not\u201d.</p> <p>The first duty of government is to protect its citizens. The risks of a pandemic can be measured and quantified. As Garrett and the Institute of Medicine showed, the dangers of a new epidemic have been known and understood since the emergence of HIV in the 1980s. Since then, 75 million people have been infected with the disease and 32 million have died. HIV may not have swept through the world at the same pace as Sars-CoV-2, but its long shadow should have alerted governments to prepare for an outbreak of a new virus.</p> <p>During a crisis, the public and politicians alike understandably turn to experts. But on this occasion, the experts \u2013 scientists who have modelled and simulated our possible futures \u2013 made assumptions that turned out to be mistaken. The UK imagined the pandemic would be much like influenza. The influenza virus is not benign \u2013 the number of annual deaths from influenza in the UK varies widely, with a recent peak of <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-compare-influenza/\">28,330 deaths in 2014-15</a> \u2013 but influenza is not Covid-19.</p> <p>China, by contrast, was scarred by its experience of Sars. When the government realised that a new virus was circulating, Chinese officials didn\u2019t advise hand washing, a better cough etiquette and disposing of tissues. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">They quarantined entire cities and shut down the economy</a>. As one former secretary of state for health in England put it to me, our scientists suffered from a \u201ccognitive bias\u201d towards the milder threat of influenza.</p> <p>Perhaps that is why the key government committee, the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag), <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-path-speci/special-report-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm-idUSKBN21P1VF\">concluded on 21 February</a>, three weeks after the World Health Organization had declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">public </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">health </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">emergency of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">international </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">concern</a>, that<strong> </strong>they had no objection to Public Health England\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d risk assessment of the disease to the UK population. That was a genuinely fatal error of judgement.</p> <p>Failure to escalate the risk assessment led to mortal delays in preparing the NHS for the coming wave of infections. The desperate pleas I have received from frontline NHS staff are painful to read. \u201cNursing burnout is at an all-time high and a lot of our heroic nursing staff are on the verge of emotional breakdown.\u201d \u201cIt is sickening that this is happening, and that somehow this country thinks it\u2019s OK to let some members of staff get sick, get ventilated, or die.\u201d \u201cI feel like a soldier going to war without a gun.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s suicide.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sick of being called a hero because if I had any choice I wouldn\u2019t be coming to work.\u201d</p> <p>The availability of, and access to, appropriate personal protective equipment has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">appallingly bad for many nurses and doctors</a>. Some hospital trusts have planned well. But many have been unable to provide the necessary safe equipment to their frontline teams.</p> <p>At every press conference, the government spokesperson always includes the same line: \u201cWe have been following the medical and scientific advice.\u201d It\u2019s a good line. And it\u2019s partly true. But the government knew the NHS was unprepared. It knew it had failed to build the necessary intensive care surge capacity to meet the likely patient demand. As one doctor wrote to me: \u201cIt seems that nobody wants to learn from the human tragedy that happened in Italy, China, Spain \u2026 This is really sad \u2026 Doctors and scientists who are not able to learn from one another.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re supposed to be living through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">Anthropocene</a>, an era where human activity has become the dominant influence on the environment. The idea of the Anthropocene conjures notions of human omnipotence. But Covid-19 has revealed the astonishing fragility of our societies. It has exposed our inability to cooperate, to coordinate, and to act together. But perhaps we can\u2019t control the natural world after all. Perhaps we are not quite as dominant as we once thought.</p> <p>If Covid-19 eventually imbues human beings with some humility, it\u2019s possible that we will, after all, be receptive to the lessons of this lethal pandemic. Or perhaps we will sink back into our culture of complacent exceptionalism and await the next plague that will surely arrive. To go by recent history, that moment will come sooner than we think.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister is approaching his fourth night\u2019s stay in intensive care. We are told, by government, that he is \u201cimproving\u201d \u2013 and more recently, today, by a spokesman, that he is \u201cin good spirits\u201d. However, fear around the severity of his condition, and uncertainty around how long he will be absent from leading the country, has inevitably led to worries around the government\u2019s handling of communications around Johnson\u2019s health. Governments have, historically, struggled with delivering this kind of news.</p> <p>No government relishes the prospect of delivering bad news. And all governments have familiar ways of approaching the problem. Sluggish statistics are buried in budgets. Press releases are unsubtly reordered. Eye-catching announcements are thrown out on the same day that an otherwise negative story would dominate.</p> <p>The scepticism that this communication spin breeds can be a big problem in a crisis, never more so when dealing with something so sensitive and important as the health of the prime minister. Compared to the cases of past prime ministers who have fallen seriously ill, the government has been fairly timely in delivering news of serious changes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/boris-johnson-improving-sitting-up-bed-chancellor-says-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson\u2019s condition</a>. But there are reasons why sceptics worry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/government-publish-data-coronavirus-deaths\">Why isn't the government publishing more data about coronavirus deaths? | Jeni Tennison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/government-publish-data-coronavirus-deaths\">transparency has to be the watchword</a>. Losing the support of the public and the confidence of the media can badly damage trust in the government\u2019s response and increase panic and confusion. The best approach is to get ahead of the bad news, to spell out that worse is to come and that times will be difficult. After an initial burst of characteristic optimism, Boris Johnson did just this: he told the public that he would \u201clevel\u201d with them that \u201cmany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d.</p> <p>The news that the prime minister had been taken into intensive care was shocking. But it also caught many by surprise \u2013 the message from the government had until then focused on Johnson\u2019s continued commitment to his workload and, as Johnson himself set out in a tweeted video, his improving condition. It shows up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/boris-johnson-illness-horror-coronavirus\">harsh reality of this virus</a> - how quickly it can turn far more serious.</p> <p> When prime ministers have fallen ill on the past, governments have often deliberately restricted how much information was shared with the public. Towards the end of 1918, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/09/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic\">Spanish flu spread across the globe</a>, David Lloyd George\u2019s sore throat developed into a full-blown case. He collapsed and was hospitalised, but the seriousness of his condition \u2013 the prime minister was on a ventilator for more than a week \u2013 was kept quiet.</p> <p>In July 1953, when Winston Churchill had a stroke, it was kept quiet. With his assumed successor Anthony Eden in hospital himself, cabinet ministers found themselves discussing whether Churchill could remain in office without the news leaking until October, when it was hoped Eden would have recovered. Following that botched operation on an ulcer, Eden would be in considerable pain throughout his premiership \u2013 but details of the medication he used to manage that pain were not shared with the public and the extent of his drug use during the 1956 Suez crisis has long been a controversial question for historians.</p> <p>This approach is not confined to history, or the UK. When Bernie Sanders had a heart attack last year during the race to become the Democrat candidate in the US presidential election, his team did not immediately relay the news to the press. After Hillary Clinton fell ill with pneumonia in the 2016 contest against Sanders, her press secretary was forced to admit that \u201cin retrospect, we could have handled it better in providing more information \u2013 that\u2019s on us\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-extended-boris-johnson-in-hospital-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: Boris Johnson 'continues to improve' in intensive care; death toll in Scotland rises by 81</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Political leaders and their teams are still wary of revealing details of ill-health \u2013 for fear that any perception of weakness will be seized on by opponents, unsettle the public or be misreported by the press. There is a personal element as well \u2013 patients, however important, want to protect medical details, and there are family members whose privacy needs to be protected too. Which won\u2019t stop journalists seeking to check that bad news is not being withheld. The era of Twitter is a big contrast to 1953, when one of the first people to know about Churchill\u2019s condition was Pamela Berry, whose husband\u2019s family owned the Daily Telegraph. It was never leaked.</p> <p>The fact that the message came out so strongly that Johnson was doing well, until worse news arose, might be that his condition deteriorated rapidly; it could equally be the case that Downing Street was attempting to manage an increasingly worrying situation, or that the prime minister himself wanted to present a positive picture.</p> <p>The prime minister will no doubt accept the interest in his health.

The guidance, drawn up by Public Health England (PHE) with input from senior doctors, sets out in what medical settings NHS personnel should either use basic PPE \u2013 apron and gloves \u2013 or full PPE, which comprises full-length surgical gown, double gloves and either a visor or goggles to cover the eyes.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to be sure that PPE is getting to the right places and being used in the right way.

On the frontline, people just want to know that they are safe and that they have access to the right kit to keep them safe. Working in Covid wards is a scary situation and we need to make that as safe as we can for them, and getting access to PPE is really important.\u201d</p> \n<p>Staff groups voiced frustration at Goddard\u2019s plea to reduce \u201cinappropriate\u201d use of PPE. \u201cNursing staff are desperate for enough equipment and the shortages are not caused by frivolous use,\u201d said Rose Gallagher, the professional lead for infection prevention and control at the Royal College of Nursing, which represents most NHS nurses.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already been on the receiving end of changes in guidance and unsafe availability of masks, eye protection and other items.

  "<p>Although <em>Parallel Lives</em> is subtitled \u201cFive Victorian Marriages\u201d, of the five couples whose joint biographies make up the subject matter of the book \u2013 Jane Welsh and Thomas Carlyle, Effie Gray and John Ruskin, Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill, Catherine Hogarth and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot\">George Eliot</a> (Marian Evans) and George Henry Lewes \u2013 the final pair, Phyllis Rose\u2019s \u201cfavourite\u201d, were in fact one of the most famous unmarried couples of the 19th century. Eliot, who in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot\">Middlemarch</a></em> (1878) writes of getting married as \u201cthe beginning of the home epic\u201d, lived for almost 25 years as \u201cMrs Lewes\u201d despite the fact that Lewes\u2019s estrangement but not divorce from his (first) wife Agnes meant they could never legally lay claim to the names they called each other.<br><br>This contradiction \u2013 the \u201cbest\u201d marriage in a book about Victorian marriages not technically being one \u2013 is one Eliot herself would have enjoyed. That famous passage from <em>Middlemarch</em>, which is often read out at weddings, is, in its context, more ambivalent than it seems: the home epic is just as likely to be a story of the \u201cirremediable loss of that complete union\u201d as it is a \u201cgradual conquest\u201d, something the fictional marriages of her own characters often attest to. <em>Parallel Lives</em> suggests that one reason for Eliot and Lewes\u2019s happiness is their position outside the heavily freighted marital structure, which \u201cbears some ineradicable taint\u201d that \u201cconverts the personal relationship between a man and a woman into a political one\u201d. In the years that have elapsed since the book was first published in 1983, marriage has ceased to exclusively confer its dubious privileges on to heterosexual couples, and even at the time of its first publication many activists and theorists alike would have disagreed, as I do, with the idea that marriage transforms the personal into the political, rather than reflects the inseparability of the two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24753865ad345b8a2c8e8bec510cb2106028ac4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24753865ad345b8a2c8e8bec510cb2106028ac4a/0_0_2560_1536/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Catherine and Charles Dickens \u2026 \u2018They loved each other, for a time.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine and Charles Dickens \u2026 \u2018They loved each other, for a time.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Yet <em>Parallel Lives</em> remains a remarkably contemporary study that places the matrimonial institution itself at the heart of its scrutiny: all the more surprising, perhaps, that despite its ongoing popularity in the US and its international reputation as a half-forgotten classic, it fell out of print in Britain at the turn of the millennium. The new Daunt edition seeks to remedy that by emphasising its relevance to the 21st century. Introduced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sheila-heti\">Sheila Heti</a> and packaged with a blurb from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jia-tolentino\">Jia Tolentino</a> and a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nora-ephron\">Nora Ephron</a>, this is Victorian biography remodelled for an increasingly autofictional world.</p> <p>Rose, who chose an epigraph from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roland-barthes\">Roland Barthes</a>, uses discrete episodes in the lives of its subjects to illuminate the broader argument that marital relations are best understood as narratives: marriage is one of the primary stories we have historically chosen to impose on our lives. Her ambition, laid out in the prologue, is to create a \u201cseries of domestic portraits\u201d that function as a counterpart to more familiar histories of the public lives of \u201cgreat men\u201d. Her title references Plutarch\u2019s <em>Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans</em>, which was hugely popular in the Victorian era and often known as \u201cParallel Lives\u201d. Marriage, for Rose, is where individual questions about a life coalesce with the possibility of public destiny: in moments of decision, \u201cI said yes!\u201d being one of them, \u201ceach of us in the ordinary process of living\u201d is, according to Rose, \u201ca fitful novelist, and the biographer is a literary critic\u201d.<br><br>In the 19th century, marriage was a site of trenchant structural inequality. Until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/11/women-rights-money-timeline-history\">Married Woman\u2019s Property Act of 1870</a>, campaigned for by, among others, Elizabeth Gaskell and Eliot\u2019s close friend Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, a married woman legally had no right to property or to money either earned or inherited. She also had no legal claims on her children. At its heart, Rose\u2019s biography seeks to illustrate the damage caused by such a fundamental power imbalance, and to remember acts of resistance such as Jane Carlyle\u2019s posthumous literary revenge \u2013 after her sudden death in 1866, a guilt-ridden Thomas Carlyle wrote <em>Reminscences</em>, which, based on her diary, portrayed him as a neglectful and domineering patriarch \u2013 and Effie Gray\u2019s successful legal manoeuvring out of her unconsummated, miserable marriage to Ruskin.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Catherine bore Charles Dickens 10 children in 15 years: as he became a celebrity, she became increasingly exhausted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although it is the life of Jane Carlyle \u2013 returned to in different chapters \u2013 that structures the book, Rose\u2019s argument for the narrative character of matrimony is best articulated in the entangling of life and work in the marriage of Mill and Taylor. Mill, one of the most influential political economic thinkers of the century, met the already married Taylor in 1831. In love with Mill but unwilling to leave her husband and children, a \u201cremarkably stable\u201d triangle was initiated, and persisted until John Taylor\u2019s death in 1849, after which Mill and Harriet could finally marry. Little of Harriet\u2019s work was published under her own name in her lifetime, but after her death in 1858 Mill insisted that she had been as much the author of his work as he had. His claim was met with incredulity and distaste, despite the fact that his essay <em>The Subjection of Women</em> was inspired in large part by Taylor\u2019s first-hand experience of the fact that women were legally obliged to have sex with their husbands \u2013 something enshrined in British law until 1991.</p> <p><br><em>Parallel Lives</em> does not seek to offer a revisionist history of Taylor\u2019s skills but rather suggests that, if Mill was indeed being hyperbolic about her talents, this was not unrelated to the vast imbalance of power within the institution of marriage: \u201cMill seems at times to be apologising for the collective disadvantage of the female sex, assuming the collective guilt of the male.\u201d What Rose finds in Mill and Taylor\u2019s partnership is the importance of imagination. Despite the evidence of those who knew them (the Carlyles and many others disliked Harriet greatly, and disparaged her character and intellect on multiple occasions) Mill and Taylor believed themselves to be happy and liberated, because their shared image of their relationship was that of a marriage of equals. \u201cHappy marriages seem to me those in which the two partners agree on the scenario they are enacting, even if, as was the case with Mr and Mrs Mill, their own idea of their relationship is totally at variance with the facts.\u201d Mill\u2019s autobiography, which has long been considered evidence of the foolishness of his love for Harriet \u2013 not least because of his insistence she was a greater poet than Shelley and the foremost political mind of their generation \u2013 is, read sympathetically, \u201cone of the most touching love stories of the 19th century\u201d. Rose reminds us that such fictionalisation of a partner is far from unusual: \u201cWe all make up the people we love.\u201d<br><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/17/top-10-books-about-long-marriages\">Top 10 books about long marriages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The volatile relationship between imagination and power characterises, to some extent, all the marriages in <em>Parallel Lives</em>. Perhaps the saddest is that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/23/charles-dickens-wife-victorian-asylum\">Charles</a> and Catherine Dickens. Married in her early 20s, Catherine bore her husband 10 children in 15 years: as he became a stratospheric celebrity, she became increasingly exhausted, with most of her household duties taken over by her sister, Georgina. The rest of the story is well known: Dickens, frustrated and bored, embarked on an affair with the young actor Ellen Ternan, and publicly announced his version of the separation in his journal, <em>Household Words</em>. Rose bolsters Catherine\u2019s experiences against the overwhelming tide of Dickens\u2019s imagination: in defiance of his later insistence that his marriage had always been unhappy, she offers evidence that they had, for a time, loved each other. <em>Parallel Lives </em>illuminates the mechanisms by which the stories we tell \u2013 about our own lives as well as those of people long dead \u2013 are structured by our own need for narrative fulfilment, and vice versa. It might not be enough to rescue the Catherine Dickenses of the world, but it teaches us to look at who, in the official marital record, is playing the role of narrator.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages by Phyllis Rose is published by Daunt (RRP \u00a310.99)</em>. <em>To buy a copy go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/bina-9780349726465.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com.</a> Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.</em></p>",

Unemployment offices have been unable to cope with the huge volumes of claims made in recent weeks, with widespread reports of websites crashing and phone lines collapsing under the weight of calls. Those delays will filter through to the figures in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Florida and Texas, which account for 15% of the nation\u2019s payrolls, only moved to close non-essential businesses in the middle of last week, so the surge in claims in those states is likely to show up in the next report. States have moved to extend unemployment benefits to gig workers employed by Uber, Lyft and others, but not all of them have yet been able to make claims. Others have chosen to stop working for health reasons and have yet to apply for benefits.</p> <p>Eric Anderson, 63, a grocery store worker in Mulberry, Florida, recently quit his job because he is in the high-risk coronavirus category because of his age and diabetes.

  "<h2>Beatle grip holds Paul</h2> <p>by Jackie Leishman<br>11 April 1970</p> <p>Paul McCartney confirmed yesterday that he had broken with the Beatles. But it seems certain that even if he wants to, circumstances will prevent him from straying too far.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/09/shattered-paul-weller-booker-beatles-split-50-years-ago-fans\">'I was shattered' \u2013 Paul Weller, Booker T and more on the day the Beatles split</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The issue is complicated by McCartney\u2019s refusal to speak to the world beyond filling in the answers to a questionnaire drawn up by the Beatles\u2019 organisation, Apple. He did say then he did not know whether his break with the Beatles was temporary or permanent; that he did not have any relationship with Mr Alan Klein, the Beatles business manager (a figure of some importance in this matter); that Mr Klein did not represent him in any way; that he had no plans to record with other Beatle members in the future; that he could not imagine writing with John Lennon again; and that in making his first solo album he had not missed the talents of the other Beatles.</p> <p>Mr Klein said that McCartney\u2019s statement had not changed things from what they were six or 12 months ago. But he did recognise \u201cthat Paul is antipathetic towards me\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s never pleasant when someone appears not to like you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Personal problems</strong><br>Mr Klein added: \u201cPaul has his own personal problems, but at the same time he is obligated into Apple for a number of years and he is as aware as anybody else in the organisation that if he broke his contract, which he couldn\u2019t do anyway, it would be financially disastrous from a tax point of view for John, George, Ringo and himself.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Klein, speaking at Apple headquarters, said it had never been a secret that Paul had always wanted his father-in-law, Mr Lee Eastman, in the job the other three Beatles voted Klein into last May.</p> <h2>Fly away Paul</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/02/edward-greenfield\">Edward Greenfield</a> assesses the Beatles\u2019 achievements<br>11 April 1970</p> <p>Leonard Bernstein, the greatest leaper of barriers the modern world of music has known, commented not so long ago on an opera he planned to write. \u201cI keep having visions,\u201d he said, \u201cof four young men playing guitars.\u201d The Beatles for longer than anyone thought possible were an inescapable force. Not only Bernstein, not only the Times music critic (whose comment on the Beatles\u2019s \u201cPandiatonic clusters\u201d has become a classic critical quotation) but anyone with an ear for a distinctive sound, a good tune and bags of energy, could readily understand that here was something beyond the normal confines of \u201cpop.\u201d From the start, there was far too much to explain away in terms of high powered promotion.</p> <p>It was of course, a team job, involving not just the four young men themselves, but the shrewd guidance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1967/aug/28/fromthearchive\">Brian Epstein</a>, their manager, and more important still the musical tutelage of their recording manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/13/beatles-george-martin-1969\">George Martin</a>. From the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/oct/04/beatles-anthology-band-reviewed\">start</a> they always had a talent for inventing memorable ideas usually in the form of good tunes, but that talent was initially obscure enough to elude a whole battery of record promoters who turned them down before George Martin, in charge of the Parlophone label, somewhat diffidently gave them a test and took to them at once. They took to him too, largely because they knew he was responsible for the Goon records.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"770407b3499b4311b5ec57a270b38bd8ff4f7495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/770407b3499b4311b5ec57a270b38bd8ff4f7495/0_182_3265_1959/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Beatles fans gathered outside the London office of Apple, some reading a newspaper story which said that Paul McCartney was leaving the group, 10 April 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beatles fans gathered outside the London office of Apple, some reading a newspaper story which said that Paul McCartney was leaving the group, 10 April 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Kemp/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Psychedelic \u201cring\u201d cycle<br></strong>I remember about a year ago very seriously sitting down one Saturday afternoon to what became a sort of psychedelic \u201cring\u201d cycle \u2013 the Beatles LPs played in chronological order. Once I had adjusted to the decibel level, it became a fascinating exercise, for unlike almost any other major pop composers, they developed perceptively from one LP to the next. Certain elements were there from the beginning \u2013 above all the ability to throw off a memorable turn of melody \u2013 but their aims and achievement gradually expanded. I know many intellectual Beatles fanatics feel that the culmination came in Sergeant Pepper when the media got well and truly mixed, Stockhausen was invoked, and psychedelia ran riot. That for many became a sort of Beatle \u201cthird period,\u201d to be treated with a reverence normally reserved for late Beethoven.</p> <p>My own feeling \u2013 particularly after my Beatles \u201cring\u201d cycle \u2013 is that the resorting to mixed media, the development of electronic ideas to the point where they submerged the music, was interesting, but marked a deteriorating of their musical inventiveness. Like Noel Coward or Cole Porter, they have been above all good tunesmiths (arguably Lennon and McCartney have written more good tunes loan anyone else since the war except Benjamin Britten) and an LP like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/15/beatles-revolver-review-pop-archive\">Revolver</a> with its sweet McCartney numbers For No One and Here, There and Everywhere marks the high point, the period which developed from the haunting Yesterday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/19/beatles-solo-albums-reviewed-1970\">The Beatles' solo albums reviewed - archive, 19 December 1970</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Beatles may be gone as a group, but not as exuberant individuals. I have long been curious to find out exactly who did what and whose talent was really dominant. George Harrison\u2019s numbers have only latterly struck out with the sort of musical invention that marked Lennon and McCartney from the start. As between John and Paul one would expect dominance in words from the one, dominance in music from the other. It was not in fact as simple as that, but my hunch is that Paul McCartney was the main talent. It may be that without the abrasive contact of his colleagues, his melodic gift will peter out. I hope not. With any luck we have here a major inventor of tunes for 50 years to come. As a start I\u2019m looking forward to his individual LP.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/04/06/18_April.jpg\">It\u2019s been a hard day\u2019s social change</a></h2> <p>by Keith Dewhurst<br>18 April 1970</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23e90a43d9192e0751f9da1134150c7b5c2dc8b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23e90a43d9192e0751f9da1134150c7b5c2dc8b9/0_3_1579_947/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 18 April 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 18 April 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

  "<p>Just a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province.</p> <p>It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China\u2019s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai\u2019s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over.</p> <p>China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cWe still haven\u2019t been told what to do, except that we can\u2019t sell or release or even cull them until further notice, so we\u2019re still keeping them, and that\u2019s been costing us about 300 yuan [\u00a334] per day for the past three months,\u201d Yongcai, 30, told the Guardian by phone.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to transition to other types of business but until it\u2019s clear what to do with the rats, it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would need funding and the right facility for that.\u201d</p> <p>Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak.</p> <p>Certain types of bats and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/pangolins-might-have-spread-coronavirus-to-humans\">pangolins </a>have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-closures-reveal-vast-scale-of-chinas-secretive-wildlife-farm-industry\">Coronavirus closures reveal vast scale of China\u2019s secretive wildlife farm industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the Guardian could find, which <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.cn/main/4818/content-796749.html\">appears to be dated 2008</a>, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats.</p> <p>Yet, local governments, the state forestry and grassland administration and their provincial bureaus have encouraged and supported all sorts of wildlife farms. \u201cThe real number could be hundreds or even over a thousand kinds [of wild animal species] with no regulation,\u201d said Yin Shanchuan, a volunteer with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation who has long been involved in investigations with the group.</p> <p>\u201cSomehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,\u201d Yin said.</p> <p>Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the Guardian on 3 April.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to invest a lot, you don\u2019t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.\u201d</p> <p>Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China\u2019s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers <a href=\"http://www.zhushuxs.com/news/zhengcefagui/576.html\">feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen</a> and the local government.</p> <p>But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade <a href=\"https://www.yicai.com/news/100558841.html\">230 families who </a><a href=\"https://www.yicai.com/news/100558841.html\">went into breeding </a>bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to \u00a323,000 per operation.</p> <p>Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. \u201cAfter the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,\u201d he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he\u2019ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful.</p> <p>Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn\u2019t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he\u2019ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that\u2019s just for the impoverished household breeders,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cFor regular breeders, we\u2019re still on our own and awaiting a decision.\u201d</p> <p>What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a0f7e84165ffff4a489c44957c9d4e6ee9cf7f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0f7e84165ffff4a489c44957c9d4e6ee9cf7f5/0_198_4029_2417/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bamboo rats at a farm in Qinzhou, in south China\u2019s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bamboo rats at a farm in Qinzhou, in south China\u2019s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer.</p> <p>Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\">African </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\">swine </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\">fever among China\u2019s pig farms </a>in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease.</p> <p>\u201cI am optimistic that bamboo rats won\u2019t be included in the livestock and poultry list,\u201d Aili Kang, Asia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told the Guardian. \u201cCurrently, the law does not use very biological or ecological definitions. Nor do they use a very pure [definitions] from a zoonotic disease kind of component.\u201d <br><br>As for Yongcai, he understands that animals can carry viruses and disease, and while he previously sanitised his operation once a month, he is now required to do so each week for the rats that remain in limbo.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, there\u2019s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>Parents and pediatricians across the US are not vaccinating their children during the coronavirus pandemic, leading experts to warn that such delays could cause outbreaks of preventable diseases later in the year.</p> <p>\u201cImmunization is an essential health service which may be affected by the current Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the World Health Organization said recently in a statement. \u201cDisruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.\u201d</p> <p>Amid the Covid-19 public health crisis, some parents who normally support vaccinations are recoiling at the idea of taking their kids to a doctor\u2019s office. Meanwhile, providers are figuring out whether they can safely treat all their young patients in-person, and if not, which children take priority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-kids-risks-can-they-infect-adults\">How can I keep kids safe from coronavirus \u2013 and can they infect me?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lauren Begen\u2019s son was supposed to go for his six-month vaccines in mid-April. But, as Boston barrels toward the apex of its Covid-19 outbreak, their family is staying at home as much as possible to avoid exposure to the virus. They\u2019re making decisions they never thought possible, including delaying their baby\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html\">booster</a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html\"> vaccinations</a> after speaking with their doctor.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t love it, but I think honestly it was kind of obvious,\u201d Begen said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ve put a lot of practices in place to protect themselves and patients, but the reality is you can only do so much.\u201d</p> <h2>The risk of prevention</h2> <p>It\u2019s a series of calculations that will, at best, cause short-term delays in some children\u2019s immunizations and at worst could lead to outbreaks or even a potential epidemic, experts say. The extent of the problem depends on how long vaccinations get pushed back and whether children who have missed a dose or two can get on their doctors\u2019 calendars before returning to school or daycare.</p> <p>Doctors in the US are supposed to administer doses of the same vaccine every few months to the infants in their care. Such inoculations ward off serious conditions such as rotavirus, pertussis (AKA whooping cough), tetanus and polio, according to the recommended child and adolescent immunization schedule for 2020.</p> <p>\u201cCould we see an outbreak, let\u2019s say, six months from now? Yeah, I think we can,\u201d said Leila M Iravani, a pediatrician at Total Pediatrics of Orange County in Costa Mesa, California. \u201cI think so. We\u2019ll see sicker kids because they were not immunized.\u201d</p> <p>Iravani usually examines between 15 and 18 children every day for checkups. But during the coronavirus pandemic, that number has more than halved due to cancellations and no-shows. She estimated that up to 60% of those missed appointments are for vaccines, and probably 50% of those are younger than two.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do telemedicine for the development, but those vaccines are gonna be the thing that\u2019s gonna protect them,\u201d Iravani said.</p> <p>Her practice is trying to chase down its patients who are most at risk if they don\u2019t get their vaccinations on time. Parents of two-month-olds are still largely coming to their checkups, she said; older babies, less so.</p> <p>Sometimes, parents claim they forgot their appointment and reschedule, only to flake a second time. It\u2019s an unprecedented turn of events for Iravani, who has been practicing medicine for 17 years.</p> <p>\u201cThis just speaks to the worry that a lot of parents have. They just don\u2019t want to risk coming out,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, the US has been dealing with isolated outbreaks of preventable diseases as states saw a decline in the number of vaccinated young children due to misinformation and fear of inoculations. In April 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/s0424-highest-measles-cases-since-elimination.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) announced the greatest number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/24/measles-cases-25-year-high-anti-vaxx-vaccine\">measles cases in the country</a> since 2000, when the ailment was eliminated domestically.</p> <h2>Youngest get top priority</h2> <p>Other healthcare providers the Guardian contacted said they haven\u2019t experienced the same dramatic dip in visits as Iravani has seen. But they in turn have had to change whom they allow into their offices \u2013 and, as an extension, which children get their vaccinations as expected.</p> <p>In the face of Covid-19, the <a href=\"https://services.aap.org/en/pages/covid-19-clinical-guidance-q-a/\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> (AAP) has said that \u201cimmunizing the youngest children is top priority\u201d. So, at Cook Children\u2019s Pediatrics Trophy Club in Texas, checkups for healthy kids who are older than 18 months have been temporarily postponed. Justin Smith, the pediatrician there, said he\u2019s asking families to call back in May for an update or to reschedule.</p> <p>Likewise, Mary\u2019s Center, a community health center with locations in Washington DC and Maryland, has decided to cut off immunizations right now at 15 months, knowing they\u2019ll have to do a big push this summer to bring kids in who missed their vaccines.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of our patients have to take three or four buses\u201d to reach the medical centers, said Jessica Schroeder, director of pediatrics for the group. \u201cThere\u2019d be a lot of exposure to try to get to the clinic.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html\">Vaccines for Children</a> \u2013 a federally funded program that gives free immunizations to families who can\u2019t afford them \u2013 reached out to the nurse manager at Mary\u2019s Center about the drop in their orders and use of vaccines, Schroeder said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put kids at risk for getting sick, yet you don\u2019t want a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/signs-symptoms.html\">pertussis</a> outbreak either.\u201d</p> <p>In New York, Tova Bourque got a call from her eight-month-old son\u2019s doctor cancelling his hepatitis B vaccine for later this month. She was frustrated with the situation of the pandemic, but understood her doctor\u2019s actions.</p> <p>\u201cI like things on schedule, so I\u2019m kind of not happy about it,\u201d Bourque said. \u201cBut at the same time, like, I don\u2019t want to go to some germ fest.\u201d</p> <p>Pediatricians are being careful, limiting the number of people attending visits, taking everyone\u2019s temperature before letting them inside, funneling patients straight to exam rooms and asking providers to wear masks. Some offices are having virtual sick visits or moving sick care to the afternoons only.</p> <p>But not all people who are Covid-19 positive show symptoms, and some screening methods \u2013 such as asking whether other family members are sick \u2013 rely on the honor system. At the same time, pediatricians are fielding different risks depending on how many coronavirus cases are confirmed in their area and whether they have the luxury of converting one of their offices to care exclusively for sick patients, said Kate Williamson, a pediatrician in Ladera Ranch, California, and spokeswoman for AAP.</p> <p>\u201cCall your [healthcare] provider,\u201d advised William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor at <a href=\"https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mph/2015/06/18/national-foundation-for-infectious-diseases-selects-william-schaffner-m-d-as-new-medical-director/\">Vanderbilt University </a><a href=\"https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mph/2015/06/18/national-foundation-for-infectious-diseases-selects-william-schaffner-m-d-as-new-medical-director/\">school of </a><a href=\"https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mph/2015/06/18/national-foundation-for-infectious-diseases-selects-william-schaffner-m-d-as-new-medical-director/\">medicine</a>. \u201cHave a discussion with people in the office. Listen carefully to their instructions about what it is to do, and how we can do this with maximum safety.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Hagan Blades, a new mom to Arthur, said she felt better after learning his doctor\u2019s practice wasn\u2019t seeing sick kids in the office any more. Neither she nor Arthur has ventured beyond their home in Brooklyn, New York, since the first week of March, a stark contrast to her fantasies of picnics in the park with her newborn.</p> <p>But on Thursday, Blades will don a mask, cover Arthur in his stroller and walk 40 minutes to his pediatrician\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cI have concerns about leaving the house with him obviously, but I think that getting the vaccines are more important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be stupid to get a preventable disease because we\u2019re trying to avoid Covid.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Like life itself, cooking at home is likely to change radically in the coming months. It will be a sanctuary for some and a chore for others, but in an era of lockdowns, we will all sometimes be frustrated by not having this or that ingredient to hand \u2013 and no longer being able to pop out to get it. How you work around that lack of ingredients may determine how well you eat in 2020. To help, we asked various chefs and expert foodies \u2013 the kind of people who improvise every day \u2013 for their tips on how to best substitute in and swap out key ingredients while still creating delicious meals.</p> <h2>Salt</h2> <p>The simple substitute, reckons Louis Korovilas, the executive head chef at Tavolino in central London, is \u201cdigging out a crushed stock cube from the back of the cupboard\u201d. Alternatively, suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/24/the-chefs-who-are-closing-for-dinner-to-pursue-a-healthier-life\">Stuart Ralston</a>, the chef-owner of Noto and Aizle in Edinburgh: \u201cSoy sauce is a direct replacement that gives better flavour.\u201d Ralston would use soy in everything from stews to, if pushed, a white sauce for fish: \u201cRight now, I can\u2019t think of any broad rule of: \u2018It can\u2019t go in X.\u2019 Go ahead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb8af506ac72b7c6b56991fa12668d0a8d84697d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8af506ac72b7c6b56991fa12668d0a8d84697d/275_121_1780_3383/526.jpg\" alt=\"Soy sauce\" width=\"526\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A better flavour ... soy sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: donatas1205/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom Cenci, the chef at the Loyal Tavern in south-east London, flags up salty staple ingredients such as capers, parmesan and anchovies, while Aktar Islam, from Opheem in Birmingham, recommends the brine from tinned pulses: \u201cThere\u2019s a Bajan recipe I do that uses lentils. I never season it, because I just pour the brine in, while cooking the lentils.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/14/cheese-story-really-grated-restaurant-charged-extra-parmesan\">Mitshel Ibrahim</a>, the head chef at Ombra in east London, says: \u201cIf it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been busy with in quarantine, most lacto-fermented vegetables have a good amount of salt. They can be added to stews or sauces if you\u2019re looking for a multilayered addition of acidity, salt and funk.\u201d</p> <p>But do you need salt? \u201cI learned from the chef Olivier Roellinger that spices can create a richer flavour profile,\u201d says Apollonia Poil\u00e2ne, the CEO of the French bakery Poil\u00e2ne. \u201cI never suggest salt and pepper in recipes, but rather spice.\u201d</p> <h2>Butter</h2> <p>\u201cYou can substitute most fats for other fats. You can make biscuits with vegetable or olive oil. Cheaper neutral oils are best. Fancy olive oil would make it a bit funky,\u201d says Ralston.</p> <h2>Lemons</h2> <p>A few drops of vinegar will lend the required acidic edge to sauces and salads, while Ottolenghi lovers should double-check their spice drawers. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, you may have some sumac you can substitute,\u201d says Paolo Saba, the executive chef at Madera in central London.</p> <p>Given that oranges, lemons and limes go off fairly quickly in the fridge, Richard De La Cruz, the head chef at Arros QD in central London, recommends freezing the juice in ice cube moulds in the freezer, \u201cready to be used when needed\u201d. Esther Miglio, the chef-owner of OWT in Leeds, zests all her lemon rinds, freezes this citrus snow and uses it \u201cto season as you would salt and pepper. Freeze the zest on baking parchment and, once dry, place into a sealed bag. It\u2019ll last six months.\u201d</p> <h2>Mayonnaise</h2> <p>\u201cUHT soy milk is not just for millennial lattes,\u201d says Alex Claridge from The Wilderness in Birmingham. \u201cIt can be stick-blended into a mayo using vinegar and rapeseed or sunflower oil (125ml soy milk, two teaspoons vinegar, 250ml oil, seasoning). I think I speak for the majority when I say dips are going to be a pivotal part of isolation cuisine and, if you add miso paste, it\u2019s pretty compelling.\u201d</p> <h2>Cooking wine</h2> <p>\u201cYou can use any alcohol to deglaze pans or make a stew. I\u2019ll be saving my wine for drinking, so I may be experimenting heavily with those dusty bottles in the back of the cupboard,\u201d says Sven-Hanson Britt from Oxeye in central London. \u201cI\u2019m 100% confident that \u2018chicken \u00e0 la Baileys\u2019 is going to be delicious.\u201d</p> <p>In braises, stews and ragouts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gizzi-erskine\">Gizzi Erskine</a>, the food writer and chef at The Nitery in central London, would replace wine with a <em>gastrique</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s a technique of acidulating caramelised sugar to boost the balance of sweet and sour umami in a dish. I do a shortcut at home of one tablespoon of sugar melted into two tablespoons of vinegar. I use sherry vinegar, but use whatever you have. Reduce that down to about one tablespoon of syrup and add it to the dish. It\u2019s amazing something simple can do so much.\u201d</p> <h2>Flour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82d94ddf4471ef60fa2d3633362f6faef3e3e0b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82d94ddf4471ef60fa2d3633362f6faef3e3e0b4/0_231_4844_2908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stale loaf of bread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waste not, want not ... bread can be used to make a b\u00e9chamel or to thicken soup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Dorling Kindersley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most baking requires flour. But if you are using it to thicken a soup or a sauce, you have options. \u201cAdding a few slices of potato during cooking helps thicken a stew,\u201d says Ryan Blackburn, the chef at the Old Stamp House in Ambleside, Cumbria. As does rice, says Saba: \u201cGrind it into powder in a food processor and substitute.\u201d</p> <p>Si Toft, the chef-owner at The Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd, has a more 70s suggestion: \u201cI\u2019ll get chucked out of chefs club for this, but Smash is quality. Use it instead of flour to hold fish cakes or thicken a sauce. It\u2019s basically tasteless. Disclaimer: I don\u2019t use Smash at work. I use gluten-free flour, which is just trendy Smash.\u201d</p> <p>For a b\u00e9chamel, says Britt, use \u201cdry bread crusts, biscuits, crackers or anything of that ilk and crush them into a fine powder\u201d, then mix that with butter to create a roux.</p> <p>More generally, do not waste bread, advises Rachel Stockley, the chef at Baraxturi in Ramsbottom, near Bury: \u201cIt can be stretched out as breadcrumbs for topping oven bakes or as croutons to bulk out salads. I like to blend torn stale bread into soups to thicken them, like our garlic soup. It is four main ingredients: chicken stock, a garlic bulb, bread, olive oil.\u201d</p> <h2>Cheese</h2> <p>\u201cIn dire times,\u201d says Claridge, \u201cumami-rich yeast flakes provide a passable substitute for parmesan cheese in sauces, and as a topping.\u201d</p> <h2>Vinegar</h2> <p>Britt recommends retaining and/or repurposing liquid from a jar of something pickled, such as ginger or cornichons: \u201cEven high-acidity apple juice will do a similar job to vinegar in your cooking.\u201d Kombucha fans may be interested to know, says Ibrahim, that, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/07/pickle-ferment-recipes-six-of-the-best\">using a scoby</a> (a fermentation-starting combination of bacteria and yeast), \u201cyou can quite easily turn an unfinished bottle of wine into vinegar.\u201d</p> <h2>Sugar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"831c8e0d618fc7d03a4c14f6020baf5b2a7aaf61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/831c8e0d618fc7d03a4c14f6020baf5b2a7aaf61/356_282_3445_4308/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jar of Honey and honeycomb\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A ready-made replacement ... honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Groesbeck/UHL/Getty Images/Digital Vision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou can use maple syrup, honey or golden syrup pretty much anywhere you\u2019d find sugar,\u201d says Ralston. You could also use waste syrup from tinned fruit, intensify sweetness in desserts by adding a pinch of cinnamon (a tip from Lina Stores\u2019 head chef, Masha Rener), or deploy vegetables with a higher sugar content (parsnips, beetroots, carrots, sweet potatoes, courgette) in your baking as a way to build in sweetness. This will take trial and error, however. As Poil\u00e2ne points out: \u201cGenerally, you can halve the sugar content of recipes without affecting their chemical balance.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Rice</strong></h2> <p>\u201cLook for alternatives: ancient grains and pulses such as pearl barley, buckwheat, bulgur wheat, millet and lentils,\u201d advises Irina Georgescu, the author of the cookbook Carpathia.</p> <h2>Fresh garlic</h2> <p>Chefs used to shudder at the very idea of using dried garlic granules. A man made for these febrile times, Toft takes a more pragmatic line: \u201cAt home, where we don\u2019t get through the same quantity, dried garlic is brilliant. Also, I have a bottle of oil I\u2019ve been topping up since about 1997 that\u2019s got a load of leftover garlic cloves in it. I use it when I\u2019m browning meat, rather than messing around with fresh garlic.\u201d (Note, though, that the incorrect preparation and storage of garlic-infused oil can give rise to botulism. Thoroughly research the process online before proceeding.)</p> <h2><strong>Meat</strong></h2> <p>Without getting bogged down in the effectiveness or, in this crisis, the availability of meat substitutes (tofu, jackfruit etc), what you certainly can do with dishes in the cottage-pie-to-ragout sphere is bulk out what meat you have. \u201cYou could go Scottish and stretch ground meat with oats and suet,\u201d says the chef Nina Matsunaga, from the Black Bull in Sedbergh, Cumbria. \u201cOr mince or dice any veg and mix it through.\u201d</p> <p>Toft suggests lengthening bolognese sauce with bread: \u201cI put Marmite through mine at home, because I prefer the flavour over stock cubes, so do that as well. It won\u2019t fool [the renowned Italian chef] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/21/massimo-bottura-feed-the-hungry-food-for-soul\">Massimo Bottura</a>, but it\u2019s tasty and packed with vitamins.\u201d</p> <p>Barley, chickpeas and lentils will do a similar job \u2013 or, says Claridge, go full vegan: \u201cWith the world increasingly dark, it was only a matter of time before you had to summon seitan. Add it to curries and stews. It\u2019s tinned and, I guarantee, avoided most panic-buying lists.\u201d</p> <h2>Pesto</h2> <p>\u201cAt work, I make a pesto every day from blanched kale, parsley stalks, pumpkin seeds and garlic oil.

If you crave the real thing, says Officina 00\u2019s chef Elia Sebregondi, you can make a rudimentary pasta, such as the tiny, Sugar Puff-shaped cavatelli, with flour and water: \u201cUse some semolina flour, which has a lot more protein and nutritional value.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a little more deliciousness,\u201d says Britt, \u201cmake some fresh sp\u00e4tzle or eastern European-style hand-cut noodles, which cook like pasta.\u201d You will need eggs and some patience; for a primer, see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/20/how-to-make-perfect-spatzle-noodles-recipe-felicity-cloake\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s How to cook the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/20/how-to-make-perfect-spatzle-noodles-recipe-felicity-cloake\">perfect \u2026</a> on the subject.</p> <h2>Potatoes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d438cbb8c32ea75dca478af91fdcd4378400de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d438cbb8c32ea75dca478af91fdcd4378400de/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerusalem artichokes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The same comforting texture \u2013 and more flavour ... jerusalem artichokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images/Westend61</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOther big root vegetables can work as well, such as celeriac or swede, and can often offer better flavour,\u201d says Cenci.

Ben Tish, of Norma in central London, rates brown sauce or ketchup as \u201cconcentrated replacements for wine, vinegar and salt in ragouts and stews. They contain an array of spices, have bags of flavour and depth, and they also add colour, particularly brown sauce, if you are short on gravy granules.\u201d</p> <p>More challenging is Ibrahim\u2019s frugal suggestion of saving whey from bagged mozzarella, bringing it to a rapid boil, then simmering it until it caramelises: \u201cThe result is a punchy, acidic elixir with a very strong, meaty taste that can be used as a flavour enhancer.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 April 2020 to include information on garlic and botulism.</p>",

  "<p>Should I vote or should I protect my health? That was the stark choice that Wisconsin voters faced on Tuesday \u2013 thanks to their elected state representatives. Like much of the rest of the nation, Wisconsin is under a statewide stay-at-home order. The order is designed to slow the spread of a disease that has already sickened nearly half a million Americans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">taken the lives of 13,000</a>.</p> <p>Given the gravity of the threat, the mayors of Wisconsin\u2019s 10 largest cities <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/907052/wisconsin-mayors-say-tuesday-primary-hundreds-thousands-citizens-risk\">urged</a> the state to delay the Tuesday election \u2013 lest the state put \u201chundreds of thousands of citizens at risk by requiring them to vote at the polls while this ugly pandemic spreads\u201d. Nearly a dozen other states had already chosen to postpone their primaries given the national state of emergency. Invoking his emergency powers, the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, likewise sought to delay the election until early June.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/wisconsin-coronavirus-black-communities-inequality\">Wisconsin's primary subjected people of color to yet another Covid-19 disadvantage | David Bowen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Wisconsin said no. In a decision staggering in its cynicism and recklessness, the Republican-controlled state legislature flatly refused to delay the election. What did they hope to gain?</p> <p>Yes, there was the Democratic primary, but that was of little concern to the Republican lawmakers. Of great concern, however, was Tuesday\u2019s vote in a state supreme court contest. This vote pitted the sitting state supreme court justice Daniel Kelly, a strong conservative voice on the bench, against Jill Karofsky, a lower court judge supported by progressives.</p> <p>Never mind that America is alone among advanced democracies in permitting many state judges to be elected officials. In this case, Republican lawmakers hoped that by suppressing the urban vote, they would help Kelly\u2019s re-election bid. This, in itself, was nothing new; suppressing the vote of urban and minority citizens has emerged as staple of Republican politics in recent years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Suppressing the vote of urban and minority citizens has emerged as staple of Republican politics in recent years.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unusual here was only the brazen willingness to use a pandemic \u2013 rather, than say, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wisconsin-voter-id_n_59ca6e60e4b01cc57ff5bdd5\">voter IDs</a> \u2013 as the means of suppression. And so Republican lawmakers forced urban voters into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice\">Hobson\u2019s choice</a>: head to one of the few available polling stations \u2013 in Milwaukee only <em>five</em> of 180 designated polling stations were open \u2013 and risk exposure to Covid-19, or follow the state\u2019s stay-at-home order.</p> <p>Still, much of the chaos and hardship could have been avoided had the state chosen to rely more heavily on absentee ballots. Such ballots permit citizens to vote by mail, and so Wisconsin voters could have had their voice heard without sacrificing their health. But here again Republican lawmakers said no, racing to the US supreme court to bar an extended reliance on absentee ballots.</p> <p>On Monday, in a per curiam decision \u2013 that is, a decision arrived at without full argument and briefing \u2013 the supreme court refused to extend by a week the deadline by which an absentee ballot could be postmarked. Writing for the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh cast the issue before the court as \u201ca narrow, technical question about the absentee ballot process,\u201d but the fact that the decision broke 5-4 along the court\u2019s sharp ideological divide belies Kavanaugh\u2019s characterization.</p> <p>Indeed, in her <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/ruth-bader-ginsburg-slams-supreme-court-decision-on-wisconsin-voting/\">passionate dissent</a>, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed that the court\u2019s decision \u201cwill result in massive disenfranchisement\u201d \u2013 which of course is exactly what Wisconsin Republicans hoped for in taking their case to court.</p> <p>All this is as shocking as it is unsurprising. Wisconsin, once a thriving crucible of progressive politics, has turned into a vanguard of the Republican assault on democracy. Remember that the commanding Republican advantage in the state assembly is itself a creature of grotesque gerrymandering: despite winning only 46% of the state vote in 2018, state Republicans succeeded in capturing 66 of the 99 seats in the state assembly. Recall, too, that no sooner had Tony Evers secured the governorship in 2018, then this same gerrymandered body raced to strip the newly elected Democrat of powers long enjoyed by the state\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>Tuesday, then, presented a scene as chaotic and alarming as it was inspiring. Intrepid poll workers, outfitted in jerry-rigged Hazmat suits, dutifully processed ballots. Senior citizens in masks stood for hours in snaking lines, waiting to vote.</p> <p>It\u2019s too early to tell whether Wisconsin Republicans will be rewarded in their willingness to use a public health emergency to extract a narrow partisan advantage. The results of Tuesday\u2019s vote will not be announced until 13 April. But the damage done to American democracy is all too visible. And the Wisconsin experience might well be a harbinger of things to come in November 2020.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lawrence Douglas is the James J Grosfeld professor of law, jurisprudence and social thought at Amherst College and a contributing opinion writer for Guardian US.

And hospitals are already rationing protective equipment and testing swabs.</p> <p>To deal with the unprecedented circumstance, and in the absence of federal guidance, hospitals have formed triage committees to guide life-and-death decisions.

Patients aged 70 and older are far more susceptible to Covid-19, and many worry that will put the elderly at a disadvantage to receive life-saving care. But ethicists say that\u2019s not the reality. They said older people could be lower priority for ventilators, but because of a higher likelihood of underlying health conditions, not age.</p> <p>\u201cI hope the public will recognize these triage plans are being developed by heartbroken health professions, for whom there\u2019s going to be tremendous suffering and [post-traumatic stress disorder],\u201d said Solomon.</p> <p>While \u201csurvivability\u201d has emerged as the most widely accepted metric for hospital ethics boards, it is not without critics. Such triage has been described as<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\"> \u201cdeath panels\u201d</a>, and some argue care should be on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis. Others have argued that underlying health conditions of demographic groups in the United States will lead to disparate treatment in critical situations.</p> <p>Critics argue metrics of survivability will prioritize the healthy, and \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d would be fairer. However, many ethicists believe this model is the \u201cmost corruptible\u201d, and will inevitably disadvantage people with less baseline access to healthcare. \u201cPeople who aren\u2019t in the know or don\u2019t have transportation are unlikely to be first in line,\u201d said Solomon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ethicists said they have been excluded from higher-level decision making during this \u201cextraordinary\u201d time. When Donald Trump took office, his administration declined to impanel a national committee on bioethics, breaking a generations-long tradition beginning with President Gerald Ford in 1974.</p> <p>\u201cI believe completely that having a panel of experienced bioethicists at the disposal of the president, as President Obama, would have been helpful to the Trump administration,\u201d said Anita Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Carey law school, who also served on President Obama\u2019s bioethics commission. For upheaval similar to that caused by Covid-19, she said, Americans would have to look back to the second world war.</p> <p>Boyd went further: \u201cThe response from the federal level has been appalling across every single front.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of a federal panel, which would have probably begun considering issues of scarcity as early as January, bioethicists have been left to coordinate with states, hospitals and even individual agencies on how to allocate scarce medical resources. More than 1,400 leading bioethicists urged the Trump administration to tackle this issue in mid-March, but the administration only began to heed such advice last week.</p> <p>Amid the piecemeal guidance, workers at all levels of the country\u2019s healthcare system are scrambling to stretch their resources on the ground. At the center of the outbreak in New York and New Jersey, hospitals have converted anesthesia and \u201cBiPap\u201d machines (often used by sufferers of sleep apnea) into ventilators.</p> <p>Physicians at hospitals in New York City said that they haven\u2019t yet been provided any specific new guidelines for how to triage or care for new patients. A doctor at Elmhurst hospital, the center of New York\u2019s coronavirus cases, said he has multiple conversations with patients and their families every day about whether or not they should go to the ICU or be put on a ventilator.</p> <p>Pressure on local hospitals extends past the doors of the emergency rooms. EMT workers in cities such as Paterson, New Jersey, to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-emt-workers.html\"> avoid bringing people to the hospital</a>. There, emergency medical technicians from the local fire department determine whether patients are in such severe respiratory distress that they should come to the emergency room.</p> <p>With the entire health system stretched to its maximum, a patient\u2019s life during the pandemic will depend not just on triage teams at hospitals, but on every health worker in their journey along the way.</p> <p>\u201cNow, we have ethics decisions at the bedside, or by the ambulance driver, or the ICU doctor in terms of when is it time to stop,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, the founding head of medical ethics at New York University\u2019s school of medicine in New York City.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies are going to be seeing a loved one die \u2013 not necessarily from Covid \u2013 that normally they would not,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>More than 35,000km (21,750 miles) of coastline was always going to be Australia\u2019s strongest advantage in keeping coronavirus at bay, but even so, the speed with which it was used was breathtaking.</p> \n<p>Without warning on Thursday 19 March, the Australian prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/australian-government-moves-to-close-borders-as-new-coronavirus-cases-continue-to-rise\">Scott Morrison, announced</a>: \u201cAustralia is closing its borders to all-non citizens\u201d. The ban was effective from 9pm the next day.</p> \n<p>That left visitors and visa holders stranded mid-journey, or turned around at the border and packed back on to planes, and left hundreds of thousands of Australians scrambling to get home, many of whom remain stuck in countries similarly locked down or without flights home.</p> \n<p>Australia and neighbouring New Zealand, almost unique among anglophone countries, have so far been successful in largely suppressing the spread of Covid-19 within their countries, and in particular, keeping deaths low.</p> \n<p>Australia, with a population of 25 million, has had just over 6,000 infections, and 50 deaths. New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, which closed its borders the day before Australia, has had 1,200 infections and so far only one death from Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both countries have enacted strict physical distancing regimes, enforced by police. Planes have been grounded, workers have been told to stay home, schools have been closed in some places, and entire industries put into hibernation.</p> \n<p>Across most of both countries, it is unlawful to be outside without the \u201creasonable excuse\u201d of essential shopping, medical care, exercise, or compassionate grounds. In both countries, the majority of confirmed cases have originated overseas. Community transmission remains, by international comparison, low\u2013 less than 10% of all confirmed cases.</p> \n<p>And in both countries, the early decision, and the capability, to enforce a total lockdown of borders has proven crucial, buying valuable time to prepare, and allowing both nations to flatten the trajectory of their Covid-19 infection curves.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas, whether it be initially in China in Wuhan, or in New York in the United States, or Italy, or Spain, or even the United Kingdom,\u201d Morrison said this week. \u201cBut we must hold the course. We must lock in these gains.\u201d</p> \n<p>Australia has inherent advantages. If a country were to be designed to withstand a viral pandemic such as Covid-19, it would look very much like Australia: geographically distant, a large island nation with borders than can be locked down, inhabited by a comparatively small population that lives, in the main, in low-density cities.</p> \n<p>Australia is wealthy, too, with a highly developed public health system, and a government sufficiently solvent to be able to turn on the tap of public monies to get its population through the months of lockdown.

The delay has given it time to prepare its public health system \u2013 additional beds and staff have been readied for the coming peak\u2013 as well as its public. Internal restrictions have also been put in place. Australia\u2019s states have closed their borders to each other for the first time since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.</p> \n<p>There have been significant and severe missteps, the most egregious being the decision in March to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock</a> at Circular Quay in Sydney Harbour, allowing more than 2,700 passengers to disembark without testing, despite there being people with Covid-19 infections onboard.</p> \n<p>That ship is now responsible for more than 660 infections \u2013 10% of Australia\u2019s total \u2013 and at least 15 deaths. The New South Wales (NSW) and federal governments have since spent weeks blaming each other and the cruise ship company for the debacle: the decision is now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">subject of a criminal investigation</a> by police.</p> \n<p>Another misstep was at Sydney airport. Just as physical distancing laws were being imposed across the country, social media videos showed border force officials corralling arriving passengers from all over the world to wait in cramped halls and tight queues.</p> \n<p>Apart from the impact of these failures on infection rates, they have damaged public confidence in the government\u2019s measures. Just as the country, state by state, was being put into lockdown, governments were undermining their own messages to self-isolate to save lives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There has been, too, overreaction.

The borders remain closed to foreign nationals, and mandatory quarantining of arrivals is to be introduced today.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have positive signs, not least the fact that we could have had 4,000 cases now, instead of 1,000,\u201d Ardern said.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves.\u201d</p>",

More than 300 people had applied in a week to become residents of the popular holiday destination.</p> <p>The state\u2019s disaster coordinator and deputy police commissioner, Steve Gollschewski, said police would be looking into it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a game to work out how you can game the system and go to your holiday home on Straddie,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Victoria</h2> <p>The police minister, Lisa Neville, said on Thursday that police will crack down on holiday travel. Visiting family for social reasons is already banned in the state, and police will also be out issuing fines to people who travel an excessive distance for exercise or recreation.</p> <p>\u201cTravelling from Melbourne to Lorne to surf is inappropriate,\u201d Neville said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to an Airbnb, you can\u2019t camp, you can\u2019t caravan, you can\u2019t boat, you can\u2019t fish. You can\u2019t catch up with friends or family that don\u2019t currently live with you.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Victoria Police issued fines to two men because they were in a car watching a movie in a public place, six people who claimed they were \u201cjust chilling\u201d, four people who were \u201cdriving around aimlessly\u201d and to a man who said he drove from Wantirna South to South Melbourne \u2013 just under 40km \u2013 to buy a bottle of water.</p> <h2>Tasmania</h2> <p>Helicopters will be flown over Tasmania, keeping an eye on people travelling for holidays. There will also be an increased police presence in the state\u2019s northwest, where a quarter of the state\u2019s current cases are located.</p> <p>The premier, Peter Gutwein, said on Thursday that \u201cthe gloves [would] come off\u201d for Easter.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to police this \u2026 If you go to a shack and you don\u2019t have a reasonable excuse to be there, you will be asked to leave. If you don\u2019t, you will be summonsed and charged.\u201d</p> <h2>Western Australia</h2> <p>Beaches could be shut over the Easter weekend as the weather seems set to bring record-breaking heat. Maximums of 36C are forecast for Perth on Good Friday and Saturday, prompting police to warn that they will be patrolling beaches.</p> <p>Going to the beach is allowed, the police commissioner, Chris Dawson, said, as long as you maintain physical distancing and do not travel unnecessarily to get there.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are saying is don\u2019t drive away from your home on holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yes, you are allowed to go out and exercise. Yes, you are allowed to go to the beach.\u201d</p> <p>However, the deputy commissioner, Gary Dreibergs, was blunt: \u201cIf you want to go to the beach, go, have a swim, pack up your towel, go back to your car, head home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Local councils are standing by ready to close the beaches if they get too crowded. The WA health minister, Roger Cook, said that \u201cobviously closing the beach is an option. [But] it\u2019s the very last option \u2013 we just simply want people to be doing the right thing.\u201d</p> <h2>South Australia</h2> <p>Police will also be patrolling holiday areas in SA, according to the commissioner, Grant Stevens.</p> <p>\u201cSome of these holiday destinations have communities in an older age bracket and those older people are concerned about this,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/beach-bars-bench-bans-easter-lockdown-rules-coronavirus\">From blocked-off beaches to bench bans: Easter lockdowns around the world</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Australian Capital Territory</h2> <p>Police will be <a href=\"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6717621/act-police-out-in-force-to-keep-people-home-for-easter-weekend/\">out at the ACT\u2019s border crossings into NSW</a>, but there will not be any hard checkpoints or roadblocks.</p> <p>Police will also patrol near Namadgi national park, according to the ACT police commissioner, Ray Johnson.

  "<p>One year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/11/canadia-soccer-coaches-abuse-mishandling\">going public about abuse, manipulation, and inappropriate behavior</a> by a Canada national team coach, former player Ciara McCormack\u2019s fire is still burning even if the country\u2019s governing body continues to ignore the issue.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://ciaramccormack.com/2019/02/25/a-horrific-canadian-soccer-story-the-story-no-one-wants-to-listen-to-but-everyone-needs-to-hear/\">blog post</a> by McCormack 12 months ago shined a light on how Canada Soccer \u2013 the governing body of the sport in the country \u2013 and Major League Soccer club Vancouver Whitecaps had failed to adequately address decade-long allegations by 14 high-level players of abuse by an elite coach working for both their organizations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/11/canadia-soccer-coaches-abuse-mishandling\">'The sickest thing': Canadian soccer rocked by claims of systemic abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the coach left Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps by \u201cmutual consent\u201d after a flawed internal enquiry at the time, he was still allowed to continue working with female youth players in Canada.</p> <p>Following poor publicity and protests by fans at the club\u2019s apparent inaction, the Whitecaps <a href=\"https://vancouver-mp7static.mlsdigital.net/elfinderimages/2019/safesport/SLSG_REVIEW_Findings_and_Recommendations_Report.pdf\">released a report</a> to the public in December last year that effectively absolved the club of any wrongdoing in how it had addressed the allegations of abuse.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day no one was held accountable for anything and a national team coach who was fired for sexually harassing players went right back into the community to coach for another 10 years,\u201d McCormack told the Guardian. \u201cYou can do the most atrocious things and not be held accountable.\u201d</p> <p>McCormack, a Canadian-born former Ireland international, had an extensive professional career in Canada, Denmark, Norway, the United States and Australia, and played for the Vancouver Whitecaps Women until the team folded in 2012.</p> <p>As reported by the Guardian, McCormack and 13 former Under-20 Canada internationals detailed events that took place in 2008 while Bob Birarda was coach of both the U-20 national team and Vancouver Whitecaps Women side.</p> <p>Their allegations ranged from rubbing a player\u2019s thigh in a car, sending sexually suggestive text messages to players, demanding one-on-one meetings with players he had cut from his team in his hotel room, and telling a player during a half-time talk how he thought her body looked in a wet white team jersey.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s report prompted more players and team administrators to speak out about their experience. Eden Hingwing, who played under Birarda for both the Canada women\u2019s Under-20 international team and the Vancouver Whitecaps in 2008 said: \u201cI watched what was a very professional environment created by the previous coach change into something extremely toxic and confusing.\u201d</p> <p>Birarda left Canada Soccer and Vancouver Whitecaps in late 2008 by \u201cmutual consent\u201d but was still able to coach female youth soccer teams in British Columbia without any sanctions. No criminal charges have been laid against him.</p> <p>\u201cThe most valuable thing to come out of this whole experience is that it created a case study for how the system is set up to not hold anyone accountable,\u201d McCormack said.</p> <p>McCormack said that a December 2019 third-party review into the 2008 events commissioned by the Whitecaps left many questions unresolved. The review by Canadian organization Sports Law and Strategy Group cleared the Whitecaps of a \u201ccover-up\u201d and even though Vancouver Whitecaps is one of the largest and well-known soccer clubs in North America it only had \u201cauthority to prevent [Birarda] from coaching with the Whitecaps organization\u201d. The report said any further sanctions on Birarda lay at the feet of Canada Soccer.</p> <p>Concacaf president Victor Montagliani \u2013 president of Canada Soccer from 2012 to 2017 and vice president at the time of the 2008 allegations with specific responsibility for national teams \u2013 told the Guardian last year that national organizations do not deal with coach registrations and responsibility for Birarda lay with regional governing bodies or local clubs.</p> <p>\u201cThere can be all the evidence in the world right in front of everybody and [coaches like Birarda] are not forced to answer to anybody,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cPeople quit the national team because they couldn\u2019t cope with the sexualized environment that [Birarda] created. No one has been able to explain why [Birarda] was able to go unchecked even when his new club\u2019s executive director worked in the Whitecaps office in 2008. Canada Soccer has never met with us. No has been forced to answer to any of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel good that everybody knows what happened and that this big nasty secret is out and that the spotlight has been shone on people who were operating in what they thought were dark corners,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cBut this is a case study for how unbelievably corrupt it all is. It is not about athlete health and wellbeing. It is all just words with no substance behind it.\u201d</p> <p>McCormack said the experience of the Whitecaps and Canada U-20 team echoed that of Megan Brown, a potential Olympic-level runner who has alleged her decades-older coach at a prestigious running program at the University of Guelph groomed her for a sexual relationship. Her former coach, Dave Scott-Thomas, was suddenly fired from the university in January more than 10 years after Brown first told her story.</p> <p>Speaking to Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, Brown said: \u201cThis is how abuse of power works \u2026 the victim has too much to lose in speaking the truth. The victim is the one who suffers, who is ostracized, who is labelled, who is forced to rebuild their life, while the person in power continues to reap the benefits of their power.\u201d</p> <p>Adds McCormack: \u201cYou can swap Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps for the University of Guelph and it is the same thing. These stories will continue. Until something significant changes, I am grateful for the experience to know that the whole system and these people don\u2019t care. To feel silenced and squished down and made to feel so little. \u2026 I wanted to see if the report would make a difference but of course it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Now coaching youth soccer in Los Angeles, McCormack said that, while the Whitecaps and Canada Soccer offered no support for the 2008 players, she was overwhelmed by the response from Vancouver\u2019s wider soccer community to their experiences.</p> <p>Whitecaps fans staged protests during MLS home games last year at their club\u2019s perceived inaction on the issue. Fans coordinated stadium walk outs mid-match joined by visiting supporters of Portland Timbers and Los Angeles FC in a show of solidarity.</p> <p>\u201cThe gift this gave us was being heard and that helped healing,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cThe community in Vancouver showed that they do care, it valued us and they were willing to take a stand. They realized people did wrong. I hated Vancouver. It was so full of bad memories but the walkouts changed things for me. It meant that I got my city back. I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Canada Soccer did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.</em></p></li> </ul>",

use of a controversial anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, for treating coronavirus, directly contradicting the federal health department, which has told doctors they can prescribe it for patients</a>.</p> <p>The Department of Health insists that as well as being used in clinical trials, the drug, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">also been touted by US president Donald Trump</a>, may be given \u201cin a controlled environment in

peak body that manages health emergencies \u2013 said experimental use of medications such as hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 prevention and treatment was not recommended, and should be prescribed only as part of a clinical trial.</p> <h2><strong>GP practices on the brink of financial ruin</strong></h2> <p>As the health minister, Greg Hunt, urges Australians to continue seeing their GPs, <a

Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/09/federal-education-minister-orders-independent-schools-to-reopen-for-term-two\">Tehan said he will use Australian Education Act powers to impose a new condition on independent schools, in effect requiring them to make classroom learning available or risk losing federal funding</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Fines for spitting or coughing on health workers</strong></h2> <p>People who spit on New South Wales health workers, police or other public health officials during the Covid-19 pandemic could be slapped with a $5,000 on-the-spot fine.</p> <p>The NSW police minister, David Elliott, said on Thursday that people who intentionally spit or cough on police officers during the pandemic could also face prosecution and up to six months in prison.<br> \u201cLike most people, I find the recent actions of a handful of individuals utterly foul and obnoxious, but worryingly, the behaviour is potentially life-threatening.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott said the fines had been introduced in response to the \u201cabhorrent\u201d acts of some individuals in recent weeks.</p> <h2>NRL aims to restart on 28 May</h2> <p>The NRL intends to get back on the playing field on 28 May but there is still no clarity on what the competition will look like once the 2020 season restarts.</p> <p>Meetings of the league\u2019s innovation committee and the ARL Commission were held on Thursday before ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce confirmed the intention to get the league back underway in seven weeks\u2019 time.</p> <p>The

<h2><strong>Social gatherings were rocket fuel for Covid-19</strong></h2> <p>Carnival season in western Germany, Mardi Gras in New Orleans and backpacker parties in Bondi.</p> <p>All of the countries hit by the Covid-19 pandemic have reported similar stories of social, cultural or religious gatherings where large numbers spent numerous hours in close company \u2013 holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass \u2013 which then turbo-charged the spread of the pandemic.</p> <p>A hundred days after a Chinese government website announced the discovery of a \u201cpneumonia of unknown

  "<p>A coroner investigating the death in custody of Aboriginal woman Tanya Day has referred the case to the department of public prosecutions to determine whether criminal negligence has occurred.</p> <p>Delivering her findings over livestream on Thursday, coroner Caitlin English said she made the recommendation after considering the evidence surrounding the 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cI believe an indictable offence may have been committed in connection to Ms Day\u2019s death,\u201d English said.</p> <p>She recommended that the Coroner\u2019s Act be amended to give coroners more control over the investigation, conducted by police, that informs an inquest.</p> <p>She also recommended that a falls risk assessment be placed in the Victoria police manual\u2019s guidelines for holding people in custody, that police training be updated with reference to the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, and that both the Victoria police and V/Line transport training manuals be subject to an independent human rights review.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/15/tanya-day-inquest-beyond-the-symbolic-police-dodge-serious-questions\">Tanya Day inquest: beyond the symbolic, police dodge serious questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She also repeated an earlier recommendation, made at the first hearing of the inquest in December 2018, that the crime of public drunkenness be abolished in Victoria, to which the Andrews government has already agreed.</p> <p>Day died in hospital on 22 December 2017 of a brain haemorrhage sustained when she fell and hit her head in the cells of Castlemaine police station 17 days earlier. She was in the cells because she had been arrested for public drunkenness, after being removed by police from a V/Line train from Bendigo to Melbourne.</p> <p>English said Day\u2019s family had asked her to consider whether the circumstances of her death amounted to negligent manslaughter.</p> <p>She said the medical evidence suggested Day had only a 20% chance of survival, and even then with severe disabilities once she had fallen and sustained a haematoma in the police cells, so that \u201cany inadequacies of [police] care of Ms Day was not causative of her death\u201d.</p> <p>But she said the issue of preventing her death was not limited to medical care after her fall. \u201cMs Day\u2019s death was clearly preventable had she not been arrested and taken into custody.</p> <p>\u201cThe totality of the evidence inclines me to assenting to a belief that an indictable offence may have been committed,\u201d English said. \u201cAnd on this basis I intend to direct that the principle registrar must notify the director of public prosecutions.\u201d</p> <p>The finding was delivered over livestream because of restrictions to in-person hearings due to the coronavirus. Three of Day\u2019s four children watched the finding together in Wodonga.

  "<p>It takes just under 30 seconds in its first episode for Netflix\u2019s Brews Brothers to crack a dildo joke. The setup: Wilhelm \u201cWill\u201d Rodman (Alan Aisenberg) mans the bar at his craft brewery in Van Nuys, California, which he has naively named Rodman XXXtreme. You can see where that is going \u2013 within the first five minutes, there are several rod jokes (his bar is frequently mistaken for a porn shop, of course), a wordplay on the meaning of \u201cgrowler\u201d and a literal shit on the sidewalk. Such is the stasis of Brews Brothers, Netflix\u2019s attempt at a 30-minute, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia-style sitcom about beer-making brothers that revels in the streamer\u2019s freedom from censorship but falls fatally short on charm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/07/best-streaming-services-us-tv-movies\">Not just Netflix: the best alternative US streaming services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a show mostly relying on gross-out humor and antics to work, you need a breezy and hilariously compelling ensemble; Brews Brothers, created and written by Greg Schaffer (That 70s Show) and executive-produced with his brother Jeff Schaffer (creator of The League, executive producer of Curb Your Enthusiasm), has a promising enough premise: a group of wellish-meaning misfits running a craft brewery, that staple of millennials with disposable income. Will is a master beer maker but a business idiot and his brewery is failing, despite (or because of) his loyal staff: chill girl Sarah (Carmen Flood) and punchline device Chuy (Marques Ray), whom Will recruited from the auto body shop down the street. Desperate for help from Will\u2019s \u201cmarketing\u201d schemes ($5,000 in \u201cfounder\u2019s club\u201d money equals free beer for life, every beer name is an inadvertent sex joke), Sarah calls in Will\u2019s estranged brother, Adam (Mike Castle), for backup.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mKnwFSWEoM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_mKnwFSWEoM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Unfortunately for them \u2013 and us \u2013 Adam is a silk vest-wearing, uptight asshole who, at least in the first four episodes, does not move beyond his bit as the most horrific craft beer snob/obnoxious older brother. And despite their not having spoken for years over a silly beer-making fallout, it takes two minutes for Adam and Will to reteam to rescue Rodman\u2019s Brewery. The extended, largely unfunny joke here is that they clash: Will\u2019s a nice-guy slacker who sees beer as the linchpin for a good community hang while Adam is a killjoy who sips only for superior taste. Glasses are broken, customers spurned, opportunities lost and won, piss flows in and out of beer, yet they continue to fail upwards \u2013 though of course, that\u2019s a given of the genre, funny or not.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good idea, in theory \u2013 a 30-minute, low-stakes sitcom centered around an extremely popular business craze (\u201cCraft beer is my generation\u2019s Pinkberry,\u201d says Sarah, in one of several lines about millennials definitely not written by a millennial). But it just doesn\u2019t have the underdog charm of staple sitcoms such as The Office, or the unhinged and hilarious offensiveness of It\u2019s Always Sunny, which seems to be the show\u2019s inspiration, though its hijinks usually resort to thwarting Adam\u2019s repulsive effect on customers and working in dick jokes in ways neither original nor particularly entertaining.</p> <p>Instead, Brews Brothers is often just the cardinal sin of loveable-dope sitcoms: boring. The characters\u2019 one-notes aren\u2019t particularly endearing or funny, so the show just rolls in a circle \u2013 Chuy makes a nonsense comment out of context, Will acts confused, Adam is a prick, Sarah chimes in with reason. It appears the show thinks its calling card will be, besides the novel craft brewery setting, a full tilt into dick jokes and at least one bodily fluids plot line an episode. Which, to be clear, <em>can</em> be funny when deployed unexpectedly, or with irony, or with an absurd punch. A play on the name Rodman in the middle of family fight? Sure, maybe. A bit on drawing penises at a brewery run by two squabbling, manchild brothers? Yeah, OK.</p> <p>That being said, Brews Brothers drops at an unprecedentedly good time for streaming, with millions sequestered at home, and everyone has their own taste when it comes to easy background TV. There\u2019s an ocean of content out there, and this show never aims for critical praise \u2013 Adam may protest against people\u2019s enthusiasm for chugging beer, thus washing away the subtleties of the craft with crass volume, but there\u2019s a reason people are drawn to onslaught as enjoyment. All of which is to say: Brews Brothers doesn\u2019t strive to break the immature humor mold. We all know a clever slacker \u2013 this one just thinks it\u2019s more clever than it is.</p> <ul> <li><p>Brews Brothers is available on Netflix from 10 April</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Two women meet at a dinner party. One is a teacher, the generally sensible mother of a young girl; the other is a flamboyant, beautiful violinist who talks loudly and exudes a captivating spontaneity. The teacher, who narrates the story, falls for Sarah with a consuming, destructive passion. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Sarah the impetuous, Sarah the passionate, Sarah the sulphurous.\u201d They are both overcome by their desire, losing their bearings in their lives. And then Sarah is overcome by breast cancer, and the novel begins and ends with them clasped in an embrace in which Sarah may or may not be dead.</p> <p>This is Pauline Delabroy-Allard\u2019s first novel and it became a massive success when it was published in France last year: titillating with its frank descriptions of sex and erotic paeans to the female body (\u201cher earlobes. Her moles. Her thighs. Her violet vulva\u201d) and captivating with its investigation of the suffering involved in passion. It\u2019s a brief, intense read. There is no world beyond the physiological experiences of the lovers. We see into the narrator\u2019s mind only when she is experiencing the effects of desire, or falling apart in its wake. Other characters \u2013 the lovers\u2019 parents, the narrator\u2019s daughter \u2013 appear but are not given a chance to exist.</p> <p>Much about the tone of the novel reminded me of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/leila-slimani\">Le\u00efla Slimani</a>\u2019s work. As with Slimani, there\u2019s a combination of breathless excitement and flatness: as though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/14/100-best-books-clarissa-samuel-richardson\">Samuel Richardson</a> has been crossed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/albert-camus-novel-the-plague-la-peste-pestilence-fiction-coronavirus-lockdown\">Albert Camus</a>. In both cases there is something compulsive about the reading experience, partly just because the feverish rhythms carry us along. Here\u2019s a typical passage: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She lets me catch up with her at the last minute, she doesn\u2019t fight when I undress her and force her to get into the bath where I wash her meticulously under the astonished eye of the resident cat, she cries silently while I go shhhhh between my teeth, shhhh like someone soothing a teething child or a strapping man felled by fever or an old man preparing to die, come on, shhhh, it\u2019s over, there, shhhh.</p> </blockquote> <p>The passion has already become harmful here. The excitement of burning with desire has become exhausting, so they start to tear each other apart. There\u2019s an arbitrariness in the destructiveness that makes it unconvincing. In the great novels of ill-fated passion \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/21/emily-bronte-strange-cult-wuthering-heights-romantic-novel\">Wuthering Heights</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/rereading-anna-karenina-james-meek\">Anna Karenina</a></em>, say \u2013 the story is richly embedded in a social world that makes the lovers feel doomed partly by forces outside their control. Here the two women live ordinary middle-class lives, going to the theatre, taking the narrator\u2019s daughter to school. I couldn\u2019t quite believe in the necessity for them to destroy themselves. Even the breast cancer felt curiously expedient, as though the illness was a necessary consequence of the destruction, rather than a cause of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The two women live ordinary middle-class lives \u2013 I couldn\u2019t quite believe in the need for them to destroy themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a long, much-contested tradition that associates lesbians with death. Think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview32\">Djuna Barnes\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview32\">Nightwood</a></em>, also set in Paris, where Nora and Robin are caught in a cycle of vampiric love: \u201cWe love each other like death.\u201d In Barnes\u2019s novel the doomedness could be associated more easily with outsider status. Delabroy-Allard toys with introducing homophobia, but in general passion \u2013 and perhaps especially lesbian passion \u2013 is shown as possessing a violence of its own. This leaves Delabroy-Allard reliant on symbolism. Sarah loves playing Schubert string quartets and the narrator becomes terrified by the words of the song that hovers beneath his \u201cDeath and the Maiden\u201d quartet.</p> <p>It could be argued that the arbitrary nature of both passion and destructiveness is precisely what the novel is about. It\u2019s partly an exploration of the solipsism that sex can seem to justify, pushed almost to the point of comedy in a book that still manages to remain humourless. When Sarah is in Japan during an earthquake, the narrator wonders if in fact they are the earthquake, and their relationship is \u201cthe seismic shift that made everything judder for several kilometres around\u201d. This is why the breast cancer feels unreal: it may just be another warped consequence of their desire.</p> <p>The best parts of the book are where the narrator goes deeper into inhabiting her own craziness in Sarah\u2019s absence. She abandons her possibly dead lover and effectively non-existent daughter and goes to Trieste. It\u2019s as though Delabroy-Allard fully accepts here that she has given up on the social novel altogether, and moves instead into a form of travel writing that ends up being more alluring and disturbing than the sex scenes. I found the \u201cglimmering gold, blindingly beautiful\u201d Adriatic the perfect backdrop for the narrator\u2019s decline, if only because the dreamlike setting stopped me minding how wilfully unconvincing the characterisation is beneath the seductive prose.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury).

  "<p>When three future members of Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs first started jamming as teenagers in leafy Richmond in North Yorkshire, the locals became curious about the strange sludge and doom metal jams emanating from the church hall in the early hours. One night, the trio had a visit.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone suddenly stopped playing,\u201d chuckles singer Matt Baty, who was the drummer in those days. \u201cI looked round and there were two coppers standing in the room. We\u2019d been making full-on noise and they must have come to check out if anything untoward was going on, and they found us.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, the local plod didn\u2019t arrest them. \u201cWhen they left they told us, \u2018Keep on rocking,\u2019\u201d grins guitarist Sam Grant. \u201cWhich we have.\u201d</p> <p>Almost 15 years later, after word-of-mouth buzz and BBC 6 Music support, the now five-piece were the festival hit of last summer, playing a hypnotic mix of Black Sabbath-style \u201cprecious metal\u201d and Jane\u2019s Addiction with the repetition-based outsider rock of Can, Hawkwind and Sunn O))). Pigs x7\u2019s tour is on hold due to coronavirus, but see them when they come back around in November \u2013 gigs tend to be incendiary, hard-rocking but awesomely entertaining affairs, with audience members wearing pig masks or clambering on stage and Baty, stripped to his shorts, howling cathartically.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsn9leb4ZSc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dsn9leb4ZSc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThe policemen asked us, \u2018Is everything all right?\u201d he remembers. \u201cI said no, we\u2019re not all right. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this.\u201d The frontman finds \u201csolace in really loud music. I don\u2019t meditate \u2013 maybe I should \u2013 but it feels like I\u2019m achieving a similar state of consciousness. When the music\u2019s so loud that you can\u2019t think about anything else, all those niggling troubles just go.\u201d</p> <p>Band members talk of getting so lost in their playing that they have felt sick on stage, or come off with clenched jaws. \u201cIt\u2019s therapy through noise,\u201d explains bassist Johnny Hedley. \u201cWhether we\u2019re thrashing about or playing something slow and droney, the variety of expression mirrors how you feel internally.\u201d</p> <p>The mostly short-haired Pigs x7 don\u2019t particularly look like regular metalheads, but discovered Sabbath and Mot\u00f6rhead from their parents\u2019 collections before digging into extreme metal, Krautrock, noise and sonics. I meet them in February in Newcastle\u2019s Trillians Rock Bar, fulcrum of the city\u2019s metal scene for years. Shortly after relocating, Baty had a eureka moment in this very bar, when he came across local noise band <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/723041-Marzuraan\">Marzuraan</a>, who were making, he says, \u201cbottles shake off the shelves. My eyebrows were vibrating. Downtuned guitars. An awkward uncomfortable guy on vocals. It was a whole new world of music.\u201d</p> <p>Gradually, Baty realised he didn\u2019t want to be the drummer any more, but the frontman, which coincided with a shift to more focused music than the original madcap plan to do \u201clong psychedelic jams, with 10 drummers\u201d, becoming a five-piece instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5085b0c811cf6c66d58f0c533b82689bdaca223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5085b0c811cf6c66d58f0c533b82689bdaca223/0_0_4467_3177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs perform at the Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, in March 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs perform at the Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, in March 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They acquired the band name while in Newcastle. The waggish Grant explains that it functions as \u201can ego inhibitor. Having a silly name stops you getting ahead of yourself or hungering for success and keeps you focused on making music you believe in.\u201d Not that it hasn\u2019t caused some issues. \u201cWe get people trying to sell us pigs,\u201d deadpans Sykes, to howls of laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s happened three times recently. A Brazilian guy saw the name on the internet and thought we were a livestock auction. I did ask for photos of his pigs, but I usually try and explain the situation early on, before I find myself ordering a herd of animals.\u201d</p> <p>A chat with Pigs is like their gigs, and careers from hilarity to something more profound. Baty is \u201chumbled\u201d by the fan letters from \u201cpeople reciting lyrics back to me and telling me what they mean to them. Which is astounding, really\u201d. On their new album, Viscerals, the song New Body is about low self-esteem, which \u2013 especially delivered by a guy performing almost naked \u2013 is quite unusual in the metal canon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our music is an escape from a period of time where socially things are very difficult</p> <footer> <cite>Johnny Hedley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe topless thing started shortly after I switched to vocals,\u201d Baty explains. \u201cHaving been a drummer it was unfamiliar territory, so during early gigs I tried to cover myself up by wearing a kaftan with a hood. Then one night the mic lead got caught in the hood and I ended up with my arms suspended over my head. I thought, \u2018Never again\u2019.\u201d As the gigs became hotter, he found himself unbuttoning. \u201cIt felt symbolic of unburdening.

Hedley sees their music as \u201can escape from a period of time where socially things are very difficult\u201d.</p> <p>Many of Baty\u2019s lyrics concern religion. Having been an avid churchgoer in childhood, and attending a Catholic school, three years ago he accompanied his mum to mass for Christmas, and found it \u201creally bleak. Like \u2018Enjoy Christmas, but remember you\u2019re a sinner and you\u2019re going to hell\u2019. It reminded me what I grew up with. I had a lovely childhood but all this is ingrained; I was taught about sin and purgatory, which are very heavy duty concepts for a child to try and process.\u201d He\u2019s at pains to point out that references to the seven deadly sins on 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/28/pigs-pigs-pigs-pigs-pigs-pigs-pigs-king-of-cowards-review-pulverising-but-accessible-metal\">King of Cowards</a> and new songs such as Crazy in Blood \u201creally aren\u2019t bashing religion.

There wasn\u2019t a week that went by without the controversial rapper appearing in court or in the gossip pages with rumours about romances with Madonna and Whitney Houston, but he balanced this notoriety with being a fervent defender of black America\u2019s most poor and vulnerable citizens. He resonated not only with the gangsters, but also the people looking to escape from that lifestyle and find inner peace.</p> <p>He switches between grappling with suicidal thoughts to leading black America on to a path of enlightenment on his third solo album, but its raw introspection makes the rapper sound less like a thug superhero and more like a fragile 23-year-old, struggling to hold it all together.</p> <p>On the mournful Lord Knows, he\u2019s on his knees reaching out in pure desperation, powerfully rapping: \u201cI smoke a blunt to take the pain out / And if I wasn\u2019t high, I\u2019d probably try to blow my brains out / I\u2019m hopeless, they should\u2019ve killed me as a baby.\u201d His throaty vocals show the wear and tear of chain-smoking Newports, true, but the delivery of his bars from the very back of his throat sounds gigantic; like a God, clearing both his throat and his conscience. This morbid fatalism reaches a crescendo with the bluesy So Many Tears, a late-night confessional where 2Pac sounds like he\u2019s quite literally being stalked by the spectral figure of death \u2013 arguably, these songs were precursors to the emo rap sound of the 2010s, with 2Pac one of the first major rap artists to show his peers that there was no shame in crying or making songs from a position of weakness.</p> <p>Thankfully, these darker moments are delivered with so much heart that they stretch beyond mere self-pity. It also means that Me Against the World\u2019s brighter, more optimistic shifts in tone feel well earned, as a paranoid 2Pac finally starts to let some light back into his life. The beautifully nostalgic Dear Mama, where he warmly pays tribute to the many hardships experienced by his Black Panther mother, Afeni Shakur (\u201cAnd even as a crack fiend, mama / You always was a black queen, mama\u201d), and the puppy dog romance of Can U Get Away remind us that gangster rappers can be just as soft as the rest of us.</p> <p>Me Against the World, which was the first US No 1 album released by someone in prison (the rapper was still serving a sentence for sexual assault), was the most fully formed, relatable iteration of 2Pac. Ideas that might have seemed neurotic 25 years ago, such as 2Pac\u2019s suspicion on Fuck the World that America\u2019s prison industrial complex might be the reason he keeps going to jail, also now sound a lot more indubitable, with the artist creating an enduring collection of cathartic anthems for anyone who has ever felt oppressed.

He feels like less of a rough diamond than he did on Me Against the World, with a bigger budget and better producers (such as Dr Dre, Dj Quik and Daz Dillinger) marking his transition from compelling rapper to American icon. The tone is primarily a celebration of Los Angeles\u2019 endless supply of celestial funk (George Clinton, Snoop Dogg and Roger Troutman are among the guest stars), sticky weed, hot weather and eager groupies, but 2Pac proves his his social awareness hasn\u2019t been washed away entirely, either. He uses urgent highlight Only God Can Judge Me to ponder: \u201cAnd they say it is the white man I should fear / But it is my own kind doing all the killing here.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2Pacalypse Now (1991)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRWUs0KtB-I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NRWUs0KtB-I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>2Pac\u2019s debut remains underrated, with the artist using it to show outsiders just how dangerous America\u2019s inner cities had become. On the poignant Brenda\u2019s Got a Baby, he empathises with a young black teenage mother whose body has been corrupted by an endless cycle of abusive men, while Words of Wisdom sees him boldly attempt to reclaim the n-word as a source of empowerment (\u201cIt means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished\u201d) as he fawns over the more aggressive political ideals of Malcolm X. The best moment is the urgent, mountain-shaking bass of Violent, where 2Pac channels the sound of Public Enemy with a twisted fable on what it\u2019s like to be harassed by police officers just for existing, ending the song by shooting a \u201ccrooked cop\u201d in cold blood. US vice-president Dan Quayle called the record\u2019s release \u201cirresponsible\u201d, but 2Pac was more than prepared to live out his words \u2013 in 1993, he was charged with shooting two off-duty police officers in Atlanta, though the charges were later dropped.</p> <p><strong>The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory</strong><strong> (1996)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZc1nnGYZec\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZc1nnGYZec?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Having switched his name to Makaveli after reading Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince in prison, this posthumous album, which was finished just before 2Pac\u2019s murder in 1996, has a macabre tone that suggests the rapper was living on borrowed time. 2Pac bluntly embraces his contradictions, persuasively asking for black solidarity (White Man\u2019z World), while also calling out half the rappers in New York, including Nas, Mobb Deepand De La Soul, and threatening bloodshed (Against All Odds). On the dread-inducing Hail Mary, which is built around church bells that ring out like death rattles, 2Pac\u2019s thunderous vocals dissect the pitfalls of masculinity as he wonders if black America is \u201ctoo hardened\u201d to smile. Just like the rest of the album, the song leaves you with a nagging sense that 2Pac was in way over his head with Suge Knight\u2019s Blood-affiliated label and that, behind the anger and thuggish rage, there was probably just as much fear and paranoia.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>2Pac \u2013 Life\u2019s So Hard (1997)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJWrBJf4is0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VJWrBJf4is0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The haunting sample of Led Zeppelin\u2019s Ten Years Gone never got cleared, so Life\u2019s So Hard was officially released with a different beat entirely, but 2Pac\u2019s unreleased original remains vital and a real insight into what it\u2019s like to live in fear even when you\u2019re on top of the world. 2Pac sounds like a soldier reporting back from the front line, focused and committed to eradicating a faceless enemy, but also well aware he could just as easily end up as another statistic.</p> <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-2pac/pl.u-8aAVXk6coL0gmjV\">click here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0woAP3gBj53GB0z5WjpktZ?si=iVcVZXmASlmBYp5It2Cc3Q\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0woAP3gBj53GB0z5WjpktZ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/07/07/the-takedown-of-tupac\">The Takedown of Tupac</a>, by Connie Bruck (1997)</strong></p> <p>This New Yorker article paints a vivid picture of 2Pac\u2019s death, while the suggestion that he died without much money in his pocket, despite his status as US rap\u2019s most important star, points to ongoing exploitation of black artists.</p> <p><strong>The Rose That Grew </strong><strong>from Concrete, by Tupac Shakur (1999)</strong></p> <p>A collection of poems that Tupac wrote in his younger years, this book showcases a passionate student of Shakespeare who had a real love for bending words and trying to find the right metaphor to fully contextualise what it felt like to be poor.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/tupac-shakur-birthday-fashion-legacy\">Tupac Shakur\u2019s Fashion Legacy</a>, by Janelle Okwodu (2016)</strong></p> <p>With his distinctive bandanas, velour sweaters, opulent diamond rings and a secret friendship with Gianni Versace, 2Pac\u2019s style aesthetic has been ripped off by a whole generation of rappers.

  "<p>The pirated VHS copy of Conan the Barbarian that I cherished when I was 12 was cruddy and discoloured even before I wore it out with twice-daily viewings. The image, tinted jaundice-yellow in some places and seasickness-green in others, was striped with thorny lines of static that made you feel as though you were watching the movie through barbed wire. I knew it wasn\u2019t supposed to look like that because I\u2019d already seen it on the big screen a year earlier. One afternoon in September 1982, I had persuaded my father to take me after school to the ABC cinema in South Woodford, east London. I gave the movie the hard sell: it had Arnold Schwarzenegger, the goofy muscleman we\u2019d liked in Cactus Jack, as well as lots of whopping great swords and a baddie who could turn into a snake! I showed Dad the glossy stills printed in Starburst magazine, and waved my copy of the novelisation in his face. In fact, there was only one detail I kept hidden from him: the AA certificate, which prohibited anyone under the age of 14 from seeing the film.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t fazed. I wore my burgundy leather jacket that day and stocked up on Juicy Fruit in preparation for some emphatic gum-chewing. Those factors alone would surely be enough to add three years to my age. The danger as I saw it was not that I would be refused entry but that I might very well be mistaken for James Dean.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t quite how it panned out. The woman at the ticket desk gave me the once over.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not 14,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dad replied. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p> <p>She broke the bad news while Dad took a step back from the counter. He sighed heavily, huffing and puffing and saying \u201cDear-oh-law\u201d and \u201cWe drove all this way\u201d and \u201cOh blimey\u201d, which I knew was serious because in our family we didn\u2019t say \u201cblimey.\u201d We said \u201cblimus.\u201d It was a Carry On Cleo joke.</p> <p>My father is an East End geezer straight out of central casting: shaved head, rough edges, bags of front. The sort of firework you don\u2019t want going off indoors. But I had seen him angry plenty of times and this wasn\u2019t the real deal: it was surprise and inconvenience worked up artificially into a performance. Possibly he had in mind a lesson learned from Mel Brooks\u2019s Hitchcock spoof High Anxiety, one of his favourite films. There\u2019s a scene where Brooks and Madeline Kahn, finding themselves on the run from the police, try to sneak through customs disguised as an elderly kvetching couple. \u201cIf you\u2019re loud and annoying,\u201d Brooks tells Kahn, \u201cpsychologically people don\u2019t notice you.\u201d And he\u2019s right. The demonstrative drunk on public transport is usually guaranteed a wealth of personal space and the pick of the best seats.</p> <p>That must be why Dad caused enough of a fuss for the cashier to decide that it might just be easier to let us in.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cBut sit yourselves at the back, alright?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"006fcf30e8a22f87147faddc34dd6500d76990f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/006fcf30e8a22f87147faddc34dd6500d76990f4/0_47_3477_2086/1000..jpg\" alt=\"James Earl Jones and headgear, with suitably underdressed companion ...

Conan the Barbarian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we crept into the dark, the short film before the main feature was just finishing \u2013 it was a documentary about the medicinal uses of snake venom \u2013 and Conan the Barbarian was up next. Basil Poledouris\u2019s thunderous, stirring score boomed out of the crummy speakers in Screen Two and for the next couple of hours I was in a disbelieving trance. What do I remember of the film itself? Watching it again now, I can only say: pretty much everything. I can hum every note of that score. And the violence is branded on my memory, from the casually brutal killing of young Conan\u2019s mother at the start of the movie \u2013 her severed head drops past the camera in a blur while the boy is still holding her hand \u2013 to the sight of Schwarzenegger punching a camel. (You will search in vain for a \u201cno animals were harmed during the making of this film\u201d disclaimer in the end credits.)</p> <p>What I hadn\u2019t minded at the time was John Milius\u2019s laborious direction, or the plodding, meat-and-potatoes script that is credited to him and Oliver Stone. But then in many ways this is the archetypal adolescent-boy movie, from the epigram taken from Nietzsche to the lip-smacking shots of phallic symbols (swords, snakes, arrows). Their only rival for closeups is Schwarzenegger himself, who looks adorable despite the baby-oiled, bowling-ball biceps; I\u2019m amazed to find that the schoolboy crush I had on him is revived today as I watch. There\u2019s a giddy innocence in his eyes here that would calcify within the decade into a businessman\u2019s shrewdness. He appears to be actively enjoying himself, which would be a difficult claim to make about Jingle All the Way.</p> <p>The majestically feline, feminine aura of James Earl Jones, as the villain Thulsa Doom, is as intoxicating as ever. And how bizarre that during the climax he appoints himself Conan\u2019s parent (\u201cFor who now is your father if not me?\u201d) a mere two years after that same rumbling voice had made a not dissimilar announcement to Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwdYd_RdLCQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xwdYd_RdLCQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It had slipped my mind that the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/max-von-sydow-obituary\">Max </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/max-von-sydow-obituary\">von Sydow</a> pops up as King Osric, exuding gravitas despite looking, in his fur-trimmed crown and robe, like a skid-row Santa. But I hadn\u2019t forgotten all the flesh on display. So much naked flesh! I\u2019d never seen anything like it. There\u2019s even a full-blown orgy scene where, rather quaintly, the organisers have supplied an enormous cauldron of steaming pea soup. Has anyone ever fancied a bowl of soup after an evening of group sex? I can\u2019t answer that. Nor can I explain how I survived the embarrassment of watching that orgy scene at the age of 11 with my dad sitting beside me. Blimus, indeed.</p> <blockquote> </blockquote>",
  "<p>That\u2019s it. I have now played Apex Legends for over 500 hours. The online multiplayer shooter, developed by Californian studio Respawn Entertainment and released in February 2019, has been my obsession all year, seeing off a variety of pretenders from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/19/doom-eternal-review\">Doom Eternal</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch\">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p> <p>To the casual observer, there\u2019s nothing remarkable about it. Set in a science-fiction universe tied to Respawn\u2019s successful Titanfall series, it is another title in the battle royale genre alongside the Goliath that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\">Fortnite</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/22/player-unknowns-battlegrounds-pubg-battle-royale\">Player</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/22/player-unknowns-battlegrounds-pubg-battle-royale\">Unknown\u2019s Battlegrounds</a> and Call of Duty: Warzone. You land in a hi-tech future landscape with two team-mates and then you scramble about, finding weapons, while 19 other teams try to kill you and everyone else. The last team left alive is the winner.</p> <p>But the thing is, Respawn is one of the greatest designers of fast-paced shooter games in the industry. Formed in 2010 by the creative directors behind Call of Duty, Jason West and Vince Zampella, the studio was set up with most of the technical and design staff behind the legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/31/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-review\">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a> \u2013 and this experience shows in Apex Legends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0609b93ba2ca3777b572ed70d50c155e602ffb44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0609b93ba2ca3777b572ed70d50c155e602ffb44/114_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Most buildings in Apex Legends have a modular design that allows easy climbing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most buildings in Apex Legends have a modular design that allows easy climbing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One vital element of game design that\u2019s explored perfectly is the interplay between flow and friction. Indeed, much of the time Apex Legends feels frictionless. When you move through the environment you do so freely; if you like, you can hit a button to slide, giving you a short speed boost on level ground but also allowing you to sledge extremely quickly down hills. It\u2019s quick, satisfying, and if you\u2019re sliding toward an object, you can hit the jump button to break out of the animation, gracefully avoiding a collision. The two Apex Legends maps we\u2019ve seen so far are designed to encourage and facilitate this form of traversal, with lots of slopes and valleys to explore.</p> <p>Buildings and rockfaces also keep the player moving. Whenever you approach a tall object, there is almost always a handy grip point \u2013 say, a rocky outcrop or a window ledge \u2013 a few metres higher than your character. When you jump at a vertical surface, you scramble up a little, adding extra height and putting that grip point just within reach. This scramble animation makes you feel as though you worked for it, providing a sense of achievement, even though raised platforms are almost always accessible. The game is working with you.</p> <p>\u201cIn instances where the player is not entirely sure if they can get somewhere but decide to try anyway, 90% of the time they are going to succeed,\u201d says game designer Dan Pearce, director at Four Circle, and fellow Respawn fan. \u201cEverything in Apex is balanced like this, the same way that bullets in Halo curve slightly to hit their target, or Mario has about half a second where he can still jump after running off the edge of a surface.\u201d</p> <p>Another aspect Dan and I both like is the decision to go with three-player squads, rather than the four-person teams favoured by Fortnite or Call of Duty. It means no one can be carried \u2013 everyone has to work together and be a functional part of any strategy. \u201cThree players also means it\u2019s really easy to set up a balanced rock/paper/scissors-style team, where someone\u2019s focused on traversal, someone\u2019s focused on aggression, someone\u2019s focused on defence,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cThree players is also a small enough group that, if you were really in the zone, you could conceivably take out a whole squad single-handed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8100ad8d43711deda39e190f405274f54c4b57fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8100ad8d43711deda39e190f405274f54c4b57fa/240_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The game\u2019s focus on three-player teams ensures everyone has a role and close teamwork is necessary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The game\u2019s focus on three-player teams ensures everyone has a role and close teamwork is necessary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the masterstroke in terms of cooperative play is the game\u2019s ping system, which allows players to highlight areas of the map, useful items and enemy locations to their team-mates without talking. This, together with a conversation wheel offering a range of tactical phrases, means that it\u2019s possible to play as a squad with strangers without having to use your voice, which is intimidating and opens you to the possibility of abuse \u2013 or unwanted noise. \u201cIt is a genuine blessing for games culture,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cI might never again have to awkwardly describe an enemy\u2019s location over the sound of a stranger\u2019s barking dog while I\u2019m being riddled with bullets.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent a lot of time wandering the two Apex Legends maps \u2013 King\u2019s Canyon and World\u2019s Edge \u2013 what I\u2019ve noticed is how functional the architecture and topography are; how they work together to provide fun little playgrounds, choke points and risk centres. The icy slides down to the Epicenter, the slim, lava-surrounded walkways of the Dome, the wide, densely overlooked streets of Capitol City. In a game with such extravagance in terms of weapon design and character special abilities, you need each area of the environment to provide strict and specific roles. Respawn\u2019s approach to staging is more theatrical than cinematic. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s incredibly little that is extraneous in the designs,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cAlmost nothing is there just because it looks cool. Every Respawn game so far has felt to me like it could be played with blocky prototype graphics and still be just as involving, because every element justifies its inclusion mechanically. This kind of puzzle-box design, where everything clicks together in such a deliberate way, is harder to come across in games with larger scopes. Respawn isn\u2019t the only developer doing this \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/30/control-review-pc-ps4-xbox-adventure-video-game-sci-fi-blockbuster\">Remedy\u2019s Control</a> felt similar to me, but it is rare in the big-budget, triple-A space.\u201d</p> <p>But what I really love about Apex Legends is the simple, unimpeded pleasure of moving through the world. Lots of game designers are very interested in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s concept of flow, a highly focused mental state in which actions become almost automatic. Assisting flow is one of the most underappreciated elements of design \u2013 it might be found in the way a game illuminates certain areas in the world to show where the player should go (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/feb/16/dead-space-was-to-games-what-alien-was-to-movies\">Dead Space</a> does this brilliantly), or the use of rumble feedback to indicate the edges of a road in a racing game.

  "<p> Police chiefs want the government to consider toughening coronavirus lockdown restrictions, the Guardian has learned, as they head into the Easter bank holiday weekend with concerns that a growing minority will flout the rules.</p> \n<p>More stringent restrictions to prevent people driving long distances are among options supported by at least five chief constables who want enforcement action to be bolstered by clearer and tougher government curbs. Other options include using legislation to enforce the order to limit exercise to once a day.</p> \n<p>Police have sent speed and traffic camera data to the government showing that road use in some areas last weekend was up nearly 10% compared with the previous weekend. Compliance with lockdown restrictions imposed on 23 March is still high, however, with a minority ignoring it to take walks or exercise their dogs far from home, sometimes in groups.</p> \n<p>It comes as forces created online forms for the public to report potential lockdown breaches.

It was also possible the lockdown could be left as it is.</p> \n<p>One police leader said that several forces covering partly rural areas believed the government should consider going further and place further restrictions on people justifying their driving by claiming it was to exercise.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to say you can\u2019t drive. The burden needs to be on the individual not the state to prove reasonableness,\u201d the police chief said. \u201cIf the test changes, a lot less people would think: \u2018Rover does not need to be driven to a national park today.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>In some areas, the unregulated holiday lets sector, including Airbnb, continues to hire out properties. \u201cThere are still people coming down,\u201d said one senior police officer in a popular holiday area. \u201cPeople are still driving for a long time under the excuse of exercise and to places they do not need to be. The Easter bank holiday is one of the busiest times of the year. I have no new powers for this weekend.

At least five police chief constables <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/police-chiefs-call-on-no-10-to-tighten-uk-lockdown\">want tougher measures brought in.</a> A new study on China\u2019s experience of the virus warns that restrictions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/lockdowns-cant-end-until-covid-19-vaccine-found-study-says\">can\u2019t end until a vaccine is found</a>. \u201cWithout herd immunity against Covid-19, cases could easily resurge as businesses, factory operations, and schools gradually resume,\u201d said Prof Joseph T Wu from the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the study.

New York retains its grim position as the worst-hit city, with more than 4,000 deaths in total. But the White House\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, said there was cautious optimism that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/us-says-mitigation-efforts-are-working-raising-hopes-of-defying-worst-case-scenario\">mitigation efforts were working</a>, raising hopes the US could defy the projected death toll of 100,000-240,000.

He made it clear Biden would be the Democratic nominee and that he would actively throw his support behind the former vice president.

  "<p>It arrives in a cardboard box, postmarked Brighton, UK. Black, with maroon pinstripes, the dry-cleaning tag still pinned to the lapel. It\u2019s beautiful material, handmade and still smells good, the traces of smoke and sweat and stage. The pants have no bum, none whatsoever, but the jacket fits surprisingly well on my small frame, slim-fitted. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ll get to Nick Cave, that\u2019s how I figure it, after imagining him as a character for so many years in my novel Almost a Mirror. I find a black wiry hair trapped in a seam and hide it for safekeeping. When I tell my male friends about the suit, they vie for my attention, insisting they are the perfect fit. I imagine them lined up in a St Kilda alley, thin and lanky, smoking \u2013 like Cinderella hoping to be invited to the ball(room).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/22/nick-caves-stranger-than-kindness-inspiration-pictures-photos-notes-archive\">Nick Cave's inspiration: pictures and notes from his archive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suit hangs and swings as I drive, and I realise it\u2019s worth more than my car. I\u2019m heading to the home of Andy Griffiths, the world-renowned author of the Storey Treehouse series, where he lives with his partner and co-author Jill. A Nick Cave fanatic, Andy has just purchased the suit for $10,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/11/from-nick-caves-suit-to-iced-vovos-with-kevin-rudd-how-authors-for-fireys-is-funding-bushfire-relief\">in an auction bid for the #AuthorsForFireys appeal </a>\u2013 a donation that I, another Nick Cave fanatic, had facilitated.</p> <p>When I arrive, Andy tries the jacket on too. It fits \u2013 but the suit isn\u2019t for him. He bought it for the skeleton in the studio out the back where he works.</p> <p>I ask why he put in a bid. \u201cFirst and foremost, I was really affected by the fires and also the bravery of the firefighters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe take creative risks as artists but not life-threatening risks. I was so angry at the \u2026 state of play for the last decade. [Scott Morrison] is just so obstinate on this issue.

Andy was part of it though. He saw his first gig there: Midnight Oil in November, 1979. He remembers because it was the last day of Year 12. \u201cWe sat outside the station just drinking, getting as drunk as we could, so we didn\u2019t have to pay money inside,\u201d he says. At that point the band was \u201cthe best kept secret in the world \u2026 Pure energy coming from the stage. Mind blowing, really exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Andy is good with dates and has a uniquely detailed memory. Partly this is because he\u2019s kept everything from childhood onwards: early stories, song lyrics, band memorabilia and photos, cassettes taped from the radio carefully labelled in a drawer. He is an archivist\u2019s dream. Over lunch with Jill, he lovingly shows me set lists from bands like Snakefinger and Dead Kennedys grabbed at the end of gigs, reads me lyrics from his high school days in first band Unborn Babies, and shows photos and hand-drawn flyers from when he rocked up to the Ballroom with a later band, Gothic Farmyard.</p> <p>On stage he was the lead singer; he couldn\u2019t play an instrument, but was renowned for his manic energy and beating himself up, colliding, bashing his head blood-raw. \u201cWe were committed to making every show an event,\u201d he says. \u201cThe end goal was to get a gig at the Ballroom. That was you already successful beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d</p> <p>He loved the venue because it welcomed all comers. \u201cAnd the beauty of it for someone like me ... was that any band that got on stage at the Ballroom would have an audience prepared to take us seriously and try to figure us out,\u201d he says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t heckling or anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7db08e0c006c122a6f21d8cdd19c68159a361fd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db08e0c006c122a6f21d8cdd19c68159a361fd9/0_66_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young, shirtless Nick Cave sings into a microphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Cave performs with the Birthday Party at the Crystal Ballroom, Melbourne, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Prentice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4477078d3adf23fe1978e245441e75fb18eae148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4477078d3adf23fe1978e245441e75fb18eae148/0_36_3024_2255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Griffiths, pictured here with Nick Cave\u2019s old suit dressed on a skeleton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Primal energy came out\u2019 of the Birthday Party, says Andy Griffiths, pictured here with Nick Cave\u2019s old suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by Kirsten Krauth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andy was always drawn to Nick Cave and Rowland S Howard while hanging around the Ballroom; he talks passionately about the Birthday Party gigs, especially one at the Astor. \u201cIf anyone asked me what\u2019s the best gig you\u2019ve ever been to? I\u2019ll just go straight back to 1982,\u201d he says. \u201cNick, Tracey Pew in the background with his 10-gallon hat and stomping around, and Rowland\u2019s cigarette hanging out his mouth, making music.\u201d Returning from London, they \u201chad kind of transformed from this Melbourne band to a world band and they were full of dark energy and anger,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were just at the height of their powers \u2026 full throttle. Opened the gates of hell, and primal energy came out.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear the influence of the place has been profound, the sensibility of the time \u2013 the chaos, and wild energy \u2013 infusing all of Andy\u2019s writing. Nick Cave was a particular inspiration. \u201cHe\u2019s been lucky to do his own thing.

There was an initial dip in calls at the start of the lockdown but an increase recorded last week.</p> <p>Sara Kirkpatrick, a former services, research and development manager at Respect, said: \u201cAt the moment, what we\u2019re doing, the Respect phone line and our members, we\u2019re looking at de-escalation and self-management techniques.

A lot of the resources we have available will be about helping people to de-escalate difficult situations and manage themselves in a crisis.</p> <p>\u201cCallers are more concerned about being indoors more and worried about not being able to control their own behaviour, and feeling quite hopeless and helpless as there are more limitations on the other services they can get to, which increases anxiety even more.\u201d</p> <p>Kirkpatrick said the charity\u2019s member organisations that work with perpetrators are having to move to non face-to-face work.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/25/domestic-violence-prevention-course-was-no-cure-but-a-salvation\">domestic violence perpetrator programmes</a> are based on a model similar to Alcoholics Anonymous.

Home to an airfield, two churches, the research bases of 10 countries and about 500 semi-permanent residents, this international community has often been cast as the last hope of humanity in dystopian novels and films because of its remoteness, collaborative spirit and focus on science.

Veterans of Antarctic exploration had warned me that this location would give me my first taste of how rapidly the region is warming. On the slopes around the bay, there was more bare rock than snow, while the stony beach was so free of ice that it could almost have been Brighton, were it not for the penguins. This was to be expected. Temperatures on the peninsula \u2013 the finger of land that points up from Antarctica towards South America \u2013 have <a href=\"https://discoveringantarctica.org.uk/challenges/sustainability/impacts-of-climate-change/\">risen by about 3C</a> in the past 70 years, one of the fastest increases in the world. <br></p> \n<p>What was more surprising was the number of other vessels bobbing in the bay.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cPeople think Antarctica is isolated. That is a myth,\u201d Marcelo Leppe, the director of Chile\u2019s National Antarctic Institute, had told me when I visited him the previous day in Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile\u2019s southernmost region. \u201cThe changes are so great it is hard to put them in words,\u201d he said. Since Leppe started studying the region in 2002, he had seen more and more visitors, and less and less snow. \u201cI have seen glaciers retreat by 100 metres, and parts of the land become so green that it almost looks like a golf course,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>In December, monitoring equipment at the Chilean research base on King George Island detected something that worried Leppe even more: black carbon in the air, which came from the Australian bushfires more than 6,200 miles away. Even in tiny quantities, this soot darkens the white landscape, reducing its capacity to reflect sunlight and making it melt faster. \u201cAt least future geologists will find this black layer helpful to identify the year 2020 in their ice cores,\u201d he joked darkly.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6d07815a4bc36bddb1ed1d963fc30259a6de04e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d07815a4bc36bddb1ed1d963fc30259a6de04e/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bridge of the Arctic Sunrise in Discovery Bay, Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bridge of the Arctic Sunrise in Discovery Bay, Antarctica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There will be other clues for the geologists of the future.

Tourists pay as much as $10,000 (\u00a38,500) or even $20,000 to experience what brochures describe as \u201cthe Earth\u2019s last great wilderness frontier\u201d. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38b38ddfbc104cabe89f48ea40d74b8db96fc281\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38b38ddfbc104cabe89f48ea40d74b8db96fc281/0_0_5888_3918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists travel by kayak near Half Moon island, Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists travel by kayak near Half Moon island, Antarctica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For our hyper-dominant species, part of the attraction of Antarctica is the chance to feel small in the presence of the sublime, to return to a time when nature seemed like an awe-inspiring and nurturing mother rather than the frail and overburdened grandparent it increasingly resembles today. To ensure that tourists feel like they are journeying through a nearly deserted wilderness, tour operators coordinate schedules and instruct captains to use radar to avoid visual sightings of other vessels. (As our polar guide, Tom Foreman, noted, the impression of solitude would be \u201csomewhat ruined if you see 500 people floating past on another big lump of steel\u201d.) </p> \n<p>If there is something absurd about tour companies expending so much energy on crafting the illusion of solitude, it does at least help avoid overcrowding. Biosecurity is no small matter in the Antarctic. Boots need to be sterilised before setting foot on land to avoid spreading seeds, fungi or viruses. Everyone must keep their distance from wildlife \u2013 five metres from a penguin, 10 metres from a seal, 50 metres from a whale, unless they come to you. And no littering. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4597d553bc45b45e7bde06754fdc303a4b5edcc9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4597d553bc45b45e7bde06754fdc303a4b5edcc9/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists visit Orne Harbour in South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists visit Orne Harbour in South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Over the past five years, Astrid Zafiro has watched the traffic to Antarctica grow. As chief of Argentina\u2019s Admiral Brown base in Paradise Harbour, about 250 miles south-west of King George Island, she considers the rise in tourism as visible as the changes wrought by a warming climate. After guiding us through a penguin colony and up a slope behind the small research facility, Zafiro pointed across the bay at a newly emerged nunatak \u2013 a bare mountain peak sticking out above the ice. Near the nunatak, a massive cruise liner was unloading Chinese tourists in rubber boats. In the distance, we heard a crash as another slab of fractured glacier crashed into the water. \u201cIt is all happening right in front of us \u2013 the bay full of tourists, the ice breaking,\u201d Zafiro said wistfully. </p> \n<p>Zafiro described a feedback loop that does not appear in climate models: the more the Antarctic is threatened by the climate crisis, the more tourists want to visit before it melts away. That means more cruise (and air) miles to the end of the Earth, more carbon dioxide and more global heating. Last-chance-to-see tourism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"697e7f51d28b9c7b5d8878b215d0f2ae19844518\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/697e7f51d28b9c7b5d8878b215d0f2ae19844518/0_0_5926_3943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An iceberg and the Hurtigruten hybrid expedition cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen on Half Moon island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On board the Sunrise, a young German member of the ship\u2019s crew, Carola Rackete, told me about \u201csolastalgia\u201d, the term coined by the philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the pre-emptive sense of loss that people feel when witnessing natural beauty in this era of environmental destruction. \u201cYou enjoy it knowing that next time it will be changed beyond recognition. There is always the anticipation of loss, which makes me feels sad,\u201d Rackete said. Solastalgia is hard to escape in the Antarctic.</p> \n<p>We passed three days in Paradise Harbour, going out daily in the boats to gather samples and look and listen for whales, seals and penguins. On our final night, I was reluctant to sleep, knowing this was the last chance to take it all in. As the sun\u2019s pale afterglow faded behind the mountains, the dusky bay was as smooth as polished chrome. Time itself seemed to have frozen and I began to understand why so many of the early Antarctic explorers felt close to God here. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b89eeacdf4e165fecc1e6e22831df15b065e61\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b89eeacdf4e165fecc1e6e22831df15b065e61/0_0_4729_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists visit Yankee Harbour in the South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists in the South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After a few moments, my transcendental musings were interrupted by the sound of KC and the Sunshine Band echoing out from a huge cruise liner anchored 100 or so metres away. \u201cThat\u2019s the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh\u201d continued to ring in my ears as I made my way to the cabin.<br></p> \n<h2>Chapter 4: Low Island</h2> \n<h2>\u2018Something is broken in this ecosystem\u2019<br></h2> \n<p>There are still some Antarctic islands that have rarely, if ever, been visited by humans. They are deemed too small, too plain, too remote or too storm-battered. Our destination the following day, Low, seemed to tick all of these boxes. This south-westernmost island in the South Shetlands, nine miles long by five miles wide, takes the full brunt of the winds and waves that spin around the Shrieking Sixties, the stretch of latitude between 60 and 70 degrees south, which is notorious for howling gales. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4069ce8c7d123ae36614e6d93b300759cea5b8a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4069ce8c7d123ae36614e6d93b300759cea5b8a/0_0_4501_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A chinstrap penguin colony on Low Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chinstrap penguin colony on Low Island.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb00bb3d-c012-4fca-8e56-103e2671ef5b\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Low was once home to what was believed to be the biggest and most raucous colony of chinstrap penguins on the continent. Prior to our visit, the last survey of this island had been carried out in 1987, and since then chinstrap populations in other parts of Antarctica had suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/antarctic-alarm-collapse-chinstrap-penguin-numbers-global-heating\">an alarming 50% decline</a>. We wanted to find out whether that trend held true here. On shore, we joined a team of US biologists from Stony Brook University who had been island-hopping on the other Greenpeace ship, the Esperanza. Their task was simple but enormous: counting penguins. Hundreds of thousands of them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"38bd630e-c64a-405a-8e8b-87b667a6f7a6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wVgXtM1FgfY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Avian census-taking starts with satellites. Penguin guano is the only excrement that can be seen from space. Over generations, the projectile poo from tens of thousands of krill-eating birds dyes rock a delicate pink. This makes colony spotting easy, but for more precise calculations, the team of four scientists use drones and artificial intelligence to count nests. Then, armed with handheld clickers, they head out to sample areas to double-check their findings. Each cluster is counted three times in a row to ensure wandering penguins do not evade the census. One member of the team, Noah Strycker, described the process to me as \u201ca Zen-like activity\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2049da4017d28371a25a2443c9263ef33190e67b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2049da4017d28371a25a2443c9263ef33190e67b/0_0_4499_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinstrap penguins diving into the ocean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinstrap penguins diving into the ocean.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chinstraps have a reputation for being one of the noisiest and most aggressive of the penguin species. During courtship, the birds chat up potential mates with loud displays. After separating to gather food, they reunite with ecstatic greetings. If nests are threatened by predators, parents shriek protectively. Scientists have discovered that birds can filter out the background cacophony and focus in on the call of their own family members (the so-called \u201ccocktail party effect\u201d). But this skill becomes less essential as the chinstrap population diminishes, and the boisterous hubbub of the colony grows quieter. </p> \n<p>As we wandered from nest from nest to nest, totting up chicks, the loudest noise was from pubescent chicks nagging their parents for more regurgitated krill, the tiny shrimplike creature that constitutes the chinstrap\u2019s only meal. Scientists believe this dependence on a single food source is one reason why chinstraps populations are plummeting. Krill graze on organisms that grow under the sea ice, so when the ice melts, the krill disappear in turn. By contrast, another species of penguin, the gentoo, is thriving, because it is far less fussy about its diet. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff9931945a439b2592d4893449e4948e692dce63\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff9931945a439b2592d4893449e4948e692dce63/0_0_2902_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinstrap penguins mate on Low.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinstrap penguins mate on Low.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The population final count is not yet complete, but it is already clear that the chinstraps on Low are just as vulnerable as elsewhere. And it is not only the penguins that are in danger. \u201cSuch a big decline over a short time suggests something is broken in the Southern Ocean ecosystem,\u201d said Strycker.</p> \n<p>It was a sobering thought to sleep on Low amid that shifting climate. Our group may well have been the first in history to camp on the island. The polar guides had to tie the tents to boulders because there was no soil to bang pegs into. The tents withstood a cold night of wind and rain, but there was nothing anyone could do about the smell and the chatter. In the damp darkness, the penguins hunkered down, although they never fell completely silent. Thirty years ago, the noise would have been louder. The quietening of Low was far less soothing than it sounded.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd07e3d6fb3a4a92a53a483084585470711fc18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd07e3d6fb3a4a92a53a483084585470711fc18/0_0_4499_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Chinstrap penguin colony on Elephant Island, with the Esperanza in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Chinstrap penguin colony on Elephant Island, with the Greenpeace ship Esperanza in the background.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Chapter 5: Hannah Point and Discovery Bay</h2> \n<h2>The continent\u2019s greatest comeback<br></h2> \n<p>Over the next two days, the weather took a turn for the worse. With a storm brewing out at sea, we sheltered in Discovery Bay, an indent on the northern coast of Greenwich Island, waiting for a break in the clouds that refused to come. </p> \n<p>In the sea, the only signs of life were strings of <a href=\"https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/polar-research/polar-life/the-watery-world-of-salps/\">salps</a> \u2013 tiny tubes of transparent jelly with pink dots for bellies. As waters warm, these little zooplankton are thriving at the expense of krill, which is bad news for the ocean ecosystem and the climate because they are a lot less nutritious for predators, and they do not appear to play such a major role in helping the ocean absorb carbon dioxide. (Krill are better at this because they graze more on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/07/oceans-demise-the-end-of-the-arctic-as-we-know-it\">phytoplankton</a> \u2013 tiny, plantlike organisms that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.) The change is another consequence of the ominous sound we had heard on the hydrophone several days earlier. As the Antarctic melt gets louder, there will be fewer chinstraps and krill, more gentoos and salps, less oxygen, more acid, and, of course, less land ice and more sea water.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"034f5db2c2262e6f1c5a290bdab2ea61f6eaed43\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034f5db2c2262e6f1c5a290bdab2ea61f6eaed43/0_0_6605_4403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Bay In Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Discovery Bay in Antarctica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An increasing number of scientists believe the melting of West Antarctica is so far beyond natural fluctuations that it has become irreversible. In February, a first examination of the underside of the vast Thwaites glacier \u2013 which covers an area similar to that of the UK \u2013 showed extensive erosion by warm water. This and the nearby Pine Island glacier are now losing ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/16/thinning-of-antarctic-ice-sheets-spreading-inland-rapidly-study\">five times faster</a> than in the 90s. A collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now a serious concern. </p> \n<p>It might be tempting to think humanity can do nothing right, but the short history of human interaction with the Antarctic suggests we can at least learn from our mistakes and reverse some of the damage we have caused.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"881e807cf199a5b50b86cb1dca4d7c9b260b2d51\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881e807cf199a5b50b86cb1dca4d7c9b260b2d51/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant seals near a gentoo penguin colony on Livingston Island, South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant seals near a gentoo penguin colony on Livingston Island, South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The stratosphere high above our heads is proof of that. In the 1980s, the world was horrified to discover that certain chemicals had thinned the ozone layer and opened up a vast hole above the Antarctic that was raising cancer risks and disrupting weather systems and ocean currents. Since then, however, international efforts to reduce CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have eased that threat. This year, scientists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/global-efforts-on-ozone-help-reverse-southern-jet-stream-damage\">relieved to find</a> that disruption of southern wind systems has paused and may even be returning towards its natural state. There is a risk that a closed ozone hole will <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-12/study-finds-ozone-hole-repair-contributes-global-warming-sea-level-rise/\">trap more heat</a>, but the initial damage is on its way to being repaired. This is also true of wildlife in the region. </p> \n<p>For 4.5bn years, not a single whisper was carried on the winds or the waves of this region. It was only 200 years ago, years after the invention of the steam engine and electric lighting, that humans first caught sight of Antarctica. The explorers who first mapped the continent were lauded as heroes, but carnage often followed in their wake. James Clark Ross \u2013 the British naval officer who discovered the sea now named after him \u2013 knew exactly what would happen to the seals and penguins he saw on his voyage. \u201cHitherto beyond the reach of their persecutors, they have enjoyed a life of tranquillity and security, but will now, no doubt, be made to contribute to the wealth of our country,\u201d he wrote in his diary in 1841.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3292db9d66f5835659005418f94142a3b1f36f49\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3292db9d66f5835659005418f94142a3b1f36f49/0_0_4959_3306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whale identification work in Paradise Harbour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whale identification work in Paradise Harbour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Over the next 50 years, Britain and the US killed more than a million fur seals for their skins, and enough elephant seals to produce 20,000 tonnes of blubber for oil lamps, cosmetics and soap. In bay after bay, and on island after island, animal populations were almost wiped out. Penguins were boiled down for oil in giant digesters that could squeeze the fat out of 2,000 birds per day. When legal protection for penguins was finally put into place in the early 20th century, it prompted a surge in whaling to make up the shortfall in animal oil and fats. Several species of whale, including the blue, right and sei were hunted close to extinction. Others, such as the humpback, suffered an estimated 90% decline. </p> \n<p>Like seals and penguins before them, whales appeared to be doomed. But unfashionable regulations and often unpopular campaigning have made a difference. Steady increases since the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1985 have taken southern hemisphere humpbacks close to their pre-exploitation population of about 80,000, according to the <a href=\"https://iwc.int/status\">International Whaling Commission</a>. The scientists on the Greenpeace ships are helping to track whale populations by collecting vast amounts of acoustic data, such as the communal chatter of a pod of orcas and the thunderous clicks of the sperm whale, the loudest natural sound made by any creature on Earth. Thrillingly, blue whales are also making a comeback. Last month, a British Antarctic Survey mission to South Georgia <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/blogpost/blue-whale-comeback-at-south-georgia/\">recorded 55</a> in just three weeks. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eaf31c1d1a04fdbff8ebd2e6390835a27031945\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eaf31c1d1a04fdbff8ebd2e6390835a27031945/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humpback whales approach Cuverville Island during whale identification and hydrophone work in the Errera Channel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humpback whales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For campaigners, the recovery of whales is a much-needed reminder that international cooperation can be effective, protections can work, and our species is capable of undoing the damage we inflicted on the natural world. But nobody is complacent. The actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/may/23/vikings-review-history-channel-game-of-thrones\">Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd</a>, who had joined the trip in order to promote conservation to his social media followers, summed it up with a personal comparison. \u201cIt\u2019s like Antarctica is in recovery. I know a thing or two about that,\u201d he said. \u201cA low point has passed but the condition is still fragile. It needs more time or it could slip back again.\u201d </p> \n<p>After the storm finally abated, the Sunrise sailed back to King George Island, from where I would have to take a plane home. The closer we came to the airport, the more cruise ships and scientific vessels we saw. In the 10 days since we had left, summer had taken a visible toll. Hillsides that had been covered in snow were now bare, black rock. The naked Antarctic will never be a tourist draw, but it is a powerful reminder that underneath the Earth\u2019s fragile outer layer of water, ice, earth and vegetation, this is just another rock hurtling through space.</p> \n<h2>Chapter 6: King George Island</h2> \n<h2>An encounter with hope<br></h2> \n<p>Of all the moments during the trip, one stands out \u2013 an encounter in Paradise Harbour that stirred two rare feelings in the age of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\">Anthropocene</a>: pure unmitigated joy and a nascent sense of hope.<br></p> \n<p>I heard the humpback before I saw it. A ripple, a sigh, then a soft splash behind my back. I turned in time to see the dorsal fin arc languorously out and back into the water just like a fairytale sketch of a sea serpent.

It was thrilling. Did the whale realise there was an obstacle in its path? Our small boat would surely be upturned in a collision with a creature that size. </p> \n<p>The whale had something else in mind. After passing just below the surface a few metres from the front of our craft, it turned parallel and so close we could almost reach out and touch it. Then the whale tilted its giant head out of the water and yawned cavernously, revealing a bed-sized tongue and the bristled carpet of its baleen plates.

We were too excited to capture the encounter with any great skill. Nobody had pushed the record switch on the hydrophone. The clip I filmed on my phone was partly obscured by other bodies. Never mind. The moment would linger long in the memory. By listening, we had seen so much.</p> \n<p><em>Jonathan Watts\u2019s time on board the Arctic Sunrise was funded by Greenpeace</em></p>",
  "<p>With offices and schools around the world temporarily shut amid the coronavirus crisis, the video platform Zoom has seen overnight success. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing\">growing concerns</a> over security across the platform have many consumers wondering about tech alternatives.</p> <p>Privacy-minded consumers should consider video chat options carefully, said Arvind Narayanan, an associate computer science professor at Princeton University who has been outspoken about the security concerns surrounding Zoom.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a tradeoff between security and usability when picking a video-conferencing product,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies and schools should consider supporting multiple software options, configuring them securely, and educating their users about the risks.\u201d</p> <p>Among the most important criteria for evaluating a video conferencing platform is end-to-end encryption of calls and data protection policies, said Charles Ragland, security engineer at <a href=\"https://www.digitalshadows.com/\">Digital Shadows</a>, a San Francisco-based security provider. Companies should be in compliance with privacy frameworks like Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation or California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act, he continued, and should also tell users what data is being collected and what third parties can access that data.</p> <p>Here are some of your video-conferencing options for staying connected while sheltering in place:</p> <h2>Zoom</h2> <p>The app is headquartered in San Jose, California, and was valued at $16bn when it went public in 2019. It quickly became the most popular option for meetings and other events moving online following shelter-in-place orders this year.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> It\u2019s seamless to use \u2013 attendees can join by a publicly shared link from anywhere, and joining does not require downloading any software. It\u2019s a great option if you are not discussing anything private or secure \u2013 a virtual happy hour with friends, for example. The company has promised to fix issues with privacy and security, recently making default options more secure by requiring passwords to join meetings.</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Zoom has had some glaring problems of privacy and security. \u201cZoom bombings\u201d, in which hackers enter chat rooms to drop racist language and violent threats, persist. The company had to fix a bug that would have allowed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/zoom-doom/\">hackers</a> to take over a Zoom user\u2019s Mac. It also had to change some of its policies after a Motherboard report found Zoom <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account\">sends data</a> from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing\">\u2018Zoom is malware\u2019: why experts worry about the video conferencing platform</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company also claimed its calls were encrypted, and then backtracked when it was <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/\">proven wrong</a> by a report in the Intercept. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado has requested responses from Zoom\u2019s CEO, Eric Yuan, on privacy concerns and the FTC is being called to investigate the company.</p> <h2>Skype</h2> <p>Released in 2003, Skype is one of the longest-standing options for video chatting. It was bought by Microsoft in 2011 and is a free option for one-on-one or group video chats.</p> <p><strong>Pros: </strong>Skype is<strong> </strong>free, easy to use and widely known.</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>The maximum number of people who can join a Skype meeting is 50, making it a difficult option for larger organizations or big get-togethers.</p> <h2>Microsoft Teams</h2> <p>Schools in New York are transitioning from Zoom to Microsoft Teams, a work-from-home collaboration platform. The app has been gaining traction: Teams saw its daily active user count <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/microsoft-teams-hits-44m-users-huge-37-growth-spike-1-week-amid-remote-work-surge/\">rise more</a> than 37% during just one week last month, from 32 million to 44 million around the world.</p> <p><strong>Pros: </strong>The video platform allows for 250 people in a meeting or up to 10,000 viewers through its presentation feature. Users can easily share files and chat during meetings as well as screen-share. It is free and integrates with Skype.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The platform is built primarily for businesses, or \u201cteams\u201d. People who want individual access can do so via Skype accounts, but it appears to require a download of Skype to join meetings \u2013 unlike Zoom, which lets users attend meetings through their web browsers.</p> <h2>FaceTime</h2> <p>The built-in video call option for Apple products is an often overlooked option for group video chats, but a strong one for a number of reasons.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Apple is known for its strong encryption practices, meaning the company cannot see what you share during a call. FaceTime is also free for Apple users and does not require the download of an app.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> FaceTime is only available for users who have Apple devices, has a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/make-a-group-facetime-call-iph405ab67de/ios\">maximum of 32 users</a> per call, and does not allow people to join by link, making it hard to spread the word about your online event in advance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1d548a71d95b967c70cd5f713134d287d751c7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1d548a71d95b967c70cd5f713134d287d751c7d/0_100_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FaceTime is only available on Apple devices.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FaceTime is only available on Apple devices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sascha Steinbach/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Signal</h2> <p>Signal is an encrypted messaging app <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/\">widely considered</a> to be the world\u2019s most secure \u2013 and it is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/\">increasingly going</a> mainstream. It allows for large group chats, but not group video calls.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> It\u2019s encrypted and free to download.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Signal does not allow for group video chats, but it is useful for one-on-one video chats that require strong security and encryption.</p> <h2>Starleaf</h2> <p>The Cambridge, England-based video conferencing provider Starleaf was founded in 2008 and has grown in popularity as it pitches itself as a more secure video-conferencing alternative to Zoom. Call volume on StarLeaf has grown more than 1,000% compared to February 2020, the company said by email.</p> <p><strong>Pros: </strong>Starleaf is based in the UK and subject to local data privacy laws there. It also allows the consumer to choose where their user data is stored. It is used by NHS trusts in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Rather than the individual consumer, it targets organizations with 500+ employees \u2013 a good option for your company but maybe not for happy hour with your friends. Starleaf hosts up to 20 people per meeting and has a maximum of 46 minutes per meeting under its free option. Its paid plans offer up to 100 participants; another 1,000 people can watch but not participate.</p> <h2>Jitsi Meet</h2> <p>This video-conferencing platform was founded in 2003 by a student in France, and it has gained popularity as a more secure alternative to Zoom.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Jitsi Meet is free; open-source, meaning outside parties can check its security; and encrypted.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> It allows a maximum of 75 participants in a chat (and a \u201cbetter experience\u201d with 35 or fewer).</p> <h2>Houseparty</h2> <p>A series of now debunked reports claimed Houseparty had been breached \u2013 rumors the company is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/houseparty-privacy/\">now claiming</a> were part of a \u201cpaid commercial smear\u201d by a rival.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> This is perhaps the most fun video-conferencing app, with a number of games within the app, including trivia and drawing challenges.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> It appears that when you start a \u201chouse party\u201d, anyone in your contacts can join, but it is possible to \u201clock\u201d a room once the people you want to be there are in it. It also has questionable privacy policies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/houseparty-privacy/\">and collects</a> a \u201cworrying amount\u201d of information, according to one security researcher.</p> <h2>Google Hangouts</h2> <p>For those of us who use Gmail, Google Hangouts is a seamless option for video chats. Up to 150 people can participate in a chat, but only 25 people <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-people-can-be-in-a-google-hangout\">can participate</a> in a video call at once.</p> <p><strong>Pros: </strong>It\u2019s free and accessible.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Use it with the knowledge that Google will have even more of your data than it already does. A hangout can be joined via Gmail, the Hangouts app or a Chrome extension but it requires a Gmail account.</p> <h2>BlueJeans</h2> <p>The California-based video conference platform BlueJeans is a good option for work teams and meetings that require a little more security than a free Zoom session.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Videos are encrypted by default. BlueJeans can be accessed via browser and does not require an account or the download of a new program.</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>It is not free \u2013 BlueJeans costs $9.99 for a basic plan that allows meetings up to 50 people and $13.99 for its \u201cpro\u201d product, <a href=\"https://store.bluejeans.com/\">which allows</a> up to 75 people per meeting, among other features.</p>",

Subway lines have reported a drop of about 30%.</p> <p>Success in reducing human contact \u2013 widely seen as essential to slowing infection rates \u2013 will partly depend on companies keeping their employees off public transport, according to Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University hospital.</p> <p>\u201cJapanese people are generally obedient towards authority and play by the rules, but it depends on how cooperative companies are, and how much they are able to abandon traditional working styles and encourage people to work from home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Critics say concern over the impact the state of emergency will have on the world\u2019s third-biggest economy is behind Abe\u2019s reluctance to put more pressure on the corporate sector, particularly in Tokyo, which generates about a fifth of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.</p> <p>\u201cAbe appears to think that his job is to focus on salvaging what is left of his economic policy,\u201d said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.</p> <p>\u201c[Abe] seemed genuinely reluctant to call the state of emergency, so maybe out of fear of further damaging the economy, he dragged his feet for too long, but then he had no choice but to accept that the outbreak is now out of control,\u201d Nakano added.</p>",
  "<p>From Herculean efforts to keep children from interjecting in conference calls to fitness classes derailed by daytime drinking, a new sitcom in Spain \u2013 billed as the first of its kind on primetime TV \u2013 is set to tackle the quirks of life in lockdown.</p> \n<p>The show aims to offer a humorous take on the sweeping changes unleashed by the pandemic, said \u00c1lvaro Longoria, the creator and producer of <a href=\"https://www.rtve.es/rtve/20200402/1-estrena-sitcom-diarios-cuarentena/2011283.shtml\">Quarantine Diaries.</a> \u201cWe are in no way trying to make fun of the people that are suffering.

For more than three weeks, social gatherings, leisurely walks and outdoor jogs have been banned in Spain, with residents ordered to remain in their homes except for essential trips.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying help people confront this situation with humour,\u201d said Longoria, who produced the 2018 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/08/everybody-knows-review-penelope-cruz-and-javier-bardem-pull-no-punches-in-asghar-farhadis-heavyweight-kidnap-drama\">Everybody Knows</a> starring Javier Bardem and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to try and normalise it in some way.\u201d</p> \n<p>As a nod to the dark reality of the crisis, the producer\u2019s fee from the project was donated to purchase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-madrid-doctor-hospital-desperate-supplies\">protective gear for healthcare workers.</a> The first episode of the series aired on Tuesday on Spanish broadcaster RTVE.</p> \n<p>Featuring 15 well-known Spanish actors, including Carlos Bardem, the brother of Javier, the series launched the cast and crew on to a steep learning curve as they sought to make primetime television from the confines of the lockdown. \u201cThe beginning was a bit rough,\u201d said Longoria. \u201cWe have 10 different houses where actors are shooting themselves and being directed via Skype.\u201d</p> \n<p>The footage is then passed along a chain of editors, sound technicians and other post-production specialists. \u201cNobody has left their house. It\u2019s quite amazing but it works.\u201d</p> \n<p>In recent days, Longoria has received messages from production companies around the world, many of them interested in adapting the idea to their local reality. As for Spain, where the lockdown is due to be extended to 26 April, those behind the series have little idea of whether the show will continue beyond its first run of eight episodes.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe best-case scenario would be that the series is very short,\u201d said Longoria. \u201cSo this immediately becomes a part of history.\u201d</p>",

No deaths have been recorded. The country has focused on isolating anyone with links to a known case, as well as new arrivals, and has quarantined more than 67,000 people. A nationwide lockdown was also introduced on 1 April.</p> <p>There are harsh punishments for those who stray from official messaging or break the rules, enforced through the country\u2019s strong surveillance systems and a culture where, as Hiep\u2019s poster suggests, people are encouraged to report wrongdoing.

  "<p>Victims of child sexual abuse should not be dissuaded from coming forward and reporting perpetrators as a result of the jury conviction of Cardinal George Pell being overturned by the high court, a barrister and professor of law at La Trobe University in Melbourne says.</p> <p>Prof Gideon Boas said he was concerned by those questioning the merit of future cases brought in the criminal or civil jurisdiction based on the Pell ruling.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>It would be unfortunate and legally wrong if the message in the community was that the high court\u2019s ruling has weakened the strength of, or point in, bringing such cases to court or making properly founded allegations,\u201d Boas said. \u201cThe risk to this kind of messaging is that victims will give up or not bother coming forward. The bottom line is that the ruling will have little or no effect on civil cases and limited effect on future criminal cases.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/08/civil-claims-expected-against-cardinal-george-pell-and-catholic-church-despite-acquittal\">Civil claims expected against Cardinal George Pell and Catholic church despite acquittal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the Pell case had a set of unique and complex circumstances that would not necessarily be a factor in other jury trials.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, any case with an allegation of abuse that is historical and decades ago will have evidentiary issues, especially in cases with only one surviving complainant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean cases with one complainant are not capable of succeeding going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Boas added that the jurors who convicted Pell should not feel as though they had failed, and that the public should not read the high court decision as a challenge to the sanctity of the jury.</p> <p>\u201cVictoria\u2019s court of appeal upheld the jury decision by a majority, and the high court went the other way,\u201d Boas said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it said a lot in this case: \u2018how could the jury get it so wrong when the high court decided unanimously it was an unreasonable verdict?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cMy response is: what\u2019s to say the high court had it right? You had a jury process that functioned, you had a court of appeal that by majority agreed with them, and gave it serious consideration, and a high court who saw it differently. There is no system that is flawless. Some juries will give verdicts that are perverse or unreasonable and, sometimes, so will judges. But victims should know that overturning a jury decision happens rarely.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday the high court ordered Pell\u2019s immediate release from prison and quashed his convictions finding the jury, acting rationally on the whole of the evidence, ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to Pell\u2019s guilt. There was \u201cstrong, credible and undispelled\u201d alibi evidence presented at trial, including from the master of ceremonies at the time, Monsignor Charles Portelli, and sacristan Max Potter, that it was Pell\u2019s practice to greet parishioners on the front steps of the cathedral immediately after mass, which would have made it impossible for Pell to be in the sacristy offending, Pell\u2019s defence barrister Bret Walker had told the high court.</p> <p>But what are victims to make of the fact that jurors are told throughout a trial that it is up to them who they believe and whether they accept all, some, or none of the evidence from witnesses? That it was open to them, in other words, to believe the complainant but not in the reliability of other witnesses called.</p> <p>A professor the Queensland University of Technology faculty of Law, Ben Mathews, said it was \u201ca fantastic question that\u2019s really difficult to answer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt gets grey and murky and one thing that helps create this is the this tension in different court conclusions about the indeterminate notion of reasonable doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you have different courts and individuals making judgments about whether reasonable doubt should have been present when that concept isn\u2019t even defined. The reason for that lack of definition in Australia is we put the trust in juries to make the decision.\u201d</p> <p>What happens in the jury room in Australia is secret. Those discussions can never be disclosed, and a juror is breaking the law if they reveal them. Jurors also have their identities protected.</p> <p>Dr Tyrone Kirchengast,<em><strong> </strong></em>a barrister and solicitor of the high court, said the jury process was sacred, but that also meant it was difficult for studies to be done on how jurors come to their decisions or how much weight they gave different aspects of the evidence.</p> <p>\u201cEven after the trial is complete researchers can\u2019t interview them about their decision-making processes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best we have is mock jurors put together to try to study what happens. We should remember that it is only in rare cases where this overturning of a jury verdict occurs, and this is a case of significant notoriety.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have to also understand that justice isn\u2019t perfect and it can\u2019t always be perfect. It\u2019s the case that sometimes innocent people are convicted and guilty people aren\u2019t, and what we strive for in Australia is a system that eliminates errors as far as possible.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to think of criminal trials as a process of a perfect case being put to a perfect jury.\u201d</p> <p>He added that trial procedures were being continuously reformed to assist jurors to do their jobs and to lessen chances of error.</p> <p>Prof David Hamer, with the University of Sydney law school, researches the way criminal courts deal with evidence in determining whether to convict or acquit defendants. He said the Pell case was complex and even experts had different readings and views of it and the high court decision.</p> <p>He said while it was true that jurors were told it was up to them to be arbiters of the facts and to decide which evidence they believed, Pell\u2019s barrister had strenuously argued throughout the appeal that prosecutors had never sufficiently challenged evidence from witnesses such as Portelli.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/08/cardinal-george-pells-witness-j-child-sexual-abuse-survivor-verdict\">George Pell's accuser issues rallying cry to sexual abuse survivors in wake of verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Portelli\u2019s testimony unchallenged, jurors should have given more weight to it, the high court found.</p> <p>The complainant in the case against Pell who made the allegations said in a statement issued on Wednesday that he did not want victims to be disheartened by the decision.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to reassure child sexual abuse survivors that most people recognise the truth when they hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know the truth when they look it in the face.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s hitting the top and it\u2019s starting to come down.\u201d</p> <p>Trump claimed Louisiana needs far fewer beds than expected, a makeshift hospital at the Javits Center in New York \u201cisn\u2019t too heavily used\u201d and in general \u201cthe numbers are coming way down\u201d. He went on, \u201cI\u2019m not getting called where they need ventilators any more, so we were right on those ventilators\u201d \u2013 though he had taken a call from Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado on Tuesday night requesting a hundred.</p> <p>Such claims are likely to raise fears that Trump is sliding back into complacency, even as states such as New York and New Jersey struggle for ventilators and other equipment. The current US death toll is more than 13,000.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/intelligence-report-warned-coronavirus-crisis-early-november-sources/story?id=70031273\">was also asked about reports</a> that US intelligence officials warned as far back as late November that the coronavirus was spreading through China\u2019s Wuhan region and posing a severe threat. He said: \u201cWhen I learned about the gravity of it was some time just prior to closing the country to China \u2026 so I don\u2019t know exactly, but I\u2019d like to see the information.\u201d</p> <p>The briefing also strayed into absurdity when a reporter asked whether he would consider a pardon for Joe Exotic, who tried to hire a hit man to kill a rival and whose story is told in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">the Netflix series Tiger King</a>. \u201cYou think he didn\u2019t do it?\u201d Trump said. \u201cAre you recommending a pardon?\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ll take a look.\u201d</p>",

In doing so, he grossly misstated what that settlement entailed. </p> <p>In January, the conservative group Judicial Watch announced that it had settled a 2017 lawsuit against the state of California. The settlement required LA county to remove inactive voters from its voter lists, and required California to direct other counties to do the same. All parties to the settlement agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by LA or California. </p> <p>Judicial Watch estimated that as many as 1.5 million people would have been removed from voter lists in LA county. But, there\u2019s no evidence than any of those people voted illegally. Judicial Watch said most of that 1.5 million would have ben \u201cvoters who have moved to another county or state or have passed away\u201d.</p> <p>At the time of the settlement, Paul Mitchell of the nonpartisan research firm Political Data Inc told the AP that the case was insignificant because it pertains to inactive voters who \u201care not getting voting materials, they are not casting ballots, they are not showing up in precincts\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, the settlement got LA county to update old records. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T23:12:10.075Z\">at 12.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8e54388f08ec70ceced379\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T22:46:51.189Z\">11.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fact check: ventilators</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re in great shape from the bed standpoint.

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.

Purchases tripled in all three countries on the day the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">declared the coronavirus a pandemic on 11 March.</a></p> <p>Sales for the site doubled in Australia on 22 March when Prime Minister Scott Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/23/australia-shuts-down-in-the-fight-against-covid-19-in-pictures\">announced bars would close</a>, and in Britain on 21 March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">when Boris Johnson announced the same.</a></p> <p>\u201cLooking at what people were buying at that point it was all sex toys,\u201d said Emily Writes. \u201cIt was like they were thinking, \u2018We can\u2019t go to bars, we can\u2019t pick up, we can\u2019t go on dates.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Adult Toy Megastore was deemed an essential service by New Zealand\u2019s government and was allowed to continue operating during the shutdown because it sells condoms and medical items. All staff are working from home.</p> <p>While hundreds of social media posts have been devoted to naming the generation of children born following the pandemic \u2013 popular choices include Coronials, Quaranteens and Baby Zoomers, named after the video-conferencing application Zoom \u2013 analysts said a baby boom nine months after the lockdown was unlikely despite New Zealanders\u2019 apparent boredom.</p> <p>\u201cUncertainties like this tend to see delayed fertility because people feel uncertain about the world they\u2019re going to bring a child into,\u201d said Paul Spoonley, a distinguished professor in demography at Massey University. \u201cThose thinking of starting a family will probably put off that decision \u2026 I think the urge to delay will be stronger than the inclination to become pregnant, even by mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Couples who did not already live together had been separated by the lockdown, he added, and opportunities for casual sex had \u201cevaporated\u201d. After the shutdown eased, the country\u2019s economic woes would also dissuade many from having children, Spoonley said.</p> <p>Sexual health specialists were also not anticipating a baby boom, but warned some contraceptives were difficult to access in New Zealand during the lockdown.</p> <p>A global condom shortage is also looming because of factory shutdowns due to the virus, leading the United Nations to warn of \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences; including unplanned pregnancies and STDs.</p> <p>Restrictions on the operations of Malaysian contraceptive giant Karex, which makes one in every five condoms globally, means the firm expected to produce 200m fewer condoms than usual from mid-March to mid-April.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s Family Planning organisation had conducted hundreds of phone consultations each week, most of them requests for oral contraceptives which were running dangerously low in New Zealand\u2019s pharmacies, said Beth Messenger, a spokesperson.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the pills were limited because there was a non Covid-19-related manufacturing issue,\u201d she said, adding that others had not been stocked in large quantities. \u201cIn New Zealand, we\u2019re about as far away from anywhere as you can get, which from a Covid-19 perspective is probably a good thing but it means it\u2019s difficult to bring essential medications in.\u201d</p> <p>Due to the lockdown rules, Family Planning could not conduct in-person appointments, so clients were missing out on insertion or removal of IUDs or contraceptive implants or tests for sexually transmitted diseases. However, she said that because those complying with the lockdown rules could only have sex with those already in their homes, \u201ctheoretically STI transmission should decrease.\u201d</p> <p>The organisation also provided free or cheap pregnancy tests, and Messenger said many preferred to take these at Family Planning clinics because they could not afford to buy them from pharmacies.</p> <p>\u201cIf people are pregnant, we want them to have the health care they need,\u201d Messenger said, adding that Family Planning had urged the government to fund at-home tests during the shutdown. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant, they won\u2019t be able to access it.\u201d</p>",
