There are now 125,000 cases and 3,700 deaths.</p> \n  <p>Some observers have raised the possibility that the slow spread of the disease in Africa is due to the relative youth of populations. Moeti said data suggested that, as elsewhere, age and pre-existing conditions appeared important in determining the severity of each case, but countries everywhere on the continent faced significant difficulties accessing test materials and personal protective equipment for health workers.<br></p> \n  <p>A traditional remedy endorsed and distributed by the government of Madagascar will be tested thoroughly, she said. The WHO has previously <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2243669-no-evidence-madagascar-cure-for-covid-19-works-says-who/\">said there is no scientific evidence</a> that the herbal treatment is in any way effective.</p> \n  <p>Governments in Africa moved quickly to impose lockdowns and restrictions which helped slow the spread of the virus, but caused very significant problems to hundreds of millions of people living in poverty.<br></p> \n  <p>These are now being progressively removed, with South Africa, which imposed one of the strictest lockdowns, moving to level three on a scale of five this Monday. There has been controversy in the country - sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most-developed - over a decision to allow religious services to go ahead if worshippers are restricted to less than 50 and strict social distancing precautions are observed. A ban on alcohol sale and transport will also be lifted.</p> \n  <p>Zweli Mkhize, South Africa\u2019s health minister, told reporters that no lockdown could last for ever and that it was time to provide some social and economic relief. It was hoped that religious leaders could educate congregations about the virus and how to keep safe, Mkhize said, adding that it had become clear that the country would be dealing with the pandemic for one to two years so \u201cthere has to be a degree of easing\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The emerging hotspot for the disease in South Africa - and in Africa overall - has been the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, the international tourist destination.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfe9978f084e882655a8d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:42:18.110Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>GSK, the British pharmaceutical company, said on Thursday that its previous flu pandemic <strong>vaccine</strong> was not linked to a rise in cases of the sleep disorder narcolepsy.</p> \n  <p>The claim comes as the company said it planned to produce large volumes of an ingredient used in that vaccine for possible use in Covid-19 vaccines currently being developed.</p> \n  <p>According to <strong>Reuters</strong>, a spokesman for GSK said the \u201cscience has moved on\u201d since concerns were raised about links between narcolepsy and its H1N1 vaccine, called Pandemrix, which was developed during the flu pandemic 10 years ago. He said evidence now suggests the link is to the H1N1 flu virus itself, not the vaccine.</p> \n  <p>Previous studies in several countries, including Britain, Finland, Sweden and Ireland, had suggested Pandemrix was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/09/ministers-lose-fight-to-stop-payouts-in-swine-flu-jab-narcolepsy-cases\">linked to a significant rise in cases of narcolepsy in children</a>.</p> \n  <p>Pandemrix\u2019s ingredients included a booster, or adjuvant, known as AS03, that could potentially be an ingredient in at least seven experimental COVID-19 vaccines, including one being developed by Sanofi, with whom GSK signed a collaboration deal in April.</p> \n  <p>Wendy Barclay, a professor and chair in flu virology at Imperial College London, said that since the link between narcolepsy and the 2009/10 flu pandemic is thought to have been due to cross-reactivity between parts of the H1N1 virus and human proteins that control sleep patterns, the Pandemrix vaccine\u2019s adjuvant may have played a role.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the virus/host cross-reactivity is the mechanism or explanation, then using an adjuvant in the vaccine to boost the immune response may have increased the chances that this cross-reactivity was generated,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe still don\u2019t really know if this was the case or not.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfd9108f087e3ca0f652e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:27:14.177Z\">5.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Israel</strong> has launched a campaign to test 100,000 people for coronavirus antibodies, in preparation for a potential \u201csecond wave\u201d of cases, a top official said on Thursday, according to <strong>AFP</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The initiative is one of the world\u2019s largest such schemes and aims to test Israel\u2019s \u201ccollective immunity\u201d against the COVID-19 disease by determining how widely the virus has spread and who is most at risk going forward.</p> \n  <p>In parallel to the national campaign, authorities are also running separate surveys of \u201chigh-risk areas\u201d.

Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes).</p> \n   <p>There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in \u201clanes\u201d, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,442. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Military virus aid could look different if 2nd wave hits, says US defence secretary.</strong> US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that as the US military prepares for another potential wave of the coronavirus, it may do things a bit differently, providing more targeted aid for cities and states and possibly shorter quarantine times for troops, AP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea faces return to coronavirus restrictions after spike in new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/south-korea-faces-return-to-coronavirus-restrictions-after-spike-in-new-cases\">triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures</a> after appearing to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/south-korea-first-steps-post-covid-world\">brought the outbreak under control</a>.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America. </strong>The UN World Food Program is warning that upward of at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, shuttering people in their homes, drying up work and crippling the economy, AP reports. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Coronavirus knocks a third of European Foreign Direct Investment \u2013 survey. </strong>Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047.

He can do this by committing to an online harms bill that puts a legal duty of care on big tech to proactively identify and manage safety risks.</p> <p>\u201cNow is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.\u201d</p> <p>The number of offences under the 2017 law is accelerating, the figures show, with 23% recorded in the last six months of the period covered, which April 2017 to October 2019.</p> <p>There were 5,784 offences where the means of communication was recorded. Facebook, Messenger, Instagram or WhatsApp was used in 3,203 instances, 55% of the total where means of communication is known, while Snapchat was used 1,060 times.</p> <p>In February, the then digital minister, Matt Warman, promised to publish an online harms bill during the current parliamentary session following proposals set out in a&nbsp;white paper. The proposals included independent regulation of social networks with potential criminal sanctions if tech directors fail to keep children safe on their platforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper\">full response to the consultation on the </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper\">white </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper\">paper</a>&nbsp;is not now expected until the end of the year and the NSPCC has expressed concerns that a regulator may not be in place until 2023.</p> <p>The charity wants to see a bill that sets out a duty of care on tech firms to make their sites safer for children within 18 months.</p> <p>Susie Hargreaves, the chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, the UK charity responsible for finding and removing online child sexual abuse material, said: \u201cThe length of time it is taking is leading to uncertainty for us all which stalls progress. We support calls for the government to speed up the timetable for the introduction of the online harms legislation.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook said that it used integrated \u201cphoto DNA\u201d that scanned all images and videos on Instagram and Facebook and flagged known child exploitative material so it could be removed. It also said it used technology that detected child nudity and previously unknown child exploitative content when it was uploaded. This meant that 99% of child nudity content was detected by this technology and removed, Facebook said.&nbsp;</p> <p>A spokesperson added:&nbsp;\u201cThere is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms and we use technology to proactively find and quickly remove it. We have a content and security team of over 35,000 people investigating reports from our community and working to keep our platforms safe. Our teams also work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement, reporting content directly to specialists such as CEOP [the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command, part of the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency] and NCMEC [the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children].\u201d</p>",

The prime minister and cabinet continued to stand by him on Thursday.</p> \n<p>As part of their inquiry, detectives examined the aide\u2019s press conference on Monday, where he repeatedly said that he had done nothing wrong, and concluded he probably did.</p> \n<p>Police stopped short of a definitive declaration of rule-breaking because lockdown regulations had not been tested in the courts, sources with knowledge of the force\u2019s thinking told the Guardian.

But clearly he has flouted the government plea to stay at home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sir Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: \u201cPeople will be puzzled. How is the PM saying the Barnard Castle trip is legal when Durham police say it is not?&nbsp;It is an uncomfortable position the police have been left in. The public have to feel that people in positions of power are complying with the law. That\u2019s where there is a danger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Robin Lees, the retired chemistry teacher who spotted Cummings in Barnard Castle and took a note of his car registration number, said he welcomed the police conclusion.</p> \n<p>\u201cI did not need to drive 60 miles to test my eyesight \u2013 I knew it was him. Lots of Tory MPs have said he should resign but I guess that is up to him,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t really decide on his motivation but his statement does match mine. They [the police] said he broke the rules, just like the other two \u2013 Scottish chief medical officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood\">Catherine Calderwood</a> and government scientific adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">Neil Ferguson</a>. They did not get fined but they did resign.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Durham police statement said: \u201cDurham constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR [automatic number plate recognition], witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on 25 May 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.</p> \n<p>\u201cHad a Durham constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis.&nbsp;Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThe police have confirmed what we all knew, that Dominic Cummings broke the rules he helped to write. The country cannot afford for this saga to carry on. Only Boris Johnson can draw a line under it.</p> \n<p>\u201cKeir Starmer has said that if he was prime minister, he would have sacked Dominic Cummings. Boris Johnson should follow that advice. If he does not act then he will send a clear message that there is one rule for his closest adviser and another for the British people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Continuing to back Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said: \u2018The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed.\u201d</p> \n<p>In their statement Durham police said of Cummings\u2019 decision to drive from London: \u201cDurham constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father\u2019s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020.&nbsp;(We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general government guidance to \u2018stay at home\u2019).\u201d</p> \n<p>The force had carried out an exercise to establish the facts. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/durham-police-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-dominic-cummings\">asked to do so on Monday&nbsp;morning</a> by Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for Durham, who oversees the force.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed Cummings had driven&nbsp;from his London home to his parents\u2019 property in Durham on 27 March, at a&nbsp;time when the&nbsp;public were being told to stay at home to stop the&nbsp;spread of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The Durham inquiry said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to back claims that Cummings was in Durham again on 19 April, and that the prime minister\u2019s top aide had denied it.</p>",

Added to this is the fact that local authorities are taking different approaches.</p> \n   <p>All of this means the picture from Monday will vary widely between schools and areas according to local circumstances.

He stated on May 25 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.</p> \n   <p>Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR, witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on May 25 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.</p> \n   <p>Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis.</p> \n   <p>Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.</p> \n   <p>In line with Durham Constabulary\u2019s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.</p> \n   <p>By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.</p> \n   <p>Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on April 19 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.</p> \n   <p>Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:29:31.340Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfac088f084e882655a5b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:18:26.804Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson still backs Cummings despite 'minor breach' of lockdown rules</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A No 10 spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations.

have a \u201cdetrimental impact\u201d on home learning for pupils who are still at home, the leader of the headteachers\u2019 union has warned.</p> \n  <p>Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the <strong tabindex=\"-1\">National Association of Head Teachers</strong> (NAHT), said fewer teachers would be available to support children with remote learning if pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 are taught in smaller groups from next week.</p> \n  <p>His comments came ahead of the government\u2019s final decision on whether to reopen primary schools in England to more pupils from as early as Monday.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the school standards minister, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Nick Gibb</strong>, said it was \u201cdifficult to say\u201d whether the government\u2019s aim to get all primary school pupils back in class before the summer break will occur.</p> \n  <p>He told MPs on the education select committee: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Remote education, home education, will continue for the majority of pupils and young people \u2013 probably until the end of the summer term.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Findings from the NAHT suggest nearly three in five (57%) schools are providing home-learning resources for pupils daily and more than a quarter (29%) provide them weekly.</p> \n  <p>The survey of 4,784 school leaders, carried out earlier this month, also found that the majority of schools have been creating their own online resources as well as liaising with parents about home learning.</p> \n  <p>But the NAHT is concerned that the quality of remote learning on offer for the year groups that will not be returning to school in the summer term may suffer amid a wider reopening of schools in England.</p> \n  <p>Whiteman told the PA news agency: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Splitting classes in order to reduce the risk of transmission requires twice the number of staff, leaving fewer teachers to support those other children still at home.</p> \n   <p>I worry that an unintended consequence will be a detrimental impact on home learning. I know the profession will continue to do all that it can, there are no easy answers.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:18:27.918Z\">at 12.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecf90128f084e882655a419\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T10:24:49.420Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Another Tory MP says Cummings trip 'very difficult to justify'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Tory MP <strong>Rob Butler</strong> has said he found Dominic Cummings\u2019 trip to Barnard Castle \u201cvery difficult to justify\u201d, though stopped short of calling for him to go.</p> \n  <p>In a letter to a constituent seen by the Guardian, Butler said he felt \u201cthe guidance [on exceptional circumstances] can be interpreted in the way Mr Cummings has done\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He then added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>However, Mr Cummings himself said \u2018there is room for reasonable disagreement\u2019 about whether he should have stayed in London, and I do not criticise anyone who does indeed disagree with him.</p> \n   <p>Personally, I find the trip Mr Cummings took to Barnard Castle very difficult to justify and am disappointed that he did not apologise for it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A tally of more than 60 Conservative MPs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/inconsistencies-dominic-cummings-story-senior-tory-penny-mordaunt-lockdown\">including the cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt</a>, have now either been critical of the PM\u2019s most senior adviser\u2019s actions or called for him to resign or be sacked.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/list-grows-of-tory-mps-calling-for-cummings-to-resign\">The Conservative MPs calling for Dominic Cummings to go</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:08:24.921Z\">at 12.08pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecf8e068f084e882655a3fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T10:14:57.535Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These from the Labour MP <strong>Ben Bradshaw</strong> and Lib Dem MP <strong>Daisy Cooper</strong>, who say <strong>Dido</strong> <strong>Harding</strong> \u2013 the government\u2019s lead for the test and trace programme \u2013 has told them track and trace won\u2019t be fully operational until the end of June.</p> \n  <p>As others have pointed out, that is four weeks after lockdown measures are to be further eased.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BenPBradshaw/status/1265943777589551104\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dido Harding just told me on an MPs\u2019 conference call that Test, Trace &amp; Isolate won\u2019t be fully operational at local level till the end of June.

Referring to a study by the Reuters Institute into media coverage of the pandemic, Ahmed noted \u201cstrong support for the BBC\u201d, though warned of political polarisation among the audience. \u201cMay have an impact on our impartiality and trust scores if we appear either too soft on the government or too condemnatory,\u201d wrote Ahmed. \u201cThat delicate middle ground is where we need to be.\u201d&nbsp;But this is nobody\u2019s definition of \u201cimpartiality\u201d: the term may in fact be meaningless, but it definitely does not mean \u201chalfway between the government and its critics\u201d.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Indeed, if you were a government minister, you would be profoundly reassured by Ahmed\u2019s directions. After all, Britain has the <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries\">highest death toll in Europe</a>. According to new analysis by the&nbsp;Financial Times, Britain has the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">second-highest excess death rate</a> on Earth, after Spain.&nbsp;It would be journalistic malpractice to relay these facts without the context that helps explain how we have fared so badly: both the government\u2019s&nbsp;very<strong>&nbsp;</strong>late imposition of lockdown and its failure to place a &nbsp;cordon sanitaire&nbsp;around care homes. </p> <p>Which brings us to the furore over Newsnight&nbsp;presenter Emily Maitlis. In her now famous opening salvo in Tuesday night\u2019s broadcast, she declared: \u201cDominic Cummings broke the rules \u2013 the country can see that and it\u2019s shocked the government cannot. The longer ministers and the prime minister tell us he worked within them, the more the angry response to this scandal is likely to be \u2026 He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can now flout them.\u201d&nbsp;This may not be \u201cimpartial\u201d \u2013 but it does faithfully reflect a wide public consensus:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2020/05/23/56b74/1\">more than two thirds</a> agree Cummings broke the rules, including most Conservative and leave supporters. Public anger is reflected in <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/yougov-poll-conservative-party-lead-over-labour-drops-by-nine-points-a4451501.html\">collapsing ratings</a> for the Conservatives and Boris Johnson. </p> <p>Yet Downing Street complained directly to BBC top brass \u2013&nbsp;which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/bbc-switches-emily-maitlis-in-newsnight-episode-over-cummings-remarks\">rushed out a statement</a> chastising Maitlis for failing<strong> \u201c</strong>our standards of due impartiality\u201d. It is highly unusual for&nbsp;such an adjudication to be so swiftly delivered.&nbsp;Some of the Newsnight team are incandescent. \u201cWhen faced with a very clear choice between yielding to government pressure or serving viewers by telling them the truth, BBC management, shamefully, chose the former,\u201d says one&nbsp;Newsnight&nbsp;source. \u201cBBC bosses believe this helps preserve the organisation. All it will really do is sign its death warrant.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Impartiality is an absurd standard for journalism, which aspires to describe the world in a way that corresponds to reality \u2013 not in a way that finds a happy middle ground between competing perceptions of a given matter. If&nbsp;the heavens open and I declare it is raining, and you claim it is not, an argument between us is unlikely to illuminate the situation for viewers wanting to know the weather.</p> <p>It is difficult not to look at the Maitlis saga and refer back to the Ahmed email: while facts may have underpinned her introduction, they were sufficiently damning to look \u201ctoo condemnatory\u201d. In response to my question, a BBC spokesperson said the email had&nbsp;\u201cno bearing\u201d on yesterday\u2019s statement on Newsnight, and that their news editorial guidelines \u201cmake clear our commitment to impartiality, establishing the truth, and providing fair and accurate coverage\u201d, and they \u201creviewed&nbsp;<em>Newsnight</em>&nbsp;against these principles, and not as a result of any political pressure\u201d.</p> <p>But the BBC\u2019s position seems to suggest that it doesn\u2019t matter if No 10 insistence that Cummings did not break the rules is at odds with the views of the rest of the country, a significant chunk of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\">parliamentary Conservative party</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/1266034560049045504\">Durham police</a> or any commonsense reading of the rules. Does anyone truly believe that if someone else had been the subject of an unflattering&nbsp;Newsnight&nbsp;introduction, and they had phoned the BBC\u2019s editors to complain, such a ruling would have been issued within hours?&nbsp;</p> <p>If impartiality is your stated aim, it is those with the greatest power and influence who are able to claim there have been breaches and to demand they are rectified. The government controls the BBC\u2019s funding taps and renews its annual charter. As a result, the BBC will always be bogged down in futile debates about impartiality \u2013 when the real standard of journalism should be independence.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The water minister, the National party\u2019s Melinda Pavey, had requested a draft regulation to amend the Water Act by exempting irrigators without a \u201cwater access licence\u201d.</p> \n<p>That regulation was issued on 7 February. The next day, under intense pressure from cotton irrigators, the department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/12/nsw-green-light-to-irrigators-to-harvest-rainfall-angers-downstream-residents\">lifted a short-lived embargo</a> that had allowed floodwaters to flow into the upper tributaries of the desperately dry Darling River.</p> \n<p>With northern irrigators now exempt from the Act and with the embargo lifted, several hundred gigalitres of water may have been harvested by the end of March, according to independent northern&nbsp;Murray Darling&nbsp;Basin specialist Bill Johnson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For 20 years the NSW government allowed their northern basin mates to build whatever they wanted to catch water off the floodplains, but it was never legal</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>MP Helen Dalton</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWater just disappeared, we don\u2019t know where it is, but it is really important we find out where water goes in these events,\u201d Johnson said. If his estimate is correct, the volume may have been larger than the annual 320 gigalitres the basin plan requires to be returned annually to the river system.</p> \n<p>The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Helen Dalton said the minutes of the meeting show the so-called \u201cshell game\u201d was still in play.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor 20 years the NSW government allowed their northern basin mates to build whatever they wanted to catch water off the floodplains, but it was never legal,\u201d Dalton said. </p> \n<p>\u201cThey rushed to issue a regulation to get around the law, depriving the entire river system below. It\u2019s wiped out communities, horticulturalists, graziers, dairies, rice and grain growers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The significance of NSW hurrying regulation to exempt irrigators from prosecution is profound.</p> \n<p>The exemption allows for unapproved works \u2013 potentially including hundreds of dams, banks and levees \u2013 to be considered \u201celigible works\u201d, with no need for approval. </p> \n<p>It has sparked fury from downstream communities, who have called for a royal commission. </p> \n<p>Chris Brooks, chair of Southern Riverina Irrigators, a litigant in a class action against the Murray Darling Basin Authority for its alleged water mismanagement, said the failure to enforce apparent breaches of the law continued to \u201cthrow the southern basin under the bus for a few big, politically connected cotton farmers to make insane profits\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>For the thousands of small businesses, which have been the beneficiary of many of the Covid-related measures announced by the government over the past three months, the landscape after September is particularly treacherous.</p> \n<p>The single biggest unknown is the extent to which they will be able to resume business. It\u2019s unlikely international tourists will resume arriving.</p> \n<p>But will people be back in their offices, going to dinner in restaurants, having coffee meetings, or even travelling between cities? Or will there be a second wave of infections that sees us retreat to more stringent rules on social interaction.</p> \n<p>And what will that uncertainty mean for confidence and spending?</p> \n<p>The unknowns are compounded by a lack of clarity about what will happen when the various Covid stimuli end.

It gives businesses with a turnover of $50m or less to get a credit for the PAYG tax they would usually pay on behalf of employees.</p> \n<p>Each business received a minimum of $20,000 and up to $100,000 in two payments and they didn\u2019t need to do anything other than lodge their usual business activity statements.</p> \n<p>The credits for those who filed their BAS monthly flowed swiftly and gave them 300% in the first month. This meant that many did not then need to write cheques to the ATO during the crisis and could use the credit against other liabilities like GST payments.</p> \n<p>Combined with jobkeeper, which also injects money into businesses by way of a wage payment (that must be passed on to the employeee) it appears to have forestalled a mass of collapses, particularly in retail and hospitality.</p> \n<p>Whether businesses can survive beyond September without these cash injections depends entirely on how fast the economy comes back. If as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/australias-treasury-chief-says-government-should-worry-about-jobs-and-not-rising-debt-during-coronavirus-crisis\">Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, suggested</a> last week, we are heading more for a U than a V-shaped recovery, then some additional support for cash flow may be essential.</p> \n<p>However, other measures have proved less successful.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/the-hardest-time-in-my-life-how-service-providers-shoulder-the-burden-of-free-childcare\">'The hardest time in my life': how service providers shoulder the burden of free childcare</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>The devil in the writeoff detail</h2> \n<p>One of the early business Covid-19 stimulus measures \u2013 an enhanced instant asset writeoff to encourage businesses to invest \u2013 appears to have fizzed because of fears about the direction of the economy and disrupted supply lines during the crisis.</p> \n<p>The measure, announced in the first round of stimulus measures on March 12, allows businesses to claim the full value of equipment they buy up to the value of $150,000 (up from $30,000) against their income for the 2019-20 financial year.</p> \n<p>The writeoff is now available to not just small business but businesses with a turnover of up to $500m. But there\u2019s a catch. The equipment must be paid for and delivered to the business by 30 June.</p> \n<p>Hard data on the uptake of the concession won\u2019t be available until companies lodge their tax returns but anecdotal evidence (and perhaps common sense) suggests that many business owners, faced with uncertainty, are choosing to preserve their cash rather than buy new items.</p> \n<p>For instance, motor vehicle sales were down 48.5% in April, compared to the same month last year, according to the industry sales tracker, V-Facts. Sales were already sluggish in calendar 2019, down 8% in compared to 2018.</p> \n<p>V-Facts doesn\u2019t separate business and private sales, but purchases of Hi-Luxes, the ubiquitous tradie vehicle, were down 35.5% in April.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want to say it\u2019s fantastic: $150,000 gives farmers the capacity to buy a major piece of kit whereas $30,000 was not sufficient,\u201d said the small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut you have to have something to write it off against. It\u2019s not a grant, it\u2019s an immediate writeoff of assets to $150,000,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>For farmers likely to get a decent crop this winter, a new harvester or tractor might be just what they need, but they have had big hits to their incomes over the past 12 months or more during the drought.</p> \n<p>Then there is the problem of disrupted supply lines.</p> \n<p>Around the world, factories such as John Deere, which makes farm machinery, have been affected by shutdowns or have pivoted to making Covid protective gear.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/27/work-in-progress-a-60bn-miscalculation-could-make-jobkeeper-fairer-and-lead-to-quicker-recovery\">Work in progress: a $60bn miscalculation could make jobkeeper fairer and lead to quicker recovery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great incentive for business to invest and that flows right through the economy.

Carnell would like to see the rules on delivery relaxed so that companies, who can now see the light at the end of the lockdown, can take advantage.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly there are some bright spots.

Stick with me here, because the origin story is confusing.</p> <p>In January the Korean actor Jung Il-woo was filmed having a coffee at Macau\u2019s Hon Kee Cafe, which is famous for its whipped coffee. The owner, <a href=\"http://travel.cnn.com/leong-kam-hon-secret-kung-fu-coffee-maker-macau-552646/\">Leong Kam-hon</a> (who lost the use of one arm in a shipping container accident, became a kung fu devotee and opened a cafe) once served it to the Chinese actor Chow Yun-fat while he was filming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the early aughts. I told you it was confusing.</p> <p>Hon says he learned the whipped coffee technique from \u201ca foreign couple\u201d years earlier. It\u2019s unclear if the couple were just explaining the common Indian homestyle \u201cbeaten coffee\u201d (for which the technique is identical), but soon Dalgona coffee (now named for its resemblance to a nostalgic Korean honeycomb candy) was spreading among YouTubers, TikTokkers and Instagrammers.

Secret corporate recipes</strong></h2> <p>By April corporations had well and truly leaped on to the isolation cooking bandwagon, releasing official recipes for popular food products.

Of course not.</p> <p>Personally, I don\u2019t think you need to provide a dissertation on the origins of every spice when you decided to put a teaspoon and a half into a recipe. Does putting chickpeas and literally two spices into a stew even make it Indian? If an Indian person puts chilli in a recipe do they need to give a shout out to Christopher Columbus and the new world 500 years after the fact?</p> <p>I can tell you with some degree of certainty that if Alison Roman had dared call #thestew Indian, the rebukes would have been fast and severe. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure she isn\u2019t trying to convince anyone she invented turmeric.</p> <p>Of course we should be aware of which voices are elevated in food media, and divorcing recipes from their cultural origins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/23/do-online-recipes-come-with-too-much-backstory-its-all-part-of-the-joy-of-food\">has its problems</a>, but attribution isn\u2019t one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if the cooks of the subcontinent never published their own recipes for chickpea stews. You could have cooked one of those if you wanted to.</p> <p>When a thing goes viral it\u2019s not because of the person who made the thing. It\u2019s not even because of the media. It\u2019s because of us.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you want to know why chickpea stew took off in a New York minute, or why it took a Korean actor to send Indian beaten coffee around the world, don\u2019t ask Alison Roman or Jung Il-woo.

  "<p>Opening schools to more children from Monday could lead to a new surge of infections of Covid-19 in the community, a group of independent scientists has warned.</p> <p>The&nbsp;report, by the&nbsp;Independent Sage&nbsp;group, suggested that plans for whole classes to return to school in England on 1 June could increase the R-value of infections by 0.3 \u2013 potentially enough to put the country back on an ever increasing trajectory of infections.</p> <p>The committee accused the government of not listening to its own scientific advice.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just too early,\u201d said Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser and the chairman of Independent Sage. \u201cWe know that \u2026 opening up schools has the potential to raise R by up to 0.3. So we are really concerned that the level of infectivity across the country as a whole is too high to open schools.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/publics-trust-in-science-at-risk-warns-former-no-10-adviser\">King established the Independent Sage group</a> to look at how the UK could work its way out of coronavirus lockdown after the government\u2019s official panel of scientific advisers, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-whos-who-on-secret-scientific-group-advising-uk-government-sage\">faced criticism over a perceived lack of transparency</a>.</p> <p>Delaying school openings by two weeks could halve the risk of infection, the report estimates, while waiting until September would reduce the risk further. The governments in Scotland and Northern Ireland have already announced that schools will not reopen to more pupils until after the August holidays, while Wales has said its schools will not do so on 1 June.</p> <p>A delay would give more time for infections in communities to fall \u2013 but also for the track and trace system, launched on Thursday, to be more extensively tested before being relied on to keep new infections in check.</p> <p>Prof Karl Friston, a computational modeller at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage committee said that opening schools without more robust surveillance could mean that new outbreaks would initially go unnoticed. \u201cYou will only know in your region several weeks or months after you have made a mistake, hence the importance of real-time data,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The government\u2019s most recent estimates puts the R-value at between 0.7 and 0.9. Once R exceeds 1, the number of infections increases exponentially, while an R below 1 will lead to a decline.</p> <p>The government\u2019s official Sage committee has modelled the impact of seven ways schools could reopen, which all result in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-uk-r-number-rate-deaths-cases-nhs-a9504496.html\">the R</a> value&nbsp;increasing, with some scenarios increasing it only marginally. However, estimates at the upper end suggest it could increase by between 0.35 and 0.5. The Independent Sage report states that in the case where there are ongoing new infections within the community, evidence suggests that reopening schools could increase R \u201cby up to 0.3\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe school reopening scenario chosen by the government is not one of those modelled by Sage, making the potential impact of reopening even more uncertain,\u201d the Independent Sage report said. \u201cRobust testing systems are not in place everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the independent report cast further doubt over the government\u2019s efforts to press ahead with the wider reopening of primary schools in England.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s primary duty should be to protect its people, but in England \u2013 unlike the rest of the UK \u2013 we are hurtling towards the further opening of schools before the scientific evidence says it is safe to do so,\u201d Bousted said.</p> <p>The report also urges authorities to consider outdoor teaching \u2013 in marquees and playgrounds \u2013 and to also run summer camps, with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes, to help pupils catch up on their education during the summer holidays.</p> <p>It also raises the prospect that asymptomatic children could become \u201cinstitutional amplifiers\u201d, spreading the virus unnoticed into the community and that there is heightened risk of the effects of the disease for families with children living in intergenerational households, or who come from a BAME or disadvantaged background.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Curbing the coronavirus outbreak involves a familiar mantra: test, trace, isolate. As of this week, the government will begin to roll out the second part of this strategy. In theory, contact tracers will call or text people in England who test positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide a list of everyone they have met for longer than 15 minutes, who will then receive a message instructing them to self-isolate for 14 days (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are rolling out separate programmes).</p> <p>But already, England\u2019s contact-tracing strategy looks set to be hobbled by the government\u2019s reluctance to involve local authorities and regional public health expertise in its coronavirus response from the outset, and its dogmatic commitment to outsourcing health services to the private sector. &nbsp;</p> <p>Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading the programme of testing and tracing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenPBradshaw/status/1265943777589551104?s=20\">recently conceded</a> that the system won\u2019t be fully operational at the local level until late June.

The JBC\u2019s roles include collecting and analysing data about Covid-19 infection rates across England, identifying and providing real-time analysis about local outbreaks and recommending appropriate responses to spikes in infections \u2013 for example, whether schools or workplaces in local areas should be closed, or whether different restrictions should be imposed in different areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Details on how the JBC will be staffed or set up to provide real-time data and intelligence for local authorities haven\u2019t been published. Somewhat bizarrely, rather than appointing a public health specialist to lead the body, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/former-counter-terror-official-tom-hurd-put-in-charge-new-uk-biosecurity-centre-coronavirus\">the government has appointed Tom Hurd</a>, a senior Home Office counter-terrorism official. According to <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/joint-biosecurity-centre\">the Institute </a><a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/joint-biosecurity-centre\">for Government</a>, the JBC is modelled on the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which analyses counter-terrorism intelligence and sets the terrorism threat level for the country. In much the same way, the JBC will set a coronavirus threat according to five different levels. But as with all centralised bureaucracies, there\u2019s a risk that the JBC will contribute to delays, as data trickles down to the local areas where it\u2019s needed most. There\u2019s also a risk that members of the public will be put off by their data being held by an organisation modelled on a centralised counter-terrorism organisation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Crucially, test results can\u2019t be anonymised if they are to be used in local disease control management. Once again, trust in the system is vital. Both the JBC and local authorities will have to rely on the various private companies that have been contracted to deliver aspects of the testing and contact-tracing strategy in England, including Randox, Deloitte, Serco, G4S and Sodexo. The detailed specifications of their contracts are not public, and the division of roles and responsibilities between the centre, local authorities and the private sector remain unclear. It\u2019s hard not to wonder why England has created such a complicated and fragmented architecture for itself, rather than following the example of other countries that have involved local authorities from the outset.</p> <p>I previously worked as director of public health in Hammersmith and Fulham, and I\u2019ve seen the efforts of public health teams in north-east London during this epidemic.

The treaty has been signed and ratified by 168 states but it will not come into force until the US, China, Iran, Israel and Egypt have ratified it, and it is signed and ratified by India, Pakistan and North Korea.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the US has observed a voluntary moratorium on tests, as have the UK, France, Russia and China, and the CTBTO preparatory commission was established to set up a network of 300 seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide sensors around the world, that helped identify nuclear tests by India, Pakistan and North Korea.</p> <p>Zerbo noted that the US is the biggest financial contributor to the CTBTO and its verification regime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/nuclear-weapons-donald-trump-arms-control-chaos\">Fumbling the nuclear football: is Trump blundering to arms control chaos?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the past year, the US has accused Russia and China of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/china-may-have-conducted-low-level-nuclear-test-us-report-claims\">secretly conducting very low-yield tests</a>, an accusation that both countries have denied, and for which the US has yet to provide evidence.</p> <p>\u201cThe CTBTO\u2019s international monitoring system [IMS] has been operating as normal and has not detected any unusual event,\u201d Zerbo said.

  "<p>There are sublime moments in music that only the cognoscenti notice, plenty that millions love, and some that many sense without quite knowing why. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgRcCyey1hM\" title=\"\">Kind of Blue</a>, the 1959 recording led by Miles Davis, had enough of all of them to become the bestselling jazz album ever.</p> <p>Jimmy Cobb, the drummer and last surviving member of that landmark session, who has died aged 91, was not just a crucial contributor to a jazz revolution unleashed by it, but the instigator of a split-second playing choice on one of its best known themes that seems to define the here-and-gone magic of the best of jazz.</p> <p>Cobb\u2019s magic moment on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rD3zdscDRQ\" title=\"\">So What</a>, Kind of Blue\u2019s opening track, was the quintessence of perfect timing and the definition of his receptivemusical character. The tune\u2019s setup seems to suggest at first that the music has nowhere to go, with the pianist, Bill Evans, apparently lost in preoccupied reflections around a slowly shifting three-chord motif with the bassist, Paul Chambers.</p> <p>Evans then implies he has found a route out, thickening the chord harmonies before Chambers brings in the tune\u2019s famously catchy bass hook, while Cobb ticks off a quiet pulse with a cymbal sound like someone idly shaking a bag of loose change, and Davis and the saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian \u201cCannonball\u201d Adderley repeat a minimally simple rising and falling two-note hook.</p> <p>Then Davis hangs out a single sustained note as if dangling it over a long drop, resolves it with an answer an octave beneath and Cobb breaks into a disruptive drum hustle and a cymbal smash as the trumpeter\u2019s solo eases into swing, and such a captivating improvised trumpet solo that composers have since transcribed it for performance as if it had been laboured over note by note.</p> <p>Cobb was to react instinctively to situations like that all his working life. That moment was not fortuitous for him, but the obvious option at the time for the astute 30 year-old percussion accompanist who had already partnered the vocal-toned R&amp;B saxophonist <a href=\"https://jazz.fm/earl-bostic-alto-tude/\" title=\"\">Earl Bostic</a>, the gospel-rooted and pop-savvy singer <a href=\"https://whenwordsmatter.typepad.com/before_their_time/2013/01/dinah-washington-was-looking-forward-to-christmas-after-six-weeks-out-west-singing-for-adoring-audiences-in-los-angeles-an.html\" title=\"\">Dinah Washington</a> , and Davis partners including pianist Wynton Kelly and Adderley. Those connections taught Cobb the patience to wait for the turning moment \u2013 in jazz, usually unscripted \u2013 of a soloist\u2019s entry, the drive to power a blues, and much more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24236403b4a04a0501c90b472a9bfe9af2475f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24236403b4a04a0501c90b472a9bfe9af2475f83/0_380_3021_1812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left, bass player Paul Chambers, trumpeter Miles Davis and Jimmy Cobb at the Apollo theatre, New York, 1960.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left, bass player Paul Chambers, trumpeter Miles Davis and Jimmy Cobb at the Apollo theatre, New York, 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herb Snitzer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Washington, Jimmy was the son of Wilbur Cobb, a security guard and taxi driver, and his wife Katherine (nee Bivens), a domestic worker. As a teenager in the mid-1940s he became obsessed with jazz, staying up at night to listen to the American wartime DJ Symphony Sid\u2019s broadcasts and washing dishes in diners to save money for a drumkit \u2013 on which he aimed to learn the polyrhythmic innovations of the bebop drum gurus Max Roach and Kenny Clarke. Largely self-taught, though he briefly studied with the National Symphony Orchestra percussionist Jack Dennett, Cobb had accompanied <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/billie-holiday-anniversary-death-jazz-age-cause-a8997656.html\" title=\"\">Billie Holiday</a> in Washington and partnered Charlie Parker and Davis on Symphony Sid\u2019s roadshow before he was 20.</p> <p>By 1950, he was on the road with Bostic, whose hit-making R&amp;B band of the period included such jazz-sax luminaries as Coltrane, Benny Golson, and Stanley Turrentine. Cobb and Kelly then accompanied Washington for some years, a period in which Cobb was having a relationship with her, and a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/quincy-jones\" title=\"\">Quincy Jones</a> was writing some of the singer\u2019s arrangements.</p> <p>The drummer\u2019s antennae were retuned by the musical differences between his own Catholic background and Washington\u2019s Baptist one. \u201cWhen I heard that Baptist sound, it took me over,\u201d Cobb later told the jazzwax.com\u2019s blogger Marc Myers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to hearing that. It would make the hairs stand up on my arms and neck, where people are singing and shouting in church. That struck me right away. She taught me to put the passion into what I was doing.\u201d</p> <p>In 1956, Adderley hired Cobb to play on his Verve Records sessions Sophisticated Swing, Quintet In Chicago and Takes Charge, with the latter two staffed by the Miles Davis band without the trumpeter. Those connections led via brief stints with Stan Getz and Dizzy Gillespie to Kind of Blue, though Davis\u2019s work in the period following ran on different tracks, with Coltrane and subsequently Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock exploring more modally stripped-down, scale-based music rather than the songlike forms Cobb had experienced with Bostic and Washington.</p> <p>Cobb and Kelly played with the jazz guitarist <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.obituaries/HtAGLQnFu5Q\" title=\"\">Wes Montgomery</a> between 1962 and 1965, formed a trio with Kind of Blue bassist Paul Chambers that recorded with guitarist Kenny Burrell, and from 1970 to 1978 the drummer partnered the operatically eloquent vocalist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sarah-Vaughan\" title=\"\">Sarah Vaughan</a>. He worked thereafter with many leading younger musicians of the postbop generation including sometime Miles Davis saxophonist David Liebman, trumpeter Art Farmer, and pianists Kenny Drew and John Hicks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5930a0af65a5d6f04f6b49c136e76d22e94569da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5930a0af65a5d6f04f6b49c136e76d22e94569da/0_132_5100_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Cobb playing Kind of Blue with his So What Band at the Hay festival, 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Cobb playing Kind of Blue with his So What Band at the Hay festival, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Morgan 02/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cobb taught in summer schools in Europe organised by Duke University, North Carolina, and for the New School for Social Research. New York, in the 1980s, worked regularly with Adderley\u2019s cornetist brother Nat, and toured and recorded regularly in the US and Europe in the following decade.</p> <p>Drawing from his New School student connections among others, Cobb formed the quartets and quintets he called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOvt01w-9ts\" title=\"\">Cobb\u2019s Mob</a> in 1998, performing and recording with them into the 21st century in lively postbop lineups including a young Brad Mehldau, the composer-guitarist Peter Bernstein, tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, and the Marsalis family patriarch, the pianist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/02/ellis-marsalis-jazz-wynton-branford\" title=\"\">Ellis Marsalis.</a></p> <p>On the 50th anniversary of Kind of Blue, an 80 year-old Cobb memorably went to the UK with a group including the uncannily Miles-like trumpeter Wallace Roney and the saxophonists Javon Jackson and Vincent Herring \u2013 spurring those timeless themes with his old lazily springy dynamism, even if the renditions might have been a little lighter and funkier for some.</p> <p>In June 2008, he received the Don Redman Heritage award from Michigan State University, and the following year a National Endowment for the Arts NEA Jazz Masters award. Cobb continued to perform and teach, aided by his wife, Eleana Tee (nee Steinberg), and daughters Serena and Jaime, all of whom survive him. He had previously been married to Ann Porter, who died in 1987.</p> <p>He was often asked for the secrets of his light and buoyant drum sound and hair-trigger reflexes, but he had no magic formula. \u201cThe first thing is they have to love it\u201d was his advice.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Jimmy (James Wilbur) Cobb, drummer, born 20 January 1929; died 24 May 2020</p>",

Legal experts have described the process as unconstitutional but say little can be done.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese communist party is \u2026 imposing a draconian law which can be used to silence dissent in Hong Kong and infringe on freedoms\u201d said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a coalition of human rights NGOs.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s decision appeared to expand the scope of the legislation to proscribe \u201cacts and activities\u201d that endanger national security, which experts say could target broader behaviour such as attending an unauthorised rally.</p> <p>The legislation, which bans all \u201cactivities of foreign forces\u201d interfering in Hong Kong affairs, has added to diplomatic tensions for Beijing, which is already facing international scrutiny over the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In a joint statement, Australia, Canada, the UK and the US said: \u201cChina\u2019s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations.\u201d They called on Beijing to work with the Hong Kong government and people to find a \u201cmutually acceptable accommodation\u201d.</p> <p>The UK separately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">said it would extend visa rights</a> for as many as 300,000 Hong Kong British national (overseas) passport holders if China does not change tack.</p> <p>Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, which has promised to help Hong Kong residents in need, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iingwen/status/1265980907137101826\">posted on Twitter</a>: \u201cWe will not sit back and watch while Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, democracy and human rights are eroded.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said his government would no longer consider Hong Kong as separate from mainland China and would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">revoke its special trade status</a>.</p> <p>China\u2019s foreign ministry office in Hong Kong called the US statement \u201cutterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless\u201d and ordered America to \u201cimmediately stop meddling\u201d.</p> <p>EU foreign ministers will meet on Friday over video link to discuss the Hong Kong crisis,.</p> <p>Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said he hoped the UK would work with its allies to stand up to Beijing. \u201cI think we need to wake up to the fact that this is a new Chinese regime and it\u2019s a different sort of aggressive communism and it needs to be defended against,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/a-history-of-resistance-key-dates-in-hong-kongs-battle-with-china\">A history of resistance: key dates in Hong Kong's battle with China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the vote, the Hong Kong government repeated its support for the legislation, which would require authorities to promote \u201cnational security education\u201d and report regularly to the central government.</p> <p>The chief executive, Carrie Lam, said the laws \u201calso show the care of the country toward Hong Kong\u201d, adding that her administration would fully cooperate to \u201ccomplete the relevant work \u2026 as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Hong Kong residents predicted an increase in emigration as the laws move ahead.

  "<h2>START FOOTBALL!</h2> <p>Following the Premier League\u2019s unanimous decision to embark on Phase Two of Project Restart, Troy Deeney has agreed to return to Watford training having opted to sit out his team\u2019s first tentative steps back on to the pitch because he didn\u2019t want to risk bringing home a virus that might endanger his infant son\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Fiver presumed curiosity had got the better of Troy, who wished to see how his teammates would pull off the impressive feat of gathering in small groups and tackling one other while simultaneously&nbsp;\u201cminimising unnecessary close contact\u201d. Sort of like a government advisor simultaneously breaking the law while not actually breaking the law, such contortions take a certain level of expertise to pull off. But let\u2019s face it, Craig Cathcart and Daryl Janmaat didn\u2019t get where they are today trying to achieve the mundane.</p> <p>As it happens, Deeney has decided to return to work after having his concerns about the disproportionate amount of coronavirus deaths in the BAME community allayed by Dr Jonathan Van Tam, the government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer and a man you may have seen standing behind a Downing Street lectern alongside assorted Tory hypocrites as they portentously told us all to stay at home, stay safe and not under any circumstances embark on any unnecessary 260-mile trips to Durham.</p> <p>\u201cThe first conversation I had with Jonathan was maybe three weeks ago,\u201d said Deeney. \u201cThe last conversation we had was on Friday and he had so much more information, so much more detailed analysis.\u201d But what\u2019s this?!?!?! It seems Deeney hasn\u2019t a second to lose when it comes to shifting any excess timber with which he may have inadvertently become upholstered during lockdown.</p> <p>It appears that the Fiver\u2019s surprisingly successful STOP FOOTBALL campaign has been overturned on appeal and FOOTBALL WILL START AGAIN on 17 June when Aston Villa entertain Sheffield United and Manchester City host Arsenal, with a full Premier League fixture list to follow behind closed doors on the weekend of 19-21 June. Now how\u2019s that for a mid-Fiver newsflash?!?!?!</p> <p>Anyway Troy, you were saying? \u201cI saw some comments in regards to my son, people saying: \u2018I hope your son gets corona\u2019,\u201d he said, showing that while football may have stopped, some of the more unsavoury weirdos who follow it certainly haven\u2019t.&nbsp;Referring to the manner in which he and Danny Rose got \u201cabsolutely hammered and battered\u201d for voicing concerns about returning to the training ground, Deeney said it wasn\u2019t just the players themselves who were shipping abuse.</p> <p>\u201cThe missus gets direct messages and you\u2019ll be walking down the street and people will be like: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m at work, you go back to work\u2019,\u201d he said. Given Troy\u2019s caution when it comes to contagion, the Fiver can but hope a respectful amount of social distancing was maintained when such conversations took place. A suitably wide Watford gap, if you will.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cMy plan was always just to go for the three years and then get into a club job, which would be what I wanted to do \u2026 I think international football for a 41, 42-year-old can get quite frustrating \u2014 so I thought, get some experience and then cut my teeth in day-to-day running with the energy that I\u2019ve got\u201d \u2013 Phil Neville says he managed England\u2019s women\u2019s team to get into club management.

  "<p>A cross-party group of MPs are seeking to change Britain\u2019s abortion laws to ban late terminations that are carried out on the grounds of minor physical abnormalities.</p> <p>The abortion (cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot) bill, which is led by the Conservative MP Fiona Bruce and supported by 13 MPs, will be presented in parliament on 3 June. </p> <p>Cleft lip, cleft palate and club foot can be corrected shortly after birth with minor surgery and physiotherapy but in some cases, the first two conditions can be indicative of other, serious conditions. </p> <p>One mother, Sophie Caldecott, was offered abortions throughout her pregnancy after her 20-week scan showed her daughter had clubfoot.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMy daughter is now six and you can\u2019t tell that there was anything wrong with her feet or ankles now, thanks to very minor surgery in her first few months and physiotherapy,\u201d said Caldecott, \u201cBut when the sonographer discovered the problem, she told my husband and me that we could have our money back for the scans, and implied it was likely we\u2019d want an abortion.\u201d</p> <p>Caldecott was offered another abortion at her next scan, five weeks later. \u201cOn the one hand, medical professionals were reassuring me that this was a minor birth defect that could be easily corrected, yet on the other, I was being offered an abortion after the usual 24-week cut-off point as though my child had a severe and life-altering disability.\u201d</p> <p>But Clare Murphy from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service has criticised the bill. \u201cWhile this bill has no chance of progressing, it is a deplorable attempt to weaponise an extremely small number of terminations and politicise the heartbreaking situation of women faced with making these decisions about what are often much longed-for pregnancies,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Under the Abortion Act 1967, a woman can have an abortion after 24 weeks only if she is at risk of grave physical and mental injury, or there is a severe foetal abnormality.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Bruce, whose son\u2019s clubfoot was corrected with surgery and physiotherapy, said the law is being interpreted as though the 24-week limit does not apply to children diagnosed with the conditions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now been 30 years since parliament last properly reviewed the law on abortion for disability,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time our legislation caught up to reflect society\u2019s positive change in attitudes towards those born with disabilities, and medical advances in the intervening years.\u201d</p> <p>According to official abortion statistics for England and Wales, there were aout 75 abortions between 2011 and 2018 for the principal condition of either cleft lip or cleft palate.</p> <p>But European researchers have <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9845780/Cleft-lip-abortions-10-times-as-common-as-reported.html\">raised concerns about under-reporting</a>, saying more than 10 times as many take place for cleft lip than are recorded in official statistics.</p> <p>In 2013 a review by Eurocat, an organisation that collects data about congenital abnormalities across 23 countries, found that 157 babies were aborted in the UK with these conditions between 2006 to 2010, despite official figures only recording 14 such abortions. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2272783/Dozens-abortions-carried-foetuses-minor-imperfections-cleft-lip-club-foot.html\">Eurocat also found </a>that 205 babies with clubfoot were aborted in England and Wales in the same period.</p> <p>Abortion is classed by government as a matter of conscience, with politicians allowed to vote according to their moral, ethical or religious beliefs.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>It sounds like a scene from a Latin American gangster movie: police intercept four young Brazilian men with a submachine gun and a sawn-off shotgun \u2013 an alleged hit squad en route to assassinate a gang member over a drug debt.</p> <p>But the checkpoint and arrests on Wednesday happened not in Rio de Janeiro but in Clara, a town in County Offaly in the midlands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFour males are currently detained under section 30 Offences Against the State Act and a number of firearms have been recovered,\u201d Ireland\u2019s police force, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, said in a statement.</p> <p>Garda\u00ed suspect the men, in their 30s, were recruited by one of two families involved in a feud, Irish media reported. The dispute allegedly started over a \u20ac70 (\u00a363) drug debt and escalated on social media, prompting one faction to bring in the outsiders to target a rival at a house in Tullamore in Offaly.</p> <p>Garda\u00ed received intelligence about a planned murder and put the men, who are suspected of involvement in the drugs trade, under surveillance, the Irish Times reported.</p> <p>Early on Wednesday the men were travelling from Dublin, three in a van, one in a car, when the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) performed a \u201chard stop\u201d \u2013 using police vehicles to force the van and car to stop before arresting the men at gunpoint.</p> <p>They are being questioned at Tullamore and Portlaoise police stations and must be charged or released after three days.</p> <p>Conflict between gangs involved in the drug trade has been linked to a spate of violent incidents in midland towns in recent years.</p> <p>Hiring outsiders is unusual in Ireland\u2019s gangland but has precedent. A separate, far deadlier feud between the Hutch and Kinahan organised crime gangs prompted the Kinahan gang to contract an Estonian hitman, Imre Arakas. He was jailed in 2018 for planning a murder.</p> <p>\u201cNow the notion of a South American hit team on the streets of a small midlands town doesn\u2019t seem all that far-fetched,\u201d a senior garda told RT\u00c9.</p> <p>There is also a grisly precedent for disputes escalating on social media. Robbie Lawlor, a gangster taunted on social media over his flip-flops being stolen, was suspected of taking revenge by abducting, murdering and dismembering a rival gang member in January. Lawlor was subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/police-fear-gangland-feud-from-irish-republic-now-being-fought-in-belfast\">shot dead</a> in April.</p>",
  "<p>The formal statement from Durham police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/dominic-cummings-potentially-broke-lockdown-rules-say-durham-police\">on Dominic Cummings\u2019 travels</a> to the county during lockdown is sufficiently cautious that both the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser and his accusers are likely to quote elements to support their arguments. Here we analyse key sections of the statement.</p> <h2><strong>The trip from London to Durham</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On 27 March 2020, Dominic Cummings drove to Durham to self-isolate in a property owned by his father.</p> <p>Durham constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father\u2019s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020.&nbsp;(We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general government guidance to \u201cstay at home\u201d.)</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p> <p>The force does not say Cummings was right or wrong to drive from London to Durham. Instead, its statement draws the clear distinction between government guidance and legislation.</p> <p>The government has failed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/what-are-your-new-rights-during-englands-lockdown\">align the law</a> as set out in the health protection regulations with NHS or government guidance, and such ambiguities over personal responsibility have repeatedly arisen during the pandemic.</p> <p>Regulation 6 in the emergency regulations is the one that deals with the list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/driving-for-exercise-allowed-under-lockdown-rules-police-advised-coronavirus\">\u201creasonable excuses\u201d</a> for someone to be away from their home, of which there are many. The excuses in force at the beginning of April have since been amended.</p> <h2><strong>The \u2018test drive\u2019 to Barnard Castle</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On 12 April 2020, Mr Cummings drove approximately 26 miles from his father\u2019s property to Barnard Castle with his wife and son. He stated on 25 May 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.&nbsp;</p> <p>Durham constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR [automatic number plate recognition], witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on 25 May 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Had a Durham constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis.&nbsp;Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken. In line with Durham constabulary\u2019s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p> <p>Durham police decided they could only say Cummings \u201cmight\u201d have breached the rule, because the courts have not yet tested the legislation. </p> <p>The chief constable, Jo Farrell, felt it was not for police to \u201cconvict\u201d Cummings, and hence the use of the word \u201cmight\u201d. Its use is not meant as a sign of doubt about the flouting of the regulation. Also, it is possible Cummings might have come up with a compelling reasonable excuse.</p> <p>Several legal commentators immediately focused on the conditional point. David Allen Green <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/1265989373616631808\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThe \u2018might\u2019 in the statement means that the police would have \u2018considered\u2019 that there was a breach for the exercise [of] the 8(3)(a) power. It would not be for the police officer to determine criminal liability: that is a matter for the court.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly the Secret Barrister, an anonymous criminal legal expert, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarristerSecret/status/1265977744996925440\">tweeted</a>:&nbsp;\u201cThe police having considered the evidence have expressed the view that Cummings did break the law.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>No further action \u2013 police policy</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Durham constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.</p> <p>By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.</p> <p>Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on 19 April 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Therefore Durham constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p> <p>The statement makes clear the force is not going to pursue Cummings \u2013 or anyone \u2013 retrospectively. On the matter of the claims that Cummings was seen in Durham on 19 April, officers did not make a definitive ruling.</p>",

Trump accused Twitter of censorship \u2013 in a tweet \u2013 and has announced plans to issue an executive order that could strip social media companies of protections against liability for user content.</p> <p>In his Fox News interview, Zuckerberg appeared to move to head off the possibility. Since its platform was hijacked by foreign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/russia-us-politics-social-media-facebook\">propaganda campaigns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">harvested</a> for private data by malicious actors during the 2016 election season, the company has stepped up government lobbying campaigns in Washington, Britain and worldwide.</p> <p>To assist the effort, Zuckerberg hired and promoted Joel Kaplan, a Republican operative in Washington, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg\">Nick Clegg</a>, Britain\u2019s former deputy prime minister, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-coronavirus.html\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Trump, who is facing an uphill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">re-election</a> bid, has not criticized Facebook for months.

The 2020 Trump campaign is reprising the effort.</p> <p>But the Trump campaign was not the only entity using Facebook to help Trump win in 2016. In March 2018, a whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">revealed to the Observer</a> that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that worked with Trump\u2019s election team and the winning Brexit campaign, harvested millions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;profiles of US voters for use in targeting political ads.</p> <p>The company later acknowledged that&nbsp;hackers had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/04/facebook-said-the-personal-data-of-most-its-2-billion-users-has-been-collected-and-shared-with-outsiders/?utm_term=.18af517384b6&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_14\">scraped</a> information from profiles of more than 2 billion users worldwide.</p> <p>Those developments saw a contrite Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments\">summoned</a> before Congress in the spring of 2018, where he apologized for allowing imposter accounts with foreign backers to target American voters with advertising meant to polarize political opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,\u201d Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments\">said</a> then. \u201cThat goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think there are a number of areas of content we need to do a better job of policing on our service,\u201d Zuckerberg added.</p>",
  "<p>China\u2019s unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">plans to impose sweeping anti-sedition laws on Hong Kong</a> have prompted mass protests and international condemnation.</p> <p>Beijing says the legislation is meant to stop subversion, terrorism and secessionism as well as foreign interference that could endanger national security. In the aftermath of the increasingly violent mass protests last year, China\u2019s government has said such laws are urgently needed to plug Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cnational security loophole\u201d. The legislation will be written in Beijing and directly added into Hong Kong\u2019s de facto constitution, known as the basic law.</p> <p>Critics say the move signals Beijing\u2019s intention to place Hong Kong firmly under its control and sounds the death knell for the city\u2019s existing rights and freedoms.</p> <h2>What freedoms are under threat in Hong Kong?</h2> <p>For years, Hongkongers have used the phrase \u201ccooking a frog in tepid water\u201d to describe the gradual erosion of freedoms and rights in their city under Chinese rule since its handover from the British in 1997. The new security laws represent a dramatic and swift escalation of that process.</p> <p>Residents, legal experts and human rights advocates are worried that regulations used in mainland China to suppress and punish dissent will be applied in Hong Kong, where authorities ultimately answer to Beijing.</p> <p>Specifically, residents are worried about their right to free speech and assembly, an important channel of political expression for Hongkongers who do not get to elect their government\u2019s highest office.</p> <p>\u201cGiven how broadly defined the terms of \u2018national security\u2019 and \u2018subversion\u2019 are, every protest that criticises the Hong Kong and Chinese government can be construed as violating the law, thus banned and their participants arrested,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division.&nbsp;</p> <p>More fundamentally, the basis of Hong Kong\u2019s legal system, its independent judiciary, and vaunted values of rule of law are under threat. </p> <h2>What could the Chinese authorities to do under the laws?</h2> <p>One of the most concerning element of the laws, according to draft legislation released last week, is that they enable China\u2019s national security organs to establish \u201cagencies\u201d in Hong Kong \u201cwhen needed\u201d.</p> <p>This could come in the form of security forces, secret police, intelligence agencies, or a separate court established to hear related cases. One Hong Kong delegate to the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), China\u2019s largely rubber-stamp parliament, proposed a \u201cnational security court\u201d in which only Chinese judges would hear such cases.</p> <p>In mainland China, national security agents regularly harass and intimidate dissidents, journalists and residents who voice criticism against their government or otherwise are accused of undermining public order by \u201cpicking quarrels\u201d. The national security laws and stationing of mainland agents in Hong Kong raise questions over how involved these agents will be in the efforts to \u201cprevent, stop and punish\u201d security threats.&nbsp;</p> <p>By including the reference to foreign interference in the legislation, the laws could allow Chinese authorities to ban international NGOs and human rights groups that operate out of Hong Kong. NGOs critical of the Chinese government have already been feeling pressure from Beijing over the years. The measure could also target pro-democracy activists who raise support and awareness internationally and work with groups overseas.</p> <h2>What comes next?</h2> <p>The standing committee of the NPC will now draft the new security laws. Bills usually go through three readings by the committee before approval but can be adopted after just two sessions if a consensus is reached. The committee, which meets every two months, is scheduled to next meet in late June but special sessions can be called.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://npcobserver.com/2020/05/22/2020-npc-session-npcs-imminent-decision-on-national-security-in-hong-kong-explained/\">NPC observer</a> blog, if no special sessions are called and normal procedure is followed the laws could be passed by the committee in August. But Chinese officials have called for the laws to be enacted \u201cwithout delay\u201d while state media have said legislation has already been mostly drafted and could be signed into a law \u201c<a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1189195.shtml\">as early as the coming weeks</a>\u201d.</p> <p>After it is approved in the NPC, the legislation will be listed in Hong Kong\u2019s basic law, under a provision that allows national laws to be implemented in the territory, which is meant to enact and enforce its own laws. It is a legal manoeuvre that allows Beijing to bypass Hong Kong\u2019s legislature where the measures could be blocked by opposition lawmakers and public resistance.</p> <p>.</p> <p>The delay leaves an opening for protesters to take to the streets again. Lunchtime protests have been called for Friday and another possible rally at the end of the month. Online some demonstrators have called for people to stage a \u201c100-day war\u201d before the laws are enacted.</p> <h2><strong>What don\u2019t we know yet?</strong></h2> <p>It is unclear who will enforce the laws. Under Hong Kong\u2019s de facto constitution, Chinese laws should not apply to the city and its own legislature should enact legislation in the common law tradition. Its laws should be enforced by the city\u2019s own law enforcement agencies and be administered by local courts.&nbsp;</p> <p>We also do not know how the legislation will define the crimes of subversion, terrorism, separatism and foreign interference \u2013 as well as what exactly constitutes \u201cacts and activities\u201d endangering national security.</p> <p>A summary of the decision approved by the NPC on Thursday included slight changes to the previous version, adding \u201cactivities\u201d as well as \u201cacts\u201d.Some legal experts believe the language expands the scope of the legislation to include organisations as well as individuals and others say it may be a way to target more general activities like attending an unauthorised rally.</p>",

Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: \u201cChasing targets and large numbers are meaningless \u2026 The absence of results going to patient records is making it difficult for general practice to manage the pandemic, and when it comes to track and trace, if we don\u2019t have the information we can\u2019t do what we need to do.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Marshall wrote to Hancock earlier this month asking for GPs to get access to the missing results.</p> \n<p>The rapid testing centres, set up by the DHSC with help from management consultants at the accounting firm Deloitte, are the backbone of Hancock\u2019s plan to control the spread of coronavirus.

  "<p>I was born in London, to Indian parents who grew up in apartheid-era South Africa. When I was seven we left Wimbledon for a tiny village in the Laurentian mountains, in Quebec, where our back garden was a wilderness. A year and a half later, we moved again to Montreal and the St Lawrence river flowed at the end of our suburban street. As a child, there was never a moment when I didn\u2019t dream of becoming a writer, or of travelling abroad. But I never saw or read about anyone like me, a small, brown woman, going off and doing adventurous things. I\u2019d see those men \u2013 and it was always men \u2013 in books and on TV and I\u2019d wonder how they made these things happen. Why did they get to have all the fun? Becoming a travel writer was the dream, spending time in wild landscapes too \u2013 for me there is not a great schism between travel writing and narrative nature writing, at least the kind I now enjoy reading.</p> <p>Long before I even thought it possible to write professionally, I\u2019d make frequent visits to the holy of holies, Stanfords Travel Bookshop. Here I\u2019d trawl the shelves, desperate to read about someone, anyone, who looked like me, or looked at the world through a prism other than the prevailing one. I can still recall my delight when stumbling upon Eddy L Harris\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-03-01-bk-5277-story.html\">Native Stranger: A Black American\u2019s Journey into the Heart of Africa</a></em>. I was fascinated: here was a man with black skin who was seeking to know himself better while roaming in the land of his ancestors. As he put it: \u201cThere is a line that connects the place we come from and the place we find ourselves, those lives and our lives. And I longed to follow that line.\u201d This was very different from the escapist, \u201chero lit\u201d, travelogues written by white men who wrote about the people they encountered and landscapes they traversed as though mere backdrops to their adventuring prowess. Though Harris\u2019s background and experiences were different from my own, they felt infinitely more relatable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whenever I have been about to set off anywhere, I can\u2019t help but wonder: how will I be received?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/09/society\">Pico Iyer</a>\u2019s 1988 book <em>Video Night in Kathmandu</em>, about his travels in Nepal and exploration of the Americanisation of ancient civilisations, I remember thinking, how did he make that book happen? I think I was more interested in how a man like him even got published than in the narrative itself. He wrote of having become accustomed to \u201ccross-cultural anomalies and the mixed feelings of exile\u201d in his life. When I read this, in my twenties, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have nodded hard. Here was someone who had been born in England (like me), was of Indian descent (tick), and now lived in California (I was in Montreal). OK, he wasn\u2019t an Asian female \u2013 the possibility of a woman with brown skin writing that book, at the time would have been so unthinkable as to be in the realms of of fantasy \u2013 but you can\u2019t have everything. His words went deep and I didn\u2019t feel I was on the other side of a glass wall.</p> <p>Later, I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/guest-house-for-young-widows-by-azadeh-moaveni\">Azadeh Moaveni</a>\u2019s 2007 memoir <em>Lipstick Jihad: A Memoir of Growing U</em><em>p Iranian in America and American in Iran</em>. In it, she wrote: \u201cBeing a Persian girl in California, it turned out, was like, a totally different thing than being a young Iranian woman in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d Here was a woman who had worked as a journalist for Time magazine in Tehran for two years. She was different (like me) and yet she had achieved this impressive career.</p> <p>Eventually, I made my own way as a travel writer. Yet, whenever I have been about to set off anywhere, I can\u2019t help but wonder: how will I be received? When travelling, I often experience what I\u2019d describe as \u201chypervisibility\u201d: it\u2019s there in the barely suppressed look of surprise I\u2019ve seen on my host\u2019s face because they\u2019ve never seen a travel writer who looks like me. In India, I have the disorientating feeling of \u2013 for once \u2013 looking the same as everyone else, and yet culturally being neither of the place, nor <em>not</em> of it. My mother cooks Indian food, though not always, my father, when he was alive, listened to Indian classical music and read Indian literature, but not exclusively.</p> <p>But there are positives too: sometimes the bonds have been formed more easily because local people don\u2019t see me as a threat to their culture \u2013 there is no whiff of colonialism, however distant. I\u2019ve noticed this on the occasions when I\u2019ve met people from indigenous cultures, for instance in Queensland, Australia, and in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/taliban-kalash-pakistan-afghanistan\">Kalash valleys</a> of northern Pakistan. There was a relaxed friendliness and a lack of formality, confidences shared, no deferential lowering of eyes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/11/women-nature-writing-forestry-commission-writers-in-residence\">Enchanted forests: the women shaking up nature writing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I pursued my career, my interest became focused on landscape and nature: I\u2019ve always been drawn to the belief, common in indigenous cultures and among those of nature-based faiths, that it is possible to enter into a reciprocal and meaningful relationship with an animate nature. So when I came to write <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/losing-eden-why-our-minds-need-the-wild-by-lucy-jones-wanderland-by-jini-reddy-review\">Wanderland</a></em>, I set off in search of the magical across British landscapes. I had intriguing experiences in all corners of the land: in Herefordshire, for instance, with a follower of the Old Ways; on Iona in the Hebrides, when seeking a mysterious land temple; or in Sussex, following a \u201ctreasure map\u201d to hidden healing springs.</p> <p>During my year\u2019s journey around the UK I found myself compelled to explore my own experience of otherness. That feeling of being on the hard end of curiosity or suspicion or of feeling vulnerable is not unique. If you\u2019re a woman you can feel uncomfortable when a man sidles up and wants to strike up a conversation, or if you have an accent that isn\u2019t local. But your skin colour marks you out from the word go, before you\u2019ve uttered a word. You are defenceless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8530f0561f92232ebc91ac4bd1710e1efa533f11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8530f0561f92232ebc91ac4bd1710e1efa533f11/0_355_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johny Pitts, photographed in Peckham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johny Pitts, photographed in Peckham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do I see any of these nuances reflected in today\u2019s writing?

But when your interests veer towards the eco-spiritual, that thins out the field even further. Reflecting on some of the narratives that first drew me in, I think, for example, of Charlotte Du Cann\u2019s <em>52 Flowers That Shook My World</em>, Jay Griffiths\u2019 <em>Wild</em>, Eleanor O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s <em>Eyes of the Wild</em>, Eliot Cowan\u2019s <em>Plant, Spirit, Medicine</em>, and <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> by Robin Wall Kimmerer, a botanist and citizen of the Potawatomi Nation. I also loved Cheryl Strayed\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/15/books-to-give-you-hope-wild-by-cheryl-strayed\">Wild</a></em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/17/i-skied-solo-across-antarctica\">Felicity Aston</a>\u2019s <em>Alone in Antarctica,</em> both outdoors memoirs.

  "<p>Domestic abuse survivors have been told they must appear in person to give evidence to MPs despite raising concerns about coronavirus infection risks. </p> <p>The requirement has raised criticism from charities and campaigning groups.</p> <p>Eighteen domestic abuse and women\u2019s rights groups, including&nbsp;Women\u2019s Aid, Refuge, and Amnesty International, have written&nbsp;to the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, to say it is unacceptable to require survivors of domestic abuse to attend parliament in person.</p> <p>So-called hybrid parliament arrangements, allowing individuals to provide evidence to&nbsp;scrutiny&nbsp;committees&nbsp;via&nbsp;video link, are set to end next week after a decision by Rees-Mogg.</p> <p>At least three women who have experienced domestic abuse are to give evidence on 4 June to the public bill committee for the domestic abuse bill, a long-awaited piece of legislation going through parliament.

This requirement is&nbsp;unsafe&nbsp;for survivors,&nbsp;especially for&nbsp;women&nbsp;from black and minority ethnic communities&nbsp;and those with&nbsp;disabilities. It will put&nbsp;survivors and staff supporting them at risk and force them to&nbsp;breach&nbsp;current government guidance.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must&nbsp;urgently&nbsp;reconsider this requirement.&nbsp;We also urge&nbsp;the bill committee to make time to hear from&nbsp;a wide range of&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;working to end domestic abuse, including&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;marginalised&nbsp;survivors whose voices are often unheard.\u201d</p> <p>Other signatories to the letter include the End Violence Against Women Coalition, Respect, SafeLives,&nbsp;and Rape Crisis England and Wales.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe landmark domestic abuse bill will transform the way we support victims and tackle perpetrators.<br><br>\u201cThe government is committed to ensuring the House of Commons has the opportunity to hear from survivors and we are looking at options to facilitate remote participation for those in unique circumstances so their voices are heard and they can continue to contribute to the bill.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A Commons spokesperson said: \u201cThe scheduling of legislation in the Commons is a matter for the government.

Other times, they aren\u2019t running thorough background checks, or they determine an officer\u2019s record would not be a liability, said Ben Grunwald, a Duke University law professor.</p> <p>In a study Grunwald co-authored last month for the <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer\">Yale Law Journal</a>, he and another researcher found that an average of roughly 1,100 officers working in Florida each year have previously been fired. They tended to move to agencies with fewer resources and slightly larger communities of color. The fired officers were also twice as likely to be fired a second time compared to officers who have never been fired.&nbsp;</p> <p>The consequences of this rehiring are severe, said L Chris Stewart, a civil rights attorney based in Atlanta. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fear losing your job and you know you have all these different immunities that will protect you, you know you will get away with [misconduct].\u201d He said it was hard not to think of this dynamic when watching the video of the Minneapolis killing where the officer ignored Floyd\u2019s cries for help.&nbsp;</p> <p>An attorney for Chauvin did not respond to a request for comment, and the other officers could not be reached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some advocates have pushed for a publicly accessible national database that documents officers\u2019 disciplinary histories, which could help prevent re-hirings that endanger the public. \u201cYou can look up what a doctor has done, what a realtor has done, what you and I have done as members of the public, but you have no way to look into the background of a person with a badge and a gun,\u201d said Pointer.</p> <p>Marc McCoy, whose brother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/the-life-and-death-of-rapper-willie-mccoy-executed-by-police\">Willie McCoy was killed by police in Vallejo, California</a> last year, said it was hard when the family learned that the officers involved had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/willie-mccoy-police-shooting-taco-bell\">previously killed other civilians</a> and been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/vallejo-police-shooting-bike-ronell-foster-willie-mccoy\">subject of excessive force complaints</a>. \u201cThese laws that you think will lead to the officers\u2019 arrest are actually there to protect them,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>In 1987, Nigel Gilmartin was working as a mobile DJ in Blackburn: weddings, engagements and birthdays at community halls; the shirt-and-tie scene at weekends. That summer, he fell under the spell of the Sunday-night shows on Key 103FM as DJ Stu Allan played early acid house and hip-hop across Greater Manchester and Lancashire. Gilmartin would meticulously note the name of every track and then scour east Lancashire\u2019s record shops with his list. One record shop staffer told him about Tommy Smith, a hippy Glaswegian hedonist who was looking for DJs for a new type of party in Blackburn. The next day, Gilmartin gave him a call.</p> <p>Blackburn\u2019s venues were uninterested in Smith\u2019s designs on bringing house music to the town until Clitheroe Kate \u2013 a key figure in the town\u2019s gay scene around Mincing Lane \u2013 rented Smith a room at a bar called Crackers. \u201cYou knew something was happening,\u201d says Gilmartin of the first party. \u201cIt was absolutely bouncing.\u201d After a few weeks, demand was wildly outstripping Crackers\u2019 capacity. Smith decided to take the parties to the empty mills \u2013 relics of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s crushing impact on the former textile town. For Smith, the parties were a vanguard against the prime minister. \u201cShe was saying there\u2019s no such thing as society,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were saying there is, we\u2019ll show you \u2013 here\u2019s 10,000 people. It was political, it was taking them on: people could come together and share collective hopes and aspirations.\u201d</p> <p>If the Blackburn parties at the end of the 80s are mentioned at all in the annals of rave history, it is as an afterthought to what was going on 30 miles away in Madchester. In reality, Blackburn was one of Europe\u2019s largest, earliest and most innovative scenes. Starting just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/28/how-we-made-shoom-acid-house-club-danny-rampling-pete-heller\">Danny Rampling</a>\u2019s London club <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/shoom-an-oral-history-of-the-london-club-that-kicked-off-rave-culture-195865/\">Shoom</a> was launched in late 1987 \u2013 widely viewed as the birth of acid house in Britain \u2013 the Blackburn parties would grow to a near weekly event for between 7,000 and 10,000 people. Yet the memory of these nights is largely the preserve of niche Facebook groups and unexpectedly sad YouTube comments: \u201cBest days ever never to be repeated,\u201d says one, followed by a dozen pill emojis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"529c42ae55575cd574e3bc45faca6e9dba742267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/529c42ae55575cd574e3bc45faca6e9dba742267/0_115_841_505/500.jpg\" alt=\"The crowd at one of Blackburn\u2019s acid house parties\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As many as 10,000 people would attend Blackburn\u2019s acid house parties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flashback</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only now, 30 years on, is its story being told. Part-funded by Arts Council England and created in response to the <a href=\"https://britishtextilebiennial.co.uk/\">2019 British Textile Biennal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.acidhouseflashback.co.uk/\">Acid House Flashback is an online archive</a> established to collect oral testimonies, images and ephemera from the Blackburn parties. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t art-school criminality,\u201d says Jamie Holman, who co-runs the archive with Alex Zawadzki, artists from Blackburn and Morecambe respectively. \u201cThis is really very raw, so it\u2019s been a real challenge. Is Blackburn finally going to make it into the canon?\u201d</p> <p>In 1987, the loose Hardcore Uproar collective, an unorthodox coalition encompassing hardened football hooligans and crusty free-spirits, formed to organise the scene, holding weekly Monday meetings to share out tasks. The parties were whatever punters wanted them to be. For some, that meant hearing the exhilarating new sounds from Chicago. For others, breaking into buildings seemed like the primary buzz. For Joe Fossard, a sound engineer, it was both. \u201cI classed myself as an audio terrorist,\u201d he says. \u201cBreaking into somewhere, doing the sound \u2013 it was a real challenge, a massive responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>Hardcore Uproar posted very vague flyers around town advertising parties at the Sett End pub on Saturday nights. Ravers would pack into the pub \u2013 known locally as the Sweat End, owing to the perspiration that dripped from the ceiling \u2013 and, at 2am, form convoys to the secret warehouse locations. There were no bouncers, just the odd football casual in a ski mask. Inside the mills, empty production line floors were repurposed for dancing. Older factories were notoriously rickety. To cover the holes in the roof, remembers Wendy Newsome, who danced at almost all the parties, \u201cthey\u2019d stick big sheets up covered with luminous paint\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c9a79f0787aca145c701cda60952c15916642c8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a79f0787aca145c701cda60952c15916642c8b/24_66_661_865/382.jpg\" alt=\"A typically cryptic flyer for one of the parties\" width=\"382\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A typically cryptic flyer for one of the parties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flashback</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Blackburn crowd loved the squelchy new acid sounds and the optimism and exaltation of booming vocal house. Local DJs such as Gilmartin or DJ Shack were preferred, although there were guests: <a href=\"https://www.djsasha.com/\">Sasha </a>first attended as a punter, and later played live. The Lancashire Evening Telegraph soon became aware of the parties, warning of \u201chalf-naked girls\u201d, drugs and loud music. This was not the deterrent the paper\u2019s editors had imagined: it functioned as an advert for what would become a broad crowd. \u201cI was expecting these trendy dudes, but it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d Fossard says. \u201cIt was really rootsy, down to earth.\u201d</p> <p>Blackburn\u2019s mills had been closing throughout the 70s, but the economic shocks of the early 80s made that decline almost total: Lancashire\u2019s unemployment rate was more than double the national average. For Hardcore Uproar, keeping entry cheap was a political issue. Many of the early parties cost just \u00a31 to enter; prices rarely crept above \u00a33. \u201cThere was a catchphrase at the time: \u2018Can you feel it?\u2019\u201d says Smith, alluding to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP3h8An4qXI\">Royal House acid war cry</a>. \u201cFor us, it was: \u2018Can you afford it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Blackburn also offered an alternative to clubbers deterred by the increasing gang presence around the Ha\u00e7ienda. \u201cPeople were looking for options that didn\u2019t quite have the problems of Manchester,\u201d says Sasha. That the Ha\u00e7ienda finished at 2am also contributed to Blackburn\u2019s appeal. \u201cThe Hacienda was pyjamas, man,\u201d says Smith, laughing. \u201cBesides, nightclubs were the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>If police turned up to shut down a party, Hardcore Uproar would often open the doors and let everyone in for free, letting chaos ensue. Foxing the police was baked into their agenda \u2013 later parties were even titled \u201cRevenge\u201d. Multiple decoy vans would set off from the pubs in different directions. Soundsystems were built to be dismantled quickly, with electricity sourced from nearby lampposts. Police tactics to neutralise the acid parties \u2013 titled Operation Alkaline \u2013 were not working, despite Blackburn MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jackstraw\">Jack Straw </a>insisting that the town \u201cis not short of places for young people to go and enjoy themselves\u201d. Fossard remembers his Labour-supporting father leaving a meal with Straw to help deliver a soundsystem to a warehouse party. \u201cHe left my mum chatting, then just went back and carried on dinner.\u201d</p> <p>The collective\u2019s ultimate triumph came in November 1989, with a party at a large warehouse that formed part of the Conservative government\u2019s enterprise zone scheme \u2013 designed to provide a space for budding entrepreneurs and industry in low-employment areas. Smith recalls sitting in the building\u2019s upstairs office, watching the winter sun rise over the town. \u201cI had this cosmic moment where I thought: \u2018Of course! They\u2019ve done it! Thatcher\u2019s government had gifted us the most beautiful party location.\u2019\u201d Smith even appeared on television, declaring to Tory MP Ken Hind that he was not on drugs or alcohol, simply \u201chigh on hope\u201d. The phrase would be quoted by loved-up dancers throughout 1989, encapsulating the moment\u2019s giddy, defiant spirit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfe6a30b82ce4563883ebb13248cec6d16a0c02c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfe6a30b82ce4563883ebb13248cec6d16a0c02c/0_52_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sett End Inn, Blackburn\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sett End Inn was known as the Sweat End, due to the perspiration from all the party goers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flashback</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fanzine publishing flourished (<a href=\"https://michaellinnell.org.uk/michael_linnell_archive/peanut_pete/e_by_gum.html\">E\u2019 By Gum: Ecstasy in the North</a> being one title) to meet the demand for safe drug guidance, rights advice and wide-eyed proselytising about the DayGlo future to come. \u201cThe 90s belong here in Blackburn,\u201d reads one fanzine missive from the end of 1989, \u201cand it is up to each and every one of us to make it happen.\u201d</p> <p>But within a few months, the parties were over, scuppered by threats from organised crime and the law. Salford gangs took control of the parties. Smith was kidnapped. \u201cThey took us to the basement in the Ha\u00e7ienda; it was the first time I\u2019d seen a gun,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said: \u2018You work for us now.\u2019 They came along and ruined the whole thing. Selling dodgy drugs, smashing buildings up. It was foul.\u201d Piers Sanderson made a <a href=\"http://www.highonhope.com/\">still-unreleased film</a> about the parties. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t believe that this beautiful, life-changing experience now had this threat of violence,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/06/its-a-tough-island-to-live-on-why-coronavirus-spells-doom-for-ibiza\">'It's a tough island to live on': why coronavirus spells doom for Ibiza</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Sett End was closed in 1990 as a mood of anxiety descended regarding police infiltration and surveillance. A party in nearby Nelson, in spring that year, proved climactic. As <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DjWpq8Oyoc\">Candy Flip\u2019s cover of Strawberry Fields Forever</a> reverberated around the mill, a bolt of white light emerged \u2013 the shutters had been raised, revealing rows of police with riot shields. \u201cFear went through the crowd,\u201d says Sanderson. \u201cEverybody tried to run. How somebody didn\u2019t get killed, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Sasha was up in the booth, watching the police stream in. \u201cThere was a couple of guys in wheelchairs who\u2019d always be at the parties,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember seeing them knocked out and sprawled across the floor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae4f955bc5b5a5d4434a7641d86b200ab338b229\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae4f955bc5b5a5d4434a7641d86b200ab338b229/0_14_1680_1008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The December 1989 rave at Chadwick Street, Blackburn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Entrance fees were kept to \u00a31, but there were always other ways of getting in</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newsome and her friends tried to hide in the loos. \u201cWe were hanging on from the cistern with German shepherds barking at our legs,\u201d she says. Smith saw police horses \u201clined up on the hill like some sort of John Wayne movie\u201d. Luckily, nobody died in the stampede, but Hardcore Uproar knew they couldn\u2019t guarantee the crowd\u2019s safety should the police repeat the Nelson tactics. There would be no more Blackburn parties. \u201cI expect this to be a clear signal to the organisers of these events,\u201d police told the Lancashire Evening Telegraph, \u201cand we shall now be looking to the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Smith was arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs and held on remand for a year until being found not guilty. \u201cYou\u2019re lying in prison in a cell with two other people, everything taken away from you,\u201d he says. He emigrated to India shortly after release.</p> <p>Dance music became professionalised, but few in Blackburn \u2013 now without a club scene \u2013 went on that journey. Its story was forgotten. Manchester had charismatic advocates with media platforms able to turn rave into urban regeneration. Blackburn\u2019s young people were just trying to hold down day jobs or keep the DSS off their back. Today, there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://djmag.com/longreads/how-much-uk-dance-music-history-real\">contemporary debate about who gets to tell dance music history</a>. For Holman and Zawadzki, Flashback is the first step towards recognising the parties for what they were \u2013 working-class people staging a cultural intervention, and a political retaliation to a Conservative government that had written Blackburn out of the future. \u201cWe wanted to put it in its historical context,\u201d says Holman, \u201cbut also, the context of what\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Larry Kramer, who has died aged 84 of pneumonia, enraged many gay readers with his lurid 1978 novel Faggots, a cautionary bestseller warning against the perils of promiscuity, before addressing the Aids crisis in his 1985 play The Normal Heart, in which an activist-writer warns against the perils of promiscuity. Publishers Weekly said he \u201cmade red-faced fist-pumping into his art\u201d.</p> <p>He also put his mouth where his money was. As co-founder of two Aids advocacy groups, Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis and ACT UP (Aids Coalition to Unleash Power), he improved the lives of people suffering from HIV and Aids, and pilloried mercilessly and tirelessly those politicians and medical professionals who refused to take the epidemic seriously. Each of these figures he excoriated in lengthy screeds, or on the streets in a voice described by the LA Times as a \u201cnasal bullhorn\u201d.</p> <p>His attacks could be parochial (he threw a drink over the closeted Republican politician <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/05/11/the-cautious-closet-of-the-gay-conservative/6d482f56-44ad-4540-b406-f923f096ce24/\">Terry Dolan</a> at a Washington fundraiser) or expansive: he was one of those credited with the idea of encasing the home of the Republican senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/04/usa\">Jesse Helms</a> in an enormous yellow condom. He led protests that succeeded in disrupting, among other things, the New York Stock Exchange and St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral during Mass; many of these resulted in his arrest.</p> <p>Also in his crosshairs was Dr Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, who was leading the US government\u2019s ineffectual response to Aids. In 1988, the San Francisco Examiner published an open letter by Kramer&nbsp;in which he wrote: \u201cAnthony Fauci, you are a murderer. Your refusal to hear the screams of Aids activists early in the crisis resulted in the deaths of thousands of Queers.\u201d Fauci acknowledged that Kramer forced him to reassess his entire approach to the disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30c3502b36887368056a82837ffcf6413927fdc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30c3502b36887368056a82837ffcf6413927fdc4/0_58_2768_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Normal Heart, with Martin Sheen and Paul Jesson, at the Royal Court theatre, London, in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Normal Heart, with Martin Sheen and Paul Jesson, at the Royal Court theatre, London, in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pair grew to be friends, with Fauci inspiring a character in Kramer\u2019s 1992 play The Destiny of Me and even becoming his doctor when the writer\u2019s health \u2013 he had been diagnosed with HIV once tests became available in 1985 \u2013 was at a particularly perilous stage. \u201cThere is no question in my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country,\u201d Fauci told the New Yorker in 2002.</p> <p>Larry was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to George Kramer, whose job as a government attorney necessitated the family\u2019s move to the Washington area when Larry was six, and Rea (nee Wishengrad), a social worker for the Red Cross. He was educated at Woodrow Wilson high school in Washington and studied English at Yale University. He tried to take his own life during his first year there. Following his recovery, he came out as gay to his brother, who sent him to a psychiatrist.</p> <p>After graduation and military service, Kramer worked for the William Morris agency and then at Columbia Pictures, where he began as a production assistant before working his way up to be an executive on films including Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Dr Strangelove (1964). He also persuaded the studio to acquire and release Darling (1965), starring Julie Christie; its director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/26/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">John Schlesinger</a>, was briefly a partner of his.</p> <p>Kramer produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/28/ken-russell\">Ken Russell</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/apr/08/ken-russell-women-in-love-1970\">Women in Love</a> (1969), having rewritten the adaptation of DH Lawrence\u2019s novel when the one he had commissioned from the playwright David Mercer proved unusable. He was Oscar-nominated for that but savaged for his next film, the maligned musical Lost Horizon (1973), which he called \u201cthe one thing I have done in my life that I truly regret\u201d.</p> <p>He first sounded the alarm about Aids in the pages of a gay periodical, the New York Native, in 1981, though it was a piece two years later in the same newspaper that provided the angriest clarion call. The 5,000-word feature, <a href=\"https://www.losangelesblade.com/2020/05/27/march-27-1983-1112-and-counting/\">1,112 and Counting</a>, began: \u201cIf this article doesn\u2019t scare the shit out of you, we\u2019re in real trouble.\u201d It catalogued methodically the failings of institutions including the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">Cent</a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">ers for Disease Control</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/\">National Institutes for Health</a>, while upbraiding the \u201cuseless\u201d gay press and complacency in the community at large. \u201cUnless we fight for our lives, we shall die,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>If Faggots had made him a pariah in some eyes \u2013 in the wake of the book\u2019s publication, Kramer was banned from at least one store on Fire Island, New York, the popular gay haunt where he kept a holiday home \u2013 then The Normal Heart was received as an urgent response to a steeply escalating emergency.</p> <p>The play took aim at an assortment of Kramer\u2019s enemies including New York\u2019s mayor Ed Koch, the New York Times (which he accused of suppressing early reports about Aids \u2013 a charge the paper rejected in print) and his former colleagues at the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis, which he had left a year after its inception in a disagreement over confrontational tactics.</p> <p>The New York Times critic Frank Rich complained of the play\u2019s \u201cpamphleteering\u201d tone, but no one could say that Kramer didn\u2019t take that to its logical conclusion: he could sometimes be found outside the theatre distributing literature to audience members, keen that their emotional responses to his work should be put to practical and political use rather than evaporating as soon as the tears on their cheeks had dried. In 2014, the play was adapted as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/apr/27/profile-mark-ruffalo-the-normal-heart-aids-play\">television film</a> starring Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts.</p> <p>As a writer, Kramer was vulnerable to hectoring and grandiosity, nowhere more so than in his mammoth 2015 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/11/were-lincoln-nixon-gay-history-book-divides-america\">The American People Vol 1: Search for My Heart</a>, which filtered history through a radical queer perspective that reimagined Franklin, Lincoln and Reagan as gay. For all the advances Kramer made in public health and civil rights, it bothered him to see his artistic reputation eclipsed by his activism.&nbsp;\u201cI like to think I work very hard on my writing,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/21/larry-kramer-i-decided-i-was-going-to-write-a-history-of-my-american-people\">told </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/21/larry-kramer-i-decided-i-was-going-to-write-a-history-of-my-american-people\">the Guardian</a> in 2015. \u201cAnd unfortunately in this country you can\u2019t be taken seriously as an artist if you\u2019re also an activist.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He lamented his \u201cloudmouth\u201d persona, though&nbsp;he had only himself to blame: in a <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/features/62887/\">2009 interview with New York magazine</a> he professed not to understand why \u201cevery gay person doesn\u2019t agree with everything I say\u201d. In 2002, he said: \u201cI put the truth in writing. That\u2019s what I do: I have told the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>He is survived by his husband, David Webster, whom he married in 2013.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u2022 Laurence David Kramer, writer and activist, born 25 June 1935; died 27 May 2020</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>South Korea tightens restrictions again after spike in cases</h2> <p>South Korea has tightened restrictions in the metropolitan area of Seoul after a spike in infections.&nbsp;Restrictions had been lifted across the country on 6 May after the outbreak appeared to be brought under control. However, officials have recorded the biggest spike in infections in nearly two months, prompting the closure of museums, parks and art galleries in the Seoul area for two weeks from Friday. Half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live in the metropolitan area where restrictions are being tightened.</p> <h2>US deaths pass 100,000</h2> <p>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.</p> <h2><strong>Trump silent on US death toll</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump remained silent on the death of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 as the US mourned the milestone. The president made no comment on Twitter about the momentous day, but used the platform to attack tech companies for trying to censor him, a day after Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/trump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">put a fact-check warning on one of his claims.</a></p> <h2>Total case numbers exceed 5.7m worldwide</h2> <p>The number of people infected by the coronavirus has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">the John Hopkins University</a>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>US</strong>&nbsp;is home to to 29.8% of the 5,707,163 people with the disease around the world, the data shows, way ahead&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Brazil</strong>&nbsp;(7.2%),&nbsp;<strong>Russia</strong>&nbsp;(6.6%), the&nbsp;<strong>UK</strong>&nbsp;(4.7%),&nbsp;<strong>Spain</strong>&nbsp;(4.1%) and&nbsp;<strong>Italy</strong>&nbsp;(4%).&nbsp;The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases.</p> <h2><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America</strong></h2> <p>The UN World Food Program is warning that at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. New projections released late on Wednesday estimate a startling four-fold increase in severe food insecurity.</p> <h2>European investment slashed</h2> <p>Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found. Some 65% of the 6,412 projects in question are already in place or continuing \u201calbeit with downgraded capacity and recruitment\u201d, EY said. A further 25% were delayed and 10 percent cancelled, its Europe Attractiveness survey found.</p> <h2>Ireland faces record recession, says think tank</h2> <p>Ireland is facing its deepest ever recession as the coronavirus lockdown devastates jobs and strains the public finances, a think tank said Thursday. A report by Ireland\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute predicts the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will decline 12.4% this year. That was the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario under a government plan to lift the lockdown in August but with the economy struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels owing to physical distancing measures, ESRI said.</p> <h2>Tory anger at Dominic Cummings builds</h2> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Sixty-one Conservative MPs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\">defied British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Dominic Cummings crisis</a>&nbsp;as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown. Former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with more than 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him. Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips.</p> <h2>Hydroxychloroquine study raises concerns</h2> <p>Questions have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/28/questions-raised-over-hydroxychloroquine-study-which-caused-who-to-halt-trials-for-covid-19\">raised about a study published in the Lancet</a>&nbsp;that prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine.

  "<p>More than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the last 10 weeks \u2013 a number of jobless the US has not seen since the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/us-job-losses-unemployment-coronavirus\">US job losses hit 40m as coronavirus crisis sees claims rise 2.1m in a week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The economic impacts of Covid-19 have been far and wide, hurting virtually every industry and leaving tens of millions of people without paychecks to pay the bills.</p> <p>Here are the key numbers that tell the story of the masses of unemployed workers, and the devastating economic impact the crisis has had.&nbsp;</p> <h2>1. The national unemployment rate: 14.7%</h2> <p>The Department of Labor releases the latest national unemployment rate at the beginning of each month. In the figures for April, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">released</a> earlier in May, the rate was 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While many states have begun gradual reopening processes, the figure only represents those whose claims were filed up until mid-April. Millions more have filed claims since then, though we will not know how that has affected the unemployment rate until May\u2019s figures are released in early June.</p> <h2>2. The black and Hispanic unemployment rates: 16.7% and 18.9% </h2> <p>Economists have long known that black and Hispanic Americans are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">most vulnerable</a> during economic recessions, and while many workers of color are in essential jobs, the Covid-19 economic crisis has proved <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm\">no different</a>. Even at its lowest, the black unemployment rate is typically double that of white unemployment, with Hispanic unemployment not too far behind. Experts say job segregation pushes black and Hispanic workers into low-paying industries, like hospitality, that come with little to no benefits and have been hit hardest.</p> <h2>3. Percentage of unemployed Americans who are women: 55%</h2> <p>Though women make up a smaller percentage of the working population, a slight majority of people who were laid off in the last few months are women. At the beginning of May, the Department of Labor <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm\">reported</a> nearly 11.5 million women had lost jobs, compared with about 11 million men. This is no coincidence given that the industries that have been hardest-hit by shutdown orders, hospitality and leisure, education and healthcare, employ more women than others.</p> <h2>4. The leisure and hospitality unemployment rate: 39.8%</h2> <p>Last month\u2019s Department of Labor figures confirmed that the leisure and hospitality industry has been the<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm\"> hardest-hit </a>by the economic downturn. About 4.8 million workers, the highest of any industry have lost their jobs in the industry.</p> <h2>5. State with the highest unemployment rate: Nevada</h2> <p>Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate is the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">highest</a> of any state at 28.2%, meaning one in four people in the state of 3 million was unemployed in April. Nevada\u2019s economy relies heavily on tourism, which brought in <a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-tourism-industry-delivers-state-67-6b-economic-impact/\">$67.6</a><a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-tourism-industry-delivers-state-67-6b-economic-impact/\">bn</a> in 2018. Michigan and Hawaii had the second and third highest rates with 22.7% and 22.3% unemployment, respectively.</p> <h2>6. Average unemployment insurance benefit amount: about $980</h2> <p>Pre-pandemic, the average unemployment insurance <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/how-much-unemployment-will-i-get-that-depends-on-your-state.html\">check</a> was about $380. But because each state is in charge of its own unemployment system, and sets the amount that is given in unemployment insurance, it varies widely. Some states give about a fifth of a person\u2019s paycheck while others give half or more. To compensate for the widespread differences, those who successfully file for unemployment are given an extra $600 a week through the end of July with money Congress set aside in its massive coronavirus stimulus package in March. While this means some are still barely making ends meet, others are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/25/unemployment-benefits-600-renewal-republicans\">getting more</a> than they were getting in the jobs they were laid off from.</p> <h2>7. Highest number of unemployment claims in one week: 6.6m</h2> <p>Between 29 March and 4 April, 6.6 million Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/us-unemployment-filings-coronavirus\">filed</a> for unemployment, a staggering number that signaled the true depths of the economic crisis.</p> <h2>8. Number of households deemed food insecure: 1 in 5</h2> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/05/06/the-covid-19-crisis-has-already-left-too-many-children-hungry-in-america/\">analysis</a> by the Brookings Institution found one in five households in the US were deemed food insecure by the end of April. Food banks have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/us-food-banks-over-budget-demand-coronavirus\">shortages</a> in light of increased demand as millions of families struggle to pay for groceries. The analysis found the situation is worse for families with children: two in five households with mothers and children under the age of 12 are food insecure.</p> <h2>9. Number of gig workers unemployed: more than 6.1m</h2> <p>In its latest stimulus package, Congress included a federal <a href=\"https://edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm\">program</a> that allows self-employed workers and contractors to receive unemployment benefits. In its <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\">unemployment report</a> last week, the Department of Labor said that 6.1 million Americans who classify as self-employed were receiving unemployment insurance. </p> <h2>10. Percentage of low-wage workers unemployed: 40%</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200513a.htm\">remarks</a> given on 13 May, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, delivered a shocking statistic from a Fed survey: 40% of households making under $40,000 a year lost a job in March. \u201cThis reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words,\u201d Powell said.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s apparent plans to punish Twitter for appending a factcheck to his claims that mail-in ballots would be \u201csubstantially fraudulent\u201d could reshape the web&nbsp;\u2013 but not necessarily in the ways he or his supporters intend.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/trump-draft-order-could-expose-twitter-and-facebook-to-more-lawsuits\">Trump\u2019s expected avenue of attack</a>&nbsp;focuses on section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That law underpins much of how the internet is regulated in the United States, by effectively creating the hybrid publisher/platform model that has become the norm for social media companies worldwide.</p> <p>Before the CDA, passed in 1996, American communications firms had two options under the law: they could either act as \u201cmere conduits\u201d, passing on all content without alteration \u2013&nbsp;akin to a phone service&nbsp;\u2013 or they could intervene, moderating their platforms but taking legal liability for anything they let pass.</p> <p>Section 230 changed that, by creating a legal exception that allows platforms to moderate their sites as they see fit, without taking on the risk of being sued for the content they leave up. It holds that: \u201cNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d The clause has been described by the lawyer Jeff Kosseff as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414\">The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The law has been widely misunderstood in the years since it passed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/social-media-companies-dont-have-to-be-politically-neutral-if-they-want-to-moderate-content/\">noted</a><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/social-media-companies-dont-have-to-be-politically-neutral-if-they-want-to-moderate-content/\"> the neoconservative think</a><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/social-media-companies-dont-have-to-be-politically-neutral-if-they-want-to-moderate-content/\">tank AEI</a>, with one \u201cunfortunately persistent misunderstanding\u201d being that it requires platforms to exercise political neutrality. As a result, it has come under increasing attack, particularly from the US right, which believes it is the victim of undue censorship from major web platforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to a draft executive order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/trump-draft-order-could-expose-twitter-and-facebook-to-more-lawsuits\">seen by Reuters</a>, Trump plans to hit back at Twitter by weakening section 230. The order would require the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cclarify\u201d the law in a number of ways, proposing that \u201cediting content\u201d could lead to a platform forfeiting its protections under section 230, as well as looking at whether it uses \u201cdeceptive policies\u201d to moderate, or if those policies are \u201cinconsistent with its terms of service\u201d.</p> <p>If the FCC followed suit and implemented the suggestions into regulation, the primary goal appears to be to force the companies to dial back their actions, for fear of losing the protection. A ban on \u201cediting\u201d content, for instance, would seem to be targeted at warnings like those Twitter appended to Trump\u2019s mail-in ballots tweets, while the ban on \u201cdeceptive policies\u201d has been interpreted as an attempt to formally introduce a requirement for political neutrality into the section 230 constraints.</p> <p>But the regulation could backfire, at least in terms of creating the internet Trump desires. By barring social media companies from using the nuanced forms of moderation they currently employ, the executive order could force them to resort to heavy-handed actions: deleting posts, or blocking users, rather than simply factchecking or reducing the reach of the worst material.</p> <p>Similarly, removing section 230 protections entirely from a technology firm would be unlikely to force it to act as a politically neutral \u201cmere conduit\u201d, since any moderation at all \u2013 even simply deleting the vast quantities of automated spam that hit platforms such as Facebook and Twitter each day \u2013 would then open them up to lawsuits about the content they had left up.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/economics/jeff-kosseff-on-the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-a-long-read-qa/#more-1022469\">As Kosseff said in 2019</a>: \u201cAre they saying you don\u2019t do any moderation at all? A free for all? I seriously would not want to be on the internet at all if that was the case.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is a moment in all British political scandals when a prickly sensation creeps up the spine: \u201cHe\u2019s going to get away with it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d It isn\u2019t provoked by Dominic Cummings alone. I felt the same watching Michael Gove\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/michael-gove-driving-eyesight-cummings-baranard/\">exchange with Nick Ferrari on LBC</a>: Gove first starting to claim that he too took the occasional miles-long drive to test his vision before rowing back, perhaps dazzled by the scale of the lie. Smirks were exchanged. The same when Matt Hancock stared down the camera <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52508836\">on 30 April</a><strong> </strong>and celebrated \u201cachieving\u201d his testing target; the reflux came two days ago, when revised testing figures revealed the target had, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-in-the-uk-how-many-people-are-really-being-tested-0ln33dp7n\">never been hit</a>. </p> <p>It is not a sensation produced merely by lies, or the stench of hypocrisy in high places. It is the smirk, the assured belief that consequences are for little people, and that, in any case, anyone who really matters is in on the act. These people are open about it: to accept it is a mark of urbanity, to be disgusted by it is gauche.</p> <p>We have become used to being badly governed, and inured to lying. The prime minister\u2019s laziness and mendacity are proverbial, but it is the mediocrity at the pinnacle of power that is more startling: the self-impressed dilettante and crank who whispers in his ear, or the toy-town thug - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/23/the-tarantula-stays-tory-chief-whip-wont-remove-pet-spider-from-office-gavin-williamson\">complete with pet tarantula</a> - now in charge of the nation\u2019s schools, or the conspiracy theorist \u201cat war with cultural Marxism\u201d now its most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/18/boris-johnson-panto-authoritarians-cruelty\">senior law officer,</a> merrily dismissing the universality of law. The problem extends beyond politicians\u2019 individual deficiencies, severe though they are, and one might point to multiple sources of institutional rot to explain it, from the sycophancy of party bureaucracy to the evaporation of the civic bodies on which the great parties once drew. But there is also another, simpler explanation: politicians are increasingly insulated from the consequences of lying.</p> <p>The UK institutionalises its corruption, with peerages regularly doled out to party patrons. Even British politicians realise that allowing donors to purchase a permanent seat in the legislature looks bad so, formally at least, it is illegal.&nbsp;Despite this, donors still acquire peerages&nbsp;with appalling regularity; as this is a useful source of patronage, all the major parties simply look the other way.&nbsp;But this is emblematic of a wider institutional rot. Now Tory fundraisers, eyeing a Covid-19 collapse in cash, brief journalists that the party\u2019s billionaire donors are cooling on Johnson for his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04733123-834f-4922-a6e2-47e9b3686ebb\">failure to deliver them the peerages they expected</a>.<strong> </strong>Such open entitlement ought to be a scandal itself, signalling a willingness to further dilute the UK\u2019s already weak institutional safeguards; instead it is greeted with jejune sophistication by commentators, proud to know that this is simply how the game works.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcfe0a1abe729bd011df7d79fddc57dfbaf6ebb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcfe0a1abe729bd011df7d79fddc57dfbaf6ebb5/0_61_1960_1177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Williamson: \u2018It is the mediocrity at the pinnacle of power that is more startling: the toytown thug - complete with tarantula - now in charge of the nation\u2019s schools...\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Williamson: \u2018It is the mediocrity at the pinnacle of power that is more startling: the toytown thug - complete with tarantula - now in charge of the nation\u2019s schools...\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why are we so badly governed, to the point that we scarcely notice it? Stories of national decline are a cottage industry in Britain, and laments for a decaying polity are common in times of upheaval.&nbsp;\u201cWhere is now the soul of god-like Cato that durst be good\u201d asked one stage character in the fag-end days of Elizabethan England, \u201cwhen Caesar durst be evil?\u201d That play itself \u2013 Ben Jonson\u2019s&nbsp;1603 <em>Sejanus</em>&nbsp;\u2013 drew on Tacitus\u2019s ancient laments about the corruption of imperial Rome, and landed its author a trial for treason. It is instructive not only because it reminds us that this anxiety is historically common, but because the villain\u2019s fall sees him replaced only with another&nbsp;villain, equally violent and cruel.</p> <p>Like many conservative \u201cdeclinists\u201d since,&nbsp;Jonson\u2019s Romans laid the blame for the weakening and corruption of the state on the decay of virtue among the citizenry.&nbsp;Modern culprits for decline might range as widely as the doctrine of equality or political correctness, or moral laxity, or the degradation of our capacity to think as independent citizens. Liberal variations impute more fault to institutions, concentrating on the corrupting influence of cash, our archaic forms of government, or erosion of sacrosanct political norms.</p> <p>Both versions offer degrees of truth mixed with dubious assertion: there is no evidence that equality drives decline \u2013 quite the opposite \u2013 and change in norms is surely the proper business of politics. Perhaps what is distinctive about the liars and mediocrities of our age is the sheer openness of political cynicism. The cynic\u2019s <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QNhSDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22adorno%22+and+%22knowing+wink%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ILcn8eashZ&amp;sig=ACfU3U1AwoLlv0TR3LVcXw_aZIIzKudT7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiem4DXnNTpAhVfQhUIHW6OCqMQ6AEwA3oECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22adorno%22%20and%20%22knowing%20wink%22&amp;f=false\">\u201cknowing wink\u201d</a> is now the basis of conservative politics in Britain: a sign that not only do they not believe what they\u2019re saying, no other politician does either. We\u2019re all liars here.</p> <p>Such permeating cynicism arises above all from depoliticisation: the claim, advanced over the past few decades, that ideological difference is dead, markets ought to be insulated from political contestation, and politics is merely a set of technical quibbles between administrators. Depoliticisation has produced a more professionalised politics with narrower routes of entry, and constrained what is agreed to be politically possible: thus the sad post-Thatcherite trawl of crumbling PFI schools, underfunded hospitals and outsourced public services. If the possibility of significant political change is denied, popular revulsion becomes increasingly anti-political, rejecting the legitimacy of democratic deliberation.</p> <p>That is why the Cummings scandal matters. His recurrent motif is that liberal democracy is a con: that deliberation and debate are simply excuses by elites to stifle the popular will; all you should expect from politics is the occasional authorising vote for a champion you hope will wreck the joint in the way you prefer. The law, in turn, is for little people who can\u2019t find a way round it, and protests about its universality are another elite sham.</p> <p>It might be that Cummings has overestimated public indifference, and the wave of popular anger washes him from office. But perhaps perversely, prime ministerial backing strengthens, rather than weakens, the cynicism on which he feeds. Had it not involved him, Cummings would have used this episode as a teaching moment.</p> <p>Democracies are more resilient than some expect. But they are still fragile achievements. If the link between actions and consequences in politics is severed, why should the young or disenfranchised keep faith with democracy at all? The pandemic has reminded us that we are not isolated individuals, and our choices impact profoundly on others.</p> <p>Perhaps it also implies other unfashionable truths: politics matters. Laws should not have get-out clauses for the rich. State power is immense, rather than weak, and no one is entitled to it by rank or wealth. There are deceptions that should see you drummed out of public life altogether.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>If the tawdry spectacle of ministers bending the law and distorting the truth to defend an unelected aide teaches us anything, it\u2019s this: consequences matter.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;James Butler is co-founder of Novara Media and a regular contributor to the London Review of Books</p>",

How we\u2019ve missed you. In the dark initial days of Covid-19, many feared Australia\u2019s winter codes would be done for 2020. But some old-fashioned bullocking from the NRL saw it return to action first, and tonight\u2019s game between Brisbane and Parramatta was the first step towards completing an unlikely premiership season. </p> <p>And what an advert for the sport it was. The Eels were irrepressible, bossing the Broncos from the first minute to the last in a fine advertisement for their title credentials. They are now unbeaten after three rounds and, revealingly, revelled in the new environs formed by the six-again rule. Parramatta held the ball well, attacked and capitalised when Brisbane made their errors \u2013 and there were plenty of them. </p> <p>On this evidence, the awarding of a fresh set of six tackles for ruck infringements opens the game up and forces it to be played at a greater speed. Inevitably this also leads to a higher incidence of errors, leading to the conclusion there are fewer places to hide for inferior teams. Blowouts could become frequent in this brave new world for rugby league. </p> <p>The move to use just one referee was ridiculed by some but tonight, Gerard Sutton was barely sighted. And that it always a good thing. So while cardboard cutouts and virtual crowd audio was as close as fans got to the live experience, the reboot of the 2020 season should be considered nothing other than resounding success for the NRL. </p> <p>For more of the same, we hope, be sure to return tomorrow night for our liveblog of the Roosters-Rabbitohs clash.

It has been a high-risk gambit. Governments can and will shut the game down the moment there is a health breach. Failure to have the backing of health departments and public officials gives the game zero wiggle room if something goes wrong.

Three young women drive home from a bar, too busy dancing to a middle-aged man\u2019s idea of what music young women like to notice that a car is barrelling towards them with its headlights off. They all die in horrible ways. A leg flies off. A skull is graphically crushed by a wheel. It is thoroughly unpleasant, and a stark warning that you should never give the come-on to psychopathic stuntmen you meet in pubs.</p> <h2>11. Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987)</h2> <p>Admittedly, cars only make up a portion of this film \u2013 but they are arguably the most entertaining parts. First, John Candy drives the wrong way down a freeway, then he accidentally sets the car on fire, and, finally, the vehicle is impounded and the pair must travel the rest of the distance in a refrigerated truck. It\u2019s no trip to Barnard Castle, but it\u2019s still pretty bad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1f9e6a3555395fca0407cadcfd6f2f8300fdde5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f9e6a3555395fca0407cadcfd6f2f8300fdde5/0_15_1742_1045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Martin and John Candy in Planes, Trains and Automobiles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Martin and John Candy go for their own take on the convertible in Planes, Trains and Automobiles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paramount/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. The Italian Job (1969)</h2> <p>In which Michael Caine\u2019s band of ragtag robbers pull off one of the most audacious high-speed getaways in all of cinema history, only to underestimate the turning capabilities of a heavy coach and bugger it up on the Nivolet Pass. The<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZCaSyid4m0\"> finale</a> \u2013 in which the coach teeters on the edge of the mountainside road, loot just out of reach \u2013 is an important lesson. After an ill-advised and illegal car trip that risks provoking the anger of a nation, should you choose survival or greed? It is becoming evidently clear that you cannot have both.</p> <h2>9. Maximum Overdrive (1986)</h2> <p>Stephen King\u2019s only directorial credit \u2013 largely because, <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/07/stephen-king-and-acdcs-maximum-overdrive-turns-30/\">in his own words</a>, \u201cI was coked out of my mind all through its production, and I really didn\u2019t know what I was doing\u201d \u2013 is a horror movie about inanimate objects that come to life, maybe because of aliens or something. We meet a newlywed couple \u2013 one of whom is played by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWKsVATduQA\">Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson</a> \u2013 as they embark on a honeymoon road trip. However, they are soon set upon by a bunch of unmanned lorries that only stop when Pat Hingle, from Splendor in the Grass, blows them up with a rocket launcher. Did I mention that cocaine was a factor in the production of this film?</p> <h2>8. Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013)</h2> <p>Now, the entire Fast &amp; Furious oeuvre is filled with poor automotive decisions \u2013 examples include the time when they were all flipped into the air by a surfacing submarine; the time they raced a military drone through a tunnel; and the time they drove out of the middle of a skyscraper, flew through the air and went into the middle of another skyscraper. But nothing beats the trip on the runway at the end of the sixth instalment. The crew has to chase a speeding plane before it takes off, and there is a fistfight and everything explodes. The scene lasts for 10 minutes; science has determined that the runway was 20 miles long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea7e211a94ff36d4cf77e19b7524cab3d8186aa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea7e211a94ff36d4cf77e19b7524cab3d8186aa4/160_0_1840_1105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in Fast & Furious 6\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Walker and Vin Diesel show wilful disregard for the Highway Code in Fast &amp; Furious 6</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7. The Blues Brothers (1980)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/16/dan-aykroyd-squrrels-taste-better-than-rattlesnake-john-belushi-clambakes\">Dan Aykroyd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/11/tragic-legacy-john-belushi-actor-died-overdose\">John Belushi</a> play two blood brothers who embark on a mission from God to save the orphanage in which they were raised. The police are in hot pursuit, there are Nazis on their trail and a mysterious woman keeps trying to murder them. As Elwood (Aykroyd) memorably says in the film: \u201cThere\u2019s 266 miles to Durham, we\u2019ve got a full tank of gas, a four-year-old in the back, the country\u2019s under lockdown and I can\u2019t bloody see anything.\u201d No, wait, that\u2019s not right.</p> <h2>6. Locke (2013)</h2> <p>All <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/14/tom-hardys-20-best-film-performances-ranked\">Tom Hardy</a> wants to do is drive from Birmingham to London. However, this trip of a lifetime is put in jeopardy by a number of phonecalls from friends and associates. Some wonder why he has abandoned the largest concrete pour ever to be seen in all of Europe. Others wonder why he has abandoned his entire family. It\u2019s a wonderful, self-contained film that remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/14/tom-hardys-20-best-film-performances-ranked\">a career highlight for both Hardy</a> and writer/director Steven Knight, but the reason for the trip is slightly underwhelming. Perhaps if Hardy had just wanted to go and look at some bluebells in a wood with his family, it would have had a bit more dramatic heft.</p> <h2>5. Monolith (2016)</h2> <p>Katrina Bowden from 30 Rock plays a pop star who is given a sentient car as a gift. But during an off-road trip through the middle of nowhere, the car suddenly goes wrong. By \u201cgoes wrong\u201d, I mean that she locks herself out for so long that she is eventually attacked by coyotes. That\u2019s right, this is an entire film about all the things that happen when a woman loses her car keys. An entire film. Imagine.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5503a120486b2d166a77742adc03785457f2ef4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5503a120486b2d166a77742adc03785457f2ef4b/0_0_3232_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Griswolds in National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just a regular family car trip: the Griswolds get ready for the off in National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation (1983)</h2> <p>An almost perfect road trip comedy, National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation manages to fold no end of horrors in to its plot. During a cross-country holiday, the Griswold family crash, get ripped off, are vandalised, murder a dog, drive a human corpse around strapped to their roof and hold an entire amusement park as their armed hostages. And still, after all this, Clark Griswold refused to resign from his job as the prime minister\u2019s special adviser.</p> <h2>3. Vanishing Point (1971)</h2> <p>A cult classic and a favourite of Steven Spielberg, the film sees an enigmatic car delivery driver named Kowalski embark on a Benzedrine-fuelled race to drive a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. The police chase him. He runs another driver off the road, fights off some armed hitchhikers, and then fatally injures himself by driving into a bulldozer at top speed. The reason for any of this is never made clear. Perhaps he wanted to visit his parents\u2019 house before the press found out.</p> <h2>2. Thelma &amp; Louise (1991)</h2> <p>This might be the definitive road trip film, where mishap after mishap is piled up until all is lost. There&nbsp;is an attempted rape. A murder. Theft. Kidnapping. Wilful destruction. And, in the end, suicide. All in all, it\u2019s arguably one of the most catastrophic road trips to ever happen \u2013 until, that is, about six weeks ago. As such, it isn\u2019t very interesting or timely at all and Dominic Cummings definitely shouldn\u2019t watch it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e4dcd56d87a02f0eaa56c4ae2b61b297594b647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e4dcd56d87a02f0eaa56c4ae2b61b297594b647/0_208_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Weaver is terrorised by the truck in Duel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is there something wrong with your eyesight?

Duel (1971)</h2> <p>Steven Spielberg\u2019s feature debut is essentially a prototypical Jaws; a harried driver just wants to peacefully travel from A to B, but his efforts are thwarted by a truck intent on terrorising him. The scariest thing about Duel is that we never know the truck driver\u2019s motives, let alone actually see him. Is this a personal vendetta, planned long in advance? Did he choose this car at random? Could this be the first time he has ever attempted this, or is he a habitual antagonist? Might it be that he just wanted to check his eyesight on a road trip and didn\u2019t even see the car? We may never know.</p>",

  "<p>In one of the rare expressions of empathy that Donald Trump has displayed during the course of the coronavirus pandemic, he talked earlier this month about the disease claiming so many lives it was \u201cfilling up Yankee Stadium with death\u201d.</p> <p>Now the death toll from Covid-19 stands at almost twice the capacity of the Yankees\u2019 home stadium, and has reached another booming landmark: 100,000 deaths.</p> <p>A country that prides itself on its exceptionalism can now without ambiguity claim that title for its experience of the virus.

The ravages of Covid-19 have revealed the deep cracks in the glittering facade of the richest and most powerful nation on Earth.</p> <h2><strong>Racial disparities</strong></h2> <p>Covid-19 is supposed to be an equal-opportunities killer. It willingly ravages the lungs of any American, regardless of their skin color or visa status.</p> <p>But as America passes the 100,000 death mark, it has become abundantly clear that the pandemic amounts to a racial disaster of stunning proportions. Figures compiled by <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">APM Research Lab</a> from 40 states show that African Americans are being killed at almost three times the rate of white people.</p> <p>Black Kansans are <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">seven times</a> more likely to die from the virus than white Kansans.

So too is the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/us/coronavirus-african-americans-bias.html\">discrimination in access</a> to testing and treatment for coronavirus that has increased the chances that black people contract and then die from the disease.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America has become a failed social experiment, a decayed empire that is unable to meet the basic needs of its people</p> <footer> <cite>Cornel West</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cornel West, the Harvard philosopher, activist and writer, argues that you have to dig deeper to find the source of such disproportionate fatalities. \u201cThe virus encounters deeply racist structures and institutions already in place, against the backdrop of wealth inequality, a militarized state and a commodified culture in which everybody and everything is for sale,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For West, the pandemic has revealed nothing less than the country\u2019s demise. \u201cAmerica has become a failed social experiment, a decayed empire that is unable to meet the basic needs of its people.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Partisan wounds</strong></h2> <p>When the US has endured past attacks by stealthy enemies \u2013 Pearl Harbor, say, or 9/11 \u2013 there has been some effort from the White House down to rally the nation around a common defense.

Over the last six weeks there has been an explosion of conspiracy theories on social media, epitomized by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-viral-video-plandemic-judy-mikovits-conspiracy-theories\">Plandemic</a> documentary, which claimed a cabal led by Bill Gates were exploiting the virus to seize power.</p> <p>Wardle has been surprised how quickly conspiracy theories have erupted into the mainstream. \u201cYou have high school friends and mums and aunts who would never normally share this material now on it.\u201d</p> <p>Wardle sees the vast proliferation of misinformation as a result of deep uncertainty about the pandemic, combined with a paucity of quality information following the collapse of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-newspapers-impact\">US news industry</a>, which has itself been accelerated by the virus\u2019 economic impact.</p> <p>Bad information cost lives. It can encourage states to reopen their economies precipitously and lure individuals to drop their guard and expose themselves to the virus.</p> <p>Wardle said: \u201cHistorians are going to look back on all of this and have a much clearer idea of how misinformation led to real-world harm \u2013 and death.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Details have emerged of more than 30 migrants&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;robbed, beaten and spray-painted with red crosses on their heads by Croatian police officers who said the treatment was the \u201ccure against coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian has interviewed asylum seekers, obtained photographs and collected dozens of testimonies, including from minors, revealing how the Croatian authorities were laughing and drinking beer while spray-painting migrants attempting to cross the border from Bosnia-Herzegovina, as EU parliamentarians have now begun pushing for an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the abuses.</p> <p>According to migrants\u2019 accounts, confirmed by numerous charities, at least two groups of migrants were apprehended by military personnel and handed over to police between 6 and 7 May near the Slovenian border, on route 61 in the area of Rijeka.</p> <p>\u201cWe were caught at 3am by a couple of military guys in a green uniform,\u201d said a migrant from Pakistan. \u201cThey searched us to make sure we were not smuggling anything and then they called the police. A police van with four officers in black uniforms arrived. They crammed us into the van and took us to a police station where we were photographed. They made us sign some paper. We asked for asylum but they told us to shut up.\u201d</p> <p>That night at the police station, Croatian officers would have allegedly taken in dozens of asylum seekers, predominantly from Pakistan and Afghanistan, who were captured in different locations. Following these events, about 4pm on 7 May the Croatian police allegedly piled them into four vans and drove them near to the border with Bosnia.</p> <p>\u201cOur group was in a van with a glass partition from which I saw the van stop at a store where they bought beer,\u201d said another man from Pakistan. \u201cThey were drinking along the way before we stopped near a small river close to Velika Kladu\u0161a.\u201d</p> <p>According to the migrants, that is where the abuse began. The police allegedly asked them to get out of the van one by one. Then, with a spray can, they began painting crosses on their heads and faces.</p> <p>\u201cThey made crosses on our heads and on some guys they coloured their moustaches or foreheads,\u201d said an asylum seeker. \u201cThey then made us take off our clothes and shoes, took our money and mobile phones and set fire to our clothes and belongings. Around 10 of them stood in a line and made us walk past them while they beat us with wooden sticks and police batons. After this they pushed us into the river and told us not to come back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cde42667e511ee2477159f6d172f1609b2ec92a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cde42667e511ee2477159f6d172f1609b2ec92a/0_0_2428_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"migrants spray painted by the Croatian police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Danish Refugee Council has collected testimonies from many of the alleged victims</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Danish Refugee Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the 33 people interviewed by the Danish&nbsp;Refugee&nbsp;Council (DRC),&nbsp;one of the main responders providing healthcare for migrants in Bosnia-Herzegovina,&nbsp;\u201c29 reported being beaten with police batons.

The family of two (a father with his son, a minor) reported that police officers were laughing while spray-painting their heads.</p> <p>The group of four said that the abuse took place near the village of Glinica; the family of two maintained they were abused on the other side of the border from the village of Sturlic, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot speculate as to the reasons behind this practice,\u201d said Nicola Bay, the DRC country director for Bosnia. \u201cWhat is clear however is that \u2018branding\u2019 humans with painted crosses is an extreme example of abusive and degrading treatment of people attempting to cross the border to Croatia. While these incidents are truly shocking, they unfortunately seem to fall into a pattern of abuse consistently reported by refugees and migrants attempting to cross the border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.\u201d</p> <p>In April alone, DRC teams in Bosnia-Herzegovina recorded 1,641 cases of refugees and migrants pushed back to Bosnia from Croatia. Of these, 891 reported being subjected to violence or physical assault; 1,253 reported having their belongings confiscated or destroyed (set on fire); 871 people said they\u2019d had identity documents confiscated or destroyed by Croatian police; 445 people said they had been denied access to asylum procedures in Croatia, despite having explicitly requested it.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, the Croatian police and the Croatian interior ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>However, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/12/croatian-police-accused-of-shaving-and-spray-painting-heads-of-asylum-seekers\">Guardian reported</a> the Croatian police\u2019s spray-painting of migrants on 12 May, the country\u2019s interior minister drafted a lengthy rebuttal on the ministry\u2019s website, calling the allegations \u201ccompletely absurd\u201d and accusing the Guardian of organising a \u201cpre-meditated attack against the Republic of Croatia\u201d.</p> <p>Following that report, a group of EU parliamentarians in Brussels is pushing for an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the abuses. \u201cWe believe the European Commission should join the investigation efforts of the UN to stop the alleged abuse and hold the perpetrators accountable for their actions,\u201d reads an internal memo circulating among MEPs. \u201cIf these allegations prove to be true, this is a serious case of abuse and in clear violation of the Schengen Border Code.

It is an utter scandal, a shameful abandonment of everything they claim to stand over in terms of respect for fundamental rights. Shame on them.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the protests of journalists, charities and even the UNHCR, all calling for an investigation into the alleged abuses of migrants at the hands of the Croatian police, the EU has not intervened.</p> <p>\u201cThe only conclusion you can reach about why they are silent is that as long as the borders are reinforced, then human rights obligations can be conveniently ignored,\u2019\u2019 said Daly. \u201cFor business reasons they are keen on the extension of Schengen and if refugees and migrants are sacrificed in delivering that then clearly for them, so be it. It makes me sick and ashamed to be a member of an EU which would operate in this way. I have no doubt whatsoever that the commission is fully aware that the allegations are correct and they have sacrificed refugees and migrants and their obligations under international law, in the interests of extending Schengen for big business &amp; geo-political reasons. [They] will not be allowed to get away with this, accountability must prevail, or the EU is over.\u201d</p> <p>In an email the Croatian Ministry of the Interior denied&nbsp;police had acted violently towards migrants, but added that \u201can extensive investigation of the allegations\u201d would be conducted.</p> <p>The email suggested migrants could have fabricated the news. \u201cWe find it highly probable that thousands of migrants are ready to use all means at their disposal to accomplish their goal, including giving false testimonies against police officers,\u201d it said. \u201cWhen lacking evidence, the simplest and easiest thing to do is to fabricate events which never happened or to portray real events in a distorted manner.\u201d</p>",

It is a question many are asking as lockdown restrictions gradually start to ease with the aim of rekindling the economy, rugby players among them.</p> <p>Premiership Rugby is hoping to resume its season in July, a date that will be considered on Thursday by the professional game board after the government\u2019s approval of contact training taking place.

One Bath season-ticket holder wrote in an email: \u201cI do not understand why restarting or finishing the season is even being discussed. Like all the other supporters I have spoken to, I do not want any of the players and staff to be put at risk. The season is over. Go away, keep fit and come back for a slightly later pre-season. No team is crowned champions. And forget the European competitions for a year.

  "<p>As he looks to the future, Kezhaseria Meyase, a 37-year-old resident of Khonoma, expresses confidence in the youth of the village. \u201cThey are well aware of the importance of conserving our forests and wildlife,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For the first time since the creation of the Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary (KNCTS) in 1998, tourism in Khonoma has come to a halt. In 2019, the remote 700-year-old village in the Indian state of Nagaland, near the Indo-Myanmar border, received more than 4,000 visitors. Nearly a fifth of the tourists were from overseas, drawn to Khonoma\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation success (in 2005, it was named<a href=\"https://ensia.com/articles/khonoma-indias-first-green-village-sustainable-agriculture/\"> India\u2019s first \u201cgreen village\u201d</a>).</p> <p>The 20 sq km (7.7 sq mile) sanctuary, consisting of dense subtropical and temperate broadleaf forests, is the first formally conserved community sanctuary in India. It is home to several vulnerable mammal species, including the clouded leopard, Asiatic black bear and hoolock gibbon; and villagers have recorded more than 300 avian species. BirdLife International recognises the sanctuary as <a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/factsheet/khonoma-nature-conservation-and-tragopan-sanctuary-iba-india\">one of the 555 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in India</a>, and the <a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22679163\">Blyth\u2019s </a><a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22679163\">tragopan</a>, a large pheasant which is the state bird of Nagaland, thrives in the higher reaches of KNCTS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f56568f293f31ecd17b00b0969fbee9ef09f722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f56568f293f31ecd17b00b0969fbee9ef09f722/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blyth\u2019s tragopan, a vulnerable species of bird which thrives in the higher reaches of Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blyth\u2019s tragopan, a vulnerable species of bird which thrives in the higher reaches of Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rofikul Islam/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khonoma, like the rest of the world, is coping with the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown in India, which began on 25 March. Visitors stayed away during the peak birding season of March and April.</p> <p>Meyase, chairman of KNCTS, says: \u201cYes, people from the village providing tourism-related services have lost cash income due to the lockdown. But they are still able to sustain themselves by farming and rearing livestock.\u201d</p> <p>He remains optimistic. \u201cSoon after the lockdown is lifted, people from neighbouring villages and from within the state will start visiting.\u201d</p> <p>Dismissing concerns about hunting in the sanctuary during the lockdown, Meyase adds: \u201cAs long as there is no free movement of people, the sanctuary is safe.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the lockdown is lifted, the Khonoma Youth Organisation, which is responsible for monitoring the sanctuary, will continue their surveillance.\u201d</p> <p>A steep fine of 20,000 rupees (\u00a3210) for any person caught hunting in KNCTS, as well as Khonoma\u2019s long history as a village of fierce warriors, serve as deterrents to any potential poachers, he adds.</p> <h2>Pulling together</h2> <p>Khonoma\u2019s residents belong to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angami_Naga\">Angami </a>people, who have lived off the forest for centuries, with hunting being a sacred cultural practice. In the early 1990s, following the mass slaughter of Blyth\u2019s tragopans by villagers over the Christmas period, a few of Khonoma\u2019s conservation-minded elders began campaigning for a protected area. They also recognised that conserving the forest, which is a rainwater catchment area, would secure water for the village and for the rice terraces in the valley below.</p> <p>Their sustained efforts bore fruit when the Khonoma village council passed a resolution for the creation of KNCTS in 1998. The hunting and logging ban was soon extended beyond the sanctuary, to include the entire village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6507b5446eccd8bc93edb7b265846336680cc0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6507b5446eccd8bc93edb7b265846336680cc0a/0_94_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The younger residents of Khonoma are well aware of the importance of conserving our forests and wildlife.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The younger residents of Khonoma learn the importance of conserving the village\u2019s forests and wildlife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To ensure that the men wouldn\u2019t return to hunting, they were recruited as forest wardens for three years and paid a salary via a grant from the Gerald Durrell Memorial Fund. Women, who had traditionally foraged in the sanctuary for fruit and vegetables to sell, were banned from doing so. </p> <p>Vitsokhono Pier, 35, who owns a plant nursery in Khonoma, says: \u201cWomen turned their attention to other income-generating activities like running a homestay or maintaining a nursery. Poinsettias are in big demand before Christmas.\u201d </p> <p>The initial trickle of tourists to Khonoma led to the opening of the first homestay \u2013 homes offering accommodation to paying guests \u2013 in 2006. There are 12 homestays in the village today and before the lockdown 20 people were employed as guides. Several more made handicrafts while others provided taxi services. The cash earned from tourism enables these families to buy groceries, pay for their children to go to school and meet other household expenses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f2f81a2fcb2b2518d8f0c4773be3c52b8476cceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f81a2fcb2b2518d8f0c4773be3c52b8476cceb/0_201_2479_1559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Village elder Tsilie Sakhrie, 77, was instrumental in the formation of KNCT.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Village elder Tsilie Sakhrie, 77, was instrumental in the formation of KNCTS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Pinto-Rodrigues</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Tsilie Sakhrie, 77, one of the village elders instrumental in the formation of KNCTS, about 100 (out of 600) families in the village have benefited from the tourist trade.</p> <p>But despite the lockdown and the loss of income from tourism, the village continues to have a high level of food security. Khonoma is known for its sustainable agriculture, and takes great pride in the fact that it has been self-sufficient since ancient times. Paddy terraces are positioned at the base of surrounding hills and the fields are irrigated by nutrient-rich rainwater that flows down the slopes. More than 20 rice varieties are grown in the village.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to rice, we also grow a variety of grains like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/25/against-the-grain-why-millet-is-enjoying-an-indian-revival-nagaland\">millet</a>, corn and Job\u2019s tears,\u201d says Kevikelie Pier, 52, a teacher at the local government school. \u201cAnd our livestock can last us for at least a year.\u201d</p> <p>Produce such as squash, pumpkin, carrot, cabbage, potato, mustard, ginger, garlic and king chilli are also grown in the village, in home gardens and rotating, shifting cultivation plots. Vegetables are also bartered with neighbours.</p> <p>Following the creation of KNCTS, several villages in the state<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/i-swapped-my-gun-for-binoculars-indias-hunters-turn-to-conservation-aoe\"> began to emulate</a> Khonoma\u2019s conservation efforts. Village elder Khriekhoto Mor, 64, says: \u201cToday, there are over 700 community-conserved areas (CCAs) in Nagaland, though only a handful are as actively conserved as Khonoma.\u201d</p> <p>In November 2014, the <a href=\"https://ccaforumnagaland.blogspot.com/p/about-nagaland-community-conserved-area.html\">Nagaland Community Conserved Areas Forum</a> (NCCAF) was formed with 22 members to facilitate the exchange of ideas and strengthen the conservation movement in the state. Mor currently serves as chairperson of NCCAF.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96d59365e53c5961fe214b065db44f62a4069622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96d59365e53c5961fe214b065db44f62a4069622/0_0_5138_3419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks to its sustainable agricultural practices, Khonoma has a high level of food security despite loss of tourist income.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thanks to its sustainable agricultural practices, Khonoma has a high level of food security despite loss of tourist income.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: robertharding/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khonoma\u2019s conservation success did, however, create an unforeseen problem for its residents. With the increase in wildlife populations, animals began to venture out of the forest and destroy crops. Wild boar and porcupines would dig up vegetable patches while large flocks of birds such as munias and parakeets attacked grain crops.</p> <p>Most of Khonoma\u2019s residents, who are subsistence farmers, were badly affected by this loss. To manage the situation, the KYO was empowered to issue a three-day hunting permit to a farmer requesting to get rid of a nuisance animal. The permit is strictly limited to the area of the farmer\u2019s land. Thirty such permits were issued in 2019, ensuring villagers remain on board with the conservation measures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/i-swapped-my-gun-for-binoculars-indias-hunters-turn-to-conservation-aoe\">\u2018I swapped my gun for binoculars\u2019: India\u2019s hunters turn to conservation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 20 years since the formation of KNCTS, it remains a safe haven for a multitude of rare species.

  "<p>\u201cI hate it!\u201d says Jim Clinton jocularly of the lockdown. \u201cI hate not being able to see the grandchildren \u2026 not being able to see a newborn baby is one of those things as a grandparent you don\u2019t really contemplate happening. You can\u2019t imagine you won\u2019t be there to experience those early days up close and personal.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton, a 74-year-old nonprofit worker from Alexandria, Louisiana, hasn\u2019t met the newest addition to his family, five-week-old baby Julia, due to the coronavirus restrictions. His son Ryan and daughter-in-law Sarah had baby Julia on 23 April. Julia is their third child, and under normal circumstances Clinton and his wife Susan would have visited as soon as possible after the birth.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t going to be possible: the family lives in Austin, Texas, and it wouldn\u2019t be responsible to visit, even if only to see the baby from a distance. \u201cThe process of getting to Julia, being exposed to the gas stations and convenience stores \u2026 it just wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d says Clinton. \u201cWe agonize over it, we grieve over it, but at the end of the day, we know it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton is one of the many grandparents across the world missing out on those precious early months of their grandchildren\u2019s lives. This is a challenging time for them: they are grateful that their grandchildren have arrived safe and healthy in the face of a frightening virus \u2013 doctors are not yet sure of Covid-19\u2019s effect in pregnancy \u2013 and yet that relief is tempered with sadness at the knowledge that they may not see these babies for months, or possibly more if a vaccine is not found.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to keep it in perspective,\u201d says Liz Griffiths, 63, a retiree from Surrey, UK. Her first grandchild, Max, was born on 29 March to Griffiths\u2019 daughter, Bekki. \u201cHe\u2019s safe, we\u2019re safe, Bekki is safe, and this hopefully won\u2019t last forever.\u201d But of course, missing the birth of your first grandchild is a challenging experience. Griffiths and her husband had cleared their schedule so that they could visit after Max\u2019s birth and help with childcare. After Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown on 23 March, they realised that would be impossible.</p> <p>There is the emotional side of the coronavirus lockdown: the anguished realisation that you won\u2019t be there for your grandchildren\u2019s first weeks in the world. But there are also practical considerations. In those early months, grandparents often look after older children, help keep the house tidy and prepare meals, and watch the baby whie the parents sleep. Without that support, new parents can feel overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so stressful,\u201d sighs 31-year-old stay-at-home mom Katelyn Cousins from St Petersburg, Florida. Katelyn gave birth to her second child with her husband Will three weeks ago. In addition to baby Meadow, Katelyn has an 18-month old daughter, Margot. When we speak, Katelyn sounds tired \u2013 I can hear the baby crying in the background. \u201cI\u2019m about an eight out of 10 for exhaustion right now,\u201d she admits.</p> <p>The difference between Meadow and Margot\u2019s births feels stark. When Margot was born, Will\u2019s parents stayed with them for two weeks, before Katelyn\u2019s mom took over. During those weeks, the grandparents helped with childcare and gave them parenting tips. \u201cThey showed us different methods for calming the baby when it\u2019s crying, how to ease gas, that kind of thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI definitely look up to my mom and her parenting style, so it was nice to have that comfort there, and my husband doesn\u2019t always know the right thing to do when both of them are crying.\u201d</p> <p>Now, with Will working from home due to the coronavirus restrictions, the burden of almost all the childcare falls on Katelyn. \u201cMy husband is a hard sleeper, so night duty is basically me,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s super-helpful when he can be, but with him having to work, it\u2019s hard. I definitely feel like I\u2019m in zombie mode all the time.\u201d</p> <p>When you\u2019re sacrificing the ability to see your grandchildren to obey the rules, watching others flout lockdown rules can be hugely chagrinning. \u201cI get very annoyed,\u201d says Paul Hawkins, 64, a retiree from Warwickshire. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my grandchild yet, and you see other people living nearby whose grandchildren are coming around every day.\u201d Hawkins\u2019 son Neil and his wife, Ellen, gave birth to their second child, son Chester, on 17 April. Even when the lockdown restrictions are eased, Hawkins probably won\u2019t meet Chester for a while \u2013 his mother-in-law Peggy lives with him, and as she\u2019s 97, she\u2019s extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84d10968723dbcf14f957cb33dc2439fa4df8fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d10968723dbcf14f957cb33dc2439fa4df8fa0/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothy\u2019s funeral group hug.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothy\u2019s funeral group hug.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Griffiths is the only grandparent to have caught a glimpse of the baby: tragically, her mother-in-law Dorothy died the week after baby Max was born. At the small, socially distanced funeral, Griffiths saw baby Max from a distance, in the car park. \u201cWe stayed a safe distance away,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, meeting your grandson at a funeral. It was very difficult.\u201d One small blessing \u2013 Griffiths was able to show Dorothy pictures of Max before she died. \u201cShe was in frail health by then, but she smiled,\u201d Griffiths remembers. \u201cWe think she did understand who he was.\u201d</p> <p>All the grandparents I speak with have been keeping in touch through FaceTime and Zoom. It\u2019s nice, but no substitute for being able to hold the newborns or sing them to sleep. Griffiths has attended online baby classes on Zoom, for parents and grandparents.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen him a lot on screen,\u201d Hawkins says of baby Chester, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the same as holding him or being there, I suppose.\u201d Watching a baby\u2019s first weeks on Earth digitally can be jarring: you notice their growth more acutely than you would in real life. \u201cIn such a short time,\u201d Hawkins says, \u201cyou really see how he\u2019s grown and changed. It\u2019s sad to know you\u2019ve missed that first month.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton relishes the photos and videos Ryan and Sarah send him of baby Julia. \u201cWe are taking advantage of the technology, which makes things so much better than they would have been if we were living through the 1918 flu pandemic, and relying on letters for news,\u201d he says. Ryan sent pictures of baby Julia from the delivery room, shortly after she was born. \u201cI was in my office and got the text and ran to the other part of the house to show Susan,\u201d Clinton remembers. \u201cWe hugged.\u201d</p> <p>Watching Julia grow up online is a bittersweet joy. \u201cEach new set of pictures is great on one level, but on another level it underscores the distance and makes you want to get on a highway, throw the rules out, behave how you\u2019d never behave, and just go.\u201d He sighs.</p> <p>\u201cBut then your better angels prevail, and you do the right thing.\u201d</p>",

There is scope and, we believe, demand and appetite to do it.\u201d</p> <p>The report says that even before the crisis, younger generations were facing declining \u201cabsolute mobility\u201d \u2013 falling real wages, fewer opportunities and stagnant or declining living standards.</p> <p>Machin said: \u201cNow that the crisis has drastically worsened economic and education inequality, young people are even worse off. There is a genuine concern that these inequalities could become entrenched for some time.\u201d</p> <p>The report says rebuilding after the pandemic offers an opportunity to \u201cgive serious consideration to radical policies that will create a more mobile society and a better functioning economy\u201d.</p> <p>The authors call for the introduction of job guarantees for people who are unemployed for more than 12 months, a one-off progressive wealth tax on the net worth of the top 1% of richest individuals, and living wages for key workers.&nbsp;</p> <p>They also call for a national tutoring service, with undergraduates and graduates helping children to catch up during the next school year.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sir Peter Lampl, the founder and chair of the Sutton Trust, an educational charity, said: \u201cWhile the young are affected least by the virus, they are impacted most by its consequences.&nbsp;These include school closures, unfinished apprenticeships and huge uncertainty around university and jobs. </p> <p>\u201cAs this report makes clear, bold moves are needed in education and the economy to prevent opportunities slipping away from these young people.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah Atkinson, the chief executive of the Social Mobility Foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s painfully clear that young people at the bottom of the social ladder, already held back from achieving their full potential, stand to lose the most from the economic impact of coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWhile schools have been closed to most pupils, we have provided over \u00a3100m to boost remote education. To support families with the impact of coronavirus, we are providing an injection of \u00a36.5bn into the welfare system as well as rolling out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters.\u201d</p>",

<p>South Australia has called a halt to granting international travel exemptions on compassionate grounds after SA Health bungled the case of a British woman who arrived on the weekend and tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Premier <strong> Steven Marshall </strong>says he wants to get to the bottom of the problem, which resulted in the woman presenting herself to authorities on arrival in Adelaide rather than being met by health officials, before allowing any further international travellers into SA in such circumstances.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be granting any further exemptions for overseas travel to South Australia until we\u2019ve ironed out this administrative error,\u201d Mr Marshall said on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we have airtight systems going forward before we grant further exemptions for people coming from overseas.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Marshall said he did not intend to \u201chang SA Health out to dry\u201d and praised the department\u2019s overall handling of the pandemic as well as the previous arrival of international travellers.</p> \n  <p>The premier also confirmed police commissioner Grant Stevens would meet the SA Health chief executive to develop new arrangements for future transfers.<br></p> \n  <p>Before Sunday\u2019s case, 21 other people had come to SA from overseas on compassionate grounds, about half to attend a funeral and the others to visit a dying relative.</p> \n  <p>The British woman, in her 50s, was granted her exemption to visit a dying relative.<br></p> \n  <p>She had spent about a week in quarantine in Victoria after arriving in Australia from the UK and had tested negative while in isolation.</p> \n  <p>She wore a mask while travelling to SA and made herself known to airport authorities and was then escorted out by police.</p> \n  <p>When tested again, she returned the positive result, becoming the state\u2019s 440th case of Covid-19 and the first for almost three weeks.</p> \n  <p>The woman was returned to quarantine while almost 20 close contacts were also ordered into self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>After initially saying Victorian officials did not tell them when the woman would arrive, chief public health Officer <strong>Nicola Spurrier </strong>issued a statement on Thursday conceding the flight information was passed on.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cDue to an administrative oversight, we can confirm the relevant flight details involving an overseas traveller arriving in South Australia were provided to SA Health prior to their arrival,\u201d Spurrier said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat this issue has highlighted is the need to strengthen the processes involving travellers arriving from overseas and travelling between states during their quarantine period.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>After SA\u2019s initial comments, Victorian chief health officer <strong>Brett Sutton</strong> said South Australia was told of the woman\u2019s travel details and he had the email to prove it.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why there is a misunderstanding about having been informed, but that email was sent and South Australian authorities were alerted about the time and flight details,\u201d Sutton said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T04:14:10.397Z\">at 5.14am BST</time></p>

My personal view, looking at what\u2019s happened with health, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the private hospitals agreement, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the public hospitals agreement. <br></p> \n   <p>It\u2019s allowed us to work with the public health units on the contact tracing.

This rule supports our regulated businesses to uphold their AML/CTF obligations while adopting a flexible approach to customer identity processes.<br></p> \n  <p>Austrac collaborated on the rule change with the Australian Banking Association and the Australian Israel Chamber of Commerce NSW who initiated the project and identified the opening of bank accounts as a significant barrier.

This is directly related to the level of pre-pandemic income support payments.</li> \n   <li>The single rate of Newstart in January 2018 (including rent assistance and energy supplement) was $117pw below the poverty line ($185pw if they did not receive rent assistance). Youth allowance (plus these supplements) was $164pw below the poverty line ($232pw without rent assistance).</li> \n   <li>Households that have to rely mainly on social security payments (eg unemployment, parenting, and disability payments) are five times more likely to experience poverty (36%) than those receiving most income from wages and salaries (7%). However, 38% of those in poverty are in wage-earning households; the majority of whom are households with children.</li> \n   <li>In households where the main earner is a female, the poverty rate is 19% \u2013 almost double the rate when the main earner is male \u2013 10%. </li> \n   <li>In single parent families in which the main earner is a woman the rate of poverty (37%) is twice that in which the main earner is a man (18%).</li> \n   <li>The biggest differences in poverty rates between households with male and female main earners are in families with children. The average poverty rate among people in families with children where the main income-earner is female is 23%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male (which is the more common arrangement). In contrast, among households without children, the average poverty rate where the main income-earner is female is 12%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male.</li> \n   <li>Nearly half the children in sole parent families live in poverty (44%) compared with 13% for children living with both parents.</li> \n   <li>While those of working age are at greater risk of poverty than older people, over 65s who are living in private rental face a relatively high risk of poverty (41%).</li> \n   <li> Renters are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as home-owners (19% compared with 9%) with public housing tenants at greatest risk (58%).</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You can read the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Poverty2020pt2\">whole report here</a>. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T00:01:37.126Z\">at 1.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecee3f58f0898700351d85f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:07:26.544Z\">11.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services has released a report \u2013 Poverty in Australia 2020: Part 2 \u2013 Who is affected? <em>\u2013 </em>which looks at the impact of poverty before the Covid-19 crisis.</p> \n  <p>Its findings, unfortunately shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone. As the acting Acoss CEO, <strong>Jacqueline Phillips</strong>,<strong> </strong>says:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>This report exposes the disproportionate impact of poverty on households in which women are the main income earners. These households are twice as likely to live in poverty as those in which men are the main income earners (19% and 10%, respectively), with the gap even higher in households with children (at 23% and 10% respectively).</strong></p> \n   <p> Disturbingly, more than a third of single mothers and their children are living in poverty (37%). The challenges faced by single mothers that lead to so many being on low incomes have serious implications for the wellbeing of those women and their children.</p> \n   <p>Early indications suggest that women have been suffering some of the worst economic impacts of the current pandemic, and effective policy action is needed to ensure this does not translate into an ongoing reduction in female employment or an increase in poverty amongst women and children. A snapback on childcare or income support risks trapping single mothers and their children in poverty.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:59:58.446Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecedd6f8f087e3ca0f64ae2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T21:36:56.374Z\">10.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rugby League is back.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRL/status/1265756229772603397\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May 28.<br><br>That\u2019s it.

Lengths vary, but the sentiment remains \u2013 a good fringe is proof that the wheels of professionalism are working nicely, even if they are coming off.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually more about [change], about wanting to feel normal, or to appear normal to the outside world,\u201d says George Northwood, the fashion media\u2019s go-to hairstylist. \u201cI get that now is a time to experiment, and while I probably wouldn\u2019t suggest cutting your hair \u2013 there are things you can do, with scarves and hairbands, which will extend the need \u2013 I understand this is about more than just a cut,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd frankly I\u2019m behind doing whatever you can to stay sane.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52b32444c474779aa6a4078d9b87709cb8d54a7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b32444c474779aa6a4078d9b87709cb8d54a7e/0_40_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, in the House of Commons in London earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, in the House of Commons in London earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This wasn\u2019t always the case. In the halcyon days of March, we didn\u2019t know when things would end; a haircut was the last thing on our minds. At least for women. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/here-are-the-new-businesses-to-start-during-the-coronavirus-recession.html\">Clipper sales are up over 200%</a>, which suggests that men have been trimming their beards and hair for weeks. But as yet there are no available figures on whether the same is true for hairdressing scissors.</p> <p>We\u2019re now 10 weeks into lockdown and well past the sweet spot of a recommended trim \u2013 \u201cwhich is absolutely six to eight weeks\u201d, according to Northwood, the man who coined and cultivated The Alexa (Chung) and The Claudia (Winkelman). As for the fringe, \u201cit generally has a four-week shelf life. So if you went into lockdown with one, chances are you will have given yourself one trim already\u201d. Northwood has been guiding clients such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bap-tZ08lY\">Winkelman</a> into cutting hers at home, using clips, point cutting and texturising scissors, videos of which have been uploaded on to social media. He says most of his work right now is on YouTube.</p> <p>\u201cCutting your hair now is mostly born out of necessity, and yes definitely a way to feel like you are in control, that you are not losing yourself,\u201d says Rachael Gibson, a hair historian. To many people, the thought of going to a hair salon represents a return to normality after a long, destabilising period \u2013 in lieu of this, cutting our hair is as close as we can get.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_f4uXjggWO/\" data-alt=\"Bella Hadid\u2019s DIY trim during lockdown.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

During the Great Depression, for example,<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wMrmN_q3XV0C&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=During+the+Great+Depression,+for+example,+cosmetic+sales+went+up+by+25+percent+in+the+US.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kogvqy3cef&amp;sig=ACfU3U1-d0bbcFkAx3KJBIde3c_a2BjpgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwju0afz5tPpAhWNFMAKHTiAA-MQ6AEwCnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=During%20the%20Great%20Depression%2C%20for%20example%2C%20cosmetic%20sales%20went%20up%20by%2025%20percent%20in%20the%20US.&amp;f=false\"> cosmetic sales initially dipped in the US</a>, though by 1939 they were up 35%. When the British economy waned in 2008 after the financial crisis, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a4ndCCdI_m4C&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=nail+polish+sales+went+up+65+percent+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oBl6tK-lzS&amp;sig=ACfU3U23lSnl2L4i3ToBWyor5EB9c-Eahw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJmPW559PpAhWyVRUIHa5bCHUQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nail%20polish%20sales%20went%20up%2065%20percent%202008&amp;f=false\">nail polish sales went up 65</a>%. And in the early 00s, Leonard Lauder, chairman of the board of Est\u00e9e Lauder, coined the term <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/unknown/2009/01/23/lip-service\">Lipstick Index</a>, which suggested that in leaner times, women turn their buying power towards smaller luxury items such as lipstick to get their fix.</p> <p>In these screen-focused times, and with mask-wearing soon possibly to be mandatory, could we be on the cusp of a Fringe Index?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00be82a9d2976c2506a8906bdd53181287d78622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00be82a9d2976c2506a8906bdd53181287d78622/0_0_2880_2508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, shortly before lockdown began.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"871\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, shortly before lockdown began.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacopo Raule/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is something subtler at play, too, particularly when you consider the semantics of how politicians dress. Boris Johnson\u2019s unkempt hair might be a bid to identify with the proletariat, but just makes him look even more posh. By contrast, that Rayner is trying to style her grown-out fringe rather than look shambolic gives her an air of relatability. Liam Allmark, a hair stylist at Bristol\u2019s Kings &amp; Queens Hair Salon, compares her hair to Brigitte Bardot\u2019s and says if you can\u2019t grow your fringe out, \u201cyou could sweep it to one side while it gets long enough to go for [this cheekbone-length fringe]\u201d. As for Matt Hancock, either he lives with a hairdresser or has some sort of access to one \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-governance-office/2015-election/guide-to-local-services.pdf\">Houses of Parliament have \u2018in-house\u2019 hairdressers</a>, says Allmark. But a quick call to the John Simon salon proves they, too, are shut. </p> <p>The pandemic has plunged us into deep uncertainty. The twist, says Northwood, is that people are also after fringes when salons re-open in July. \u201cIt seems that cutting your hair is one thing, but focusing on the fringe is more like a mood change, something that marks a new beginning.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>On a Tuesday in early April, viewers around the globe watched streamers on Twitch play one particular game for a combined 34m hours, smashing established live-streaming viewership records.

Many professional crack shots are jumping ship from games such as Apex Legends and Fortnite, the most notable departure thus far being 2019 Overwatch League MVP Jay \u201cSinatraa\u201d Won, who revealed in April that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SFShock/status/1255250197510225922?s=20\">he was leaving Blizzard\u2019s hero shooter behind to focus on Valorant.</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8amyzDHOKw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g8amyzDHOKw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Yet for the casual player like me, Valorant still has a lot to offer. While I might not be the most accurate shot, I can still be useful in other areas. My preferred character, Cypher \u2013 one of nine in the game right now \u2013 has the tools to provide match-winning information about the enemy team through careful camera placement and pesky tripwires. It turns every round into a battle of wits as well as accuracy, weaving personal narratives into a conventionally cold competitive format.</p> <p>The game\u2019s slick design has enabled its meteoric rise on Twitch, but a crucial difference between this game and previous contenders is that almost no one could get their hands on it for weeks. Valorant spent almost two months in a very limited closed beta stage, which ends today on 28 May, and the digital keys to the virtual kingdom were a hot commodity. Riot Games\u2019 clever marketing scheme was to let streamers give away keys to their viewers, incentivising millions of people to watch the game being played in the hopes of gaining access for themselves.</p> <p>This led to an initial boom, but it didn\u2019t take long for things to turn sour. Top streamer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drdisrespect/status/1248075009790103554?s=20\">Dr Disrespect was caught fraudulently advertising</a> beta keys, and some players with access took to eBay to trade their accounts for profit. In an attempt to keep the system fair, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1248047652500992002?s=20\">Riot swept its player database, banning many account sellers</a>, and later opened up giveaway drops to all streamers with beta access instead of a curated few. But then people started streaming prerecorded footage of their gameplay, claiming that they were \u201clive-playing\u201d Valorant, trying to bring in more viewers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb60cbe2d88c971202e0e542f129890248aea9c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb60cbe2d88c971202e0e542f129890248aea9c6/0_0_1634_920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Team game\u2019 \u2026 Valorant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Team game\u2019 \u2026 Valorant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riot Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under lockdown, when viewers may have more free time than usual, Riot\u2019s approach has created a perfect storm of hype. But it has also left some debris in its wake. While writing this, I watched a houseful of streamers play the game in shifts to a drop-desperate audience in the hundreds \u2013 yet the chat was devoid of conversation, beyond viewers pinging the watch-time command to expose the nauseating amount of hours they\u2019ve spent watching and hoping for access. I\u2019m not sure this is what Riot had in mind when it kicked off this campaign.</p> <p>For those who snagged a coveted beta key, the watching and waiting was worth it. Having played Counter-Strike for almost two decades, Kai Powell spent roughly 50 hours waiting for Valorant access over three or four days. \u201cI like that Valorant feels different from other hero shooters because the abilities supplement the gunplay,\u201d Powell tells me. \u201cIf you look at Overwatch, you\u2019re locked into whatever weapons that character comes with.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie Flores has spent more than 1,500 hours in Overwatch, but now plays Valorant on a daily basis. \u201cValorant is a team game, but doing well individually is enough to lead your team to victory,\u201d Flores tells me. \u201cToo often, I\u2019m doing well in Overwatch, but my teammates will deny constant opportunities to coordinate attacks together \u2026 even if it ends in a victory, the process leading up to the win was so exhausting that it usually doesn\u2019t feel rewarding!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9994506c0e7ed9948badb94c3988ef2844b3f571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9994506c0e7ed9948badb94c3988ef2844b3f571/0_0_1400_700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instant hit \u2026 Valorant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Instant hit \u2026 Valorant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riot Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet like many competitive esports \u2013 including Riot\u2019s own League of Legends \u2013 Valorant already has a toxicity problem.

Esports organisations such as Sentinels, T1 and Ninjas in Pyjamas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sentinels/status/1255291066028261377\">are stocking teams with ex-Overwatch and Counter-Strike professionals as we speak</a>, and given the streaming numbers, it\u2019s hard to accuse any of them of jumping the gun. Riot will have an esports giant in its roster when the game launches next week.</p> <ul> <li><p>Valorant is out on 2 June; playable for free on PC.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>\ufeffAccording to the great proto-existentialist philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, the life of a human or other beast \u201cswings like a pendulum back and forth between pain and boredom\u201d. Indeed, pain (or want) and boredom are the two main constituents of existence, and not only during the lockdown phase of a pandemic \u2013 a thought that might (or might not) afford some gloomy relief to many right now.</p> <p>Schopenhauer was arguably the first western philosopher to take boredom seriously as one of the primary miseries of humankind, defining it lucidly as \u201ca tame longing without any particular object\u201d. Boredom was, moreover, more likely to afflict the more intelligent person, unfortunately for geniuses such as himself.</p> <p>His successor Friedrich Nietzsche agreed, adding that boredom was the fundamental reason for a host of regrettable phenomena, including the self-denying practices of holy ascetics (who chose the refusal of pleasure as \u201ctheir chief tool in the fight with their enduring pain and boredom\u201d), and even the creation of humans by God, who needed something to distract himself from his divine, cosmic ennui.</p> <p>On the other hand, Nietzsche pointed out that boredom is not all bad. \u201cHe who fortifies himself completely against boredom fortifies himself against himself too,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe will never drink the most powerful elixir from his own innermost spring.\u201d Indeed, boredom could be a spur to creativity: \u201cFor the thinker and for all inventive spirits boredom is the unpleasant calm of the soul which precedes the happy voyage and the dancing breezes.\u201d If one were never bored, perhaps, one would never bother to write such brilliant books.</p> <p>This is one of those occasions, not so rare as generally imagined, when the philosophers did, after all, get it right the first time, before the scientists came along to see what was what. That conclusion is richly endorsed by this highly interesting and suggestive book on the analysis of boredom from a strictly psychological perspective.</p> <p>One experiment found that captive mink in unexciting environments get bored (as distinct from depressed or apathetic). Another found that people would give themselves painful electric shocks to avoid boredom. Boredom in humans can be induced either by too little information or by too much (as in a baffling high-level lecture on a subject one knows nothing about). Those with a weaker faculty of attention, too, get bored more easily, as do those who are more sensation-seeking. People in middle age are less likely to be bored than teenagers and older people. It is even suggested that men are more boredom-prone than women, though not considered here is the possibility that women just don\u2019t have as much time to get bored in.</p> <p>Our guides\u2019 careful analysis leads to a detailed conception of boredom as a combination of being mentally unengaged, and wanting to engage with something, yet being unable to \u2013 what they call \u201ca failure to launch\u201d. It seems that some people experience this more often than others: those blessed with a strong sense of \u201cintrinsic motivation\u201d, who pursue projects for their own sake \u2013 whether it be extreme rock-climbing or learning a musical instrument \u2013 might be less prone to boredom, or might just be better at learning from its early signals. But others will experience boredom more often if they generally lack a feeling of agency and satisfaction in their lives: such factors can\u2019t be remedied by simply telling them that only boring people get bored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6c6ad27352a40ad43e3952f986aede499ba001a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6c6ad27352a40ad43e3952f986aede499ba001a/365_436_3424_2053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimi Hendrix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I didn\u2019t hear any guitar players doing anything new and I was bored out of my mind\u2019\u2026 Jimi Hendrix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Sharrat/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But despite the rhetoric of peril \u2013 many factors are described as causing a person to be \u201cat risk of boredom\u201d, and higher levels of boredom have been associated with poor impulse control and addiction \u2013 the authors also argue, following Nietzsche, that \u201cit is actually beneficial to have the capacity to be bored\u201d. Boredom might, after all, be a \u201cspur to creativity\u201d, they say, citing a story about one of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s first solo appearances. An audience member asked where he had been hiding this volcanic musical style, and Hendrix responded that he\u2019d been touring as a sideman with other bands and \u201cI got bored shitless. I didn\u2019t hear any guitar players doing anything new and I was bored out of my mind.\u201d</p> <p>This is a cool story, but it\u2019s arguable whether what Hendrix was experiencing as a session player was really \u201cboredom\u201d as the present book defines it, or simply a mixture of dissatisfaction and creative ambition. Because true boredom, our authors argue, is precisely the state in which you want to do something interesting (such as play some amazing guitar licks), but somehow you just can\u2019t.</p> <p>Even so, the authors argue that boredom must be useful somehow, working from an implicit evolutionary-psychology assumption that any part of our psychological make-up must have somehow helped our ancestors survive and have more children in the deep past. So evolution, they suppose, must have built into us a desire to use our cognitive capacities well, and boredom is the adaptive signal that we aren\u2019t doing so. They also tell one of those evo-psych just-so stories: imagine if our ancestors had never been bored while sitting around the campfire munching on buffalo meat! They would never have striven to create civilisation!</p> <p>There is no doubt some kernel of truth in this, though it doesn\u2019t help us modern humans, who are more perverse than captive mink and probably than early homo sapiens, and so can be bored even while facing a huge menu of possible stimulation, as we all know from those times spent scrolling through Netflix without being able to decide to watch anything in particular. And in fact the most intriguing, and gently polemical, strand of this book is the suggestion that, perhaps, boredom is a larger and far more serious problem in modern society than we think.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The writers identify boredom as a driving force behind tribalism and xenophobia. Did boredom, after all, lead to Brexit?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It might have, for example, profound political implications. People who are more prone to boredom, the authors report, are more likely to be narcissistic or hostile, and \u201csome forms of aggression could be viewed as attempts to redress the lack of meaning that is associated with boredom\u201d. So they identify boredom \u2013 in its existential mode as a sense of the meaninglessness of life \u2013 as one possible driving force behind tribalism and xenophobia. Did boredom, after all, lead to Brexit? Certainly one plausible hypothesis for why so many people voted for Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, I\u2019d suggest, is that voters were profoundly bored with a world in which nothing very important ever seemed to happen, so why not vote for a leader who would at least be entertaining? The events of this year, of course, illustrate at least one problem with that reasoning.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to think of smartphones and social media, meanwhile, as handy alleviators of boredom, but the truth might be more disturbing. The authors of this book argue persuasively that consumption of social media is a maladaptive response to boredom, as indeed Schopenhauer himself would have recognised. \u201cThis is the true source of boredom \u2013 a continual panting after excitement, in order to have a pretext for giving the mind and spirits something to occupy them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe kind of things people choose for this purpose shows that they are not very particular, as witness the miserable pastimes they have recourse to, and their ideas of social pleasure and conversation.\u201d It is not difficult to imagine what Schopenhauer might have made of Twitter.</p> <p>It is possible, however, to make a much stronger argument. We know that social media has been deliberately engineered to be addictive, its infinite distractions packaged in the psychological model of \u201cintermittent reward\u201d: sometimes you get new stuff or likes, sometimes not. It\u2019s also obvious that postmodern consumerism carpet-bombs us with too many meaningless alternatives, leading to the well-known phenomenon of choice paralysis: according to one celebrated study, the more varieties of jam there are to choose from, the less likely it is that you will actually buy any jam.</p> <p>Given these facts, it is all too plausible that, via such mechanisms, the modern world deliberately manufactures mass boredom in order to profit from it. What if our psychologist authors\u2019 idea of a healthy response to boredom \u2013 to find something that satisfyingly engages our curiosity and our capacities \u2013 is the worst nightmare of digital marketers and, if broadly adopted, would drive down \u201cproductivity\u201d, considered in a strictly economic sense, even further? It\u2019s interesting to think that we might be about to find out.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom is published by Harvard (RRP \u00a322.95).

The screen is covered in Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass 3, similar to a smartphone.</p> <h2>Running</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52defcb9b7d69c6e9a4ec99d2731769b8d0e7867\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52defcb9b7d69c6e9a4ec99d2731769b8d0e7867/256_421_4363_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The running screens are highly customisable displaying up to four data fields, and you can have multiple screens you can flick through with the up and down buttons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Forerunner 245 tracks lots of sports but excels for running with practically every feature you can think of, whether that\u2019s on a treadmill, track, trail or road. The battery lasts up to 24 hours tracking with GPS, and just under six hours playing music.</p> <p>The GPS trails are the most accurate I\u2019ve tested in suburban London, matching distance and routes with very little deviation from maps and race lengths. The time it takes to get a GPS lock, and the strength of that lock, has been drastically improved with a recent software update too, getting a lock within 20 seconds of stepping outdoors most of the time.</p> <p>Garmin\u2019s third-generation heart rate sensor is about as accurate as optical scanners can be too, and for the majority of people will be more than accurate enough for training purposes. If you need better you can connect a chest strap via Bluetooth.</p> <p>During a run you have a series of customisable screens with a varying number of fields and stats on display. The screens are well designed and easy to understand with just a quick glance mid-run.</p> <p>My primary screen has pace at the top, a run timer and distance in the middle, and heart rate at the bottom. But you could show fewer fields or swap any of them for a vast list of stats, including: various timers and laps, distances, paces, speeds, heart rates and zones, running dynamics (with optional <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/561205\">Running Dynamics Pod</a> accessory), cadence, race info, temperature, elevation and other bits. There\u2019s a stat for practically anything you want to see at a glance.</p> <h2>Targets, performance and workouts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc2b3fd25626bbdfe571acdb2ad075e0b77fc4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2b3fd25626bbdfe571acdb2ad075e0b77fc4a/3_0_5461_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Forerunner 245 Music comes into its own when training, with detailed performance stats and easy-to-follow interval guides.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can get the watch to beep and vibrate when you\u2019ve hit certain milestones, such as laps or distance, and speak things like your average pace every three minutes through Bluetooth headphones. You can also set a target based on distance, time or pace, which is extremely handy for running a 5K without a running track.</p> <p>Alongside <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max\">VO2 Max</a> estimates, used as an overall measure of fitness, the Garmin can measure performance and tell you if you have worked hard enough. Between six and 20 minutes into your run the watch will beep and give you a positive or negative score, which is either a kick to run harder or confirmation that you\u2019re on track. I find it extremely useful.</p> <p>The Forerunner 245 can track workouts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/aug/05/interval-training-burn-running-fast\">interval training</a> too. The watch has a built-in coach with adaptive plans for beginners to intermediates with a 5K time over 21 minutes.</p> <p>But you can easily programme your own or download sessions, based on pace, distance, heart rate zone or other metrics. Running at a pace, for instance, the watch beeps a countdown to the start of the interval.</p> <p>During the sprint the watch beeps when you are over or under your target pace alongside a glanceable dial on screen. It works really well and means you do not need a track, a set place to run or someone with a timer to do effective interval training.</p> <p>The only thing missing is a barometer. You\u2019ll still get elevation data from maps, but if you look to train using elevation this might be a deal-breaker.</p> <h2>Other health</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4cae0f80786e133a6f384f05970c4cf9940ac6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4cae0f80786e133a6f384f05970c4cf9940ac6a/566_597_3882_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Forerunner 245 might be running-focused, but it does a good job of tracking multiple other sports and activities, as well as general health.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Forerunner 245 does a good job of tracking most of the basic cycling stats similar to running (pace, distance, heart rate etc) and can be paired with various external sensors for speed and cadence, plus Garmin\u2019s smart lights.</p> <p>Swimming, including heart rate, lengths, distance, stroke type and count, calories and other bits can be tracked in the pool too. Plus gym workouts and a handful of other activities profiles, such as walking, yoga, rowing and weights.</p> <p>Overall health tracking is also extensive, covering all the usual suspects such as steps, calories, distance, intensity, heart rate, move notifications, menstrual tracking and stress.</p> <p>Garmin\u2019s body battery attempts to track your energy levels during the day to show when best to exercise or rest. The watch tracks sleep, including cycles, heart rate and estimates blood oxygen saturation, and it can alert you when if heart rate spikes when not active. The only thing missing compared to the very best fitness trackers on the market is ECG measurements for your heart.</p> <h2>Music</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db42a65c631b9260cf89765ae0557c3c9d87576b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db42a65c631b9260cf89765ae0557c3c9d87576b/786_681_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Music playback controls are a bit clunky, having to switch between pause/play/skip and volume control, but do the job admirably on a run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both versions of the Forerunner 245 can control music playback on a smartphone, but only the Forerunner 245 Music can download tracks and play them without a phone, with a capacity for 3.5GB or 500 tracks.</p> <p>Music in MP3 or AAC format can be transferred via USB cable from the computer using Garmin Express. If you\u2019re a Spotify Premium, Deezer or Amazon Music user, you can install the associated app on your watch and sync music and podcasts directly to the watch via wifi. The Spotify app works really well, although downloading large playlists takes quite some time. Playing Spotify on runs without a phone is a killer feature but reduces the battery life to six hours.</p> <h2>Smartwatch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0130c272c154dd6803adba85b7f9cf8b2eccaf91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0130c272c154dd6803adba85b7f9cf8b2eccaf91/449_503_3950_2370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The watch can handle basic smartwatch functions, such as notifications, calendar sync and the weather.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside health tracking, the Forerunner 245 has basic smartwatch features, vibrating when you get a text, notification or call on your phone. You can scroll through the text of a notification and clear it, reject a call and that sort of thing.</p> <p>The battery lasts about a week with the screen on, notifications and health-tracking active, including heart rate, which is significantly longer than most smartwatches that only manage up to two days.</p> <p>The smartwatch functions work with both Android and an iPhone. They will not match a true smartwatch, but if you are looking for alerts on your wrist the Garmin does the job.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3270da1ce5dae33e83043f24f3183e45cc4dbc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3270da1ce5dae33e83043f24f3183e45cc4dbc8/0_153_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Garmin Connect app on Android or iOS takes care of data syncing, fitness and health data analysis, and a large range of settings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Syncing and updating the watch via wifi is much faster than via smartphone.</p></li> <li><p>You can\u2019t listen to music and sync via wifi at the same time.</p></li> <li><p>Garmin and Beats headphones have a bug that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/14/beats-powerbeats-review-apples-cheaper-bluetooth-fitness-earbuds\">breaks the on-earphone volume controls</a>.</p></li> <li><p>The watch can take a beating \u2013 I fell while running, landing on the watch and taking a bit out of the plastic but it was otherwise unaffected.</p></li> <li><p>The Forerunner 245 doesn\u2019t support Garmin Pay/mobile payments.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Garmin Forerunner 245 costs <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/628939/pn/010-02120-10\">\u00a3249.99</a> RRP without local music playback or <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/646690/pn/010-02120-30\">\u00a3299.99</a> RRP with music playback, but are frequently discounted.</p> <p>For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 45 has an RRP of <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/682416\">\u00a3169.99</a>, the Forerunner 945 <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/621922\">\u00a3519.99</a>, the Polar Vantage M costs <a href=\"https://www.polar.com/uk-en/vantage/m\">\u00a3249</a>, the Suunto 5 costs <a href=\"https://www.suunto.com/en-gb/Products/sports-watches/suunto-5/suunto-5-all-black/\">\u00a3299</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/13/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-best-smartwatch-for-android\">Samsung Galaxy Watch Active</a> 2 costs <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/wearables/galaxy-watch-active2-r830/SM-R830NZDABTU/buy\">\u00a3269</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/apple-watch-series-5-review-the-king-of-smartwatches\">Apple Watch Series 5</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch\">\u00a3399</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a runner\u2019s best friend, and sets a new bar by which most other running watches will be measured.</p> <p>The watch is small, slim and light.

Buy the one with music and free yourself from your phone for motivational tunes or podcasts, including offline Spotify support.</p> <p>It also does a great job of tracking a lot of other activities and features comprehensive general health monitoring too, including sleep, stress and heart rate alerts. Its smartwatch-like features get the basics right without trying to do too much, plus it has a fair few watch faces available and easy-to-swap standard straps.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the cheapest, but the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a truly great running and fitness watch that is easy to live with on a daily basis.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> slim, light, real buttons, clear screen, accurate GPS, good heart rate, extensive stats, comprehensive health tracking, highly customisable, long battery life, optional offline music, Spotify, basic smartwatch features</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive, no barometer, no touchscreen as well as buttons, interface can be a bit clunky, screen fairly basic compared with smartwatches</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbee9d3d1b91901b0134fa5f07ed55df6785246c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbee9d3d1b91901b0134fa5f07ed55df6785246c/724_798_3454_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hold the light button to access a series of quick settings, and to turn the watch off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/13/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-best-smartwatch-for-android\">Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 review: the best smartwatch for Android</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/24/fossil-gen-5-review-googles-wear-os-smartwatch-at-its-best\">Fossil Gen 5 review: Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch at its best</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/apple-watch-series-5-review-the-king-of-smartwatches\">Apple Watch Series 5 review: the king of smartwatches</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The UK government must urgently set out clear plans on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-green-recovery\">green recovery</a> from the coronavirus crisis if the delayed UN climate summit is to be a success, say leading experts.</p> <p>The climate talks known as Cop26 and scheduled to be held in Glasgow, are expected to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/cop26-climate-talks-in-glasgow-likely-to-be-delayed-again\">postponed by a year</a> from their original date this November, dashing hopes that the summit would be swiftly reconvened. A formal decision on the delay will be taken by the UN Thursday evening.</p> <p>Tying the Cop26 talks to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders\">green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis</a> is now essential to regain momentum and ensure the summit produces the fresh global commitment needed on the climate crisis, experts say.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theelders.org/profile/mary-robinson\">Mary Robinson</a>, former UN climate envoy, and chair of the Elders group of international leader, said: \u201cVery definitely we need to tie together a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">green recovery</a> and Cop26 \u2013 that is imperative. UK leadership can and should urge forward a net-zero carbon transition from the Covid-19 crisis. Leadership is needed, moral, political, economic and social leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said: \u201cThe UK presidency comes at an absolutely critical time. There is an extraordinary opportunity to restart the economy and look at creative ways [to recover]. We need to find ways to become more resilient.\u201d</p> <p>The Cop26 talks are seen as vital because nations are obliged under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris agreement of 2015</a> to present renewed plans every five years on how to meet the legally binding goal of holding global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably no more than 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>Current commitments on curbing emissions, set in Paris, would take the world far beyond those limits, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">about 3C of heating</a>, which scientists say would spell disaster around the world. That means fresh national commitments on carbon reductions by 2030 must be set this year, ahead of the Cop26 talks.</p> <p>As host nation the UK carries responsibility for bringing governments together to make Cop26, the most important conference since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris in 2015</a>, a success.</p> <p>Without a clear plan of its own to reach net-zero carbon emissions, a target <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">enshrined in British law</a>, the UK will struggle for credibility in urging other countries to come forward with national plans, according to participants and close observers of the talks.</p> <p>Some countries would like to see the UK present a formal submission to the UN, setting out its emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050. Known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC), these formal plans are a legal requirement under the Paris accord.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a very welcome and important signal [to set out an NDC],\u201d said Steiner. \u201cWe need to see a high level of ambition and a national strategy.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://christianafigueres.com/#/\">Christiana Figueres</a>, the former UN climate chief, told a committee of MPs last week: \u201cIt definitely would set a good example to other countries. I believe the UK should do it as soon as it responsibly can.\u201d</p> <p>Developing countries are also anxious that NDCs should not be delayed by the long hiatus before Cop26.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aosis.org/about/lead-negotiator-for-oceans/\">Janine Felson</a>, Belize\u2019s&nbsp;ambassador to the UN<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: \u201cAll developed countries should bring forward their NDCs.\u201d</p> <p>Few large-scale economies have submitted an NDC yet. Chile, the original host of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">Cop25</a>, in 2019 (before the transfer to Madrid), submitted its plan earlier this year, Norway has strengthened its NDC, and Rwanda last week became the first African nation to do so. Japan set out plans that drew widespread criticism for lack of ambition but China, India,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/european-green-deal-will-change-economy-to-solve-climate-crisis-says-eu\"> the EU</a>, and other large green house gas emitters are still holding back.</p> <p>Leading figures have said that the formal submission of NDCs can wait while ministers and officials consider the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. Yet the UK has to urgently show leadership by announcing concrete measures for a green economic recovery.</p> <p>Lord Stern, a climate economist, said: \u201cIt\u2019s more important to set out actions for a green recovery, that is key. We can do that now, bring forward these carbon reductions. Set out policies and then we can see how the NDC can become more ambitious.\u201d</p> <p>The Committee on Climate Change, the UK government\u2019s independent advisers, has delayed until December the publication of its advice on the country\u2019s sixth carbon budget, in order to take account of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">impact of the Covid-19 crisis</a>. Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee, said it would be better for the government to delay the NDC too.</p> <p>Setting out a formal NDC was less urgent than setting out a clear direction for the economic recovery, added Robinson. \u201cI was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/07/mary-robinson-attacks-unhelpful-uk-over-cop-26-climate-talks\"> very close to despair in January</a>,\u201d she said, referring to a flawed start to the UK\u2019s presidency, when the government<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/sacked-cop-26-chair-claire-oneill-berates-boris-johnson-over-climate-record\"> fired its initial choice for Cop president</a>, the former MP Claire O\u2019Neill, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/boris-johnson-promises-urgent-climate-action-after-stinging-criticism\"> failed to produce a clear plan for the summit</a>. \u201cI could not see an ambition [to have a good Cop26]. Now Covid-19 has turned the world upside down. We have to get up momentum for a green and nature-based recovery.\u201d</p> <p>The delay of Cop26 also means that other international meetings can lay the ground for success. The UK holds the 2021 presidency of the G7 group of industrialised nations, whose leaders are likely to meet in the summer when Cop26 will be discussed. Italy, co-host with the UK of Cop26, will chair the G20 with a similar aim.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen sharply amid the lockdowns, by about 17% on average in early April, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">recent study</a>. But that will have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/steep-fall-emissions-during-coronavirus-no-cause-for-celebration\">no measurable effect</a> on efforts to meet the Paris goals, as emissions will<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\"> resume their rise</a> as the lockdowns ease unless lasting changes are made to countries\u2019 energy production and consumption patterns.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UK government said: \u201cAs hosts of Cop26 and the first major economy to legislate for net zero, the UK is committed to delivering a clean and resilient economic recovery from Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThe great global challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss have not gone away and it will be the duty of every responsible government to see our economies are revived and rebuilt in a way that stands the test of time. That\u2019s why&nbsp;we\u2019re calling on&nbsp;all nations&nbsp;to&nbsp;come forward with more ambitious climate plans.\u201d</p>",

The editor at the time \u2013 and one of the judges \u2013 was an up-and-coming journalist and would-be Tory MP called Boris Johnson, who was already setting about making the magazine a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/laughter-lies-boris-johnson-journey-journalist-mp\">byword for Westminster intrigue</a> with his colourful love life and public apologies during an era which saw the magazine dubbed the \u201cSextator\u201d for his and others\u2019 antics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ef3b6cf9b3aa2b9a43be5065de538af49d17a92\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ef3b6cf9b3aa2b9a43be5065de538af49d17a92/0_95_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson as editor of the Spectator in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson as editor of the Spectator in 2003.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The daughter of a baronet, Wakefield grew up at Chillingham Castle \u2013 a large country house deep in the Northumberland countryside, an hour\u2019s drive north of Newcastle. Her father, formerly employed by the auction house Christie\u2019s, took possession of the property in the early 1980s and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/northernengland/722527/Northumberland-Castles-knight-in-shining-armour.html\">painstakingly restored</a> it after it had been derelict for 50 years. The house is so grand that it was used as the set for key scenes in the 1997 film Elizabeth, starring Cate Blanchett.</p> \n<p>After rising quickly up the Spectator\u2019s ranks to become deputy editor, Wakefield has remained a core part of the Spectator team, albeit with a limited public profile. One former colleague praised her editing skills and suggested she had a different political approach to her husband, describing her as a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d who is less involved in aggressive day-to-day politics than the journalistic partners of other leading politicians. \u201cShe isn\u2019t Sarah Vine [wife of Michael Gove, and a Daily Mail columnist] ... she\u2019s just his wife, she loves him, she\u2019s got her own thing, they\u2019re very different,\u201d the former colleague said.</p> \n<p>Wakefield, 45, has so far worked under three editors and stayed on when the current boss, Fraser Nelson, was appointed in 2010, despite herself being viewed as a potential candidate for the top job. \u201cI think in a different world she might have been the first female editor of the Spectator,\u201d said the former colleague.</p> \n<p>Her career as a journalist at a politics-heavy magazine is perhaps ironic, given her husband\u2019s public insistence that he thinks little of the profession and political reporters in particular.</p> \n<p>However, biographies of Cummings often overlook his brief journalism career at the Spectator. In 2006 the future prime ministerial aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/02/newmedia.race\">left his position as the magazine\u2019s online boss after he briefly published a cartoon on the Spectator\u2019s website of the prophet Muhamm</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/02/newmedia.race\">ad with a bomb </a>in his turban, following the lead of a Danish newspaper which had prompted an international row about the limits of free speech.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a wise thing,\u201d said the then acting editor Stuart Reid.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fea0e7f5-409c-4cc2-82aa-6ebdb41aed88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UD-TwHQDDgo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In another sign of the magazine\u2019s role at the centre of a web of political connections, his departure was ultimately overseen by the Spectator chairman, Andrew Neil, who continues to hold the role at the Barclay Brothers-owned magazine in addition to his job as a BBC political interviewer.</p> \n<p>When Cummings was contacted by the Guardian in 2006 to clarify his role at the Spectator and the decision to publish the drawing, he said: \u201cI have zero comment.\u201d Fourteen years later, No 10 gave similar responses on his behalf to requests for comment from Guardian reporters on whether he had travelled to Durham during lockdown in late March.</p> \n<p>Wakefield has so far remained silent on the apparent lockdown breach, other than favouriting a number of supportive tweets suggesting the media were exaggerating the importance of the incident. A spokesperson for the Spectator, which has carried comment pieces arguing that Cummings must be sacked, said: \u201cWe are happy to let our coverage speak for itself.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the unanswered questions about the incident is why Cummings felt the need to check his eyesight by driving to Barnard Castle, rather than ask his wife to take the wheel on the long drive down the A1 back to London. Wakefield herself is known to have driven: the award-winning travel writing piece that helped her get the Spectator job describes her driving across Texas.</p>",

The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/list-grows-of-tory-mps-calling-for-cummings-to-resign\">a total of 61 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him</a> \u2013&nbsp;two of them government whips.

Prof Sheila Bird, a biostatistics expert, said it was \u201cpretty incredible stuff\u201d that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/government-target-of-200000-covid-19-tests-meaningless\">each individual swab from a single individual was reportedly counted as a separate test</a> in thousands of cases. \u201cConsidering the swab of the left nostril and the right nostril of the same person as two tests would be most unfortunate.\u201d Prof John Ashton, a former medical and public&nbsp;health official, said the published statistics were \u201call over the place \u2026&nbsp;We don\u2019t know how many people have been tested.

The environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has&nbsp;advocated&nbsp;that&nbsp;the government use the cover of the coronavirus pandemic to weaken already shaky environmental protection laws.

The suspension of the Social Democratic Liberal party for alleged breaches of party registration laws leaves little in the way of checks on prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who came to power in a coup before winning the 2014 and 2018 elections with his FijiFirst party. Fiji&nbsp;had four coups from 1987 to 2006, largely due to tensions between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendants of colonial era indentured labourers.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Two-Prom strategy \u2013&nbsp;</strong>There will be&nbsp;Prom concerts&nbsp;this summer but not as we know them.

  "<p>No planes in the sky, empty hotels and deserted attractions: with the world at a standstill, tourism has been one of the industries worst-hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">International arrivals this year could be down by 80%</a> compared with 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization, and more than 100 million jobs are under threat.</p> <p>But as destinations slowly start to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/18/europe-holidays-which-european-countries-are-easing-coronavirus-travel-restrictions-lockdown-measures\">emerge from lockdown and borders tentatively reopen</a>, many in the sector are wondering if this is a chance for tourism to rebuild in a greener, more sustainable way.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s completely devastating \u2013 but it\u2019s also provided a much-needed chance for introspection,\u201d said Sam Bruce of Much Better Adventures, who is a co-founder of campaigning group <a href=\"https://www.tourismdeclares.com/\">Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency</a>. \u201cThings needed to change. It\u2019s an opportunity for everyone from tourist boards to tour operators to reset and to look at how things can be better \u2013 for the planet, for local communities and for travellers.\u201d</p> <p>In Venice \u2013 one of the most overtouristed cities, with an estimated 25 million foreign visitors a year \u2013 officials are using the pause to rethink \u201can entire Venice system\u201d, with sustainability and quality tourism at its core, said Paola Mar, the city\u2019s councillor for tourism. Part of the plan is to lure locals back to live permanently in the city. The mayor is in discussions with universities, aiming to offer tourist rentals to students, and old buildings are being restored for social housing. Measures to control visitor numbers \u2013 including a tax on day trippers, which was due to be introduced in July \u2013 will go ahead next year, while the debate around cruise ships continues.</p> <p>\u201cOur goal is to trigger a renaissance of the city,\u201d said Mar. \u201cWe want to attract visitors for longer stays and encourage a \u2018slower\u2019 type of tourism. Things can\u2019t go back to how they were.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"609c0d03a9531d95d4155eefc01e9248ff3c6e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/609c0d03a9531d95d4155eefc01e9248ff3c6e5c/0_82_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign in Amsterdam\u2019s Leidseplein counting the days until bar terraces are allowed to reopen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign in Amsterdam\u2019s Leidseplein counting the days until bar terraces are allowed to reopen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remko de Waal/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>City authorities in Amsterdam \u2013 which was struggling to cope with an estimated 18.3 million overnight tourist stays in 2019 \u2013 are also quietly hopeful that the pandemic will be a catalyst for change. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/22/amsterdam-mayor-urges-extreme-caution-over-return-of-tourism-to-the-city-covid-19\">the mayor urged extreme caution in reopening to tourists</a>, while nonprofit group <a href=\"https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/our-network/amsterdam-and-partners\">Amsterdam&amp;Partners</a> believes the tourist hiatus pushes to the top of the agenda plans to cut numbers, give Amsterdam back to locals and attract the \u201cright\u201d kind of visitor, and has launched a sustainability taskforce to map the way forward.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working with partners to discuss how we can restart in a more sustainable and responsible way,\u201d said Amsterdam&amp;Partners spokeswoman Heleen Jansen. \u201cThe main focus is that we want a sustainable visitor economy that doesn\u2019t harm the livability of our city. If you have the right balance between living, working and visiting, you can have the right visitor economy. That\u2019s what went wrong in the last years in the old city centre, and we have to entice locals to discover their city centre again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on environment and communities, and  make more considered choices</p> <footer> <cite>James Thornton, Intrepid Travel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the suddenly empty streets of Barcelona have made local businesses and the tourist board re-evaluate their priorities too. \u201cWhile we couldn\u2019t continue at the speed things were, this is showing us that no tourists is no good either \u2013 there needs to be a more moderate way,\u201d said Mateo Asensioof the Barcelona tourist board. \u201cOur first task is getting locals back out into the city, then the domestic market and our neighbours. When the international market returns, we\u2019ll focus more on specific sectors. It\u2019s an opportunity to change the rules.\u201d</p> <p>With the world\u2019s \u201cnew normal\u201d including social distancing, an increased fear of crowds and busy places \u2013 and the future of airlines in the balance \u2013 over-tourism may not be a pressing issue for some time.</p> <p>Other changes in cities around the world include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/cleaner-and-greener-covid-19-prompts-worlds-cities-to-free-public-space-of-cars\"> reshaping in favour of cyclists and pedestrians</a>: Athens is accelerating plans for a car-free historic centre, Berlin is introducing 14 miles of new bike lanes, and Paris is also significantly increasing its bike lanes, to ease potential overcrowding.</p> <p>Destinations likely to see the first surge in visitor numbers are remote coastal and rural areas, places seen as \u201csafe\u201d, said Patricia Yates, acting CEO of Visit Britain/Visit England. It will be longer before cities bounce back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0912867e74edef6f1a277e726247d2f26ba1ee8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0912867e74edef6f1a277e726247d2f26ba1ee8c/0_133_5106_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coast path near Langland beach, Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quieter coastal areas, such as the Gower in Wales, will see the first rise, says Visit Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Rees/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur weekly consumer sentiment surveys show that the domestic market is very nervous \u2013 so we will be focusing initially on reassurance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut beyond that we will be looking at promoting areas outside the honeypots. What is needed is destination management to rebuild tourism more slowly and keep residents, visitors and businesses that depend on tourists happy \u2013 it\u2019s quite a balancing act.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the progress made on sustainable tourism is likely to go into reverse at first, she added \u2013 with people eschewing public transport in favour of car travel and infection control measures leading to more single-use plastic.</p> <p>Many tour operators, however, believe the pandemic could engender a positive change in client behaviour. Intrepid Travel CEO James Thornton said: \u201cDuring this hibernation period we\u2019ve seen the benefit to nature and the climate \u2013 fish spotted in Venice\u2019s clearer canal water, the Himalayas visible in India \u2013 and people have had time to reflect. I think customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on the environment and the communities they visit, and make more considered choices.\u201d</p> <p>A renewed focus on slower travel, including train journeys and cycling, as well as keeping experiences as local as possible and offering more off-season departures are part of Intrepid\u2019s post-Covid plans, with wilderness and wellness trips tipped to be of most interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeb8a7c05f1b9ae86fabbe4b9c9a21ae46c12412\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb8a7c05f1b9ae86fabbe4b9c9a21ae46c12412/0_0_4287_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bikes on the Runkerry Trail near Bushmills, Northern Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Runkerry Trail in Northern Ireland: slower travel could include more trains and bikes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Lyons/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Launching new adventures in even more remote destinations to assist with economic recovery is on the agenda for Much Better Adventures when tourism opens up again. \u201cThe crisis has shown just how much communities in less-developed parts of the world rely on tourism,\u201d said Sam Bruce. \u201cWe will look to spread tourism to areas that would genuinely benefit. But it has to be done in the right way. We risk a flood to remote places that aren\u2019t prepared and could be taken advantage of.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that a new, slower tourism will emerge \u2013 but the recovery needs to be slow enough for the industry to make the right decisions as it rises from the ashes.\u201d</p> <p>G Adventures founder Bruce Poon Tip \u2013 who has just published Unlearn: The Year the Earth Stood Still,<em> </em>an e-book looking at the impact of the pandemic on tourism \u2013 believes the industry can emerge as a stronger force for good.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will travel again. We don\u2019t yet know when, but we know that they will. I want to challenge everyone who travels to \u2018unlearn\u2019 what they think they know. We have the opportunity to use this reset to be more conscious about how we can improve, as individuals and as a wider travel community.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest issue in the move to a more sustainable tourist industry, though, is air travel \u2013 aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon emissions in 2019 and was one of the fastest-growing polluters<strong>.</strong> With airlines grounded, emissions from aviation declined by about 60% in early April compared with 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">according to the journal Nature Climate Change</a>.</p> <p>With the pause likely to be temporary, campaigners from Greenpeace to Flight Free are demanding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/is-covid-19-crisis-the-catalyst-for-the-greening-of-worlds-airlines\">airline bailouts </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/is-covid-19-crisis-the-catalyst-for-the-greening-of-worlds-airlines\">come with strict conditions</a> on their future climate impact and say Covid should be the catalyst for greening the world\u2019s airlines.</p> <p>But in a race for economic recovery, rebuilding the industry quickly could sideline climate change and aviation issues, said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, who is calling for a \u201cgreen flying duty\u201d, with more regulation and tax revenues invested in renewable fuels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3609d5c642c48832cb03ec10951e0c35809d435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3609d5c642c48832cb03ec10951e0c35809d435/0_12_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queues at the Ryanair desk at Stansted Airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queues at Stansted Airport: many people were \u2018hooked on short breaks\u2019, says Responsible Travel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cost of flights is likely to rise in the long term, he added. \u201cShort term, the where and how we travel has had to change. But new, more entrenched, norms could form from that. Many people were hooked on frequent short breaks, but key to more sustainable tourism is taking far fewer flights \u2013 we may now see a return to longer, less frequent holidays, with more time spent getting to know a place, and a rise in slower forms of travel.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens, it\u2019s unlikely travel will ever be the same as in pre-Covid days. An industry known for its resilience will find a new way forward, adapting to an unknown global market, but whether sustainability can be at the heart of a new model of tourism is hard to predict.</p> <p>\u201cTourism will be smaller, and so more sustainable per se. Fewer flights means less C02, fewer guests means less waste, and there will be much more focus on localism, at least initially,\u201d said Graham Miller, professor of sustainability in business at the University of Surrey.</p> <p>\u201cHow the nature of the product changes, however, remains to be seen. There are huge vested interests to contend with \u2013 like the cruise industry in Venice and big businesses \u2013 but it feels like the moment we have been waiting for. If we are going to redesign tourism, this is about the best chance we can wish for.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Known global cases near 5.7m</strong></h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 5,693,066 people are known to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/global-report-trump-silent-on-us-death-toll-as-south-korea-sees-new-covid-19-rise\">contracted the virus since the pandemic began</a>, while at least 355,653 people are known to have died. The true death toll and number of cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</p> <h2><strong>US deaths pass 100,000</strong></h2> <p>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths</a> from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea could face return to coronavirus restrictions</strong></h2> <p>South Korea&nbsp;has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/south-korea-faces-return-to-coronavirus-restrictions-after-spike-in-new-cases\">triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures</a> after appearing to have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/south-korea-first-steps-post-covid-world\">brought the outbreak under control</a>.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million.</p> <h2><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America</strong></h2> <p>The UN World Food Program is warning that at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. New projections released late on Wednesday estimate a startling four-fold increase in severe food insecurity.</p> <h2><strong>European investment slashed</strong></h2> <p>Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found. Some 65% of the 6,412 projects in question are already in place or continuing \u201calbeit with downgraded capacity and recruitment\u201d, EY said. A further 25% were delayed and 10 percent cancelled, its Europe Attractiveness survey found.</p> <h2><strong>Ireland faces record recession: think tank</strong></h2> <p>Ireland is facing its deepest ever recession as the coronavirus lockdown devastates jobs and strains the public finances, a think tank said Thursday. A report by Ireland\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute predicts the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will decline 12.4% this year. That was the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario under a government plan to lift the lockdown in August but with the economy struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels owing to physical distancing measures, ESRI said.</p> <h2>Tory anger at Dominic Cummings builds</h2> <p>61 Conservative MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\">defied British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d&nbsp;from the Dominic Cummings crisis</a> as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown.

Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips.</p> <h2>Hydroxychloroquine study raises concerns</h2> <p>Questions have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/28/questions-raised-over-hydroxychloroquine-study-which-caused-who-to-halt-trials-for-covid-19\">raised about a study published in the Lancet</a> that prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine.

For at least 15 years, Thomas lived in a retirement community in West Philadelphia, where he was tenant council president.

Powerback is run by a national holding company, Genesis, which, as a nursing home chain, operates 400 facilities in 26 states nationwide and provides rehabilitation therapy in another 1,400 locations. Genesis has settled numerous multimillion-dollar lawsuits for financial and care violations. When the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services changed national reimbursement rules last fall, lowering compensation for therapy, the for-profit company promptly laid off 585 of its staff therapists.</p> <p>While Thomas was at Powerback, he met Michael Johnson, a member of the national long-term care ombudsman program. Ombudsmen like Johnson oversee facilities and are the primary contact for residents who experience poor care, neglect, or abuse. Johnson said Thomas was well-liked among the staff and residents at Powerback, but that the facility was not delivering the rehabilitation and recovery it had promised. The Friend family hoped the skilled care would allow Thomas to return to his baseline level of health, before he got sick, and return home. But, Rafiyq and Johnson told me, the rehab never happened. Rafiyq would find Thomas in a chair in the hallway with a blanket over his head when he visited. Thomas went back to the hospital with pneumonia, his physical and mental health deteriorating before his family\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK if you say to the family: \u2018Your hopes and dreams of him getting back to walking and talking and living on his own are not realistic,\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut the facility wasn\u2019t saying that. They weren\u2019t doing anything, really.\u201d</p> <p>Then Thomas was told that he no longer had a payer \u2013 his Medicare, which had to that point fully covered his stay at Powerback, had run out. The family had no pot of gold to pay the facility on their own \u2013 which could run anywhere from $300 to $500 a day \u2013 and no one able to take Thomas into their home full-time, which would have required paying for skilled home care out of pocket. Their only choice was to apply for Medicaid and hope that Powerback or another facility would accept it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/example-4-2-zip/giv-3902hlkgppUJmdUY/example%20(4)/index.html\" data-alt=\"Map or Thomas Friend's care facilities\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/example-4-2-zip/giv-3902hlkgppUJmdUY/example%20(4)/index.html\">Map or Thomas Friend's care facilities</a> <figcaption>A map of Philadelphia, PA</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Powerback never informed the Friends of what their decision was.

Rafiyq and his family began to look at other facilities. Johnson suggested to both parties that Powerback help Thomas apply for Medicaid, but Powerback said it had no Medicaid beds. Which was not true, Johnson found out by calling the Pennsylvania department of health. All its beds were dual beds, designated for both Medicare and Medicaid patients.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/us-health-insurance-layoffs-coronavirus\">Up to 43m Americans could lose health insurance amid pandemic, report says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But like so many care facilities, Powerback organized patients by reimbursement levels. They kept higher-paying Medicare recipients on one floor where \u201cskilled nursing\u201d services were available; they kept lower-paying Medicaid, or \u201clong-term\u201d recipients, on another. In this way, the facility made a clear distinction between the two rates of state and federal reimbursement. Medicare was the most lucrative; there was a hurry to get Medicaid patients out of the facility to free up more beds for Medicare residents. The facility maintained its own quotas of resident types in order to maximize profits. According to law, there are five reasons a resident can be evicted, including disturbing other residents or failure to pay. Any of these reasons are routinely used to evict unwanted residents.</p> <p>Johnson convinced Powerback\u2019s social worker to agree to work with Rafiyq to apply for Medicaid (which is up to three months retroactive). But while the paperwork was still being completed, Powerback checked Thomas into Jefferson hospital, where he stayed for several days. \u201cThey tried to make plans with Powerback to transfer him back, but Powerback was like, \u2018No, we\u2019re not taking him back,\u2019\u201d Johnson said.</p> <p>This is a common nursing home practice referred to as \u201chospital dumping\u201d.

County homes, once called poorhouses, were also available to elders who had nowhere else to go. But it wasn\u2019t until 1965, with the passage of the Older Americans Act and the advent of Medicare and Medicaid, reimbursed at both the federal and state levels, that nursing home care became a profitable industry. Non-profit, often family-run, facilities popped up all across the country in the 1970s. Increasingly, in recent decades, large for-profit operators like Genesis have moved in, which \u2013 as with so many other business categories \u2013 has caused consolidation, remote management, and the quick-fire flipping of properties.</p> <p>Federal and state governments have largely been silent on the corporatization of nursing and long-term care facilities (in Pennsylvania, the department of health approves sales of nursing homes). Last year, Pennsylvania\u2019s two US senators <a href=\"https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SFF%20List%20with%20Cover%20Letter%20051419%20-%20Casey.pdf\">released national data</a> on the Special Focus Facility Program \u2013 about 400 facilities reported by residents, families and inspectors as troubled.

She is also one of a handful of ombudsmen in Philadelphia. \u201cUsually, the cause for rehab is an accident of some sort, a fall, surgery like a knee or hip replacement. People are coming into the system in panic mode.\u201d</p> <p>Some facilities have made knee and hip replacement their specialty \u2013 a niche practice that allows them to focus on Medicare-reimbursed rehab residents and deters Medicaid recipients from seeking admissions. The problem for residents occurs when they are ready to go home.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is a good discharge plan with services in place at home,\u201d Diane Menio, the executive director of Carie, said, \u201cthen the likelihood of their being readmitted to the hospital is reduced. The problem is that the responsibility [for a discharge plan] falls squarely on the nursing home.\u201d Which means they don\u2019t always happen. So when a resident is served with a discharge notice, they are already panicked, they may not have advocates, and the very people they must appeal to for their rights are the ones providing their physical care.</p> <p>The discharge notice includes a list of residents\u2019 rights and contact information for the local ombudsman. Residents can appeal the eviction and apply for Medicaid, but the process is complex. \u201cIt is not set up for laypeople,\u201d Menio said.</p> <p>In their many years as advocates and ombudsmen,<strong> </strong>Menio and Walsh have accumulated harrowing stories, many involving residents released to homeless shelters or hotel rooms.<strong> </strong>The best advice Menio and Walsh have for residents who are facing eviction is to stay in your bed, then call your ombudsmen.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>\u201cThe whole system is set up so</strong> that even the reasonably good people end up behaving in non-optimal ways,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThey\u2019re short staffing, they\u2019re not providing rehab, they\u2019re treating the Medicaid people like trash.\u201d</p> <p>Change won\u2019t come soon enough.

Three days before Breach was murdered, Quintana\u2019s father had been killed in a confrontation between rival gangs.</p> <p>Breach worked for la Jornada and for the regional paper Norte de Ciudad Juarez, covering politics and crime; she had also set up her own news agency, Mir. She had reported extensively on the links between organised crime and politicians in Chihuahua state. On 4 March 2016, Breach wrote in la Jornada about the alleged criminal connections of mayoral candidates in several small towns in western Chihuahua. Breach had received threats to her life on at least three occasions as a result of her reporting.

Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Attacks on journalists around the world take many forms, some of which are sanctioned in law. Legal or quasi-legal mechanisms include the use of civil or criminal legal actions, covert surveillance, overt censorship and financial threats (such as withdrawing state advertising), as well as more direct intimidation and threats.</p> <p>In recent years, another way of silencing journalists has proliferated: the use of what are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/help-record-rise-of-slapp-lawsuits-aiming-to-silence-journalists-comment/\" title=\"\">Slapps</a>, where defamation or criminal lawsuits are brought with the intention of shutting down forms of expression such as peaceful protest or writing blogs. Originally regarded as an American legal mechanism, such lawsuits are now fairly widespread in Europe. Before she was killed in 2017, the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was facing around 40 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/malta-urged-to-drop-libel-lawsuits-against-daphne-caruana-galizia\" title=\"\">libel lawsuits</a> filed by companies, government officials and individuals, which were described by her son Matthew as a \u201cnever-ending type of torture\u201d.</p> <p>V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the vice-president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has been working on introducing protections against Slapp lawsuits, the defence of which can cost individuals a fortune and tie up their time and resources. Justin Borg-Barthet, a legal academic at Aberdeen University, has called for EU law to be changed to prevent \u201cforum shopping\u201d to countries with claimant-friendly laws, so that defamation suits would have to be filed in the courts of the country where the media organisation or journalist was based. Slapp lawsuits are commonly used against journalists investigating government corruption or exposing corporate abuses, but are also used against civil society organisations, activists such as environmental campaigners, trade unionists and academics, to shut down or silence acts of criticism and protest.</p> <p>In France, media organisations and NGOs <a href=\"https://actionaid.org/stories/2019/slapp-face-accountability\" title=\"\">have been hit</a> with what they view as Slapp suits for publishing accusations of land-grabbing from villagers and farmers in Cameroon by companies associated with the Bollor\u00e9 Group.

These injunctions had a chilling effect on the right to protest and free speech, until the court of appeal <a href=\"https://drillordrop.com/2019/04/03/breaking-anti-fracking-campaigners-win-appeal-against-ineos-protest-injunction/\" title=\"\">ruled in April 2019</a> that parts of an Ineos injunction prohibiting protests on the public highway and against the Ineos supply chain, and which had been used as a template for similar orders granted to other oil and gas companies, were unlawful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside Slapp suits, there are more traditional ways to keep journalists quiet. More than 150 countries retain some sort of criminal defamation laws, many of which include the possibility of imprisonment. Blasphemy and insult laws remain commonplace in many countries, and are often used by politicians and government officials against any critical media. A number of countries including Turkey and Egypt have expansive definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d that allow them to arrest and detain anyone who voices political dissent or opposition, including journalists.</p> <p>In countries such as Hungary and Poland, governments and political allies exercise quasi-legal control of public information. Media owners can be pressured on what content to publish by threats to limit access to finance and advertising revenues.</p> <p>Separately, the lack of legal protections for journalists against those who attack them acts as a strong deterrent. Impunity fuels a vicious cycle of violence, bolstering those who aim to silence public debate and block sensitive information.</p> <p>In 2013, the UN published a <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/un-plan-action-safety-journalists\" title=\"\">plan of action</a> on the safety of journalists, and the problem of impunity for perpetrators. The plan provides a framework for co-operation between UN bodies, national authorities, media actors and NGOs. Spearheaded through Unesco, the plan was incorporated into the Declaration of the Council of Europe in April 2014, and in guidelines published by the EU soon after. In April 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors.</p> <p>By the end of 2018, the Council of Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/the-platform\" title=\"\">Platform for the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists</a>, set up to record information on serious concerns about media freedom and the safety of journalists in Council of Europe (CoE) member states, had registered more than 500 <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/all-alerts\" title=\"\">alerts</a>, with year-on-year rises of incidents in every year except 2017. Nearly half of all alerts are marked as category 1, covering the most severe and damaging violations of media freedom, such as murder, direct threats to life and physical assaults. The majority of threats came from the state, with physical attacks and detentions making up nearly half the alerts. Since 2015, only 11% of all alerts have been marked as resolved, a figure that goes down to 1.82% for alerts entered in 2018. Interviews with journalists echo these statistics. In 2017, a study that interviewed 940 journalists from all CoE member states found that a staggering 40% of them had suffered slander.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/background-paper-safety-of-journalists-and-other-media-actorsfinal/168094b396\" title=\"\">May 2020 report</a> by Peter Noorlander on the implementation of the 2016 CoE recommendation, attacks against journalists remain insufficiently investigated, and a very high percentage of incidents go unpunished. \u201cJournalists have little confidence that attacks or threats against them will be investigated, and often do not report them,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has a grave effect on them, and many no longer report attacks but instead self-censor and shy away from potentially controversial issues \u2026 [CoE] Member States have committed to creating an enabling environment for freedom of expression, yet, what journalists experience on the ground is increased violence, threats, denigration, arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Some of the most high-profile cases of attacks against the media in the last few years have involved journalists in countries where neither democracy nor the rule of law is respected.

Rappler has also reported critically on extrajudicial killings, human-rights violations and the rising death rates from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-catholic-church\" title=\"\">Duterte\u2019s war on drugs</a>. The law suits that would follow were presaged during Duterte\u2019s state of the union speech in July 2017, when he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>In January 2018, the Philippine securities and exchange commission revoked Rappler\u2019s licence. The government then investigated Rappler for tax evasion, and a warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018. In February 2019, Ressa and Rappler were hit with another lawsuit alleging libel relating to a story published in 2012, using a law enacted four months after the story was published.</p> <p>Other infamous cases of state-sponsored crimes against journalists include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/23/jamal-khashoggi-timeline-of-key-events\" title=\"\">the brutal murder</a>, on 2 October 2018, of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.

It was just a ghastly feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Thames Valley police had secretly recorded a conversation that took place between her and a police officer. Murrer was accused of receiving sensitive stories from the police officer and selling them to the News of the World. \u201cThe stories were about a local GBH committed by a footballer, and the murder of a local man where there was a link to cannabis and his wife was the secretary of the then-MP.\u201d After 19 months, during which she had been on police bail, Murrer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/28/pressandpublishing-medialaw\" title=\"\">trial collapsed</a> after the judge ruled police had breached her rights.</p> <p>More recently, in August 2018, the police in Northern Ireland arrested two journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, over the alleged theft of documents from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/22/investigating-the-loughinisland-murders\" title=\"\">Loughinisland massacre</a>, when members of a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, burst into a pub with assault rifles and fired on the customers.

The raid on the home of the News Corporation journalist was in response to a story she had written about how the Australian Signals Directorate was seeking new powers to spy on Australian citizens. In February, a court ruled the search was legitimate as the police were investigating valid national security offences. ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, described the decision as \u201ca blow for public interest journalism\u201d and argued that it highlighted a \u201cserious problem\u201d with Australia\u2019s national security laws.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since the outbreak of coronavirus, protections for journalists have become <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52363305\" title=\"\">more urgent than ever.</a> According to RSF\u2019s secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth China and Iran censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively.

  "<p>In early 1976 Gary Green, aged 22 and not long out of college, was living with his parents in the suburbs of Long Island. On weekends he would travel into Manhattan to watch shows by the likes of glam-rock veterans the New York Dolls and aspiring punk poet Patti Smith. That summer, he rented an apartment in the West Village and began working as an assistant to a commercial photographer, a job that allowed him to \u201cgo out every night and take photographs\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"afa318f7740d37b233434dae3c2ce7bd6dabb7a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afa318f7740d37b233434dae3c2ce7bd6dabb7a9/0_0_2400_3730/643.jpg\" alt=\"Patti Smith and Ivan Karl in 1976\" width=\"643\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poet \u2026 Patti Smith and Ivan Kr\u00e1l in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That April, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/02/forty-years-of-the-ramones-they-were-the-smartest-dumb-band-you-ever-heard\">Ramones</a> released their eponymous debut album, the first signal of the seismic shift in pop culture that was punk. Green was a clued-up music fan with a camera in the right place at exactly the right time. He began shooting in venues like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/11/cbgbs-rocks-backpages\">CBGB </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/11/cbgbs-rocks-backpages\">on</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/11/cbgbs-rocks-backpages\"> the Bowery</a>, where a scene was coalescing around groups such as the Ramones, Television, Blondie and Talking Heads. Green took his photos to the music paper New York Rocker, he says. \u201cThe editor, Alan Betrock, gave me my first assignment, which was to photograph this young rockabilly-obsessed singer, Robert Gordon. It all started from there.\u201d</p> <p>It has taken 44 years for Green\u2019s monochrome photographs of New York\u2019s punk and post-punk scene to see the light of day with the publication of <a href=\"https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/products/when-midnight\">When Midnight Comes Around</a>. It is a book filled with familiar faces \u2013 Smith, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/17/guardianobituaries.adamsweeting\">Joey Ramone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/26/richard-hell-destiny-street-repaired\">Richard Hell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/03/johnny-thunders-arms-memory\">Johnny Thunders</a> \u2013 and now legendary and long-gone places such as CBGB, Max\u2019s Kansas City and the Bottom Line. What sets it apart is the sense that Green was both an insider \u2013 for a time, he shared an apartment with Sylvain Sylvain of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/14/popandrock.shopping8\">New York Dolls</a> \u2013 and an acute social observer who understood that he was witnessing an important pop-cultural moment driven by outsiders and misfits.</p> <p>His photographs of the soon-to-be-famous are punctuated by portraits of anonymous individuals who caught his eye with their style or attitude. The result is a democratic portrait of an emerging New York punk scene that looks both distant and timeless.</p> <p>\u201cI thought what I was doing was a kind of social documentary. I had seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/diane-arbus\">Diane Arbus</a>\u2019s work and would later take a class with Lisette Model, who had taught Arbus. I think this accounts for my straight-on approach, but also my desire to shoot people who weren\u2019t famous,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, I was never a fan of live photography. I preferred to turn away from the stage and look at what was going on around me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36e1c4192890dc0be5b0fef828b44c4fbb819a9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e1c4192890dc0be5b0fef828b44c4fbb819a9a/0_0_2400_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Setting the scene \u2026 sleazy streets around Times Square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Setting the scene \u2026 sleazy streets around Times Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Lower East Side is trendy now, but back then \u2026 even the little kids there were tough and threatening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book opens with two scene-setting shots: a pair of bohemian-looking women selling secondhand clothes on a sidewalk in Manhattan\u2019s East Village and a ground-level view of the sleazy porn cinemas that once dotted the streets on Times Square. This is another New York, grittier and edgy, a city close to financial bankruptcy. Its more neglected neighbourhoods, where rents were low and crime rates high, drew artists and musicians attuned to an emerging punk aesthetic that fed off and was energised by the surrounding seediness. \u201cThe lower East Side is trendy now, but back then I didn\u2019t go there unless I really had to. Even the little kids there were tough and threatening.\u201d</p> <p>Green\u2019s early photographs from 1976/77 evoke the ad-hoc atmosphere of what was then a small, evolving downtown scene, just as his later ones reflect the shift towards a more self-consciously stylish milieu as punk mutated into post-punk, the music becoming more arty and angular. Alongside New York scenesters such as Anya Phillips, co-founder of the Mudd Club, Green also snapped a young, dapper Tom Waits, a lonesome-looking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/02/alex-chilton-big-star-biography-rocks-backpages-melody-maker\">Alex Chilton</a> in CBGB, and Lou Reed with Andy Warhol at an early solo show by erstwhile New York Doll David Johansen at the Bottom Line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3540a5f8fcf80a5340f17eb0f2309afb5ffdaac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3540a5f8fcf80a5340f17eb0f2309afb5ffdaac3/0_0_2031_1505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Johansen, Lou Reed and Andy Warhol, backstage at the Bottom Line in the 1970s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanging out \u2026 David Johansen, Lou Reed and Andy Warhol, backstage at the Bottom Line in the 1970s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople were there in those clubs to be noticed,\u201d he says, \u201cso it was never that difficult to get access.

  "<p>Two studies have raised further alarm about deforestation in Brazil during the first year of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government.</p> <p>One study showed the country lost 12,000 km<sup>2</sup> (4,633 sq miles) of forest last year and also provided important information about those behind deforestation.

  "<p>We all now know the basics \u2013 the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to.&nbsp;If it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially.&nbsp;If it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/uk-coronavirus-r-number-stays-the-same-for-two-weeks-in-a-row\">less than 1.0</a> it will eventually disappear.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions; and the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/\">effective R</a>\u201d or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We calculate the R in several ways.&nbsp;What it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths.&nbsp;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time; but these take a week or two to process and report.&nbsp;Thus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s science committee, Sage, estimates that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-publishes-latest-r-number\">R value for the UK</a> was between 0.7 and 1.0 on 22 May. This is an average value across the nation, and there is substantial regional variation \u2013 Re may be twice as high in the north-east than in London, the original centre of the UK\u2019s epidemic.&nbsp;The R value varies across individuals, with \u201csuper-spreading\u201d events being associated with a high proportion of the infections, and many people, perhaps most, not passing the infection on to anyone.&nbsp;Infectious <a href=\"https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67\">disease modelling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20104521v1\">virus sequencing data</a> suggest that, early in the epidemic, 10% or less of virus carriers led to about 80% of infections.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The amount of virus each individual&nbsp;carries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others \u2013 at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services \u2013 is important too.&nbsp;Thus, one man may have infected more than 90 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/south-korea-struggles-to-contain-new-outbreak-amid-anti-lgbt-backlash\">clubgoers in South Korea</a>, and one member of a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm\">choir in Washington State</a> may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal.</p> \n<p>Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at <a href=\"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/05/r-nought\">4.0 or more</a>.&nbsp;This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0.&nbsp;The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not <a href=\"https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19estimates/#/details/United_Kingdom\">drop precipitously</a> until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.&nbsp;The epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards.&nbsp;To decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 \u2013 and no one thinks it has declined to that level.&nbsp;As Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: \u201cA fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

close to 1.0 there are basically two options.&nbsp;First, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people \u2013 bringing Re down further \u2013 so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It became clear from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-advice-coronavirus-spread-work\">prime </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-advice-coronavirus-spread-work\">minister\u2019s announcement on 10 May</a> on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus \u2013 guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus.&nbsp;As a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious.</p> \n<p>Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the \u201cback to work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/24/pm-accepts-some-english-primary-schools-may-not-return-on-1-june\">and school</a>\u201d decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place.&nbsp;Indoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly.&nbsp;On trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting.&nbsp;And the <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/time-to-encourage-people-to-wear-face-masks-as-a-precaution-say-experts/\">use of face coverings</a> should be the new normal \u2013 including at government press briefings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\"

epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine.&nbsp;Perhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on.&nbsp;But when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is massively stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life.

  "<p>Questions have been raised by Australian infectious disease researchers about a study published in the Lancet which prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext?utm_source=AusSMC+mailing+list&amp;utm_campaign=a5c0a299a0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_26_03_00&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_90d9431cd5-a5c0a299a0-126967137\">study published on Friday</a> found Covid-19 patients who received the malaria drug were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients. The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug.</p> <p>The findings prompted researchers from around the world to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/australian-hydroxychloroquine-trial-under-review-world-health-organization-concern-over-safety\">reassess their own clinical trials of the drug for preventing and treating Covid-19</a>.

It was once viewed as among the most promising medicines to treat the virus, though no study to date has found this to be the case, and the drug can have toxic side-effects. The Australian Department of Health had been stockpiling millions of doses of the drug in case clinical trials found it proved useful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/australian-hydroxychloroquine-trial-under-review-world-health-organization-concern-over-safety\">Australian hydroxychloroquine trial to treat Covid-19 under review after WHO safety concern</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study, led by the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital Center for Advanced Heart Disease in Boston, examined patients in hospitals around the world, including in Australia. It said researchers gained access to data from five hospitals recording 600 Australian Covid-19 patients and 73 Australian deaths as of 21 April.</p> <p>But data from Johns Hopkins University shows only 67 deaths from Covid-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April. The data relied upon by researchers to draw their conclusions in the Lancet is not readily available in Australian clinical databases, leading many to ask where it came from.</p> <p>The federal health department confirmed to Guardian Australia that the data collected on notifications of Covid-19 in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System was not the source for informing the trial.</p> <p>Guardian Australia also contacted the health departments of Australia\u2019s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, which have had by far the largest number of Covid-19 infections between them. Of the Australian deaths reported by 21 April, 14 were in Victoria and 26 in NSW.</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s department confirmed the study\u2019s results relating to the Australian data did not reconcile with the state\u2019s coronavirus data, including hospital admissions and deaths. The NSW Department of Health also confirmed it did not provide the researchers with the data for its databases.</p> <p>The Lancet told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe have asked the authors for clarifications, we know that they are investigating urgently, and we await their reply.\u201d&nbsp;The lead author of the study, &nbsp;Dr Mandeep Mehra, said he had contacted Surgisphere, the company that provided the data, to reconcile the discrepancies with \u201cthe utmost urgency\u201d.&nbsp;Surgisphere is described as a healthcare data analytics and medical education company.</p> <p>In a statement, Surgisphere founder Dr Sapan Desai, also an author on the Lancet paper, said a hospital from Asia had accidentally been included in the Australian data.</p> <p>\u201cWe have reviewed our Surgisphere database and discovered that a new hospital that joined the registry on April 1, and self-designated as belonging to the Australasia continental designation,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIn reviewing the data from each of the hospitals in the registry, we noted that this hospital had a nearly 100% composition of Asian race and a relatively high use of chloroquine compared to non-use in Australia. This hospital should have more appropriately been assigned to the Asian continental designation.\u201d</p> <p>He said the error did not change the overall study findings. It did mean that the Australian data in the paper would be revised to four hospitals and 63 deaths,.</p> <p>Dr Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor with Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the Australian hospitals involved in the study should be named. He said he had never heard of Surgisphere, and no one from his hospital, The Alfred, had provided Surgisphere with data.</p> <p>\u201cUsually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database,\u201d he said. He said the dataset should be made public, or at least open to an independent statistical reviewer.</p> <p>\u201cIf they got this wrong, what else could be wrong?\u201d Cheng said. It was also a \u201cred flag\u201d to him that the paper listed only four authors.</p> <p>\u201cUsually with studies that report on findings from thousands of patients, you would see a large list of authors on the paper,\u201d he said. \u201cMultiple sources are needed to collect and analyse the data for large studies and you usually see that acknowledged in the list of authors.\u201d</p> <p>He stressed that even if the paper proved to be problematic, it did not mean hydroxychloroquine was safe or effective in treating Covid-19. No strong studies to date have shown the drug is effective. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have potentially severe and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/australian-doctors-warned-off-after-prescribing-potentially-deadly-covid-19-trial-drug-to-themselves\">even deadly side effects if used inappropriately</a>, including heart failure and toxicity.

Our data use agreements do not allow us to make this data public.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists have reiterated the need to wait for the results from rigorous randomised control trials, considered the gold standard of science, and the Australian Department of Health has warned the drug should not be given to patients other than in clinical trials.</p> <p>Cheng said it would be a mistake to stop strong, well-designed clinical trials examining the drug because of questionable data. The Lancet study findings have prompted the leaders of an Australian hydroxychloroquine trial, known as the Ascot trial, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/australian-hydroxychloroquine-trial-under-review-world-health-organization-concern-over-safety\">to review the future of their study</a>. The outcome of that review has not yet been announced.</p> <p>The Ascot study has been recruiting patients in more than 70 hospitals in every Australian state and territory, and 11 hospitals in New Zealand. The randomised control trial is exploring whether hydroxychloroquine in combination or on its own can treat Covid-19 patients and prevent deterioration in their condition. The leader of the trial, Prof Josh Davis, has written to the Lancet study authors asking for an explanation of the data.</p> <p>In the meantime, patient recruitment for the study had been put on hold, an Ascot spokeswoman said. \u201cFollowing an&nbsp;observational study published in&nbsp;the Lancet&nbsp;Ascot has paused patient recruitment pending deliberations by the governance and ethics committees overseeing the trial,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect these deliberations to occur rapidly and will provide further information as they arise.\u201d</p> <p>Questions about <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/05/25/hydroxychloroquine-update/\">the paper\u2019s statistical modelling </a>have also come from other universities, including Columbia University in the US, prompting Surgisphere to <a href=\"https://surgisphere.com/2020/05/25/lancet-paper/\">issue a public statement</a>.</p> <p>Last month Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/australias-chief-scientist-warns-against-claims-of-breakthroughs-on-coronavirus-cures\"> urged the public to be cautious about findings and interpretations from studies in the race to find cures and treatments for Covid-19</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/22/science.abc1731\">Serious concerns have being raised</a> by bioethicists, clinicians and scientists that scientific rigour and peer review is falling by the wayside in the race to understand how the virus spreads and why it has such a devastating impact on some people.</p> <p><strong>Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com</strong></p>",

Earlier this month, Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll.</p> <p>The virus has killed more Americans than the Vietnam and Korean wars combined, and the death toll is approaching that of the first world war, when more than 116,000 Americans died in combat.</p> <p>The number of fatalities in the United States is still climbing, , and federal officials warn that the likely actual toll from the coronavirus is higher than the official figure.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm\">tracking project by the Centers of Disease Control</a> (CDC) of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in each state beyond seasonal averages suggests the official count of Covid-19 deaths could leave out thousands of cases.</p> <p>\u201cThese deaths could represent misclassified Covid-19 deaths, or potentially could be indirectly related to Covid-19 (eg, deaths from other causes occurring in the context of healthcare shortages or overburdened healthcare systems),\u201d the CDC said.</p> <p>The first confirmed coronavirus case in the United States emerged on 20 January, in Washington state, the same day that a first case was confirmed in South Korea. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">Months ensued</a> in which the White House told states they would receive minimal federal support in obtaining testing kits, ventilators, protective equipment and other gear.</p> <p>The United States has increased its testing capacity but has yet to stand up a national plan for the contact tracing of positive cases, a step South Korea took immediately. That country has since recorded 269 deaths from coronavirus.</p> <p>In a video, former vice-president Joe Biden expressed grief for the lives lost and condemned the administration for not acting sooner. \u201cTo those hurting, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201d Biden said.</p> <p>Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and former presidential candidate, struck a similar tone. \u201c100,000 Americans are gone. They were our brothers and sisters. Our friends and neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd too many of them could have been saved if our federal government had just done more.\u201d</p> <p>Across Europe, the virus exacted a terrible toll. Eight of the 10 countries with the top per-capita rates of Covid-19 deaths are in Europe; the United States ranks ninth on that list, with about 30 deaths per 100,000 people, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">data from</a> Johns Hopkins University. Britain is third, with 55.64 deaths per 100,000.</p> <p>Health experts warn that the United States can expect millions more Covid-19 cases and a tragic number of deaths to come, unless the virus takes an unprecedented and unforeseen vector. With regional infection rates varying from about 5-20%, most experts believe the virus will continue to churn through the US population until the overall rate of infection is 50-60% \u2013 or until a vaccine is widely administered.</p>",

While elemental princess Mermista and the flamboyant sea captain Seahawk provide much of the comic relief with their unlikely romance, it\u2019s the way She-Ra openly centres queer love and romance that\u2019s really powerful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68d794af732fcedc5bef53472b2242828986f7da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d794af732fcedc5bef53472b2242828986f7da/0_0_2202_1239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seahawk, Mermista, Perfuma, Scorpia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seahawk, Mermista, Perfuma and Scorpia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From married princesses Netossa and Spinnerella, to Rebellion archer Bow\u2019s two dads, showrunner Noelle Stevenson put her cards on the table early in the series and continued to develop queer relationships that become more and more central to the plot as the series progresses.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s something that is quite joyful to watch with a small child.

In the weeks that followed, Newsom expanded the modifications to allow counties that had not been as affected by the virus as others to apply for looser restrictions. As of Tuesday, 47 out of the state\u2019s 58 counties have self-attested, and will be allowed to reopen hair salons, offices, some schools, all with modifications. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe pace at which the state has made these modifications is concerning to me,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county, location of what is believed to be the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought\"> first Covid-related death</a> in the country. </p> \n  <p>Cody voiced these concerns at a local board of supervisors meeting on Tuesday, where she called for the county to take a more cautious approach.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths.

The research raises hopes that everyone who has had the disease could acquire some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long or to what degree.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission proposed a \u20ac750bn coronavirus recovery fund</strong>, as part of a \u20ac1.85tn budget to help member states whose economies have suffered as a result of the pandemic.

Thank you to all of those who got in touch with tips, comments and more. My colleague Nick Ames will be picking up the baton now. </p> \n  <p>Here are the top developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Known global deaths pass 350,000. </strong>More than 350,000 people have now lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current toll stands at 350,456. The number of confirmed cases is 5,589,932, after the number of declared cases doubled in a month, with more than one million new cases registered in the last 11 days. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The US alone accounts for less than a third of the global toll, with 98,916 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tory unrest increases pressure on PM to sack Dominic Cummings. </strong>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/tory-unrest-increases-pressure-pm-sack-dominic-cummings\">growing revolt within Boris Johnson\u2019s party</a> over his refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, over his lockdown breach. A<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/junior-minister-resigns-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-trip-douglas-ross\"> junior minister has resigned</a>, and 30 other Conservative MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/public-anger-swells-ranks-tory-mps-turning-on-dominic-cummings\">called for Cummings to go</a>. Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart\">Heather Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-proctor\">Kate Proctor</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease. </strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/global-report-who-says-the-americas-are-centre-of-pandemic-as-cases-surge\">accelerating in countries such as Brazil</a>, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand expects plan for safe travel with Australia in June. </strong>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday that a draft blueprint on safely starting travel between New Zealand and Australia will be presented to both governments in early June, Reuters reports. The neighbours have been discussing the possibility of a travel bubble between them as both have slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus to levels well below those in United States, Britain and some other European countries. New Zealand has also reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports biggest daily jump in almost 50 days. </strong>South Korea South Korea has reported 40 new coronavirus cases for its biggest daily jump in nearly 50 days, causing alarm in a country where millions of children are returning to school. All but four of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to nightclubs, karaoke rooms and an e-commerce warehouse. Three cases were linked to international arrivals. South Korea has also jailed a man for four months for breaking quarantine rules, in the country\u2019s first such prison sentence.</li> \n   <li><strong>Vietnam to readmit foreigners. </strong>Vietnam will resume issuing e-visas to citizens from 80 countries from 1 July, the government said, though it was unclear whether quarantine measures would be lifted. The country imposed a blanket ban on foreigners entering the country in March as part of its aggressive response to the pandemic, which has also involved mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing.So far, Vietnam has not reported any coronavirus deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Macron unveils \u20ac8bn French auto rescue, champions electric cars. </strong>President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday announced an \u20ac8bn (US$8.8bn) plan to revive France\u2019s auto industry by making it the European leader in electric cars, boosting a sector brought to its knees by the coronavirus. Macron said the package would include one billion euros in subsidies to encourage purchases of electric and hybrid cars and set a target of France producing a million green cars annually by 2025.The \u201chistoric\u201d intervention will aim to turn France\u2019s rechargeable car industry into Europe\u2019s biggest, the president said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany extends distancing rules to end of June. </strong>Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government said on Tuesday. Merkel\u2019s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. Germany\u2019s virus caseload now tops 181,200 with just over 8,372 deaths - much lower than European counterparts such as Britain, France, Spain and Italy.</li> \n   <li><strong>India backs hydroxychloroquine for virus prevention. </strong>India\u2019s top biomedical research body has backed the use of the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine as a preventive against coronavirus, after the WHO suspended clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns. The endorsement from the Indian Council of Medical Research came a week after US President Donald Trump said he was taking the drug as a preventative measure. India - which accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine - on Tuesday reported 145,380 cases of the virus including 4,167 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain begins 10 days of mourning. </strong>Starting on Wednesday, the country will mourn for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ece002d8f0852d729950738\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T05:54:40.169Z\">6.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Sabrina Toppa reports for the Guardian from Lahore: </em></p> \n  <p><strong>Pakistan\u2019s garment workers fight for rights amid Covid-19 crisis</strong></p> \n  <p>Police in Karachi last week allegedly shot at hundreds of unarmed garment workers protesting outside a factory supplying denim for global fashion brands.</p> \n  <p>Garment workers claimed to have been charged by police with batons outside a factory which is reported to have fired more than 15,000 workers since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Nasir Mansoor from the National Trade Union Federation.

There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.

Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart\">Heather Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-proctor\">Kate Proctor</a>. </li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/trump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">Twitter added a fact-check warning to the bottom of a tweet by US President Donald Trump for the first time</a>. </strong>Trump tweeted: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....\u201d Bellow the tweet there is now a link with the warning text \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d. On Sunday Trump suggested that supporters of mail-in voting were using the coronavirus outbreak to perpetrate a \u201cscam\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump said he thought it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden wore a face mask yesterday</strong> while attending a Memorial Day ceremony. The president has resisted wearing a mask in public, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans cover their faces while out in public and around other people.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>The Pentagon\u2019s deputy inspector general resigned. </strong>Recently, the president effectively removed Glenn Fine<strong> </strong>from his role leading a coronavirus relief spending oversight committee, and the defence department official has now become the latest inspector general to step down in recent weeks.</li> \n   <li><strong>The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange was reopened after two months. </strong>Cuomo rang the opening bell to cheers from traders, who will still have to wear masks and stay six feet apart from each other when they\u2019re on the floor.<strong> </strong></li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease</strong>. The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, </strong>a country devastated by five years of war.

Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll passed 47,000, </strong>according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics.

The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. </strong>Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342 \u2013 but Vladimir Putin said the country has \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over the official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years.

This is especially important for elderly people, middle-aged people with chronic health problems and others who are immune-compromised. \u201cIf these are our loved ones, [you can protect] them by not coming in and giving hugs.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has said the decision to hug visiting family <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/melbourne/programs/drive/chief-health-officer-brett-sutton-new-pysical-distancing-rules/12235806\">\u201cis up to you\u201d</a>. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be doing it \u2026 there must be circumstances though, where it\u2019s really important for an individual,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-11/coronavirus-victoria-eases-restrictions-the-new-covid-19-rules/12233798\">he said</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Set your boundaries</strong></h2> <p>\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s difficult about this is that there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all [rule],\u201d says the psychologist and Australian National University lecturer Amy Dawel. \u201cEvery family is different, and they\u2019re all going to make different decisions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I would encourage people to do is spend a bit of time by themselves before they talk with older relatives,\u201d Dawel says. \u201c[Think about] what boundaries you want to maintain and how you see that potentially working.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s helpful to set a practical plan, before emotion kicks in. \u201cOne of the important things is identifying physical space that makes [distancing] possible,\u201d Dawel says. \u201cThat can help take some of the stress out of it.\u201d If you have kids, outdoor spaces might be easier \u2013 especially when public playgrounds reopen. If you\u2019re meeting for a meal, think about seating arrangements. Is there a table big enough to allow space between each person?</p> <p>When you speak to your family, Dawel says, aim to be \u201cpatient, kind and gentle \u2013 but also firm\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Listen to your relatives</strong></h2> <p>When social distancing measures were first announced, many young Australians said their older relatives were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/19/where-do-you-think-youre-going-coronavirus-is-making-millennials-fearful-for-our-parents\">\u201cway too relaxed\u201d</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brigidwd/status/1239354459894853632?lang=en\">going out too much</a>. But the data \u2013 from an <a href=\"https://psychology.anu.edu.au/research/projects/australian-national-covid-19-mental-health-behaviour-and-risk-communication-survey\">ongoing ANU study</a> on mental health and behaviour during the pandemic \u2013 doesn\u2019t fully back that up.</p> <p>\u201cThe over-65s are much less worried about Covid,\u201d admits Dawel, who is leading the study. \u201cAcross the board we see older adults doing much better in terms of mental health \u2026 But older people are reporting they\u2019re socially distancing just as much as other people \u2013 if not more \u2013 and that they agree with those distancing measures. If anything, they\u2019ve shown slightly stronger agreement [with physical distancing measures] over time.\u201d</p> <p>The survey, she notes, does not have data on distancing around close family, \u201cso that could be quite different\u201d. If an older relative insists on close contact, Dawel suggests \u201clistening to find out what\u2019s important to them about it\u201d. \u201cCan you fill this space with some other kind of connection for them? We really have to get creative and think outside the box here.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Look for alternatives</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this month Ana Bolerjack\u2019s grandmother, 76, was feeling disconnected. She had no family near her retirement home in Virginia. So her mother, 55, decided to make the trip from Utah for one big, creative gesture \u2026 in a sanitised, inflatable hippo suit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickyBoler/status/1260627728170024960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My mother-in-law hugging my grandmother in an inflatable hippo suit wearing a tutu is the content you needed today.

If your older relative is missing this sense of touch, there are also ways of helping from a distance. Dawel suggests giving clothing \u2013 \u201ca special gift, like a jumper of a scarf \u2013 something they can wear and connect with\u201d as a reminder you are \u201cwith them in quite a physical way\u201d.</p> <p>If they\u2019re missing connection, try letter writing or <a href=\"https://theimaginationtree.com/25-ideas-the-kindness-elves/\">\u201ckindness elves\u201d</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of evidence that random acts of kindness help not only the person who\u2019s receiving that kindness, but the giver.\u201d</p>"
