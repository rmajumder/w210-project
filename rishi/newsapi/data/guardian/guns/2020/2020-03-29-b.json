For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around 10 days later.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days.

Last year, 1,900 reached the UK by boat, with many others arriving by lorry. Eighty migrants are understood to have reached the UK by boat last week, with some reports of around 160 attempts in one day.</p> \n<p>While numbers are disputed, internal documents collated by NGOs in the area and seen by the Guardian revealed there are about 1,500 people in Calais, including 160 unaccompanied children, the youngest of whom is 11. There are about 600 people in Grand Synthe in Dunkirk, including around 35 families. Some have serious health problems such as diabetes, and others have suffered broken limbs including a broken arm and a broken jaw.</p> \n<p>A 16-year-old boy from Sudan told the Guardian that he planned to run away and cross the Channel rather than go into one of the French centres. \u201cIf we are taken away to these centres we won\u2019t know what will happen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI will run away and I will keep trying to reach the UK by lorry.

Refugees have reported food and water shortages.

Provision of showers and phone charging facilities have also decreased.</p> \n<p>NGOs working in the camps in Calais say it is crucial that the lockdown is managed properly and that the French authorities work with them, as they are trusted by the refugees.</p> \n<p>Clare Moseley, founder of <a href=\"https://care4calais.org/news/urgent-appeal-food-please-share/\">Care4Calais,</a> which provides emergency aid and support for refugees in Calais and Dunkirk as well as in Brussels, and is continuing to operate in the refugee areas, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the camps.

The reduction of food in the camps has been a game-changer. If the only way people can eat is by going into one of the centres then it won\u2019t really be voluntary.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said that after getting legal advice from lawyers in the UK and France, Care4Calais volunteers are continuing to operate as frontline aid workers and are following current World Health Organization guidance on infection control.</p> \n<p>According to documents seen by the Guardian, some unaccompanied minors have reported being beaten by French police and they have told charity workers they prefer to sleep in the camps rather than in centres provided by the French authorities.</p> \n<p>When buses are sent to the camps from Tuesday, migrants who agree to leave will be given a medical check before being transferred. Once they reach the temporary accommodation they will be expected to keep the same lockdown rules as the rest of France, which has prohibited all movement except for essential work, essential shopping, medical appointments and a daily maximum one-hour exercise routine not more than 1km from home.</p> \n<p>Even before the coronavirus crisis, life in the refugee camps was grim. Volunteers said that asking migrants who were often four or five to a tent to maintain social distancing was impossible.</p> \n<p>L\u00e9ah Njeim, a volunteer with Utopia 56, an organisation that distributes food to the camps, told <a href=\"https://www.ouest-france.fr/sante/virus/coronavirus/comment-se-confiner-quand-est-migrant-calais-6791752\">Ouest France</a>: \u201cSome migrants are more than an hour\u2019s walk away from running water.\u201d</p> \n<p>Utopia 56 had been transporting sick migrants to local health centres. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to stop this ... the police are blocking the exit to the Jungle [camp],\u201d Njeim added.</p> \n<p>Secours Catholique, a charity that ran a day centre for 250 to 300 migrants where they could warm up, have a hot drink and charge their mobiles, said it had been forced to close as most of its volunteers were aged over 70 and in the coronavirus \u201cat risk\u201d group. In an open letter to the authorities, 18 NGOs called for the migrants who wished to stay in the Channel area to be housed in \u201chotels, schools and empty apartments\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo stay home, you have to have a home to stay in,\u201d the organisations wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/mais-pour-rester-chez-soi-il-faut-un-chez-soi\">petition</a> addressed to the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe.</p> \n<p>Fran\u00e7ois Guennoc, vice-president of the Auberge des Migrants, told La Voix du Nord newspaper: \u201cGiving them accommodation far away will not work.

  "<p>The threat from the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain could be diminishing after Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory because supporters of the ideology feel they are being listened to, according to a former head of MI5.</p> <p>Lord Evans of Weardale said \u201calienated\u201d voters normally vulnerable to exploitation by far-right groups such as the British National party (BNP), English Defence League (EDL) and National Action might <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/28/britain-first-far-right-members-5000-have-joined-tories\">feel that their voices had been heard </a>at the ballot box with the significant win for the Conservatives in December\u2019s election.</p> <p>The former MI5 director general, who led Britain\u2019s domestic security service between 2006 and 2013, said: \u201cWhatever you think of the outcome of the recent election in the UK, the fact that some of the legitimate concerns that were being used as a pretext by English nationalists have now been formally acknowledged at the ballot box might be a good outcome, even though it is sort of disconcerting for southern liberals.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a significant alienated and disenfranchised group out there who didn\u2019t think the system was taking any notice of them. And that\u2019s where you need to be concerned about extremists exploiting legitimate concerns.</p> <p>\u201cDisaffected English nationalists were manifesting themselves at the extremes in things like the British National party and National Action, which fed the undertone that articulated itself as extreme rightwing terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>However, the crossbench peer warned that it remained to be seen whether potential far-right supporters would be wholly satisfied by Johnson\u2019s administration.</p> <p>\u201cAttention still needs to be paid to this group, as it is not clear that they will feel entirely assuaged as a result of the fact that people are paying wider attention to them now. Terrorist problems emerge when you have a significant population who feel alienated and nobody takes notice of them, causing frustration and anger,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Evans, who was made a life peer in 2014, made the comments in an interview with the US-based Combat Terrorism Center. He has previously said the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain has been encouraged by years of austerity following the 2008 recession.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect it is a reflection of the social pressures on communities as a result of austerity measures. There seems to be a constituency of disaffected males (for the most part, but not entirely) who find extreme rightwing beliefs attractive. And they have started to get their acts together to organise into groups and plot.\u201d</p> <p>In the interview, he said some far-right terrorists had been \u201cconsciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of violent Islamists\u201d.</p> <p>He added that the EDL was \u201cmutually symbiotic\u201d with Anjem Choudary\u2019s al-Muhajiroun group and described the emergence of neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Action and its successor groups, which have described their ideology as \u201cwhite jihad\u201d, as predictable.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is some evidence that they have been consciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of the violent Islamists in getting their grievances on the table as a result of violence and thought, \u2018Well, we can do something like that.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Last September the head of counterterror police, Neil Basu, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/19/fastest-growing-uk-terrorist-threat-is-from-far-right-say-police\">vowed to thwart</a> the rise of the far right, which the force has said is the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK.</p> <p>The number of white terror suspects being arrested in the UK has outstripped those of Asian background for two years in a row, and of the 25 attack plots that have been foiled since March 2017, 16 were Islamist, eight far right and one \u201cother\u201d.</p> <p>In 2018 MI5 took the lead in investigating the most dangerous extreme rightwing terrorists in a sign of how seriously the threat was being taken.</p> <p>Some terrorists were incited by extreme rightwing propaganda, such as Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016. But others, like Darren Osborne, who attacked Muslim worshippers with a van in north London, had acted after reading lawful material from groups such as the EDL and mainstream media.</p>",
  "<p>As a freelancer of nearly 20 years\u2019 standing, I welcome the support package for self-employed people (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-uk-offers-self-employed-80-of-earnings\" title=\"\">Coronavirus: UK offers self-employed 80% of earnings</a>, 26 March) . But the exclusion of those who have become self-employed since the end of the 2018-19 tax year is disappointing. It can hardly have escaped the chancellor\u2019s attention that the 2019-20 tax year ends on 5 April \u2013 nearly two months before the scheme is expected to begin paying out. So why can\u2019t the recently self-employed be assessed pro rata on the basis of a promptly submitted 2019-20 tax return? Likewise, I hope that assessment of those who became self-employed in 2018-19 will take account of the date on which their self-employment commenced, rather than assuming their earnings for that year represent a whole year\u2019s income.<br><strong>Rob Sykes</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 It seems the chancellor\u2019s support for those suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic only goes so far. Those recently entering self-employment can apparently go swing. I started self-employment in April 2019 after 44 years of paid (and taxed) employment. As a result I am one of very few people who will not benefit from any grant or help that the government is offering. </p> <p>At the same time I started self-employment, my wife decided to give up her reasonably paid position to work in a care home on minimum wage. We were confident my income would support us until retirement. My wife\u2019s low income also means no universal credit either. I have lost all my work and income, and the chancellor doesn\u2019t care because there would be a risk of fraud, and yet I will shortly submit my tax return for the year ending 5 April 2020 and subsequently pay tax.<br><strong>Paul Chapman</strong><br><em>Beyton,</em> <em>Suffolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 In 1996, I wrote a pamphlet for the Institute of Employment Rights. It was called Towards the Insecurity Society. It showed how a scourge of self-employment had exploded in the construction industry in the UK. Relieving employers of payment of national insurance, and with lower rates of tax and insurance for the self-employed, a powerful fiscal drive pushed millions of building workers into false self-employment.</p> <p>Workers were given no option but to be self-employed: no employment rights, no security, no safety training, no apprenticeships, no pensions. Most were working for the same contractors, under their instruction, using their capital equipment. It was, and is, mass bogus self-employment, infecting most large building sites. I predicted that this fiscal regime would equally drive bogus self-employment into other sectors of the economy. But I could never have foreseen just how widespread this problem would become.</p> <p>More recently, I calculated that this fiscal driver cost the Treasury at least \u00a31.5bn a year in lost national insurance and taxation, just for the construction industry, never mind other sectors. Now this bogus self-employment epidemic has collided with the coronavirus epidemic. Millions of self-employed find themselves threatened with the abyss of no financial protection. The fiscal and legal regime created a situation in which the Treasury was losing billions each year. Now the Treasury is being asked to bail out the bottomless pit of which it was the architect.</p> <p>If there could be a silver lining to this crisis, the underlying epidemic of bogus self-employment and the vulnerability it has created needs to be suppressed. Not by any vaccine, but by the justice of good law and equitable tax regimes.<br><strong>Emeritus</strong> <strong>Professor Mark Harvey</strong><br><em>University of Essex</em></p>",

She was a child in the war, and she and her three brothers looked forward to Sunday when they would each, in turn, get to eat the one rationed egg. One Sunday she came down in great anticipation because it was her turn, only to find her father, just home on leave, eating her egg.

The Derby West response section of the force tweeted: \u201cOfficers have just attended an address in absolute shock to find 25 adults and children having a massive party with speakers and karaoke. Everyone dispersed and hosts dealt with. It is clear people are still having complete disregard for the Government advice and rules.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Surrey, police broke up a house party in the Stanwell area, while in Cornwall walkers were criticised for ignoring lockdown advice and pouring into rural villages.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said they were receiving regular reports from people concerned about others flouting the lockdown rules with about five calls an hour since 10am on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Many forces have created hotlines to submit tip-offs about people allegedly flouting the social distancing rules, including gatherings of more than two people.

  "<p>\u201cThere are no words,\u201d says Kely Nascimento-DeLuca, the eldest daughter of Pel\u00e9, when I ask about her journey from women\u2019s football novice to documentary maker on the subject. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very into football.

Hundreds of thousands of people bought it, but you cannot fathom a cheeky slogan you could make up to get people to go and watch this movie, which is really not just about sport but is about passion?\u2019 It\u2019s people\u2019s stories. It\u2019s women\u2019s stories \u2013 which is problematic because people aren\u2019t used to that. My favourite stories in the world are about women, but they are men\u2019s stories about women.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve had a profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pel\u00e9 in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are some huge names in the film. US women\u2019s national team players past and present such as Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach, tennis and equality hero Billie Jean King, England\u2019s Nikita Parris, as well as the Brazil superstars Marta, Formiga and Neymar are all interviewed. But at thedocumentary\u2019s heart, is the story of the Brazilian Lais Araujo, now 24, who was spotted in a favela eight years ago by Wilson Egidio, Nascimento-DeLuca\u2019s brother-in-law and coach of Manhattan Soccer Club, a youth side based in New York.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this girl who I just saw, Kely, we have to try and get her here,\u201d said Egidio in a text to Nascimento-DeLuca on his return to the city. \u201cThere\u2019s no future for her there, she was playing with all the boys, she\u2019s super skinny, she\u2019s 16, she was playing with no shoes on and she\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be90d14301e7f4e0caf4150c67cbddb7c7732e49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be90d14301e7f4e0caf4150c67cbddb7c7732e49/0_277_3413_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lais Araujo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lais Araujo, right, the star of Warriors of a Beautiful Game, in action for Adelaide United last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Brake/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nascimento-DeLuca wanted to help but was also hesitant given she worked as a creative director and, her father aside, had no connection with football. But then while working on a series of T-shirts for a fledgling brand, which included tops with images of Pel\u00e9 on them, she had an idea. \u201cListen, I want to shoot this on a girl player,\u201d she pitched to the CEO of the company. \u201cI think we need to change the narrative a little and I know the girl.\u201d</p> <p>It marked the beginnings of a relationship in which Nascimento-DeLuca would grow as much as Araujo. \u201cI have four kids and a job and so our conversations were very much on the side,\u201d says Nascimento\u2011DeLuca of the early period of their contact after the t-shirt shoot. \u201cShe would send me a WhatsApp message excited because she had heard that in a month a scout from the national team would be coming to her town and she was going to work extra hard. In the two years we chatted it happened several times and they never came, ever. Those things started to lodge themselves in the back of my head.\u201d</p> <p>Then, however, Araujo\u2019s life began to change. She got to the US, invested in a good camera phone and with the help of friends made a showreel. It worked \u2013 she was soon in the orbit of the University of Florida, having impressed at junior college level, and after impressing for them she caught the eye of those in charge of selecting players for Brazil\u2019s under-20s team. By 2016, she was her country\u2019s No 10 at the U20s World Cup in Papua New Guinea, playing alongside four players who are now senior Brazil internationals.</p> <p>As Nascimento-DeLuca followed Araujo\u2019s journey, her eyes were opened to the struggles of women footballers. \u201cI thought that this was a) an amazing story and b) truly fucked up. That this girl comes from a country that literally breeds talent and had to go through this journey to get to our U20 national team.\u201d</p> <p>That led to Nascimento-DeLuca researching women\u2019s football. \u201cI was really shocked by so many things. I knew nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily shocked at the systemic sexism, because I\u2019m South American, and a woman, and alive. But I was shocked at some of the statements that were being made in 2015 by those in charge of promoting the team and sport in Brazil.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c9e27117019bddc4c40febd9280b54e448724d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c9e27117019bddc4c40febd9280b54e448724d1/0_1057_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marta being interviewed for the documentary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Kely Nascimento-DeLuca</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For someone who has grown up with a global superstar as a father, Nascimento-DeLuca\u2019s social consciousness is striking. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pel\u00e9 in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil. I was always very aware that everywhere we went nobody looked like me, and definitely not my father.</p> <p>\u201cIt was interesting because my father is the type of person who treats everyone that works for him like family. I don\u2019t mean altruistically, I mean that he doesn\u2019t know how to have staff. That sounds horrible, I don\u2019t mean to sound uppity, he just doesn\u2019t make that distinction. If you\u2019re standing there and I\u2019m eating? Sit down. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know how to be wealthy.</p> <p>\u201cYou become very aware that if it wasn\u2019t for one magical bit of genius, your life could be completely different because of the way you look. That\u2019s huge. There were many painful things about moving to the US at that time. There was no FaceTime. It was like moving to Mars. But they put us in the United Nations school, so we weren\u2019t aliens. And they moved us to a city where no one gave a fuck. Like truly.

But it certainly helped as she sought to make her documentary. It took a year to raise the money required for Warriors of a Beautiful Game to become a reality, with the first investor being St\u00e9phane Mbia, the former Cameroon international who Nascimento-DeLuca met at a Paris Saint-Germain game.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is any time when using his name is justified and should be encouraged I think it is to do something like this. For many reasons,\u201d she says. \u201cHis [Pel\u00e9\u2019s] career \u2013 I mean, he was a genius \u2013 and his longevity is a great juxtaposition to any woman\u2019s, like Marta\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see that it\u2019s all the same emotions, it\u2019s all the same strings it pulls on. And yet one has been allowed to thrive and been allowed to reach incredible parts of society and culture and the other one hasn\u2019t to nearly the same extent.\u201d</p> <p>For Araujo, it has not been easy. She graduated in 2018 and went to Norway, then to Adelaide. Now she is back in Brazil having fallen off the radar after she prioritised her diploma over the NWSL draft and staying in the pool for the under-20s team. For Nascimento-DeLuca, the hope is that she has done her story justice.</p> <p>\u201cI feel a lot of pressure to make the women in the film proud and to tell the story that they want told. I want it to be a love letter to the sport that makes other people fall in love with it.\u201d</p> <p>And perhaps a rather obvious question \u2013 has Pel\u00e9 seen the documentary? \u201cHe\u2019s seen the teaser. He said it\u2019s good,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut he\u2019s always like: \u2018I\u2019ll reserve my judgment, let\u2019s see the whole thing first\u2019.\u201d</p>",

This week he will almost certainly acquire dictatorial powers.

That\u2019s where we find ourselves at the opening of Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2012 film Farewell, My Queen, following three days in Versailles on the eve of the French revolution.</p> <p>Now streaming on SBS On Demand, the plot of the French-language film revolves around a servant, Sidonie (L\u00e9a Seydoux), who is the reader (or \u201cassistant reader\u201d, as she is reminded by more senior servants) to Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/27/high-maintenance-weed-dealer-anthology-is-a-perfect-escape-and-keeps-getting-better\">High Maintenance: weed dealer anthology is a perfect escape \u2013\u00a0and keeps getting better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farewell, My Queen initially invites its audience into a lush world in which every woman is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. Affairs are conducted in public and looks are longingly exchanged in corridors. It\u2019s a universe of embroidered silk gowns, violet perfume, delicate hair ribbons, tiny cakes and walks in sun-drenched, manicured gardens. Coffee is described as tasting like \u201cbitter velvet\u201d and is drunk while tucked up among floral sheets in four-poster beds. Noblewomen cluster in dark corners and whisper sweet nothings to each other \u2013 this movie features many scenes of French women just breathing on each other. Marie Antoinette has fashion magazines read to her when she wakes up, while people holding empty bowls are shooed away from the palace\u2019s golden gates. Historical spoiler: all of this decadence won\u2019t last for long.</p> <p>Less than 10 minutes into the film the tide is beginning to turn for the royal family. Sidonie, who harbours a passionate loyalty to the queen, doesn\u2019t understand it. Other servants grumble about having to stitch tapestries and run ridiculous errands, but Sidonie thinks her job feels like \u201ca journey into a magical land\u201d. She is jealous when an Italian gondolier tells her that the queen is having an affair with the Duchess of Polignac (Virginie Ledoyen). When an older woman of the court casually mentions, \u201cHey, I hear there\u2019s not much bread in Paris,\u201d Sidonie snaps, \u201cStop talking nonsense!\u201d And then suddenly it\u2019s the morning of 15 July, and footmen are carrying valuables out of Versailles and servants are whispering about some ruckus at the Bastille last night.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRE7JjPWALg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KRE7JjPWALg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Even if you\u2019re not into period dramas (I don\u2019t understand you, but your business is your own) the decadence and degradation of Farewell, My Queen will probably still appeal. Like The Favourite, Portrait of a Lady on Fire and Marie Antoinette, it feels a little edgier, with a slightly more modern sensibility than other corset-heavy dramas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/26/new-girl-screwball-comedy-gets-funnier-and-smarter-and-is-best-when-binged\">New Girl: screwball comedy gets funnier and smarter \u2013 and is best when binged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even though we know, thanks to history, where the story ends,<em> </em>Farewell, My Queen still manages to feel like a workplace thriller. We don\u2019t spend much time with Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI; instead we spend it with the ladies\u2019 maids and palace librarians who rush around dark corridors, anguished faces illuminated by candlelight, wondering if the revolutionaries will want to dispose of them too.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will happen to us?\u201d a wide-eyed Sidonie asks the librarian, suddenly realising that her employer might not be so popular on the outside. When pamphlets start circulating with a list of heads that need to be cut off for France to be renewed, the nobles also scramble to escape or wait anxiously for the king and queen\u2019s instructions while tense violin music screeches in the background.</p> <p>Sidonie, disgusted that so much blame is being placed on Marie Antoinette and shocked that the ladies who were sucking up to her a week ago are now riffling through her undies to see what they can sell, also has her loyalty tested.</p> <p>Farewell, My Queen isn\u2019t exactly relaxing, but something about stories of extremely wealthy people not sharing their resources feels essential at this moment.

  "<p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national on temporary release from a five-year jail sentence, is for the first time under formal consideration for clemency, her family has been told. A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran\u2019s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight\u2019s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/iran-to-pardon-10000-including-security-prisoners\"> 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak.</a> She has been allowed to stay at her parents\u2019 house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents\u2019 home.</p> <p>All prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran\u2019s political prisoners to be freed.</p> <p>The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight\u2019s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday.</p> <p>Arrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail.

  "<p>\u2018Growing up,\u201d says Kayleigh Llewellyn, \u201cmy mum had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/what-is-bipolar-disorder-google\">bipolar disorder</a> type one. So quite severe. The love you have for your mother or father is so deep-seated, there\u2019s a contradiction: you love the person, but you also feel ashamed of them, because you\u2019re a teenager and you don\u2019t know any better.\u201d</p> <p>Llewellyn has poured this experience into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06myb3d\">In My Skin</a>, an emotional rollercoaster of a TV drama about Bethan, a Welsh teenager coming of age and living a double life as she negotiates mental illness, friendships and her sexuality. Bethan\u2019s mother Trina has bipolar disorder and is sectioned in a psychiatric ward. In an early episode, Trina says something so horrible to Bethan that I gasped out loud in my living room. At other times, the sympathy I feel for her has me weeping. But there are plenty of laughs along the way.</p> <p>Bethan shoulders much of the burden of her mother\u2019s illness alone, although her gran and a kindly but interfering PE teacher do try to help. She\u2019s ambitious and dreams of being a writer, while trying to survive in a hostile and homophobic school. She also desperately wants to impress popular girl Poppy, on whom she has a crush, lying about her home life even to her closest friends, portraying it as secure and middle class.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in fear that kids in my school would find out my mum was frequently being sectioned,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cI thought they would make fun of me, ostracise me \u2013 or even worse, make fun of my mum.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15e785ddacd2ce4d655c500ab90d238be34401d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e785ddacd2ce4d655c500ab90d238be34401d5/0_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I just could not afford to live any more\u2019 \u2026 Llewellyn.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I just could not afford to live any more\u2019 \u2026 Llewellyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karla Gowlett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Llewellyn initially trained as an actor and didn\u2019t start writing until she was 27. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know any actors, and I certainly didn\u2019t know any writers. I didn\u2019t know writing was a job.\u201d It was only when she started acting and realised that the words were what really drew her that she began to write.</p> <p>Another script, co-written with a friend, won the <a href=\"http://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/rocliffe\">Bafta Rocliffe New Writing</a> comedy award in 2012 and helped her secure an agent. \u201cFor once in my life I got really bloody lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cI went from not being a writer at all to having a commission for a primetime BBC One show.\u201d</p> <p>That series didn\u2019t happen in the end: Llewellyn is keen to point out that her screenwriting journey hasn\u2019t been an entirely easy one, even if she does now find herself in the writers\u2019 room for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/killing-eve\">Killing Eve</a>. \u201cAbout three years ago, I was so broke.

They paid my rent for a few months, gave me subsistence.\u201d</p> <p>In late 2017, after another failed project, Llewellyn rattled off a one-page treatment based on her childhood experiences of caring for her mother \u2013 and emailed it to several producers. \u201cWithin about an hour, I had that feeling of regret, thinking: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve exposed myself so much\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Seven out of 10 wanted to option it.

The show was then greenlit for a full series.</p> <p>In My Skin was shot in Cardiff, a few streets from where Llewellyn grew up. How does it feel to see her life played out on screen? Was it necessary to keep a bit of distance? \u201cTo a degree, I did have to,\u201d she says, \u201cso that I felt free to tell a good story.\u201d She decided it would be too strange to film in her old school, and she made Bethan an only child. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/11/jo-hartley-favourite-tv\">Jo Hartley</a>, who plays Trina, and I made a choice that she would never meet my mum.

It was such a responsibility. It was about visualisation, breath work, and lots and lots of research, and I was able to use emotional recall from personal experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Hartley watched videos of people with hypomania, and had in-depth chats with Llewellyn and others who had experience of bipolar disorder. On set, she was isolated from most of the cast and crew and didn\u2019t wash her hair, staying in character for the duration. \u201cWe came up with a scale of one to five,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cBipolar has stages\u2013 you\u2019re not just hypomanic all time. So Jo could be given <em>this</em> number for the level of her mania. And then we had an amazing doctor based in Cardiff who specialises in bipolar patients, who read all of our scripts and gave advice.\u201d</p> <p>Llewellyn\u2019s sister also read all the scripts and gave her blessing, but her mother was very ill when they were shooting the pilot, and did not watch it until two weeks after it was first shown on BBC Three. \u201cShe was in Wales and I was in London and I was on the edge of my seat feeling sick waiting for the phone to ring.

Llewellyn says not. \u201cI want people to have the takeaway that Trina is a kind woman and a good mother who\u2019s very ill. I hope I struck that balance. But to give an accurate representation of what it is to care for someone who\u2019s mentally ill, you have to show it warts and all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We wanted to recreate the Wales we knew: you can be on a grotty street, but the vista around you is beautiful hills</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe all know there is something we can each say to our mother, our sister, our partner, that would cripple them, but of course you love them, you don\u2019t want to hurt them.

  "<p>The Polish composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki, who has died aged 86, was an outstanding representative of musical modernism\u2019s success in the 1960s. From the early 70s he became equally emblematic of the subsequent failure of so many of that modernism\u2019s principal pioneers to sustain a lifelong career without abandoning their original principles.</p> <p>In Penderecki\u2019s case, that appeared to mean the substitution of his early trademark emphasis on sound itself, the innovative textures of his choral and orchestral music replacing themes and tonality as the basis for musical construction, with a more lyrical and Romantic style that seemed more like a continuation of 19th-century compositional concerns than a radical reappraisal of received materials.</p> <p>The composer\u2019s earlier manner reached its apogee in the St Luke Passion for two vocal soloists, reciter, three mixed choruses, children\u2019s choir and orchestra; its world premiere took place in March 1966 in M\u00fcnster Cathedral.</p> <p>As the German critic Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt put it: \u201cA large ecclesiastical choral work, composed by a representative of the new music in socialist Poland, performed for the first time in a centre of West German Catholicism, in the former bishop\u2019s seat of the daring anti-Nazi Graf von Galen [a prominent critic of the Third Reich when bishop of M\u00fcnster during the 40s]: this gives occasion to a variety of thoughts.\u201d Many performances worldwide of the Passion took place over the next few years.</p> <p>Penderecki\u2019s later approach is perhaps best exemplified by the First Violin Concerto, written in 1977 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/24/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Isaac Stern</a>; by the Polish Requiem for four soloists, chorus and orchestra (1984, revised in 1993), many sections of which are dedicated to individuals or mass martyrs from Polish history; or by the Credo for five vocal soloists, chorus, children\u2019s choir and orchestra (1998), in which Bach and Polish sources are encountered in a broadly 19th-century harmonic idiom.</p> <p>Penderecki was born in D\u0119bica, in south-eastern Poland, the youngest of three children of Zofia (nee Wittgenstein) and Tadeusz Penderecki. His father was a lawyer, and an amateur violinist and pianist. Armenian ancestry came from a grandmother, who took the young Penderecki to an Armenian church in Krak\u00f3w; this aspect of the composer\u2019s heritage was highlighted in 2015 with the premiere of a new choral work, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTULkAtKM_o\" title=\"\">Psalm No 3</a>, commemorating the Armenian Genocide of 1915, at Carnegie Hall, New York.</p> <p>Composition studies with Artur Malawski and Stanis\u0142aw Wiechowicz at the State Higher School of Music (now known as the Academy) in Krak\u00f3w (1954-58) led to his being appointed a teacher of composition there himself. This was only five years after the death of Stalin; and, despite the advent of the Warsaw autumn international festival of contemporary music in 1956, communist rule in Poland discouraged modernist tendencies.</p> <p>Penderecki himself was then still writing music essentially neoclassical in style, and in 1958 it must have looked as though the young composer was set for a safe but dull career of merely local significance.</p> <p>In the following year, however, came a rise both to sudden maturity and to fame surely as swift as that experienced by any composer at any period. Penderecki had, anonymously, as its terms required, submitted three works to a competition organised by the Union of Polish Composers.</p> <p>When his name turned out to be on the scores winning all the top three prizes, the works involved \u2013 Strophes, Emanations and Psalms of David \u2013 all immediately became well-known in European avant-garde circles, and commissioners of new works quickly beat a path to his door.</p> <p>The reasons for Penderecki\u2019s increasing popularity during this time clearly lay in the fact that his reliance on sound itself, rather than on melody or harmony as such \u2013 an approach that came to be called \u201csonorism\u201d \u2013 was allied to a highly expressive manner that quickly resonated with listeners beyond the avant garde, promising to create a new public for contemporary music.</p> <p>The works that Penderecki now began to write \u2013 deploying sound masses including unusual instrumental and vocal techniques, and combining conventional and more graphic methods of notation \u2013 extended this coupling of experimental sound-world and immediacy of expression to develop a texture-based language of assertive individuality.</p> <p>In the St Luke Passion, the use of chant, recitative and chorales, not to mention the BACH motif (using German note-names, B flat-A-C-B natural) and occasional major triads, helped to make it famous as an instinctively dramatic reworking of a genre familiar from the baroque period. The work was also very timely since, despite emerging from communist Poland, it expressed a spirit of post-second world war reconciliation. Penderecki\u2019s Passion became regarded as a kind of avant-garde counterpart to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/may/31/1962-benjamin-britten-war-requiem\" title=\"\">Benjamin Britten\u2019s War Requiem, premiered </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/may/31/1962-benjamin-britten-war-requiem\" title=\"\">only four years before </a>it.</p> <p>An expressive approach to new materials and means such as Penderecki\u2019s found contemporary parallels in the outputs not only of other Polish composers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/12/henryk-gorecki-obituary\" title=\"\">Henryk G\u00f3recki</a> and, to some extent, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, but also in those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/feb/05/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Iannis Xenakis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/14/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti</a>. Part of the broader agenda here was a concern to find a way forward that addressed the problems of musical structure and comprehensibility raised by the so-called total serialism of such composers as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/pierre-boulez\" title=\"\">Pierre Boulez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/08/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, and that yet retained a radical attitude to musical materials.</p> <p>West Germany, in particular, opened its doors to Penderecki in the 60s: the publisher Hermann Moeck and Heinrich Strobel \u2013 a radio producer who also ran the Donaueschingen Music Days \u2013 were soon prominent champions. It was not long before Penderecki was showered with awards, both in that country and elsewhere.</p> <p>One of the first of these, a Unesco prize, went to his most famous early composition before the St Luke Passion, his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp3BlFZWJNA\" title=\"\">Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima</a> (1960). Written for 52 strings and originally known as 8\u201937\u201d (the work\u2019s length), Threnody is classic early Penderecki: its vividly unconventional writing for massed strings, including quarter-tones, tremolos and multiple glissandi, allied \u2013 after the composer changed the title \u2013 to highly emotive and political subject matter.</p> <p>This combination would serve him well both at this period and later. Indeed, just as the highly expressive, sometimes programmatically charged, approach of other early works such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwImX18AS_E\" title=\"\">Polymorphia</a> for 48 strings (1961), with its thunderously concluding C-major chord, or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_jvgdAFJlM\" title=\"\">Dies Irae</a> for three vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra (1967), which commemorates the dead of Auschwitz, was subsequently carried over into the more conventional sound-world of Penderecki\u2019s output from the 70s onwards, so the potentially incompatible range of musical materials to be found in some of his 60s compositions can sometimes be detected in his later output too. The Polish Requiem and Credo offer two contrasting approaches here: the former incorporating 60s sonoristic effects, the latter more consistently conventional in idiom.</p> <p>More rigorously modernist commentators soon criticised Penderecki\u2019s scores of the 60s for cheap eclecticism, producing \u201ceffects-without-causes\u201d music. Subsequently, his move into what was often called \u201cneo-Romanticism\u201d supplied them with fresh ammunition, as the view of Penderecki as a \u201csheep in wolf\u2019s clothing\u201d appeared vindicated. Now that most of the more obviously avant-garde surface aspects of his music had largely disappeared, thematic and tonal underpinning could show through, unencumbered by any remaining equivocations about expressing musical and extra-musical ideas as approachably as possible to a public for whom most contemporary music remains anathema.</p> <p>Yet those early works, which at the time struck so many as so arresting in their dramatic challenge to convention, now indeed seem \u2013 for some listeners at least \u2013 shallow, simplistic, or even opportunistic. Penderecki\u2019s subsequent manner, meanwhile, retained the endless chromatic melodic sequences and tritones of the earlier manner in the context of a thematic tonality that could now prove simply banal.</p> <p>A notable example is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzglGiIfmpA\" title=\"\">Second Symphony</a>, subtitled the Christmas Symphony (1980), with its quotation of the carol Silent Night: this seems inadequate to the task of handling the religious and political meanings with which it is often charged. Some would argue that the composer had long since proved to be a spent force.</p> <p>Penderecki\u2019s later, as well as his earlier music, retained some champions, however; both before and after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/poland-solidarity-martial-law\" title=\"\">imposition of martial law in Poland</a> in December 1981, the composer\u2019s works were adopted as a representation of the struggle between church and state. This did not stop Penderecki from maintaining links with the Polish political establishment in the years immediately after 1981, something that his compatriots Lutos\u0142awski and G\u00f3recki \u2013 the latter also directly linked, like Penderecki, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/sep/18/the-birth-of-solidarity-in-poland-archive-1980\" title=\"\">Solidarity</a> movement \u2013 refused to do. Works such as the Te Deum for four vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra (1980) \u2013 dedicated to Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a of Krak\u00f3w, who became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism\" title=\"\">Pope John Paul II</a> in October 1978 \u2013 and the Polish Requiem \u2013 both of which quote old Polish hymns \u2013 should be understood in this light.</p> <p>Other signs of Penderecki\u2019s acceptance included the number of leading international soloists who premiered works by the composer, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/27/russia.world\" title=\"\">Mstislav Rostropovich</a>, for whom the Second Cello Concerto (1982) was written, and Anne-Sophie Mutter, for whom both the Second Violin Concerto, subtitled Metamorphosen (1995), and the capriccio for solo violin solo, entitled La Follia, premiered in 2013, were composed.</p> <p>Four operas \u2013 beginning with a suitably lurid Devils of Loudun (1969), based on a book by Aldous Huxley \u2013 received prominent performances, if not very many productions in the UK.

  "<h2>John Lennon <em>by Julian Lennon</em></h2> <p>A lot of the happy memories of my father are from the late 1960s at Kenwood, the old Tudor house we had in Surrey, when I was a little boy. Without knowing it, I probably saw some of the greatest musicians in the world come and go through that house.</p> <p>I remember sitting on the roof of that house with my dad making a balsawood aeroplane. There was a great view from up there. As a kid, I thought my dad was pretty happy \u2013 with the family, the family home and his place in the world. Who could have predicted that everything was about to change?</p> <p>The Beatles had just released <em>Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. At the time, my dad had his famous psychedelic Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which I adored because it had a record player in the back. We also had a Honda Monkey bike, a mini motorcycle we used to ride around on. Ringo [Starr] lived down the road and my dad would take me to see him on the bike. </p> <p>At Kenwood, my father and I were close. So close, in fact, that though my first name is also John, I started to get called Julian or Jules since when my mum would shout, \u201cJohn, your dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d both my dad and I would react.</p> <p>Then suddenly my dad literally disappeared off the face of the planet. At least, that\u2019s how it seemed to me. He and Yoko Ono were deeply and publicly in love. And I felt as if my mum and I had been cast aside. Not everyone forgot about us, though. Paul wrote Hey Jules after dropping in to check how my mum and I were doing. (Obviously, the title of the song changed to Hey Jude).</p> <p>Maybe 10 years passed during which my dad and I barely spoke. I was very angry about how he left the family. It was thanks to my mum that we started having conversations again. She was such a gentle soul, never vindictive in any way, shape or form. She always wanted me to have a relationship with him.</p> <p>I was scared the first time I went to visit him in the US after my parents\u2019 divorce. I was becoming more aware of the magnitude of this man. Much to my relief, the visit was a success. My dad was charming and funny and warm. From that trip on, I remember us getting along better. </p> <p>I hesitated to enter the music business because of who Dad was. I would send him the odd cassette of me playing live, or song ideas I had recorded on a little Sony Walkman he had given me.</p> <p>He warmly encouraged me to continue playing, but sadly, he never really got to see my career unfold, as he passed when I was just 17. When I did finally become a professional musician a few years later, I felt like I understood him better.</p> <p>I try to remember my dad as fondly as possible. I strive for forgiveness and understanding in that area of my life, for the difficult times he put my mum and me through. I loved her more than anything and can\u2019t forget how poorly he treated her. But our relationship was getting better before he died. He was in a happier place. He wanted to reconnect, not just with me but with the rest of his family. He never got a chance to do so. Even now, almost 40 years after he died, I hold my father\u2019s memory dear.</p> <p><em>Julian Lennon is a musician and photographer and the founder of the <a href=\"https://whitefeatherfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">White Feather Foundation</a></em></p> <h2>Caitlyn Jenner <em>by Brandon Jenner</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d/0_120_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Jenner with baby son Brandon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Now, we\u2019re making up for lost time\u2019: Bruce Jenner (as she then was) with baby Brandon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father spent the first 65 years of her life trying to avoid answering the question \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And because of that, she didn\u2019t ask it often, either. And, though, I understand that she avoided the question because the answer would have laid bare too many struggles, it made my relationship with her challenging. People connect with each other through vulnerability, and you can only get someone to open up to you if you are willing to be vulnerable yourself. Because she was shielding something so important from herself, Dad remained distant for much of my life.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have many memories from before my parents split up and my father moved out. I was four at the time. They got divorced because my dad had decided to start transitioning to female. I, of course, was too young then to have any idea what was behind their decision.</p> <p>I do, however, remember a few details from my early childhood that only made sense much later. For instance, when I was very young, I used to love to fiddle with people\u2019s ears. Once when I reached out to touch my dad\u2019s ears, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t do that. I just had surgery.\u201d He pointed to a thin line of small black stitches behind his ear, grinned, and said: \u201cThey took my ear off, peeled my face back, and then stitched it back on.\u201d </p> <p>For the first few years after their divorce, my parents were amicable. Mom started dating David Foster, whom she later married. I never called him dad, but he was the one who lived with us, who told me to pick up my clothes and turn off the lights \u2013 all the typical dad things. So even though this is about Caitlyn, I could write just as easily about David. He was a wonderful father figure.</p> <p>A few years after my parents divorced, Dad apparently decided that it wasn\u2019t the right time to transition and had many of his surgeries reversed. After that, his relationship with my mother grew more hostile. She had worked hard to accept that the reason he couldn\u2019t be with her was because he was working towards transitioning. When he started dating Kris Jenner, whom he would go on to marry, that line of reasoning fell apart. It was tremendously painful. The effect of my parents\u2019 souring relationship was that I didn\u2019t see my father more than half a dozen times between ages eight and 25.</p> <p>Because of this, most of the memories I have of my dad are from the narrow slice of time before I was eight. I remember him betting my brother Brody and me $20 that he could beat us to the top of these insanely high giant sand dunes in Malibu and then just smoking us. He ran a flat-out decathlete sprint. He didn\u2019t even pretend to let us win.</p> <p>After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of their dynamic. When I was in my 20s and his daughters with Kris \u2013 Kendall and Kylie \u2013 were teenagers, Dad and I began to re-establish a relationship. He wasn\u2019t as needed around the house and, I think, was looking for someone to talk to. Although, to be honest, instead of talking, we did things. We worked on my car or flew radio-controlled planes in the park near his house. But even then, it always seemed Dad had his guard up.</p> <p>Once he decided to go through with the transition, I was the first of her children she confided in. As soon as Dad said it herself, I was so happy for her.</p> <p>As her son, I wish my dad had been able to transition sooner, not only because I think she would have been happier, but because I think we could have built a stronger relationship earlier. Now, I\u2019m making up for lost time. I speak to my dad almost every day, and every time, she asks me, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p> <p><em>Brandon Jenner is a singer and songwriter</em> </p> <h2>Jeff Bridges <em>by Isabelle Bridges Boesch</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e/0_0_3157_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bridges poses for a portrait after being nominated in the Best Actor category for the 82nd Academy Awards for his role in \u201cCrazy Heart\u201d in Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was like having the most imaginative friend in the world\u2019: Isabelle Bridges Boesch on her dad Jeff Bridges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My dad came from a family of actors. His father, Lloyd, was an actor. His mother, Dorothy, was an actor. His brother Beau is an actor, too. He knows firsthand how weird and challenging it could be to have an actor as a parent, which means he is very good at being a famous actor father.</p> <p>When I was growing up, my dad was really hitting his stride. He made many of his greatest films, from <em>The Fabulous Baker Boys</em> to <em>The Fisher King</em> to <em>Fearless</em>, before I was 10 years old. He was often away shooting for weeks at a time, leaving my mother to look after me and my two sisters. She likes to say she takes care of the empire \u2013 and she does.</p> <p>But when my dad was at home, it was like having the greatest, most imaginative friend in the world. What makes him such a wonderful actor is the same thing that makes him a wonderful playmate: he\u2019s a great pretender. He relished opening up his rich inner life to share with me and my sisters, and he was always happy to be part of ours, too. My sisters and I loved to dress him up, put flowers in his hair \u2013 he\u2019s always had a nice head of hair \u2013 and decorate his face with makeup. When Dad was around, we\u2019d draw or paint or just play pretend for hours. He has such a playful spirit. The only time he ever brought his work home with him was the day he returned from shooting Blown Away still in makeup, his face appearing all bloodied and bruised. I think he wanted to scare us, but we just loved peeling off the stretchy plastic fake blood from his face. It was really satisfying.</p> <p>But, of course, he couldn\u2019t always be at home. When he was away, Dad made sure we stayed connected. He\u2019d call every night. He\u2019d say something like, \u201cIsabelle, when you\u2019re asleep tonight, you\u2019ll see a building. Go through the front door and climb up to the attic. What do you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see the branch of an oak tree by the window,\u201d I\u2019d reply. Then he\u2019d ask, \u201cDo you see the tree house nestled in the crook of the branch?\u201d I\u2019d laugh and say I did. \u201cLet\u2019s meet there tonight,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll jump on our horses and ride to the mountains.\u201d \u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he\u2019d say. In the morning, he\u2019d call again, and we\u2019d go over the adventures we\u2019d had in our dreams the night before.</p> <p>I always knew my father was loving and sweet and playful, but it\u2019s still funny to me that he\u2019s become so closely identified with the Dude. By the time <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers\">The Big Lebowski</a></em> came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father\u2019s work. (I still haven\u2019t seen some of his films from that period.) What I remember most is that around that time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They\u2019re one of the most well-known parts of his costume, but they were actually my dad\u2019s own shoes. Anyway, my sister and I were so embarrassed by those godawful jellies, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they\u2019d probably be worth a lot of money.</p> <p>Another funny thing about people conflating Dad with the Dude is that he\u2019s not really a laid-back guy. He gets anxious. He experiences stress. Before he goes onstage, he always says he doesn\u2019t want to do it, and afterward, he is critical of himself. Though he describes himself as \u201cBuddhish\u201d, he doesn\u2019t project Zen calm. He is, however, extremely present. Even more so now that he\u2019s older and a grandfather. I have two kids of my own, and he is very focused on being in their lives. We live in Oakland, but he and my mom visit often. And when he\u2019s not able to be with his grandkids, he calls to plan dream meetings with them, too.</p> <p><em>Daddy Daughter Day by Isabelle Bridges Boesch and Jeff Bridges (Penguin Random House) is due to be published in October</em></p> <h2>Samuel L Jackson <em>by Zoe Jackson</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel L.

He is completely different from his cool-guy persona. When I was 10 we would go to the comic store every week religiously. They even kept a pull box for my dad (the store pulls the new comics on a customer\u2019s list and keeps them behind the counter). Dad\u2019s pull box was full of weird and really violent comics that I wasn\u2019t allowed to read. He and I didn\u2019t start exchanging comic books until I got to college, and when I was there, whenever I went to the comic book store alone, I was sad. I wanted my dad to be there.</p> <p>Though I was largely shielded from it at as a child, my dad was struggling with addiction during much of my childhood. When I was eight, he entered rehab. He was gone for 60 days, which was a confusing time for me. I had no idea anything was wrong. I never saw him drunk that I know of. I just thought he was a dude who slept a lot.</p> <p>We moved to Los Angeles for my mum, LaTanya Richardson: she got a role in a shortlived TV series. But soon my dad\u2019s career really took off, and my mum stopped working as much to take care of me. It\u2019s funny that my father is the better-known actor, because my mum was the one who pushed him to act in the first place. They met in a teacher\u2019s office (They went to different colleges but the teacher taught at both places.) Mum was doing some makeup work. She said, \u201cYou need to be in my play. Do you act?\u201d Dad said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d and my mum replied, \u201cWell, you do now.\u201d And that\u2019s how it went, and how it has gone ever since. My mum turns the key and sends Dad out into the world.</p> <p>I do think it was very hard for my mum to give up her career to raise me for as long as she did, though. She\u2019s happy for my dad, of course, but it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s a sadness there.</p> <p>I was 12 years old when <em>Pulp Fiction</em> came out. After that, my dad became cool. Or, he thought he did. And though much of the world agrees, he\u2019s still just a big nerd to me. He goes through phases. Once, he gave me a sweatshirt he got from working on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review\">Django Unchained</a></em>. He said, \u201cI signed it for you!\u201d I was like, \u201cDad, thanks. Now I can\u2019t wear it!\u201d It\u2019s up to my mum and me to pull him back down to earth.

Other actors fight for lines; my dad tried to remove as many words as possible. His friends called him Duke, his childhood nickname. It was the name of his dog, an Airedale. Dad used to deliver papers with Duke. The local firemen called the pair Big Duke and Little Duke. The name stuck. He told me, \u201cNow when someone calls me John, I don\u2019t even turn my head.\u201d</p> <p>In his free time, his life was centred on the ocean. We had a converted Second World War minesweeper called Wild Goose and every summer, we would sail up to British Columbia and Alaska. Every winter, we would take it down to Mexico.</p> <p>When he wasn\u2019t on the boat, Dad was working. So I was raised on movie sets. They were rugged in those days. Our family would stay either in a small rented house or in a little motel. I had a tutor three hours a day, but I learned a lot from my father, too. He never told me \u201cdo this\u201d or \u201cdo that\u201d, but led by example. You never wanted to disappoint him. </p> <p>Once when we were at a friend\u2019s ranch, he asked me to drive to the house in an old pick-up truck and grab some things for him. I was 12. I got the truck stuck and I had to go tell him. He was in the middle of a card game. He didn\u2019t get up or offer to help. It was clear that I was expected to figure out how to get the truck out on my own.</p> <p>Some of my proudest moments came from living up to my father\u2019s straight-ahead toughness. When we were in Cabo or La Paz, Mexico, we\u2019d anchor the boat far from the shore and swim in. It was about a 25-minute swim. I remember once, when I was seven or eight, swimming into a bunch of sea snakes and saying, \u201cHoly crap. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/snorkelling-grandmothers-uncover-large-population-of-venomous-sea-snakes-in-noumea\" title=\"\">sea snakes</a> here, Dad!\u201d He replied, \u201cYeah, just keep swimming, kid.\u201d</p> <p>Once we made it to shore, we walked around until our clothes dried. He gave me a big hug and said, \u201cGood job, Big Stuff.\u201d I was just so proud to have made it through, proud to be my father\u2019s son.</p> <p>My father died on 11 June 1979. I was 17. At the time, it was just him and me alone in the house; my mother had moved out. That day, he said he wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I drove him to the hospital. As we pulled up, there was a crowd of photographers waiting for him so we had to go through the back. I was worried, but I was also a naive teenager and thought he was going to be OK. He just always got through things. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that was the last ride I would ever take with my dad.</p> <p><em>Ethan Wayne is the chairman of the <a href=\"https://johnwayne.org/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Cancer Foundation</a> and president of <a href=\"https://www.johnwayne.com/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Enterprises</a></em></p> <h2>Miles Davis <em>by Erin Davis</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971/0_58_612_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis with son Erin.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play on: Miles Davis with son Erin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Erin Davis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People think of my dad as the prince of darkness (the name of his 1967 album), a moody performer who turned his back on the audience out of disregard for them. That wasn\u2019t him at all. But this wasn\u2019t something I truly realised until I stood onstage with him as part of his legendary band: Dad wasn\u2019t turning away from the audience; he was turning toward the band. It wasn\u2019t a sign of disrespect for those there to hear him; it was a sign of respect for those there to play. And I was lucky enough to be there to play.</p> <p>I knew he was a famous musician, but didn\u2019t quite understand how famous. As a kid, I was always telling him I wanted to be a musician. Finally, when I was 14, he asked if I wanted to go on the road with him in the summer. Of course, I said yes.</p> <p>I learned a lot, not only about music, but about my father, during those summer tours. As I stood in the wings, I saw that playing the music live was the most important thing to him. </p> <p>Those tours were the first sustained amount of time I spent with my father. What I discovered about him was how he could break down what was going on in any musical performance \u2013 and find something to take away from it. I remember once watching a heavy metal show on MTV, and when Slayer came on, I thought, \u201cDad\u2019s going to hate this.\u201d He watched for a bit and then said, \u201cHuh. That drummer is really laying it down, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Then he just walked away.</p> <p>He finally asked me onstage for a tour in 1990. He was giving me a chance and I was terrified of blowing it. I played electronic percussion, which was a genre my dad kind of invented. I didn\u2019t even get any rehearsals. I watched the guy who did it before me for a couple of shows, then I was just kind of on it, in the seat. It was nerve-racking for me, but at the same time, it felt wonderful to have my father turn toward me, to listen to me and to play with me as an equal.</p> <p><em>Erin Davis, along with his sister and cousin, is an executor of the Miles Davis estate</em></p> <p><em>To Me, He Was Just Dad by Joshua David Stein is published by Artisan at \u00a317.99.

  "<p>Offices empty, restaurants and cafes closed, performance venues dark, schools and universities shut down. Across the world, numerous industries have entered a state of suspended animation, imposing a sharp and involuntary brake on the working lives of millions of people.</p> <p>This week, having moved my psychoanalytic practice online, I\u2019ve sat in an empty consulting room talking to patients via video-conference, many of them struggling to process what life in the shadow of Covid-19 might mean in the short- and longer-term. Some are lamenting the lost sense of belonging they derive from their workplaces, as well as the claustrophobia of being shut in with partners and children.</p> <p>For others, the fear is more immediate: oneself or a loved one becoming ill and unable to work, the demise of a business, the contraction or total erosion of a livelihood. And lurking behind all these grim prospects, ensuring I\u2019m not immune from this rapid contagion of anxiety, is the possibility that my psychoanalytic practice may be sacrificed to this grim new financial reality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beyond survival, work shapes our sense of self. The thought of being without it induces existential terror</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My interest in the question of how to live without work lead me to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/not-working-9781783782062.html\">write a book</a> on the topic. I discussed clinical cases, as well as lives of major artists and thinkers, that spoke to the importance of renewing contact with our neglected inner lives and letting our minds roam without the imperatives of productivity or purpose dogging every moment. I asked how we could loosen the grip of the centuries-old ethic that ties our sense of self so inextricably to our work.</p> <p>In thinking about a world without work, I had in mind a future of automation and AI, rather than the unthinkable shock of a global pandemic. I followed Oscar Wilde in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-soul-of-man-under-socialism-and-selected-critical-prose-9780140433876.html\">The Soul of Man Under Socialism</a> and tried to imagine life unburdened by the yoke of necessity. Now, Wilde\u2019s vision of a society freed by automation to realise its creative potential is a painful contrast to the workless reality being foisted on millions.</p> <p>Under very different conditions, we could imagine a period of life without work as the most precious of gifts \u2013 the chance to live at our own pace and rediscover the pleasures and possibilities of free, aimless time. But this can only be the case when work ceases to be a matter of survival and when its loss doesn\u2019t plague us with anxiety, depression and sleeplessness. The virus, in other words, is throwing into stark relief an obvious yet suddenly treacherous fact of life today: we depend on work.</p> <p>This dependence is partly a matter of survival; nothing is more liable to arouse a sense of helplessness than the threat of poverty or hunger. But beyond survival, work shapes our sense of self. The thought of being without it induces existential terror. \u201cI\u2019m scared of the loss of income, for sure,\u201d a woman with a suddenly precarious job in the arts said to me recently, \u201cand obviously my health. But I\u2019m more scared of losing myself.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a fear many will share. With the lockdown, it seems we\u2019ve lost the routines that give substance to our lives. Need this mean losing ourselves? I\u2019d like to believe that this period could help us discover new creative resources within ourselves, a thought that takes me to the unlikely figure of Xavier de Maistre, a French aristocrat who in 1790 spent 42 days under house arrest in Turin, Italy, for duelling with an officer.</p> <p>De Maistre whiled away the hours of solitude by writing a journal of his confinement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/04/journey-around-my-room-review\">A Journey Around My Room</a>, which takes us on a strange journey across the walls and floor of his bedroom. He envisioned this motionless travel as a kind of radically democratic tourism, requiring no disposable income or gratuitous effort. In words that take on an eerily hopeful resonance at this moment, De Maistre insists that the Turin authorities \u201cmay have forbidden me to travel through a city, one place, but they left me the entire universe: infinity and eternity are at my command\u201d.</p> <p>But in these times, even the most insulated of us can\u2019t be De Maistre. Even if we enjoyed similar financial privilege, we lack the comfort that the world we return to when our own house arrest is over will be as it was when we left it. And, of course, most of us enjoy no such privilege. Our reveries in front of our bedroom walls are bound to be disturbed by fears for the future \u2013 both ours and the world\u2019s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/08/not-working-why-we-have-to-stop-by-josh-cohen-review\">Not Working: Why We Have to Stop by Josh Cohen \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What if those fears and concerns for others could help fuel a different kind of imaginative transformation? If we can\u2019t, like De Maistre, withdraw into the peaceful cell of our own daydreams, we can (assuming we\u2019re well enough) channel our creativity into refreshing our neglected social and emotional bonds.</p> <p>Think of those offers of help being popped into neighbours\u2019 letterboxes, those helping at food banks, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/astonishing-170000-people-sign-up-to-be-nhs-volunteers-in-15-hours-coronavirus\">thousands of NHS volunteers</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.thehelphub.co.uk/volunteer/\">Help Hub psychotherapy project</a>, originating in Oxford and now offering free online sessions to those in need of human contact and solidarity.

  "<p>Where was the compassion? The overwhelming mainstream media response to the announcement that Boris Johnson had tested positive for Covid-19 was anything but sympathetic. It was summed up by a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8162049/For-days-weve-seen-leaders-coming-closer-6ft-didnt-practise-preached.html\">Daily Mail headline which pointedly asked</a> whether Johnson, his ministers and advisers had not practised the social distancing they had preached.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/nonchalant-boris-johnson-accused-of-covid-19-complacency\">Guardian referred to accusations</a> that the prime minister had been guilty of nonchalance by failing to heed his own advice to the public. Amid the crisis, he may not be held to account. But the Sunday Mirror, reflecting the consensus viewpoint, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/voice-mirror-coronavirus-crisis-ends-21772896\">argued that later \u201che will have serious questions to face</a><a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/voice-mirror-coronavirus-crisis-ends-21772896\">\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Altogether less serious was the Mail on Sunday\u2019s suggestion, on the thinnest of evidence, that the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8163427/Did-Michel-Barnier-infect-PM-EUs-Brexit-negotiator-Downing-Streets-Patient-Zero.html\">Michael Barnier, was the source of Johnson\u2019s infection</a>.

These rapid changes of approach echoed the swiftness of the pandemic\u2019s grip on public imagination. Johnson\u2019s dilemma was met initially with a measure of understanding that soon elided into a large dose media credulity.</p> \n<p>During that honeymoon period, it was largely accepted that Johnson was acting correctly by following scientific advice advocating \u201cherd immunity.\u201d This was challenged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">other scientists, such as William Hanage</a>, but counter arguments got little media traction. When the government performed a U-turn in mid-March the BBC tamely accepted the false No 10 line that its strategy changed because the science had changed.</p> \n<p>More than a week passed before the second phase saw natural journalistic scepticism kick in. Johnson found himself fielding pertinent questions. Did he really think \u201cherd immunity\u201d was either a practical or moral response? Sure, he was relying on the science, but were the scientists on which he was basing his policy right?</p> \n<p>Watching his press conferences, it was possible to sense a growing frustration among the questioning political editors. They were polite, as was he. He took care to name them \u2013 \u201cthank you, Laura\u201d \u2026 \u201cyes, Beth\u201d \u2026 \u201cwhere\u2019s Heather?\u201d \u2013 and, after repeating his central messages about handwashing and social distancing, he passed the trickier inquiries to his scientific wingmen.</p> \n<p>As an exercise in transparency it just about held up, although it didn\u2019t really amount to public accountability because it was impossible for the journalists to be as fierce and forensic as MPs in the Commons during prime minister\u2019s questions. Nor were they able to ask supplementary questions. The problem of dealing with Johnsonian evasiveness became more apparent when the conferences were staged remotely.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of last week came the third phase: overt hostility. It was unsurprising to find the anti-Tory Daily Mirror in the vanguard with its <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/voice-mirror-absence-coronavirus-clarity-21748898\">accusation</a> that Johnson and his government \u201cwere criminally slow to respond to the threat\u201d and lamenting the \u201cmixed messages and an absence of clarity\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the \u201cBoris distancing\u201d took hold even in papers previously sympathetic to the government\u2019s plight and even in those noted as fervent cheerleaders for Johnson. Look, for instance, at the Sun\u2019s unexpectedly pointed criticism in a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11239353/boris-johnson-lock-down-coronavirus/\">leading article</a> which echoed the Mirror\u2019s viewpoint.</p> \n<p>It took Johnson to task for taking far too long in enacting legislation to enforce social distancing. \u201cThe Sun,\u201d it said, \u201chas largely backed the Downing Street response so far \u2026 But there is a shambolic \u2018on the hoof\u2019 feel to it now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another whose faith was shaken, was one of Johnson\u2019s most enthusiastic press supporters, the aforementioned title\u2019s political columnist, Trevor Kavanagh. Looking to a future public inquiry into the handling of the crisis, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/opinion/11241352/boris-johnson-trust-common-sense-coronavirus-trevor-kavanagh/\">he suggested</a> a likely outcome: \u201cIt may be that Boris Johnson was too soft, too trusting, too unwilling to make hard choices.\u201d</p> \n<p>If Kavanagh\u2019s jibe surprised No 10, then the Times\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-boris-johnson-and-coronavirus-war-leader-s5kwgksb8\">leader</a> last Monday must have come as a shock. Johnson\u2019s performance \u201chas been chequered\u201d. Why had he \u201cdisappeared from view\u201d in February? Why had he failed to preside over the first Cobra meeting to discuss the pandemic? Why, even as the scale became apparent, did he not take greater measures? The Times\u2019s conclusion was laced with sarcasm: \u201cThe country needs to know that Mr Johnson has a coherent strategy. Otherwise the prime minister who dreamt of being Churchill may find himself cast as Neville Chamberlain.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the end of the week, the Daily Mail joined the growing chorus of disapproval by accusing the government of having been \u201clamentably behind the curve\u201d and urging it to \u201craise its game \u2026 fast\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/if-germany-can-test-so-many-people-why-cant-we-fbpv83xmm\">The Sunday Times took a similar line</a>. Why had Britain not tested as widely and efficiently as Germany?</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/the-observer-view-on-government-failure-in-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Observer was amazed</a> at the lack of testing kits, as it was with the failure to procure extra stocks of ventilators and personal protective equipment.</p> \n<p>This media criticism should not be viewed as cynical or carping. Newspapers, in company with broadcast news outlets, have been doing their job. By refusing to accept the official narrative, they have disrupted the government\u2019s agenda and, on the positive side, have played a key role in changing the direction of public policy. They held power to account and found it wanting.</p> \n<p>Now, with parliament in recess, their job becomes even more important. They must go on questioning and harrying the prime minister. They have to find a way to ensure that an executive backed by an 81-seat majority does not misuse its own version of self-isolation to pursue the wrong route in the difficult weeks ahead.</p>",
  "<p>The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser.</p> <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.</p> <p>The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election.</p> <p>Boyd said the government was aware of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644968/UK_National_Risk_Register_2017.pdf\">many risks</a> with low likelihoods but potentially very high impacts on the nation, such as pandemics, severe storms and power blackouts. But he said these were assessed independently from one another, underplaying the total risk, which itself was rising due to climate change, population growth and the globalisation of travel.</p> <p>Looked at alone, a pandemic had appeared unlikely, he said. \u201cAs a result, getting sufficient resource just to write a decent biosecurity strategy was tough. Getting resource to properly underpin implementation of what it said was impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd added: \u201cThe middle of a crisis may not be the best time to suggest why we should learn lessons \u2026 But many people are more likely to listen now. Certainly, nothing should distract us from getting ahead of Covid-19. My concern is that we should come out of this much wiser.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS is reported to have failed a government test of its ability to handle a pandemic, though the finding were not made public. Exercise Cygnus, a three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016, examined how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronavirus.</p> <p>According to the Sunday Telegraph, ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment.</p> <p>Boyd said politicians found it tough to deliver large-scale preventive policies to a public unconcerned about major risks. \u201c[They] often talk the talk but find it hard to walk the walk of the changes needed. As they are currently structured, governments are hopelessly underpowered to implement the about-turn needed on policy.\u201d</p> <p>The 2018 biological security strategy, the UK\u2019s first, stated: \u201cThe UK is globally renowned for the quality of our preparedness planning [for] significant biological risks.\u201d It noted that the UK spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, these efforts have not always been as well coordinated as they could have been and we have sometimes failed to approach these issues with an international as well as a domestic perspective,\u201d it said. As a result, \u201cwe may also fail to maximise the impact of our activities or to tackle issues as quickly as we need to\u201d.</p> <p>The strategy said the UK maintained \u201cappropriate stockpiles of clinical countermeasures for diseases of concern\u201d, made it a priority \u201cto protect first responders through ensuring that they are equipped and trained properly\u201d and had \u201ca strong public communications capability to ensure we are able to engage swiftly and clearly with the public about any action they might need to take\u201d.</p> <p>As well as committing to improving government coordination and data sharing, and the communication of risk to the public, the strategy said: \u201cWe will develop a UK government response plan for major international diseases to ensure that the government is fully prepared to respond as quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The UK was ranked second in the world in 2019 by the <a href=\"https://www.ghsindex.org/\">Global Health Security (GHS) Index</a>, with the US first. The independent GHS Index assessed the capability to prevent and mitigate pandemics in 195 countries.</p> <p>In July 2019 the House of Commons joint committee on the national security strategy <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/inquiries/parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health-inquiry-17-19/\">launched an inquiry</a> into preparing for emerging infectious diseases. However, its <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news-parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health1-evidence-19-20/\">first evidence session in October</a> was postponed due to debates on Brexit and the calling of a general election. The December election meant the inquiry was cancelled.</p> <p>Catherine Rhodes, the head of the centre for the study of existential risk at Cambridge University, had been scheduled to give evidence to the MPs\u2019 inquiry. She said the UK had had fairly good pandemic planning in place.</p> <p>\u201cThere does, however, seem to have been a significant gap between recognition of the risk and planning, and action on preparedness,\u201d she said. \u201cIn particular, there could have been much better public communication in advance of the outbreak about the sort of measures that might be necessary in such a situation, and surge capacity in the NHS could have been substantially improved.\u201d</p> <p>Opi Outhwaite, at St Mary\u2019s law school in London, who was also scheduled to give evidence to the inquiry, said: \u2018I think broadly that any government would likely have been overwhelmed by this outbreak.\u201d</p> <p>But she said: \u201cThe risk of an outbreak of this type has been known for some time, while the biological security strategy seemed to have stalled. The response aspect of the strategy focuses a lot on deployment of expertise to other parts of the world. To me this emphasises the idea that we needed to be preparing to respond to outbreaks overseas, with less emphasis on what we would do once an outbreak crossed into the UK.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that we had to experience a pandemic here first-hand to shift the thinking. It\u2019s very noticeable now hypothetical everything [in the strategy] appears.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe UK has well-established and world-leading capabilities for dealing with disease outbreaks and pandemics.

  "<p>In a family photograph taken by his father in 1903, nine-year-old Jacques Henri Lartigue stands on a path in the Bois de Boulogne, in front of his mother and grandmother. He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.</p> <p>Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.</p> <p>When the celebrated American photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Richard Avedon</a> saw Jacques Henri Lartigue\u2019s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2563\">show in 1963</a>, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: \u201cIt was one of the most moving experiences of my life\u2026 You brought me into your world and isn\u2019t that, after all, the purpose of art?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8fd5cd5dd535cdb7e4348d860eaac65b5990ef68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fd5cd5dd535cdb7e4348d860eaac65b5990ef68/0_0_1384_1762/785.jpg\" alt=\"Lartigue\u2019s older brother Zissou in the pool at Rouzat, 1911.\" width=\"785\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s older brother Zissou in the pool at Rouzat, 1911.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri\u2019s offspring amused. He once said: \u201cI have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Lartigue\u2019s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.</p> <p>In her new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lartigue.html\">The Boy and the Belle \u00c9poque</a>, </em>Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue\u2019s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle \u00e9poque.</p> <p>Lartigue\u2019s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e10816ae48017ce8a9b62abfc9b3d35e667affd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e10816ae48017ce8a9b62abfc9b3d35e667affd5/0_0_1831_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Roussel, Rouzat, 1913.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s cousin Simone Roussel, Rouzat, 1913.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.</p> <p>More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family\u2019s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was \u201ca sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator\u201d.</p> <p>Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue\u2019s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/15/-sp-garry-winogrand-genius-american-street-photography\">Garry Winogrand</a> and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls \u201ca new visual language of the 20th century\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2583594184712ee3d37a83efbd4f35421201be96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2583594184712ee3d37a83efbd4f35421201be96/0_0_4134_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna la Pradvina, Bois de Boulogne, 1911 by Lartigue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna la Pradvina, Bois de Boulogne, 1911.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was \u201cto photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats\u201d. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the All\u00e9e des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and \u201cgrand cocottes\u201d \u2013 courtesans like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liane_de_Pougy\">Liane de Pougy</a>, a friend of the novelist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colette\">Colette</a>, and \u00c9milienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII\u2019s lover.</p> <p>Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, \u201cset the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season\u201d. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera\u2019s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another diversion in, as Colette scathingly put it, \u201cthe bustling lives of people with nothing to do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a93409d618715692f65be05fb0e0d9c3db88bef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a93409d618715692f65be05fb0e0d9c3db88bef/0_0_1831_1292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lartigue\u2019s bedroom, 40 Rue Cortambert, 1906.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s bedroom, 40 Rue Cortambert, 1906.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle \u00e9poque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large \u2013 and even more exotic looking \u2013 in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.</p> <p>Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Bl\u00e9riot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e2ce336b46beb6b1a4d56cd149bfd41cb213e68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e2ce336b46beb6b1a4d56cd149bfd41cb213e68/0_0_9449_6506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The French Grand Prix, Circuit de Dieppe, Normandy, 1912.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The French Grand Prix, Circuit de Dieppe, Normandy, 1912.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: All photographs by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere.

The war inevitably curtailed his carefree life, writes Baring, but \u201cLartigue emerged intact, plunging into life with the passions of a child, refusing ever to grow up\u201d.

  "<p>I saw a coronavirus banner the other day that said \u201cCheck in on your five nearest neighbours\u201d, and I thought about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/errol-graham-welfare-uk-benefit-cuts-disability-deaths\">Errol Graham</a>.</p> <p>Back in January, just as China\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak was turning critical, the story broke of how Graham, a grandfather of two and lover of football, had died aged 57. In June 2018, bailiffs pursuing him for nonpayment of his rent had found Graham\u2019s body, which weighed just four and a half stone. A coroner\u2019s report said he suffered from severe social anxiety, and had isolated himself from even family and friends. His flat in Nottingham had no gas or electricity, and there was no food in his fridge apart from two cans of fish that were four years out of date.</p> <p>Eight months before Graham\u2019s body was discovered, his benefits had been stopped after he didn\u2019t attend a fitness for work assessment. Among the items found in his home was a letter addressed to what news reports called \u201cwelfare officials\u201d, pleading with them to \u201cjudge me fairly\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We all know the basics: a population divided into \u2018skivers' and \u2018strivers', and the endless cruelties of \u2018sanctions'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Graham\u2019s case received a lot of attention, not least in the Guardian. But for all the awfulness of his story, it never really caught the popular imagination: at the time it was covered, the media was still aflame with controversy about the opinionated actor Laurence Fox and the fate of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Graham was one particularly tragic example of something that 21st-century Britain has long been in danger of accepting as a given: a nasty, punitive benefits system seemingly run according to the inhuman rhetoric we have regularly heard from politicians \u2013 and still might be hearing, had Covid-19 not arrived.</p> <p>For about a decade now, the cruelties of that system and their consequences have existed in plain sight. We all know the basics: a population divided into \u201cskivers\u201d and \u201cstrivers\u201d, people either ill or disabled summarily judged fit for work, joblessness usually assumed to be the fault of the jobless person, and the endless cruelties of the \u201csanctions\u201d that mean many people have had their benefits arbitrarily suspended, leaving them barely able to survive. In February it was revealed that the National Audit Office had linked at least 69 suicides to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/07/dwp-benefit-related-suicide-numbers-not-true-figure-says-watchdog-nao\">workings of the benefits system</a>, and this number was probably an underestimate.</p> <p>Six weeks later, the fact that people in charge are suddenly speaking a language of solidarity and accepting that unemployment is a consequence of economics rather than character failure is something to behold. Whatever its caveats, Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirus\">plan for people\u2019s jobs and incomes</a>\u201d is welcome; so is hearing him talk about people \u201cnot being able to pay the rent or the mortgage\u201d and \u201cnot having enough set by for food and bills\u201d. There is a truly astral irony in Sunak\u2019s efforts being <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hzeffman/status/1242954230899585026\">saluted</a> by that well-known Tory sympathiser Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless, just about every part of the benefits machine that has ruined so many lives is, inevitably, still in place. We will sooner or later find out if it can survive this huge undermining of its basic logic \u2013 and either grind on or at last be changed.</p> <p>As my colleague Polly Toynbee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/britain-benefits-rishi-sunak-claimants-austerity\">pointed out</a> last week, there will be a very large gap between the communitarian words of politicians and the reality that people new to benefits will discover when they begin trying to access universal credit. This is already becoming clear in the stories of day-long waits on helplines and the mounting sense of a new segment of the population finding that supposed \u201cwelfare\u201d falls far short of what is required to avoid debt, bad housing, ill health and all the rest. Yes, the government has loosened some aspects of universal credit, working tax credits and payments for housing. The Department for Work and Pensions has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-update-benefit-reviews-and-reassessments-suspended\">announced</a> that people receiving benefits will not have to attend the usually compulsory jobcentre appointments for at least three months \u2013 a move that, in theory at least, suspends the sanctions regime. But even these things could sooner or later revert to normal, with consequences that this crisis and its aftershocks will inevitably make worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed\">Universal basic income is the best way to help the self-employed | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When politics returns to normal, nobody on the left should kid themselves that resisting such backward steps will be easy. After all, we are talking not just about policies and systems, but also beliefs that are deeply entrenched in large chunks of the population, and which even this international tragedy might not shift. Notwithstanding a softening of people\u2019s views about the welfare state and support for increasing the minimum wage, recent research from the British social attitudes survey <a href=\"https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39284/bsa35_full-report.pdf\">suggested</a> that when it came to benefits and the needs they cover, we remained a fairly crabby, judgmental country. In 2018, 43% of us accepted the idea that the \u201cgenerosity of welfare benefits creates dependence\u201d. Only 20% of us agreed that unemployed people should receive higher benefits. The kicker, perhaps, was the fact that 56% of respondents agreed that \u201cmost unemployed people could find a job if they really wanted one\u201d, compared with just 17% who disagreed.</p> <p>Outside of major cities, I have heard these things so many times that they have often seemed as unremarkable as the weather. In many cases, they are a dysfunctional sign of the resentments and frustrations sown by insecurity and want. They have been repeatedly stoked by politicians \u2013 most obviously by Conservatives, though rifling through the news archives throws up such memorable headlines as \u201cGordon Brown to crack down on benefit cheats in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d (from 2008). </p> <p>But to some extent, people in Westminster were merely seizing on malign views already present in the<strong> </strong>culture. The most pitiful thing to see was the acceptance of these opinions by people whose experiences showed how misplaced they were. I remember going to the Cheshire town of Warrington eight years ago and, watched by press officers from the Department of Work and Pensions, interviewing a 27-year-old man who had just endured nine months of unemployment. He said he had been averaging 25 to 30 job applications a week, most of which had not even got a reply. \u201cI think I should have applied for more,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have tried more. When you\u2019re feeling down, you start blaming the world for your mistakes \u2026 You feel the world owes you. And it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>If millions of people are suddenly staring into the most uncertain future imaginable, and 500,000 people are suddenly applying for universal credit, will those ideas survive? Put another way, what will happen to the beliefs and prejudices that have defined so much of the last 10 to 15 years, encouraged by politicians chasing votes: mutual suspicion, a manic belief in \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d, and the very British tendency to focus your furies on the people down the street?</p> <p>In his capacity as a newspaper editor, the former chancellor George Osborne last week commissioned a special back page of London\u2019s Evening Standard emblazoned with the slogan \u201cLondon stands together\u201d. God knows, in times as dreadful as these our capital city could do with as much solidarity and mutual care as it can get. But I also wonder about the infamous <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/george-osbornes-speech-conservative-conference-full-text\">speech</a> he made in 2012, all cheap misanthropy and cynicism: \u201cWhere is the fairness, we ask, for the shift worker, leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning, who looks up at the closed blinds of their next-door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits?\u201d While imploring the young and strong to stay in their homes in the interests of the old, infirm and vulnerable, we now want those same neighbours to be embracing their common humanity, and checking on each other\u2019s welfare. We had better hope they will.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Europe is being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-deaths-in-italy-pass-10000-with-889-new-fatalities\">10,000 deaths in Italy</a>. In the grimmest of league tables, Spain comes second. Normal life has been suspended across the continent and the hit to the economy is immense. France\u2019s output is running at two-thirds of what it was last year. Germany has abandoned fiscal rectitude and \u2013 along with the rest \u2013 adopted a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach.</p> <p>Border controls have been erected to stop the flow of people even though this contravenes one of the founding principles of the single market. Rules on state aid to struggling companies have been relaxed. The European Central Bank has embarked on a gigantic asset purchase scheme in an attempt to flood the eurozone economy with cheap money.</p> <p>Jean Monnet, the driving force behind the creation of what was to become the European Union in the 1950s, said that Europe would be <a href=\"https://thewell-travelledpostcard.com/portfolio/europe-will-be-forged-in-crises-how-crisis-has-shaped-eu-integration/\">forged in cris</a><a href=\"https://thewell-travelledpostcard.com/portfolio/europe-will-be-forged-in-crises-how-crisis-has-shaped-eu-integration/\">es</a>, and Covid-19 clearly meets that criterion. The twin health-economic emergency is by far the worst crisis Europe has had to face since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957: worse than the oil shock of the mid-1970s, worse than the banking meltdown of 2008.</p> <p>That, though, was not the end of Monnet\u2019s observation. He went on to say that the sort of Europe that would be forged would depend on the \u201csolutions adopted for those crises\u201d. And, in that respect, the signs have not been good.</p> <p>If ever there was a time for the EU to act as one, for the richer countries to show solidarity with those less fortunate, then this is it. Yet when Italy pleaded for fellow countries to send it medical equipment such as masks, France and Germany not only failed to respond, they placed export bans (since lifted) on the export of the kit Italian hospitals were crying out for. In the end it was left to China to show EU how to respond to a country in dire need.</p> <p>Another problem for Italy is that because of its slow growth and high levels of public debt it has to pay a higher rate of interest on the money the government borrows than is the case for Germany and, when the hospitals in the cities of Lombardy started to fill up with Covid-19 cases, this gap \u2013 or spread \u2013 started to widen. It was therefore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\">deeply unhelpful for Christine Lagarde</a>, the president of the ECB, to say that it was not the job of her institution to \u201cclose bond spreads\u201d.</p> <p>Lagarde, to her credit, quickly recanted and the ECB is now doing its utmost to help Italy and the wider eurozone economy. But the crisis has highlighted the weaknesses of the eurozone: the lack of coordination between monetary policy run by the ECB from Frankfurt and fiscal policy under the control of member states; the lack of a sizeable, single budget; the absence of financial tools that would make a collective approach easier.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">virtual meeting of EU leaders</a> was supposed to come up with a joint approach to the crisis but was instead a complete car crash. One group of countries \u2013 including Italy, Spain and France \u2013 wanted the creation of corona bonds, which would be issued collectively by all eurozone countries.</p> <p>The thinking behind a corona bond is simple. By pooling risk, hard-pressed countries such as Italy and Spain would benefit from the reputation for financial probity of countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Of the money raised, the lion\u2019s share would go to the countries at greatest need and at lower rates of interest than they would have to pay if they were issuing their own national bonds.</p> <p>Yet even in these quite exceptional circumstances, corona bonds proved to be a non-starter. Germany thought Italy should ask for assistance through the European Stability Mechanism, where the money comes with strings attached. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said under no circumstances would he agree to common bonds. For Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other northern European eurozone members, it is a question of moral hazard: the countries that are running big budget deficits will never change their ways if they think they can always borrow on the cheap.</p> <p>The Italians and the Spanish also dug their heels in, preferring for the meeting to end with no agreement rather than accept the stigma of conditionality. So, in time-honoured fashion, the can was kicked down the road, with eurozone finance ministers given a couple of weeks to come up with something.</p> <p>One possible solution would be to get round the moral hazard problem by making the corona bonds a one-off solution to a quite exceptional crisis. If, as is possible, the emergency is relatively short-lived, the Germans and the Dutch ought to be able to support the idea of corona bonds are for 2020 only.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is little doubt which side Monnet would be backing. This is not just about providing a lifeline to Italy, important though that is. Nor is it simply about avoiding the meltdown of already shaky Italian banks, which would have ripple effects across the eurozone. It is about political legitimacy and whether the EU goes forward or backwards.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said at the weekend: \u201cIf Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d\u2019\u00eatre to the people. We are at a critical point in European history.\u201d</p> <p>That just about sums things up.

  "<p>Suzanne Aubert makes quite some entrance. The first minutes of St\u00e9phane Braunschweig\u2019s production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s School for Wives, first seen in 2018, are a slow build-up for the big reveal. In a modern-day gym, Claude Duparfait\u2019s Arnolphe has laid out his creepy scheme to bring up a girl in such seclusion that he may marry her, certain she will be faithful.</p> <p>We\u2019re desperate to see the victim of this social engineering and, when the vast curtain dividing Alexandre de Dardel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatre-odeon.eu/en#3\">Od\u00e9on Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe</a> set is pulled back, we are shocked. Aubert is lying across a bed, idly cutting strips of cotton, her T-shirt scarcely reaching her knickers, her bare legs coyly kicking the air.</p> <p>This Agn\u00e8s makes Arnolphe appear not only as a foolish control freak but as a dangerous sexual predator. It is all our #MeToo anxieties at once.</p> <p>As knockabout comedies go, this one is uncommonly alarming. Indeed, Braunschweig, whose <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-measure-for-measure-royal-lyceum-theatre-1245188.html\">Measure for Measure</a> toured the UK in 1997, gives the whole play a rare psychological depth.

With his trim suit and bended knees, Duparfait plays him like a man comically uncomfortable in his own skin. Yet he also comes across as genuinely distressed by the unravelling of his plan. You almost feel sorry for him.</p> <p>Aubert\u2019s Agn\u00e8s, meanwhile, is every bit the modern woman. Her response to Arnolphe\u2019s patriarchal opinions is to laugh uncontrollably. Who needs a big speech to reply to views so patently absurd?

You\u2019re picking the better of two evils.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump is concerned that a prolonged lockdown might harm his chances of re-election. He agrees.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem,\u201d the president said last week, announcing that America would be \u201copen for business\u201d by Easter.</p> <p>But senior public health officials including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/23/coronavirus-trump-anthony-fauci/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-national%3Ahomepage%2Fcard-ans&amp;tid=lk_inline_manual_3&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, think this is no time to scale back social distancing.</p> <p>If anything, they say, the economy needs to be shut down even further. Otherwise the virus will continue to escalate, inundating hospitals and causing far more deaths. America leads the world in coronavirus cases. Dr Fauci believes we haven\u2019t yet felt the worst of the pandemic.</p> <p>It may seem logical to weigh the threat to public health against the accumulating losses to the economy, and then at some point decide economic losses outweigh health risks. As Stephen Moore, who is advising the White House, warns: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a policy that says we\u2019re going to save every human life at any cost, no matter how many trillions of dollars you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>But this leaves out one big thing. The \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d of economic losses don\u2019t exist on any balance sheet that can be tallied against human lives. An \u201ceconomy\u201d is nothing but human beings. So it matters whose losses we\u2019re talking about \u2013 whose losses of life, and whose losses of dollars.</p> <p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re going to lose a number of people to the flu,\u201d Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to lose more people by putting the country into a massive recession or depression.\u201d</p> <p>Wrong. Recessions and depressions don\u2019t themselves cause people to sicken or die. Their health is imperiled during such downturns if they don\u2019t have enough money to eat, keep a roof over their heads and get needed medical care.</p> <p>Last week, lawmakers took an important step to prevent such hardships. Because unemployment insurance levels in many states are so low, Democrats insisted on a provision in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">$2.2tn coronavirus bill</a> that would provide jobless Americans an additional $600 a week for four months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-economy-health-lives-trump\">The economy v our lives? It's a false choice \u2013 and a deeply stupid one</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Republicans objected that this would boost incomes for some of the unemployed higher than their pay when they worked, the bill was almost scuttled. The Senate vote on the Republican amendment was a hair-raising 47 to 47. But the provision made it into the law.</p> <p>Apparently, Republicans didn\u2019t appreciate that the pay of the typical working American hasn\u2019t increased in decades, adjusted for inflation. So a temporary boost in pay in order to get people to stay home and thereby help slow the spread of Covid-19 is hardly unseemly.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what <em>is</em> unseemly. The \u201ceconomy\u201d the bankers and billionaires are eager to restart had been growing rapidly. But most of its gains had gone into corporate profits, as shown by the meteoric rise of the stock market.</p> <p>The bankers and billionaires now urging Americans get back to work possess a huge share of that stock market. The richest 1% of the population owns roughly half of the value of all shares of stock. (The richest 10% own more than 80%.)</p> <p>So when they recommend Americans get back to work for the sake of the \u201ceconomy\u201d, they\u2019re really urging that other people risk their lives for the sake of the bankers\u2019 and billionaires\u2019 own stock portfolios.</p> <p>While it\u2019s true that we can\u2019t save every human life at any cost, and at some point may have to end the lockdown of America and accept some additional coronavirus casualties, we need to keep in mind whom we are talking about.</p> <p>The trade-off average Americans might make between getting back to work and exposing themselves to the virus is likely to be quite different from the trade-off bankers and billionaires make, especially if average Americans have enough income support to get through the crisis.</p> <p>Four months of extra unemployment benefits may not be enough.

  "<h2>Mark Kermode<br><em><strong>Chief film critic for the Observer since 2013</strong></em></h2> <p>\u201cEvery now and then, in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, when you\u2019ve seen a run of really bad films \u2013 <em>Mighty Pups</em>, say, followed by some terrible Michael Bay movie \u2013 and you\u2019re scuttling from one screening room to another, and it\u2019s raining, and you\u2019ve got a deadline, and you\u2019ve been up since 5am, and you think: \u2018Ohhh, life is so hard!\u2019 But then you go: \u2018Hang on a minute\u2026\u2019\u201d Mark Kermode takes a breath and reflects on his professional fortunes. \u201cWhen I went to the school careers office, they told me I should probably work in an insurance office. Instead,\u201d \u2013 he draws the next six words out for emphasis \u2013 \u201cI watch films for a living. Which is astonishing to me. I should never ever complain about the job that I have, because I have the best job in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Kermode got the job as the<em> Observer</em>\u2019s chief film critic in 2013, taking over from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/01/philip-french-tributes-mark-kermode-clive-james-claire-tomalin\" title=\"\">the late, great Philip French</a>, who was retiring after 50 years in the role. Prior to that, he had written for <em>Time Out</em>, <em>NME</em> and <em>Fangoria</em>, as well as broadcasting about film for the BBC and Channel 4. Each new gig delighted him, but when the <em>Observer</em> first got in touch in 2003, asking him to fill in while French was away, Kermode recalls being \u201ccompletely overwhelmed\u201d by the opportunity. (Aptly, given his love of horror films, his first review was of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/08/features.review\" title=\"\">the Japanese chiller </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/08/features.review\" title=\"\">Dark Water</a></em>.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every week I am filled with the absolute belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every Monday and Tuesday, in normal times, Kermode travels to London from the New Forest, where he lives with his wife, the film studies professor Linda Ruth Williams, and watches eight or nine films in Soho\u2019s screening rooms. He takes notes as he watches \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t use a light-up pen or any of that nonsense, I just taught myself to write in the dark\u201d \u2013 jotting down things that particularly strike him, \u201clike the composition of a shot, or a particular line, or the use of a piece of music, or a striking juxtaposition of scenes\u201d.</p> <p>Agreeing on his film of the week with his editor at the <em>Observer</em>, he gets his notes in order on the train home and writes his column on Wednesday morning. Kermode admits to finding writing \u201cthe most stressful thing on Earth\u201d. After filing at 1pm, \u201cI worry away at it for the rest of the afternoon while subbing queries come in. And then it goes off on Thursday and I am filled with the belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written ever and it will bring the newspaper to its knees. Then it comes out on Sunday and it starts all over again.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of this, Kermode\u2019s love of film criticism runs deep. As a kid, growing up in Hertfordshire, he used to keep notes of all the films he watched. Now, in his home office crammed with movie memorabilia, books and DVDs, he is adamant the form remains as vital and relevant as ever in the social media age.</p> <p>He welcomes one significant change. \u201cThere have always been brilliant female film critics, but I think people finally started to realise that the fact that a room full of the same ageing white blokes wasn\u2019t doing anybody any good.\u201d His <em>Observer</em> deputies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wendy-ide\" title=\"\">Wendy Ide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simran-hans\" title=\"\">Simran Hans</a> are, he says, brilliant. \u201cWorking with them makes me constantly up my game.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201cThe Sunday that the first review I wrote for the <em>Observer</em> came out, I remember sitting with the paper open on the kitchen table, just looking at it going: \u201cI\u2019ve arrived.\u201d I thought to myself, look, I\u2019m in the <em>Observer</em>, I must know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Laura Cumming<br><em><strong>Art critic for the Observer since 1990</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a91b23d22dace6f5d3269ba349e1db173c7b4b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91b23d22dace6f5d3269ba349e1db173c7b4b8a/0_0_4854_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Cumming at home in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Cumming at home in London, in front of a painting by her father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt seems to me it comes in three stages,\u201d says Laura Cumming of the process of reviewing art for the <em>Observer New Review</em>. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s the exhilaration of seeing the show. Then there\u2019s the torture of thinking it through; and finally the torture is relieved by the writing.\u201d</p> <p>Cumming has been working through these stages on an almost weekly basis for more than 20 years. Born in Edinburgh to artist parents, she studied English literature at university and started out as a producer and presenter for the BBC. Her deeply held interest in art was channelled first through radio shows on painting and then through writing for the <em>New Statesman</em> and the <em>Guardian</em> before she became the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s art critic in 1999.</p> <p>Over the years, Cumming has taken great pleasure in witnessing artists embrace \u201cfilm and video and performance and installation and ballet, and every other field that has come into art to enrich it\u201d \u2013 and she still feels exhilarated every time she goes to a gallery. \u201cThe prospect of each new show,\u201d she says, \u201cis like virgin snow.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thank God for deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She prepares by poring over the catalogue and soaking up everything else she can find about the artist, from books to online video clips. Then she goes to a critics\u2019 preview, usually on the weekend before her review comes out. Making notes and sketches with pen and paper, she also uses her phone to \u201cphotograph astonishing details that I know I will never see again \u2013 I\u2019ve got billions of them stored away\u201d.</p> <p>Occasionally, she\u2019ll catch herself saying out loud things like \u201cshocking, shocking\u201d or \u201cfor God\u2019s sake!\u201d, but there\u2019s rarely anyone around to hear it, because, as she acknowledges: \u201cWe see exhibitions when the galleries are completely empty, which is of course both an enormous privilege and an unreality.\u201d</p> <p>Back home, in south London, she commits her notes to laptop and lets it sit, usually overnight, while she wrestles with \u201cthe thinking bit, which is the torture\u201d. Then comes the release. \u201cI write in our bedroom in the loft \u2013 I don\u2019t have a study,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I write a lot in bed, because I don\u2019t really have a desk either.\u201d The words come slowly. Reviewing a Jackson Pollock retrospective early in her career, she spent eight hours writing and rewriting the first paragraph. \u201cSo thank God for deadlines,\u201d she says. \u201cI love deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s striking about her home in Clapham, which I visited before the coronavirus outbreak, is how little art there is on the walls. She has some reproductions of prints, notably \u201ca blow-up of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/26/velazquez-las-meninas-everything-is-happening-extract-michael-jacobs\" title=\"\">Las Meninas</a></em> [by Vel\u00e1zquez] on a big card, which I love looking at\u201d, but otherwise it\u2019s mainly work by her parents \u2013 her father James\u2019s geometrical paintings (an example is in the photograph above), her mother Betty\u2019s tapestries. \u201cI don\u2019t collect art,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not acquisitive. I\u2019m much happier seeing it in its natural state in the wild, in the gallery, rather than in my house.\u201d</p> <p>There are things that dismay her about her field. \u201cOne big change in the past couple of decades,\u201d she says, \u201chas been the crowning of curators \u2013 sometimes you are following a curator\u2019s mind rather than an artist\u2019s.\u201d She is suspicious of the commercial workings of the art world and tries to steer clear of curators, artists and publicists when seeing shows. \u201cOur job,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cis to be critics, not courtiers.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, reviewing for the <em>Observer</em> is a high point of Cumming\u2019s week, which is also taken up by authoring books (<em>On Chapel Sands</em>, her 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/23/on-chapel-sands-laura-cumming-extract-memoir-mother\" title=\"\">memoir-through-photography about her mother</a> has been shortlisted for many awards).

The street\u2019s really quiet; your thoughts are really clear.\u201d</p> <p>Her pre-virus morning routine may prompt howls of jealousy in those working nine to five: she usually sleeps till 10.30. \u201cThat\u2019s the norm \u2013 but I get most done in the evenings, I\u2019m most awake then.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bidisha also finds it rather helpful to have to go out a few nights a week. \u201cI love to work from home because you just get so much more done. But we\u2019re living in a time of increasing atomisation, where we watch films on our laptops, we watch TV on our laptops, we read at home, so being pulled out is incredibly valuable.\u201d</p> <p>Plus writing about dance has a fruitful impact on her own creative practice of making short films: \u201cYou learn so much about how to present something dramatic from dance. It\u2019s teaching me a lot about lighting and music and costume, about editing and storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>If she\u2019s reviewing in the evening, Bidisha will spend the day catching up with life admin before heading to the theatre for 7pm. \u201cI love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She\u2019ll take \u201cvery complete\u201d notes during the performance, so that almost the whole review is in her notebook by the end. Writing it up involves topping and tailing with context and interpretation. \u201cBut I\u2019m very, very against obscurantism,\u201d she says vehemently.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of critics fall into the trap of saying \u2018Well, this Beethoven was nothing like when I saw it in New York in 1974\u2019. It\u2019s a form of willy-measuring, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p> <p>Bidisha\u2019s approach is simply to describe the movement. \u201cPeople think you need a special kind of vocabulary for dance, which you don\u2019t at all. You don\u2019t have to find a story; just sit back and enjoy it. And that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d</p> <p>But for all the joy, criticism is still a job. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped going with friends because they\u2019re a bad influence! We always wound up having two martinis and dinner at 11.

Though he went on to edit <em>Blueprint</em> magazine and review for the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Evening </em><em>Standard</em> \u2013 as well as heading up the Architecture Foundation from 2002 to 2008 \u2013 his early experience helped him appreciate the difficulties of the profession from the inside. \u201cAlthough I criticise architects,\u201d he says, \u201cI think to put up a building that has some kind of intention to it, that realises an idea, is a hugely impressive achievement.\u201d</p> <p>Moore, who joined the <em>Observer</em> in 2010, considers it his job to weigh up \u201cbroader issues around architecture as well as architecture itself\u201d. Instead of simply writing about \u201ca single work by a master of the art form\u201d, he\u2019ll think carefully about the people who move through the building, the area in which it stands, and the social, political and economic factors that shaped it.</p> <p>One unusual aspect of his job is that \u2013 unlike other forms of criticism that, in normal times, depend on a weekly schedule of releases \u2013 it\u2019s not always clear what he\u2019ll write about. Sometimes, in the absence of a new building or exhibition to assess, \u201cit\u2019s a case of making your own story\u201d, he says. Lately, this has meant taking aim at Tory planning policies or surveying architectural responses to the climate crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another difference is that Moore\u2019s job often involves speaking to the people whose work he\u2019s critiquing. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in writing about buildings as magical objects that just appear one day, because they\u2019re always there for a reason, or many reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I talk to people \u2013 clients as well as architects \u2013 and ask them what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>He jots all this down in a notebook and snaps details with his phone, before heading home to write \u2013 ideally over a couple of days so he can take a fresh look at his copy before filing. Having previously worked on daily newspapers with fast turnarounds, Moore finds it \u201ca fantastic luxury on the <em>Observer</em> to be able to take more time over articles\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s susceptible to the odd bit of procrastination \u2013 \u201cI distract myself by looking at football results and the news\u201d \u2013 but when it comes to writing Moore doesn\u2019t seem at all precious. \u201cI can write with noise in the background,\u201d he says, and at home in Whitechapel, east London, \u201cI just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy.\u201d</p> <p>There is plenty of space to wander around in: his home consists of two smallish 1830s terraced houses joined together, with dividing walls removed on the ground floor so that the kitchen opens into a spacious living room with a huge desert-scape by his painter friend Jock McFadyen on the wall.</p> <p>At the back is a long, gently sloping extension which was added to accommodate Moore\u2019s late wife, who was diagnosed with MS in her mid-30s. By 2011, she was using a wheelchair and no longer able to access the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. \u201cThe extension was about giving her everything she needed without any steps,\u201d says Moore.</p> <p>It was also about \u201cenhancing the house rather than the opposite\u201d. When architects design for disability, \u201cthere\u2019s still a bit of an attitude that if you\u2019re fixing somebody\u2019s practical problem, they should be grateful for it,\u201d says Moore, \u201ceven if it\u2019s really ugly and messes up the house.\u201d With this extension, which slopes gracefully down to a bedroom and bathroom, opening on to a garden with decked pathways amid sumac and eucalyptus trees, Moore and his wife, who died in 2017, were challenging that view.</p> <p>In its joyful layering of different periods, the house repudiates one of Moore\u2019s pet hates in architecture. \u201cWhen I started out in the 80s, the dominant narrative was: modern architects have messed everything up,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow lots of people get the idea that modern design can do something for you. But it\u2019s the opposition of modern and old that I find very unhelpful.\u201d</p> <p>Though he expresses strong views in his columns, and mostly regrets \u201cthe ones when I was too nice \u2013 when I tried too hard to be positive in a situation where it wasn\u2019t warranted\u201d, Moore doesn\u2019t regard himself as a \u201cfinal arbiter\u201d on any given project. \u201cI have a viewpoint that I think has a validity, because I know about this subject and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut whatever I write, it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all \u2013 it\u2019s a contribution to an ongoing process of understanding architecture.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>In 1986, after finishing university, he went to Los Angeles to write some magazine articles, which put him in contact with Frank Gehry and other interesting architects. \u201cThe climate in Britain at that time was extremely suspicious of new architecture, so it was really exciting and encouraging to go to California, where there was a very positive view and really interesting things going on. It gave me a lot of faith that new buildings could be good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Susannah Clapp<br><em><strong>Theatre critic for the Observer since 1997</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd77ce7e1efb13ae3a69ed913602df6caeb8cfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd77ce7e1efb13ae3a69ed913602df6caeb8cfed/0_0_4788_3591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susannah Clapp at her home in King\u2019s Cross, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susannah Clapp at her home in King\u2019s Cross, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSideways,\u201d is how Susannah Clapp describes her route into writing about theatre. In 1994, after years of working in and around the publishing industry \u2013 she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/london-review-of-books-at-40-susannah-clapp\" title=\"\">helped found the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/london-review-of-books-at-40-susannah-clapp\" title=\"\">London Review of Books</a></em> and wrote a biography of the writer Bruce Chatwin \u2013 she was asked to review plays for the BBC Radio 3 arts programme <em>Night Waves</em>, a gig that involved dashing straight from the theatre to deliver a \u201cmatch report\u201d on the latest stage action. Moving into print, Clapp reviewed for the <em>New Statesman</em> before becoming chief theatre critic for the <em>Observer</em> in 1997.</p> <p>Having spent so much time focusing on the written word, \u201cit was exciting to work in something which also required you to think about how things <em>looked</em>,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTheatre involves so many different reactions \u2013 acoustic, visual, working out how people\u2019s gestures influence or interrupt what they say \u2013 all of which is instantaneous and can\u2019t be captured instantaneously in a book.\u201d</p> <p>One of her aims, starting out, was to avoid writing literary reviews \u201cwhich suggested that plays were composed of cut-out text walking around the stage\u201d. Instead, she wanted \u201cto write about [characters] as if you\u2019re writing about an enhanced group of friends, or enemies, a hyperactive piece of life, and I suppose that\u2019s joy of it \u2013 that, at its best, theatre either takes you out of your life or further into it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always think about the first thing I\u2019d say to describe a play to a friend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fact that \u201cthere are so many different things going on at the same time\u201d on the stage is endlessly compelling. \u201cEven if you\u2019re squirming with boredom or frustration, you can isolate an element of design, or the one actor who elevates it \u2013 and if it\u2019s simply a travesty, that in itself is interesting.\u201d</p> <p>For her <em>Observer</em> column, Clapp usually reviews three plays per week. This involves a considerable amount of pre-planning \u2013 she keeps a \u201clong, obsessive list\u201d of forthcoming openings around the country. Even when the week ahead has been finalised, she can never be quite sure, until she\u2019s seen them all, which of the three plays will be her lead review. As a result, \u201cthe major part of the writing always gets done at the last minute\u201d.</p> <p>She makes notes in the theatre, \u201cbut they\u2019re often unreadable because I don\u2019t have very good handwriting\u201d, she says. \u201cQuite often, I forget to turn over the page and I find that I\u2019ve written my already indecipherable scrawl on top of something else \u2013 but I hope that the act of writing fixes it in my mind.\u201d She tries to identify her \u201cline\u201d on the play in the same night \u2013 \u201cjust simply, whether I liked it or not. And what is the first thing I would say about this if I were describing it to a friend?\u201d</p> <p>There are a number of small but niggling dilemmas that accompany a theatre critic through her week. The hours are odd \u2013 you\u2019re starting work when others are clocking off \u2013 and the timing of dinner is often fraught. \u201cDo you eat beforehand and risk getting sleepy? On the other hand, if you go hungry, and there\u2019s a play with a lot of eating in it, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s odd, too, rubbing shoulders with fellow critics night after night \u2013 \u201cwe share a vocabulary, we share a task, though we\u2019re not exactly colleagues\u201d \u2013 while having to resist discussing the play at hand, lest it sway your opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most male profession I\u2019ve ever worked in \u2013 much more male and, of course, white than broadcasting or publishing or literary journalism. It\u2019s changing now, but very slowly.\u201d</p> <p>Home is a flat overlooking a square near King\u2019s Cross, London. Here Clapp does most of her writing in her front room, which is lined with play texts, theatrical biographies and reference books, though she sometimes works in a cafe or library. \u201cI am a big believer in walking as writing (or vice versa),\u201d she says. \u201cIf I get stuck, I charge around the square and often find a sentence slips into place. I work out what I think more easily on the hoof \u2013 going to or from the theatre, or emptying the rubbish \u2013 than when stooped over my desk.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/29/theatre\" title=\"\">Punchdrunk\u2019s site-specific production of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/29/theatre\" title=\"\">Faust</a></em> in a warehouse in Wapping \u2013 a meticulously created Edward Hopper world with bubbling test tubes and stinky herbs and extraordinarily fragrant pine forests.

  "<p>It\u2019s been quite a week to have a womb in the UK.</p> <p>First, pregnant women were suddenly <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults\">categorised as vulnerable</a>, and advised to stay home by the government. But then some of them were told to come <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/mothers-say-they-being-kept-at-work-uk-as-fathers-stay-home\">back into work</a> by their employers \u2013 including the riskiest of all, the NHS.</p> <p>This week on my radio programme I heard from the husband of one such pregnant woman who works in our beleaguered health service and simply doesn\u2019t know what to do.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/2020-03-26-covid19-occupational-health.pdf\">official guidelines</a> from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) say that pregnant women should be able to choose whether or not to work, and this decision should be supported by their employers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Simply put, we'd follow what Australia and the US already do: speak to the GP on the phone and take two pills at home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this leaves women working in healthcare with an uncomfortable decision: do they protect the lives of their unborn, or those seeking treatment? Pregnant women are naturally already the most risk-averse group in society. Tell them that you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s safe for them to go to work, so they\u2019d better not go, and they really won\u2019t want to go. It\u2019s an almost impossible choice to be forced to make.</p> <p>Next came the weirdest about-turn from the government \u2013 which, at the time of writing, still hadn\u2019t been explained. Last Monday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, signed off on a decision to allow early medical abortions at home during the pandemic. Simply put, we would follow what Australia and the US already do and allow women to speak to a doctor over the phone, and take two pills at home to perform the procedure. This would ease pressure on clinics and GPs \u2013 and remove the need for anyone to see a practitioner in person.</p> <p>The vast majority of abortions in this country happen in the first few weeks, and so this is the way most procedures take place. The move was welcomed by both the RCM and the RCOG.</p> <p>And yet, a few hours later, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52018805\">it was rescinded</a> with the most meagre of explanations \u2013 that the advice, carefully worded and sent out was \u201cpublished in error\u201d, leaving doctors utterly puzzled. Neither Hancock \u2013 admittedly a man with much on his mind \u2013 or the Department of Health have commented further.</p> <p>Dame Lesley Regan, the former president of the RCOG, shared her fears with me on air: \u201cIf you make abortion difficult for girls and women to access, the problem does not go away. All that happens is that it goes underground and becomes unsafe.\u201d</p> <p>She also said changing the official guidance wouldn\u2019t have made abortion any easier: \u201cWe know that this is incredibly safe and very, very easy. They would just receive their drugs by post, and they would be spoken to on FaceTime or Skype to obtain consent. All of the other precautions will be taken, we\u2019re just trying to cut down on unnecessary travel and unnecessary exposure both in terms of women and hospital and clinical staff.\u201d</p> <p>However, in another U-turn on Sunday, it is understood from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service that Hancock is preparing to reinstate telemedicine for early medical abortions. But it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Confused?</p> <p>At a time when there also are concerns about women and men being holed up together, with difficulty in getting coils fitted and access to the contraceptive pill (which, yes, also still requires a visit to a GP for initial prescription or renewal \u2013 GPs who none of us can easily see or should burden right now), a potential coronavirus baby boom does not naturally mean all of those pregnancies are wanted.</p> <p>In a perverse contrast, consider the deeply unenviable position of those longing for a child, and already into a cycle of IVF, having their <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ivf-cancelled-coronavirus_uk_5e71ee5ac5b63c3b64876837\">embryo transfers cancelled</a>, in some cases just hours before.</p> <p>As someone who has been on that vile journey, drugged up on a toxic cocktail of hormones and hope, having the final stage cancelled is almost too painful to even consider, let alone experience. I spoke to several of those women this week too.</p> <p>One can understand the rationale of NHS IVF clinics needing to pack up shop to lend all support to the coronavirus cause, and the argument that we shouldn\u2019t be helping people have babies at this time \u2013 from both a resource and safety point of view. But is a similar ban going to be placed on the fertile? I think not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/move-in-partner-survive-isolating-without-them-coronavirus\">Can't move in with your partner?

  "<p>It was a tale of two beaches. On Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast, at the height of spring break season, the sand was deserted in the cities of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, where Democratic mayors had <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-coronavirus-fort-lauderdale-beach-20200315-iojqkcdbjndutlnaafntkjwzaa-story.html\">imposed closures</a> to fight the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>Across the narrow neck of the state, the Gulf coast beaches in Clearwater were a world apart.

A day earlier the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had advised against gatherings of more than 50 people, and New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, warned the coronavirus \u201chas already spread much more than you know\u201d.</p> <p>But at the time Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, like most of his 25 Republican peers across the country, did not see cause for alarm, and he has still not closed non-essential businesses statewide, despite <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/03/24/south-florida-medical-professionals-write-letter-to-public-making-plea-to-act-responsibly/\">warnings</a> by medical professionals that coronavirus cases there could \u201cexplode\u201d.</p> <p>Hundreds of US counties and all 50 states now have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">confirmed coronavirus cases</a> \u2013 despite a widespread lack of testing \u2013 underscoring the indifference of the virus to the familiar political boundaries separating red states, dominated by Republicans, and blue ones, dominated by Democrats.</p> <p>But while the virus does not select for party affiliation, contrasting emergency responses at the state and local levels have split dramatically along partisan lines.</p> <p>States with Democratic governors <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/\">have been quicker</a> to declare emergencies, close schools, shutter non-essential businesses and impose limits on bars and restaurants, according to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/\">data</a> collected by the Kaiser Foundation. Fifteen of 21 states to have issued stay-at-home orders have Democratic governors.</p> <p>States with Republican governors, meanwhile, have been less eager to ask businesses to close, and more likely to downplay the threat. \u201cGo to the grocery stores. For crying out loud, go to the grocery stores,\u201d Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia told residents on 16 March. \u201cIf you want to go to Bob Evans and eat, go to Bob Evans and eat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e64fd047abf15c200e6eb4e6e2b0d9c67b5ddb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e64fd047abf15c200e6eb4e6e2b0d9c67b5ddb0/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Stitt, Oklahoma\u2019s Republican governor, declared a state of emergency on 16 March, the day after posting a picture of himself and his two sons in a packed restaurant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Stitt, Oklahoma\u2019s Republican governor, declared a state of emergency on 16 March, the day after posting a picture of himself and his two sons in a packed restaurant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alonzo Adams/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The night before, Oklahoma\u2019s Governor Kevin Stitt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dragonfly_Drama/status/1239271745485332480\">tweeted</a> a picture of himself and his two sons at a restaurant, boasting: \u201cIt\u2019s packed tonight.\u201d The tweet was later deleted.</p> <p>The divergence in state responses to coronavirus does not cleanly split along the red-blue line, with Republican governors in states such as Ohio and Maryland among the most proactive in responding to the threat, said University of Southern California professor Manuel Pastor.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more like the rational states versus the Trump Republican states,\u201d Pastor said.</p> <p>All partisan disagreements in the United States in 2020 seem to emanate from or end with Donald Trump. But the president has encouraged a partisan divide on the coronavirus threat, analysts said, pitting state governors against each other and setting off bidding wars for medical equipment.</p> <p>While states and localities have primary responsibilities for public health under the American system of federalism, the president has an important role in focusing the national attention on the emergency and channeling the massive resources of the federal government to the states most in need, said Lawrence O Gostin, a professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>\u201cThis is something that\u2019s really unprecedented and clearly American federalism is not well equipped to do it. You need every oar to work together. We have fragmentation, name-calling and wildly different responses,\u201d Gostin said.</p> <p>Because past disasters were locally confined, states were able to help each other, by sending firefighters to combat wildfires in California, by sending first responders to help in New York after September 11, or by accepting refugees from Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>\u201cThis is almost like we have a hurricane,\u201d Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has moved aggressively on coronavirus, said on the radio show of the former New Jersey governor on Thursday. \u201cBut it\u2019s hitting every single state in the country at the same time, and it\u2019s been hitting them for 21 days, at least in our state.\u201d</p> <p>Citizens judge the viral threat according to their politics, polling indicates. More Democrats than Republicans have told pollsters they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about coronavirus by a <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ET_VgpgUcAEJ_7k.jpg\">20-point margin</a>. A poll <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21195940/coronavirus-fox-news-poll-republicans-trump\">released</a> on Friday showed that viewers of conservative Fox News, which spent weeks downplaying and dismissing the virus, were much less likely to take the pandemic seriously.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that states can decide particular local issues on a wide range of things allows for such variation,\u201d said Pastor. \u201cThat\u2019s, of course, kind of stupid, in the context of the pandemic, because when one state has lax standards, then you wind up maintaining the infection in another location.\u201d</p> <p>The partisan divide over the pandemic probably stems in part from personal experience, with the worst-hit states so far, including New York, California and Washington, being coastal with large cities and a lot of Democrats. As of Thursday, counties that voted for Trump in 2016 accounted for 45% of the US population but just 19% of all US coronavirus deaths, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1243201775869530113\">analysis</a> by Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6c8675a3baf0b8f9bfc80054d3cfd3e4170059b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c8675a3baf0b8f9bfc80054d3cfd3e4170059b/0_136_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Desolate streets are seen in Dayton, Ohio, on Tuesday.

Governors in some non-coastal states have taken aggressive action against the virus, including Kentucky\u2019s Andrew Beshear, a Democrat, and Ohio\u2019s Mike DeWine, a Republican.</p> <p>While Kentucky was quick to set up lab testing for the virus and declared a state of emergency on 6 March, the governor nextdoor, Republican Bill Lee of Tennessee, waited a week longer to declare a state of emergency.</p> <p>In Ohio, DeWine became one of the first governors in the country to order bars and restaurants to close and limit large gatherings, while the Democratic governor of neighboring Michigan was <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2020/03/ohio-has-247-coronavirus-cases-compared-to-787-in-michigan-compare-timeline-of-restrictions.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=mlive_sf\">slower to issue restrictions</a>. As of last week, Ohio had recorded 351 cases, compared with 1,035 for Michigan \u2013 although variations in testing obscure the picture.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to talk about a Covid epidemic in the United States,\u201d said Gostin. \u201cWe\u2019d have to say it\u2019s Covid epidemics. Because the epidemics will vary state by state, and the response will vary state by state.\u201d</p> <p>It is \u201ccrucially urgent\u201d for the Trump administration to coordinate aid for the states and for the president to use his bully pulpit to focus the national attention, said Gostin.</p> <p>\u201cThat should have been happening several weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we wait without having a properly coordinated national approach the worse the disaster will unfold in the United States.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On the face of it, the map of Europe\u2019s struggle with coronavirus suggests the prospects for the eastern half of the continent are much less grim than for the western half.</p> \n<p>The combined death toll to date across more than a dozen countries is less than the number of fatalities on any given recent day in Italy. The highest numbers of infections are in the Czech Republic and Poland, with 2,541 cases and 1,638 cases respectively, still a fraction of the numbers in most western European countries.</p> \n<p>Partly this could be down to lockdown measures introduced at an early stage in the outbreak. The Czech Republic imposed a strict lockdown two weeks ago, while at the same time Poland cancelled almost all flights in and out of the country. Polish authorities were also quick to close bars, restaurants, cinemas and schools. Police vehicles with mounted loudspeakers blare recorded messages urging people to stay at home.</p> \n<p>But there is also a worry that the figures in some countries are deflated by a much lower testing rate than in western Europe. Hungary, for example, has conducted less than a quarter of the number of tests that neighbouring Austria has, despite having a slightly larger population. Britain, where lack of testing is also a serious concern, has conducted many more tests per capita than most countries in eastern Europe, with a few exceptions, notably the Czech Republic which has tested widely.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course, the low number of confirmed cases has to do with the low amount of testing. I have a colleague who has symptoms, he has stayed at home for the past five days and he hasn\u2019t been tested yet,\u201d said one doctor at a Budapest hospital who asked to speak anonymously.</p> \n<p>If and when the expected surge in cases does come, there is a fear that struggling and underfunded health services across the region could buckle. While concerns over outdated facilities and a lack of protective equipment are certainly not unique to central and eastern Europe, they could be particularly acute here.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t have enough protective equipment,\u201d said the doctor in Budapest. Although there had been only 343 confirmed cases in Hungary, she said there was already a shortage of equipment for doctors working with coronavirus patients.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-39025ZidS5LI3b4x/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-39025ZidS5LI3b4x/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Regulations have recently changed in her hospital, she said, meaning that only those doctors spending an hour or more with coronavirus patients are eligible to wear FFP2 masks offering high levels of protection. Those who spend less than an hour with patients receive only a simple surgical mask.</p> \n<p>Similar issues have been raised across the region, especially outside capital cities.</p> \n<p>\u201cHelp us, we don\u2019t have gloves, masks, overalls, disinfectant or the money to pay for them,\u201d Barbara G\u0105siorowska, the director of a hospital in a small town south of Warsaw, pleaded in a Facebook post last week.</p> \n<p>In one disastrous case in Suceava, Romania, the city\u2019s hospital was closed after nearly 100 medical staff contracted the virus. Romania is particularly vulnerable to a health crisis: the country has faced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/romanian-hospitals-in-crisis-as-emigration-take-its-toll\">chronic shortage of doctors for years</a>, with thousands leaving for better paid jobs abroad.</p> \n<p>To help with shortages of equipment, governments across the region have turned to Beijing. Over the past week the Czech and Hungarian prime ministers have personally met planes carrying equipment from China on the airport tarmac in Prague and Budapest.</p> \n<p>On Thursday a plane containing 150 respirators, 600,000 medical masks and more than 250,000 medical overalls arrived in Warsaw. On Friday the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borisov, announced he had struck a deal with China to purchase 50 respirators and 1.1m masks.</p> \n<p>There have also been promises to scale up testing, with Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, pledging the country will move to a model of mass testing on the advice of Chinese medical experts. But increasing the number of tests requires laboratory capacity that may not be present.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if we had more tests, we don\u2019t have the people to do them,\u201d Gra\u017cyna Cholewi\u0144ska, a Polish consultant specialising in infectious diseases, told the Polska Times this month. Romania\u2019s health minister resigned on Friday, two days after making the implausible promise that the government would test the entire 2 million population of Bucharest. So far Romania has carried out 12,000 tests.</p> \n<p>Authorities have tried to silence medics who raise concerns in public. In Poland, a nurse was dismissed by the director of her hospital for publishing an angry account on Facebook in which she described a chronic shortage of essential equipment and other irregularities.</p> \n<p>In Bulgaria, four doctors who complained about a lack of resources were reprimanded by the police for speaking out and \u201cspreading panic\u201d. In Hungary, several doctors contacted by the Guardian said they had been warned by their hospital bosses in the strictest terms against speaking to the media.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is also a fear that emergency coronavirus measures across the region could lead to the further erosion of democratic norms in the long term. Legislation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/hungary-to-consider-bill-that-would-allow-orban-to-rule-by-decree\">due to be passed in Hungary on Monday</a> will give the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the potential to rule by decree with no time limit or sunset clause. It also introduces jail terms for people who spread false information, and there are fears the law could be used to stifle critical reporting of the government response to the crisis.</p> \n<p>In Bulgaria, the leader of the opposition Socialist party, Kornelia Ninova, lamented the suspension of parliament during the state of emergency as \u201cthe first step towards dictatorship\u201d.</p> \n<p>In Poland, the government has insisted it will go ahead with presidential elections on 10 May despite the pandemic. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the Polish parliament passed an amendment to the electoral code allowing senior citizens and anyone in quarantine to use postal voting. The opposition has called for a postponement, saying it will be impossible to campaign during a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Amid the political manoeuvring, the region is nervously awaiting the inevitable rise in cases and hoping the early lockdowns will help avoid Italian-style carnage.

And by allowing the ability to consult a number of patients in the comfort of their own room, in their own home, in their own isolation, will allow a significant reduction in the amount of PPE required by doctors, nurses and all other frontline healthcare workers that will be taking part in telehealth.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:48:56.052Z\">at 6.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8031188f0878a2a48ac4d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:26:26.124Z\">6.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the past 24 hours Victorian police say they have conducted 1,430 checks that people are complying with quarantine rules.</p> \n  <p>That included 139 checks on returned travellers.

Next Saturday, New Zealand nationals will also be offered access to this flight.</p> \n  <p>People on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2712912542154556/\">Australians stranded in Nepal</a> Facebook page say they fear they will be trapped in the country because they cannot afford a ticket, or reach Kathmandu in time for the flight.</p> \n  <p>Michael Bonner, an Australian aid worker with Three Angels Nepal, a non-government organisation, said between 80 and 100 people turned up at the embassy at 9am Saturday local time hoping to organise a ticket home. He said many more were stranded in the Himalayas and other parts of the country and unable to reach Kathmandu in time because roads were closed.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a couple of hundred people who will make this flight and another couple of hundred stranded as the situation in the country deteriorates,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>He called on the government to delay the flight to give more Australians time to reach the capital.</p> \n  <p>In response to concerns expressed on the Facebook page, the Australian ambassador to Nepal, Pete Budd, said he understood people were frustrated, and the embassy had tried to achieve economies of scale by securing the largest possible aircraft.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMany Australians have been stretched financially having paid for bookings that were subsequently cancelled. The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle.

Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days.</p> \n  <p>And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke.</p> \n  <p>Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses.</p> \n  <p>People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills.<br>Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords.<br>A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem.<br><br>After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers.</p> \n  <p>This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works.</p> \n  <p>Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done.</p> \n  <p>On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew.</p> \n  <p>And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t.</p> \n  <p>Yes, these are hard problems to solve.

  "<p>Care home managers are refusing to accept elderly people discharged from NHS hospitals owing to coronavirus fears, and one has said government-issued protective equipment for residents and staff is \u201ccompletely useless\u201d.</p> \n<p>David Steedman, the manager of Arlington House care home in Sussex, said he had five empty rooms but he was not taking in people discharged from hospital as it would be \u201cmadness\u201d to expose residents and staff to the risk of infection.</p> \n<p>On Friday it was announced that every social care provider in the country would receive deliveries of personal protective equipment including masks. Social care workers will start being tested for coronavirus along with NHS staff from next week.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe personal protective equipment issued for staff is laughable,\u201d Steedman said. \u201cThese masks, as well as having an expiry date of 2016, are the sort of flimsy, paper thing that dentists wear with gaps all round the edges. The instructions say they should be used if a resident has symptoms of the virus or actually has it. But these masks are completely useless in those situations.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe government needs to take a reality check if they genuinely think otherwise. The hospitals are desperately trying to empty beds so they can take new people in, who have the virus, but we can\u2019t help them because they don\u2019t have the equipment to test those they\u2019re discharging.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>NHS trusts have been trying to discharge patients to free up capacity.

It would be dangerous foolishness on my part to accept any hospital discharges who might bring the virus into our home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, said Steedman and other care home managers he knew of who were also refusing to accept NHS discharges should be praised for their stance. \u201cCare homes simply can\u2019t afford to let anyone in unless they\u2019re confirmed not to be carrying the virus. The consequences of doing otherwise are just too awful to consider,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cCare homes are going into crisis mode because the second there\u2019s a symptom of the virus in the home, there are layers upon layers of failure from the state to support them. The state is failing to test residents or staff quickly enough and they\u2019re failing to issue suitable equipment.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe failures are particularly shameful because not only are these people who have spent their lives paying into the system and deserve dignity, but the equipment is simple and straightforward and the state should be able to supply it.\u201d</p> \n<p>A senior director at a London acute trust, who asked not to be named, told the <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/nhs-told-to-up-its-game-in-helping-social-care-respond-to-crisis/7027193.article\">Health Service Journal</a>: \u201cThere\u2019s a real problem with private care homes refusing to take patients back unless they\u2019ve been tested for Covid-19. But [testing] is not the national guidance currently and there just aren\u2019t enough testing kits to do it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m now on calls with commissioners about getting more people out of hospital and into the community, and they\u2019re saying: \u2018Yes, that\u2019ll be done in the next week,\u2019 and I\u2019m on the verge of screaming at them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another acute sector director in north-west England said: \u201cWe need care homes to be really robust. We\u2019ve been hearing from colleagues that nursing homes won\u2019t accept their residents back after they\u2019ve been discharged from hospital, unless they\u2019ve been fully swabbed for coronavirus. This is not the national guidance, and we aren\u2019t able to do that right now.

Hancock, who is in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, said the government was committed to doing \u201cwhatever is needed\u201d for social care and the NHS, including allowing workers from both sectors free parking in council-owned spaces.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhilst many people are now staying at home, I know that is not an option for most of you as your work caring for others cannot be done from home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will do all we can to make your lives easier during this period, including, for example, making parking on council-owned on-street spaces and car parks free for those who work in social care. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe are committed to doing whatever is needed; that promise applies just as much to social care as it does for the NHS.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Last September, I met the vice-president for risk for a Fortune 100 company in Washington DC. I asked the executive \u2013 who previously had a long career as an intelligence analyst \u2013 the question you would ask any risk officer: \u201cWhat are you most worried about?\u201d Without pausing, this person replied, \u201cA highly contagious virus that begins somewhere in China and spreads rapidly.\u201d This vice-president, whose company has offices throughout east Asia, explained the preventive mitigating steps the company had subsequently adopted to counter this potential threat.</p> <p>Since the novel coronavirus has swept the world, I have often thought about this person\u2019s prescient risk calculus. Most leaders lack the discipline to do routine risk-based horizon scanning, and fewer still develop the requisite contingency plans. Even rarer is the leader who has the foresight to correctly identify the top threat far enough in advance to develop and implement those plans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/trump-narcissism-american-blood-coronavirus\">Trump's narcissism has taken a new twist. And now he has American blood on his hands | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Suffice it to say, the Trump administration has cumulatively failed, both in taking seriously the specific, repeated <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-intel-agencies-warned-rising-risk-outbreak-coronavirus-n1144891\">intelligence</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/488763-intel-reports-going-back-to-january-warned-of-coronavirus-threat\">community</a> warnings about a coronavirus outbreak and in vigorously pursuing the nationwide response initiatives commensurate with the predicted threat. The federal government alone has the resources and authorities to lead the relevant public and private stakeholders to confront the foreseeable harms posed by the virus. Unfortunately, Trump officials made a series of judgments (minimizing the hazards of Covid-19) and decisions (refusing to act with the urgency required) that have needlessly made Americans far less safe.</p> <p>In short, the Trump administration forced a catastrophic strategic surprise onto the American people. But unlike past strategic surprises \u2013 Pearl Harbor, the Iranian revolution of 1979, or especially 9/11 \u2013 the current one was brought about by unprecedented indifference, even willful negligence. Whereas, for example, the 9/11 Commission <a href=\"https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf\">Report</a> assigned blame for the al-Qaida attacks on the administrations of presidents Ronald Reagan through George W Bush, the unfolding coronavirus crisis is overwhelmingly the sole responsibility of the current White House.</p> <p><a href=\"https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch8.htm\">Chapter 8</a> of the 9/11 Commission Report was titled, The System Was Blinking Red. The quote came from the former CIA director George Tenet, who was characterizing the summer of 2001, when the intelligence community\u2019s multiple reporting streams indicated an imminent aviation terrorist attack inside the United States. Despite the warnings and frenzied efforts of some counter-terrorism officials, the 9/11 Commission determined \u201cWe see little evidence that the progress of the plot was disturbed by any government action \u2026 Time ran out.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\">reported</a> on the steady drumbeat of coronavirus warnings that the intelligence community presented to the White House in January and February. These alerts made little impact upon senior administration officials, who were undoubtedly influenced by President Donald Trump\u2019s constant derision of the virus, which he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html\">began</a> on 22 January: \u201cWe have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d</p> <p>By now, there are three painfully obvious observations about Trump\u2019s leadership style that explain the worsening coronavirus pandemic that Americans now face. First, there is the fact that once he believes absolutely anything \u2013 no matter how poorly thought-out, ill-informed or inaccurate \u2013 he remains completely anchored to that initial impression or judgment. Leaders are unusually hubristic and overconfident; for many, the fact that they have risen to elevated levels of power is evidence of their inherent wisdom. But truly wise leaders authentically solicit feedback and criticism, are actively open thinkers, and are capable of changing their minds. By all accounts, Trump lacks these enabling competencies.</p> <p>Second, Trump\u2019s judgments are highly transmissible, infecting the thinking and behavior of nearly every official or adviser who comes in contact with the initial carrier. Unsurprisingly, the president surrounds himself with people who look, think and act like he does. Yet, his inaccurate or disreputable comments also have the remarkable ability to become recycled by formerly honorable military, intelligence and business leaders. And if somebody does not consistently parrot the president\u2019s proclamations with adequate intensity, they are fired, or it is leaked that their firing could be imminent at any time \u2013 most notably the recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-fauci.html\">report</a> of the president\u2019s impatience with the indispensable Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An initial incorrect assumption or statement by Trump cascades into day-to-day policy implementation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And, third, the poor judgments soon contaminate all the policymaking arms of the federal government with almost no resistance or even reasonable questioning. Usually, federal agencies are led by those officials whom the White House believes are best able to implement policy. These officials have usually enjoyed some degree of autonomy; not under Trump. Even historically non-partisan national security or intelligence leadership positions have been filled by people who are ideologically aligned with the White House, rather than endowed with the experience or expertise needed to push back or account for the concerns raised by career non-political employees.</p> <p>Thus, an initial incorrect assumption or statement by Trump cascades into day-to-day policy implementation.</p> <p>The same Post report featured the following stunning passage from an anonymous US official: \u201cDonald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were \u2013 they just couldn\u2019t get him to do anything about it. The system was blinking red.\u201d That latter passage is an obvious reference to that aforementioned central finding of the 9/11 Commission Report.</p> <p>Given that Trump concluded early on that the coronavirus simply could not present a threat to the United States, perhaps there is nothing that the intelligence community, medical experts employing epidemiological models, or public health officials could have told the White House that would have made any difference. Former national security adviser Henry Kissinger is <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=F7wYAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22You+warned+me,+but+you+didn%E2%80%99t+convince+me%22&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiLrbq8grboAhVUlXIEHdacB6kQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22You%20warned%20me%2C%20but%20you%20didn%E2%80%99t%20convince%20me%22&amp;f=false\">reputed</a> to have said after an intelligence community warning went unrecognized, \u201cYou warned me, but you didn\u2019t convince me.\u201d Yet, a presidential brain trust wholly closed off to contrarian, though accurate, viewpoints is incapable of being convinced.</p> <p>The White House detachment and nonchalance during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak will be among the most costly decisions of any modern presidency. These officials were presented with a clear progression of warnings and crucial decision points far enough in advance that the country could have been far better prepared. But the way that they squandered the gifts of foresight and time should never be forgotten, nor should the reason they were squandered: Trump was initially wrong, so his inner circle promoted that wrongness rhetorically and with inadequate policies for far too long, and even today.

And they are warm. And dry.</p> <p>Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s booze palaces are pie-and-a-pint flophouses for the daytime diaspora of the austerity era, where inexpensively nourished customers are hypnotised by bespoke and quite brilliant regionally specific carpet designs and beguiling guest ales, before being seduced by slogan-strewn anti-EU beermats while at their most mentally pliable.</p> <p>One can hardly blame Tim Wetherspoon for making the scientifically unverified claim, on <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-wetherspoons-boss-says-over-the-top-to-shut-pubs-11960778\">Sky News on Friday 20 March</a>, that there had \u201cbeen hardly any transmission in pubs\u201d. If, like me, you have contentedly spent entire days in Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s premises, you will know they are magical environments where the laws of science are routinely defied, leaving customers unsure of how they got home, which kind of pie they ate, or even of who they are. And Tim Wetherspoon himself fronted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/10/wetherspoon-tim-martin-brexit-leave-agm-corporate-governance\">factually fluid Brexit campaign</a>, endorsed and abetted by our current prime minister, that eschewed evidence and experts as if they were the sort of things only traitors valued.</p> <p>But experts are suddenly back in fashion with a vengeance, emerging blinking from the hidden priest holes of the academic institutions that sheltered them during the public book-burnings of the Brexit campaign, waving their statistics and their strategies like prayer flags.

  "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LamornaAsh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lamorna Ash</a> has a hunch about seasickness: a conviction that there could be more than one reason why a person might feel suddenly queasy up on deck. \u201cA fisherman told me that his cousin never used to suffer from seasickness at all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then he had kids, and suddenly he did. I thought this was fascinating. It made me wonder whether seasickness isn\u2019t somehow connected to things that tie you to the land. Could it be that the more of those things there are, the more likely you are to suffer from it? Perhaps it functions a bit like homesickness in that way.\u201d Struck by her own fancifulness, she flashes me a smile. \u201cWell, anyway\u2026 I like that as a way of thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>When she was 22 and studying for a master\u2019s degree in social anthropology at University College London, seasickness was briefly Ash\u2019s closest companion. Having decided to devote her thesis to the way that fishing shapes a community, she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall \u2013 which is where she met Don, the skipper of a rusty old trawler called the Filadelfia. Would Don consider taking her out in his boat, so that she might stand, as it were, in \u201cthe same wellies\u201d as his crew? Somewhat to her amazement \u2013 women are supposed to bring bad luck at sea \u2013 he said that he would, and so it was that one evening in 2017 she found herself rounding Land\u2019s End just as the sun was about to set, her stomach a tight knot of nerves, her eyes already red from the salt-licked wind. \u201cI\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t think too hard about things before I do them,\u201d she says. \u201cI seem not to be very cautious; I get overexcited. But that day, yes, I was nervous. I was very scared of seasickness. Not so much of being sick itself, but of it being so bad that I would be useless and they would have to take me home. I didn\u2019t want to do anything to jeopardise their trip; I knew that would cost them a lot of money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1/0_2509_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"don the skipper of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don, skipper of the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, she was sick, but only once. \u201cYou start yawning,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re going to go, and you don\u2019t want the men to see because it\u2019s such a sign of weakness.\u201d Most of the time, however, she was able to manage her constant, raging nausea with a combination of seasickness pills and hard work; among other things, she learned to gut every kind of fish, holding the gasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands even as she struggled properly to stand upright. Life on a trawler is hard, the days long and tough and extremely cold, and thanks to this she found that she was always hungry for the vast meals the crew cooked and ate down below, sickness or no sickness.</p> <p>As for the things that tied <em>her</em> to the land \u2013 her parents, her friends \u2013 she learned not to think of them. It embarrasses her now to remember the moment when, not long after they had set sail, she asked Don for the Filadelfia\u2019s wifi code. (\u201cDo you know how much that costs at sea?\u201d he told her, with a laugh.) Her phone useless in the pocket of her oilskins, she found that time deepened at sea. She learned to speak a new language, one at once both more reticent than the English spoken on land and yet, in some ways, more open, too. In the wheelhouse, talking to Don or one of the other men while they were on watch \u2013 on a trawler, you\u2019re potentially only ever seconds from catastrophe; hit an old anchor or some submarine cables, and the vessel can easily capsize \u2013 she learned to listen to the long, meditative gaps between sentences, spaces that allowed words to \u201cexpand and drift\u201d in ways that rendered them altogether more meaningful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"lamorna ash on board the newlyn trawler\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filadelfia freedom: Lamorna Ash on board the Newlyn trawler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did the world of the Filadelfia feel very male? Was it unnerving to sleep in her bunk \u2013 its size and shape made her think of a coffin \u2013 alongside all those snoring, hairy, briny men? \u201cI didn\u2019t especially experience it like that, no,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were older than me; they\u2019re family guys, and their women are very strong. The biggest fishing family in Newlyn, the Stevensons, has a matriarch at the head of it. I never felt unsafe, though now and then I would ask one of them: <em>would you say that to a man? </em>But I did want to prove myself a bit. I was never going just to sit there and make notes and take photographs.\u201d Ash studied English at Oxford, and Don made her think of Singleton, the old sailor on Joseph Conrad\u2019s Narcissus: the men who could understand Singleton\u2019s silences were, she recalled, those mariners who \u201cknew how to exist beyond the pale of life\u201d. Staring out into the blue-black, she realised on that first night aboard the Filadelfia that she and its crew had now themselves moved beyond the pale: a confined, almost monastic existence, and yet an unencumbered, roaming one, too \u2013 and so began what she thinks of today as the richest and most vast experience of her life so far.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s eight-day stint on the Filadelfia forms the spine of her first book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-salt-clear-9781526600011.html\">Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town</a></em>; artfully, she returns to it again and again, to the point where you come to believe she must always have known she would one day put the experience between hard covers. But this was, she insists, never her plan. Her thesis complete, she was interning at the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> when a publisher spotted a piece she had written about a trip she took on another trawler, the Crystal Sea \u2013 that publisher asked to meet her, and duly gave her a book deal (she now works for an educational charity). And in person, it\u2019s impossible not to take her at her word. I\u2019m amazed and slightly shocked when she reveals that she spent, in total, just three and a half months in Newlyn; something about her book \u2013 the intimacy of the encounters it describes; the epic quality of her account of life on the Filadelfia \u2013 leads you to imagine that she must have lived there for a year at least, and possibly much longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"catch of the day on the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catch of the day on the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She and I meet in Penzance. She has been in Newlyn all weekend, seeing old friends and mooching around, and when I get off the train on a bright Monday afternoon, she pitches up in a long coat and with a ravishing new pixie haircut looking like someone who is slightly drunk on fresh air. For both of us, London and Covid-19 suddenly seem very far away. We can breathe. St Michael\u2019s Mount casts its usual spell out in the bay (24 hours later, the National Trust will announce that it is now closed to the public). <a href=\"https://jubileepool.co.uk/\">The Jubilee Pool</a>, Penzance\u2019s celebrated art deco saltwater lido, looks strangely inviting even in mid-March. The people, mostly retired, that we pass as we walk along the promenade are unhurried and smiling.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s important not to take things at face value. Ash has a family connection to this part of Cornwall; she spent her childhood holidays in Lelant, near St Ives, where her mother\u2019s side of the family has lived for generations. But if those times were idyllic \u2013 her mother, a former actor who once appeared in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark\">Poldark</a></em>, was always encouraging her to let her imagination run wild as they walked on the beach \u2013 Cornwall has, of course, a darker side: chiaroscuro shades that she learned to see (\u201canother way of looking\u201d) more clearly during her time in Newlyn.</p> <p>Though the town is one of the most profitable fishing ports in Britain, it is also poor. In 2015, the mean gross annual salary in Penzance, of which Newlyn is a part (the two merge almost seamlessly together nowadays), was \u00a326,788, compared with \u00a334,265 in the rest of the country. Penzance is literally the end of the line, as anyone who has travelled there by train will know, and Newlyn sits at the far side of a county that in 2017 had the 10th highest numbers of homeless people in the country, and the third highest suicide rate in the UK. Cornwall is the only county poor enough to have qualified for EU emergency funding \u2013 a sad fact that did very little to change its implacable determination to vote for Brexit (the <a href=\"https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/brexit/\">leave vote in the county</a> was 56.5%).</p> <p>In Newlyn, Ash carefully points out the sights to me. Here is the fish market, where she once spent a morning unpacking catch after catch, her fingers so cold she could not feel them (stored in ice, the lemon sole were the hardest to break apart); here is the Swordfish Inn, AKA the Swordy, where she used to drink with her new fishermen friends (it was once ranked second in a TV documentary entitled <em>The Toughest Pubs in Britain</em>); and here is the little house where she lodged with a couple she came to think of as her guardian angels, Denise and Lofty (Denise worked in a fishmongers; Lofty is a ship chandler). Finally, we go past Newlyn\u2019s lifeboat station and out on to the pontoons in the harbour to look at the boats. The creaking Filadelfia has, she says, finally given up the ghost, but there are two trawlers here that look just like it: rough, industrial vessels with huge derricks from which their nets drag. In her book, she likens these boats to prehistoric birds with skeletal wings, and as we gaze at them, clanking and inhospitable, it isn\u2019t hard to see why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672/0_0_6500_4338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the swordfish inn at newlyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Swordfish Inn, Newlyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Hawkins Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newlyn has the largest number of vessels in its administration of any port in the UK, 88% of which are \u201c10 metres and under\u201d inshore fishing boats \u2013 and the harbour looks busy to me, if not exactly bustling. And yet, as Ash writes in <em>Dark, Salt, Clear</em>, over the years \u201cthe pontoons\u2019 leaves have become sparser \u2013 a deciduous tree living a perpetual winter\u201d. The number of fishing vessels nationally has fallen by 29% since 1996. The money needed to buy and maintain a boat, and the cost of fuel, grows ever higher; combined with expensive struggles over quotas, these things have worked to put off a new generation from following their parents into the industry (though a trawler man can earn a good living, depending on the type of boat he has, and how good the fishing is in his waters). Does she feel Newlyn could survive a future without fishing? She shakes her head. \u201cYou know what they say: for every man at sea, there are three people [connected to the industry] on land. The guys I was with in the pub last night: one was a filleter, one works at the auctions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The men take a misanthropic pleasure in telling you how awful it is.

They can\u2019t give it up</p> <footer> <cite>Lamorna Ash</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The men\u2019s relationship with their work, as she learned over the course of many late-night conversations, is complicated. They\u2019re extremely proud of what they do; their sense of identity is entirely bound up with it. But many of them seem to hate it, too. \u201cThey take a kind of misanthropic pleasure in telling you how awful it is,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also addictive, I think. They can\u2019t give it up.\u201d She understands this: \u201cEven now, I still love to go on to the AIS system [the automatic identification system that tracks the movements of boats out at sea] on my laptop.\u201d Do the men want their children to follow them into fishing? \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture. A lot don\u2019t. There is a sense of it being a hard life, but there\u2019s also sadness when a boat that has been in a family for generations suddenly isn\u2019t any more. It can be heart-wrenching [for a young person] to say: I can\u2019t live here, I can\u2019t do what my dad did, my education will take me elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI met a guy who, when he was 12, used to run off on a boat. \u2018See you in a week, Mum,\u2019 he would say, once it was too late for her to do anything about it. It was a brilliant escape, a rite of passage. The older men were heroes for him, and he wanted to be like them. Fishing comes with many frustrations. The men hate throwing fish off the boat [to stay within EU quotas], and there have been low points when there was very little money in it. It\u2019s very precarious. What if you can\u2019t go out? You\u2019re dependent on the weather, especially if you\u2019re a small boat: a crabber, say. But on the other hand, there are not many industries where you can rise up so high.\u201d Is being a skipper a bit like being a king? Or a God? She laughs. \u201cYes, maybe it is.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit is mentioned only rarely in her book; its politics are deliberately oblique. But the subject came up a lot while she was in Newlyn. The first trawler she went on, the Crystal Sea, was part of the Brexit flotilla that sailed into London in 2016 (organised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/15/no-deal-brexit-buccaneers-make-waves-on-the-tyne-nigel-farage\">Fishing for Leave</a>, it sailed from Ramsgate to Westminster, demanding that Britain take back control of its waters; under the common fisheries policy, European fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds up to 12 nautical miles from the coasts of member states). \u201cIts crew spoke about \u2018our seas\u2019, which always felt bonkers to me. Fish migrate, and when you\u2019re out there\u2026 the sea is vast. It feels as though it belongs to everyone. But we had good debates. They were kind of vital for me. They made me see that arguments about waters are very complicated; I stopped assuming that a certain point of view was right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"seaview from the deck of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the deck\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the fishermen aren\u2019t dumb; they\u2019re not, by her telling, particularly hopeful that Brexit, even now it is agreed, will necessarily work to their benefit. After all, the fishing industry makes up only about 0.05% of the UK\u2019s GDP, and employs fewer than 12,000 people. \u201cI think they\u2019re preparing for disappointment,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the sense that they are always sold down the river. Politicians use them for a cause, and then they drop them. It\u2019s a long way [from London] down here, and you feel that rage a lot: their awareness that the debate is never about their place.\u201d What about the money the EU has long pumped into Cornwall? (It received some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/13/cornwall-council-eu-cornish-embassy-brussels-brexit\">\u00a380m a year in EU funding</a>, money that went into jobs, training and local infrastructure.) Did she ever point this out to them? \u201cYes, but they just ignore certain things. It\u2019s territorial for them.\u201d</p> <p>And what about her? In what ways did her experiences at sea change her? She isn\u2019t, she says, a particularly squeamish person; apart from when she was dealing with rays, a fish that seemed to be somehow more fiercely alive than the sole and the monkfish, and which could only be killed with a stab to the heart, she didn\u2019t mind the gutting and the filleting. She was learning new skills, and there was something so unexpectedly beautiful, she thinks, even about their arrabbiata-sauce coloured insides: \u201cThe brilliant thing is that every time I have fish now, I think about the supply chain. It has made me more appreciative, knowing that men are out there, risking their lives.\u201d Most people are, she thinks, very distant from their shrink-wrapped food: far <em>too</em> distant: \u201cI have the sense, living in London, of so rarely being involved in <em>real</em> things.\u201d</p> <p>Her time in Newlyn also taught her to think, both as a city person and one determined to be more green, in a more nuanced way about the environmental issues around fishing. \u201cPeople say we have got to get rid of the trawlers, because of the damage they do to the seabed. But I know that doing so will affect the lives of a whole community \u2013 though it\u2019s a relief when you hear about the smaller boats: there is a future that could be greener.\u201d British people need to start eating more hake, she thinks: \u201cWe catch so much of it.\u201d (The fishermen of St Ives, incidentally, refer to themselves as Hakes, while the Newlyn men, with whom they are fiercely rivalrous, like to call the north coasters the Scaly Backs.)</p> <p>But she does not want to romanticise. As her book makes plain, fishing takes its effects on mental health; some men come to have issues with alcohol (though it is strictly forbidden at sea), and depression is a problem, too. \u201cI hope that I show the limits of close community, as well as its benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own problems with depression in the past, and it was good to talk to the fishermen about their mental health. I recognised the disassociation they sometimes felt \u2013 it\u2019s how they survive \u2013 and how scary it can sometimes be.\u201d A fisherman\u2019s life is one of extremes: his sense of jeopardy swiftly replaced by one of celebration when he arrives home safely and hits the pub. As one of the men, Nathan, once told her: when a fisherman is at home, he\u2019s always counting the days until he leaves; and when he\u2019s at sea, he\u2019s always counting the days until he\u2019ll be back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"on board the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On board the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On her last night on the Filadelfia, Don cooked (how on earth did he do it?) one of the best meals she has ever eaten \u2013 a huge roast dinner of potatoes, mashed swede, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, parsnips and beef \u2013 after which the crew, in spite of their bloated bellies, landed the best catch of their trip, the derricks moaning loudly as they pulled up the immense haul of prized turbot and cuttlefish (\u201clike waiting for lottery numbers to come up,\u201d Ash thought, as she waited to see what the nets had brought). But after this, the mood changed. No one slept much on that last night.</p> <p>Fishermen call it \u201cchannelling\u201d: when thoughts of home, and all the people in it, swim through your mind all night, waking you repeatedly. One of the men tells her that the term is drawn from the word \u201cchannel\u201d in its spiritual sense: the conveying of a spirit from another world to this one. (The link between these two worlds is the boat.) And she came to understand that it\u2019s a necessary process. The next morning, as the Filadelfia approached the harbour and a mobile phone signal was once again possible, the boat became simply another place of work rather than, as it was just moments before, the only world that mattered. And now it was the land that seemed suddenly mysterious: a single, unbroken entity she had found herself unable to imagine while she was at sea. Arrival was at once both exhilarating, and anticlimactic. Only when she came face to face with Lofty again did she realise how rancid she smelled \u2013 and how little her stench had mattered to her until that moment.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s book comes into the world garlanded with praise. William Dalrymple has called her a new star of nonfiction: \u201cprecise, perceptive, humane and sensitive\u201d. What will she do next? Does she have a plan? What, for her, could ever top Newlyn? \u201cI always have lots of plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to go to Texas for a year, and write about my family on my father\u2019s side: my grandfather was from Dallas, and after the war he set up the Marxist Leninist Society of London. For me, Cornwall is very blue, and I want to look at redness\u2026\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cOr perhaps I\u2019ll do a PhD about coastal communities. I need to wait for the pull.\u201d In the meantime, though, of one thing she is certain: that she must go back to using an old-fashioned \u201cbrick\u201d phone. \u201cI enjoyed listening to the men at sea. Out there, I realised how our phones are stopping us from listening, and I want to get back really to listening to people.\u201d Her eyes, which today are precisely the same colour as the English channel, meet my own, and hold them for a long minute.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town </em>is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

  "<p>In the early stages of the crisis, one of those at the heart of government decision-making told me: \u201cWe are all going to get it.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t wish a positive test for the coronavirus on anyone, but there is this to be said for the news that the prime minister, the Prince of Wales, and the health secretary now number among the infected, while the chief medical officer is self-isolating. There couldn\u2019t be a more vivid illustration that this is an equal-opportunity virus that couldn\u2019t care less about your status. A VIP protection squad of police officers is no defence from the invisible terrorist. It can get to you whether you are the leader of the country or the heir to its throne.</p> <p>The penetration of the coronavirus within the high black gates of Downing Street takes us into another situation that is unprecedented. After e-cabinet meetings and virtual news conferences and an online emergency summit of the G20, we have now witnessed the extraordinary first of the prime minister addressing the nation via Twitter video from quarantine. The breezy \u201chi folks\u201d with which he began was intended to damp down any public fright that might be triggered by the virus reaching the highest levels of government.</p> <p>In an earlier era, Number 10 might have sought to conceal that the country\u2019s leader had fallen ill and at such a critical juncture. During the Second World War, the British public weren\u2019t told that Winston Churchill had had a heart attack while at the White House shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Two years later, Churchill contracted pneumonia, which was also kept from the country. That would be impossible now. In a crisis playing out in the era of 24/7 media, when daily bulletins are demanded of the nation\u2019s leaders, concealment was never an option.</p> <p>\u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,\u201d the prime minister declared. This reassurance about the functioning of the chain of command was extra necessary because there has been some unedifying background bickering within the cabinet about who is in charge of what.</p> <p>The spread of infection into the apex of the state does add dramatic heft to the ministerial mantra that \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d. It is hoped within government that this will be persuasive on the stubborn minority of the population who have been putting themselves and others in potential danger by resisting the new rules on social distancing. If the infection of the head of government and the next head of state won\u2019t persuade the irresponsible minority to take this menace seriously, it is a bit hard to know what will.</p> <p>There might have been fewer issues with securing comprehensive public compliance with social distancing had there not been too many days when the government issued advice that was confusing and contradictory. The prime minister himself has been particularly wanting in this respect. He urged people to stay away from at-risk relatives only then to tell reporters that he would be going to see his mother on Mother\u2019s Day. Only on Monday did government messaging start to achieve the necessary clarity when Mr Johnson gave his television address, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/boris-johnsons-covid-19-address-is-one-of-most-watched-tv-programmes-ever\">one watched live</a> by 27 million people, ordering the national lockdown. If there is one further silver lining to his own infection, it is this. He was offered another opportunity to make amends for earlier chaotic messaging by reinforcing the \u201cstay at home\u201d injunction to the nation.</p> <p>There have been personal brickbats tossed at Mr Johnson since his infection was revealed, with some suggesting that he exposed himself to the virus by being cavalier about following his own government\u2019s advice on social distancing. More significantly, there has been serious criticism of the government\u2019s shifts in approach, and some fierce complaint from doctors and nurses about shortages of vital resources, especially protective equipment for health workers dealing with the infected and testing kits for frontline staff. Yet this has so far not come at any evident political cost to the government. Our Opinium poll today suggests that 92% of the public back the lockdown. Reflecting similar results from other survey organisations, the poll also indicates that trust in the prime minister has gone up.</p> <p>This probably has little to do with how the prime minister is objectively performing. Leaders of wildly varying characters presiding over differing responses to the pandemic are seeing a similar coronavirus popularity dividend. Emmanuel Macron has become better regarded among the French. Germans are more appreciative of Angela Merkel. Despite the grim state of affairs in Italy, Giuseppe Conte, the leader of its strange coalition government, has seen his approval rating leap from 44% in February to more than 70%. Donald \u201cit\u2019s going to disappear\u201d Trump\u2019s sensationally reckless responses to the crisis have been accompanied by a rise in his ratings. Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, has never been more popular.</p> <p>The Americans have a phrase for the impulse of people to want to unite behind their leaders at a time of emergency, especially when the threat comes with an existential dimension. They call it \u201crallying round the flag\u201d. George W Bush saw a massive surge in his approval ratings in the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks on the Twin Towers. John F Kennedy\u2019s ratings soared during the Cuban missile crisis and in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs misadventure. About the latter, he quipped to friends: \u201cThe worse I do, the more popular I get.\u201d</p> <p>We British lack an agreed term for this effect: \u201cHang on to nurse\u201d would be particularly appropriate to the coronavirus crisis. Gordon Brown, generally a deeply unpopular prime minister, enjoyed a big surge in his ratings during the Great Crash in 2008. The more severe the emergency, the more the instinctive response of the public is to want to get behind its government.</p> <p>Fearful people need the comfort of thinking they are in the hands of capable leaders. In benign times, there is not much psychological cost to ourselves to regard politicians as useless knaves. In an emergency, many of us need to believe that there are smart people at the top who know what to do. This is accompanied by a desire for national solidarity, that yearning made manifest on Thursday night when so many people stood at their doors and windows to clap their salutations and thanks to NHS workers. The urge to pull together has also been demonstrated by the 700,000 applications to join the new NHS volunteers organisation.</p> <p>Shrewd opposition politicians understand this mood and grasp that the public are likely to react badly to anything that smells of petty point-scoring. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had every right to articulate legitimate anxieties about allowing construction projects to continue in the capital, but he was careful to use his voice in a tempered way. Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, made a fool of himself during the election, but has found redemption with a carefully calibrated, non-hyperbolic approach towards criticising the government.</p> <p>This means that, politically speaking, we are in the phoney war period of the crisis. Even when the government has made egregious blunders, such as over the procurement of additional ventilators, the opposition isn\u2019t being very aggressive about it. Much of the public is willing to defer to authority and extend to the government a benefit of the doubt that it would not normally receive. This will not last for ever. The surge in approval enjoyed by Gordon Brown during the initial phases of the financial crisis faded away as national debate turned to issues about his stewardship of the financial system over the previous decade. There will one day be a great reckoning about the coronavirus, its origins, its spread and how it was tackled. Why wasn\u2019t Britain better prepared for a pandemic? Was the health service inadequately staffed and equipped? Did the government initially underestimate the virulence of the disease and what that meant for the NHS? Was the prime minister too slow to order the lockdown and other critical steps? These are some of the questions that will preoccupy the inevitable inquiry the other side of this crisis. Boris Johnson\u2019s currently buoyant approval ratings tell us nothing about what the public will think of him by the time this is over.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</em></p>",

It\u2019s an industry worth $5bn; BTS alone sold more albums than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish\" title=\"\">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\" title=\"\">Ariana Grande</a> last year. But something is very wrong inside K-pop, and it points to a deeper malaise throughout South Korea.</p> <p>There has been a spate of suicides and high-profile sex scandals involving K-pop stars in recent times. At the height of their fame, these men and women seem to have buckled under the strain, unable to live up to the demands placed on them to be polished, picture-perfect ambassadors of this effervescent pop music. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/shinee-kim-jong-hyun-lead-singer-of-south-korean-boy-band-dies\" title=\"\">Kim Jong-hyun</a>, 27, a member of SHINee, took his own life in 2017 after speaking about the intense pressures brought on by success.</p> <p>In March 2019, several male K-pop stars, including Seungri, a member of boyband Big Bang, Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of FT Island, and singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young were implicated in a spycam sexual abuse scandal, after Jung shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/29/k-pop-stars-jailed-for-quasi-rape-of-woman-jung-joon-young-choi-jong-hoon\" title=\"\">videos</a> of women in a group chat.

A month later, <a href=\"v\" title=\"\">Goo Hara</a>, 28, a former member of the group Kara and a close friend of Sulli, also took her own life.</p> <p>It soon emerged that both women had been harassed online for months, if not years. Sulli had experienced sexist abuse and cyber-bullying from thousands of faceless male \u201canti-fans\u201d (online haters) over her conduct and appearance. Goo had been hounded over a court case with an ex-boyfriend over a sex tape that had allegedly been filmed without her consent.</p> <p>According to Mano Lee, a Seoul-based K-pop columnist, the sexism and misogyny that female stars face is a symptom of the way women are treated in wider society. \u201cA lot of Korean women can relate to the issues that female celebrities deal with. They have experienced it themselves. While many feel unsafe due to the pervasiveness of <em>molka</em>, gender-based violence and victim-shaming,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>Molka </em>\u2013 from <em>mollae</em>, Korean for secret, and <em>ka </em>for camera \u2013 means the illicit filming of women. There has been widespread outrage over the spycam epidemic. In 2018, almost 6,800 cases of hidden camera crimes were reported to the supreme prosecutors\u2019 office. In some cases, cameras were hidden in women\u2019s public toilets and motel rooms, others involved the filming and sharing of videos of women taken by partners and former partners.</p> <p>The revelations of the Jung Joon-young spycam scandal provoked fury across the nation. \u201cK-pop tries to present a cleansed image of male stars as being kind, generous, that they are unlike patriarchal, sexist and unstylish Korean men,\u201d says John Lie, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThe shock came because of the gulf between the illusion and the reality.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, though K-pop stars are expected to live up to all but impossible standards, many might say that the pressure to be perfect is also intense for ordinary Koreans \u2013 K-pop simply takes what\u2019s there in wider society and intensifies it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7a0be9ee0de74a9dc5f1f0344a39a051ad9891b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7a0be9ee0de74a9dc5f1f0344a39a051ad9891b/0_77_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tragic heroine: Sulli, 25, a former member of the girl group f(x), who killed herself in October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tragic heroine: Sulli, 25, a former member of the girl group f(x), who killed herself in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Yong hak/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn order to get ahead in Korea, you have to step on someone else,\u201d says Justin Shin, a Seoul-based fashion photographer who works closely with K-pop idols. \u201cIt\u2019s like this from kindergarten, you have to leap ahead of all the other kids. All their lives, Koreans are exposed to competition \u2013 constantly being tested, evaluated and scored over their actions and academic achievements. It\u2019s super-competitive.\u201d</p> <p>For most South Koreans, success means having the right \u201cspecs\u201d or specifications: everyone is judged in terms of their family background, level of education, job title, wealth and appearance. \u201cIf you went to a great school, or you have a nice body that you worked hard to cultivate, or if you have an expensive foreign car \u2013 these are all different forms of specs,\u201d says Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul.</p> <p>For women in particular, having the right specs means being attractive and excelling at homemaking. But, says Shin Gi-wook, professor of sociology at Stanford University, the natural consequences of such a highly competitive society are jealousy and bullying: \u201cThose who are more successful than others easily become the centre of gossip and rumours,\u201d he says. In Sulli and Goo\u2019s cases, the public shaming they experienced can be seen as a more extreme example of the scrutiny and criticism all Korean women are subjected to.</p> <p>Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was among the few K-pop stars who supported the nation\u2019s feminist \u201cno bra\u201d movement, daring to challenge Korean society\u2019s strict female dress codes. For this, as well as for her past relationship with Choiza, a fellow musician 14 years her senior, which began when she was 19, Sulli became the target of online abuse \u2013 K-pop stars are expected to stay single for years and not date during their teens.</p> <p>Sulli tried to address her detractors by appearing on a TV talk show about the cyber-bullying that celebrities face, telling viewers, \u201cMy life is actually empty. I feel like I\u2019m lying to everyone by pretending to be happy on the outside.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ce0a8f6cf034612cd1e087b497f6d5a05a1efe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce0a8f6cf034612cd1e087b497f6d5a05a1efe7/0_297_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fallen idol: Jung Joon-young arrives in court in central Seoul in March 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fallen idol: Jung Joon-young arrives in court in central Seoul in March 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo many celebrities have taken their lives because of this kind of criticism,\u201d says one Korean jewellery designer who asked not to be named, and who says he knew Sulli for many years. He explains that another K-pop star he works with once received a bloody dagger in the mail \u201cwith real blood\u201d and that receiving angry threats and letters was normal for many K-pop idols.</p> <p>Like Sulli, Goo had been the target of severe online bullying since late 2018, when she entered a court battle against Choi Jong-bum, an ex-boyfriend who she claimed had threatened to release a sex video allegedly filmed without her consent. Choi was later acquitted and although the video was never released, Goo suffered from the events and her all-important K-pop image was badly damaged.</p> <p>\u201cKorean celebrities who take their lives tend to be women, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cI think there\u2019s a kind of precariousness that female stars have to live with that men don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly true that male K-pop stars don\u2019t have to worry about wearing the wrong suit, for instance, while, for female stars, the risks of deviating even slightly from strict expectations about appearance are dire. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman your career can always end in an instant,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou can be a top star but they\u2019ll come after you with pitchforks. These women are stars, yet society is stacked against them. When police are coming at you, turning a victim into victimiser, it seems like a man can attack a female idol who has top lawyers and a big entertainment company behind her and <em>still</em> he has more protection.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Back at </strong></em><em><strong>the Seoul academy,</strong></em> Kim Tae-heon, 21, waits for his audition. Kim grew up in South Gyeongsang province in the rural southern region of the country. He moved to Seoul to attend the school two years ago and spends up to nine hours every day practising his singing, dancing and acting skills at the academy.</p> <p>\u201cBesides the obvious performance skills, you need a strong, stable mind to be able to do this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people disappear along the way \u2013 at least six out of 10 will give up when they realise there are so many others who are better at this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b7cf32e0c45eb237650e64c722226da47dfeb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b7cf32e0c45eb237650e64c722226da47dfeb4/0_235_6983_4190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dirty pictures: women protest against \u2018spy-cam porn\u2019 in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dirty pictures: women protest against \u2018spy-cam porn\u2019 in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Jones/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Kim, despite the intense competition, there is nothing else he could see himself doing. \u201cSince I was young, I\u2019ve always enjoyed being onstage. At school I would volunteer to sing or dance in front of others. It\u2019s my joy in life.\u201d</p> <p>According to the academy\u2019s founder, 386 former students \u2013 including Hye Bin from Momoland and Song Min-ho from Winner \u2013 have been recruited by major K-pop firms over the past five years. However, he admits the success rate is still very low. \u201cOnly 5-10% of our students make it past auditions . . .I find the ones who are successful are the ones who practise all day. I see them at the academy all the time.\u201d</p> <p>He says that around 40% of current students live outside Seoul. Many travel for hours every week by train or bus to get to and from the school, where they pay up to KRW600,000 (\u00a3400) a month for the opportunity to become an idol. According to him, this work ethic is the backbone of K-pop \u201cThe reason K-pop became so successful was because of its intense training system\u2026 And if these companies want to continue innovating the industry, they need to upgrade the training system,\u201d he says. \u201cThese days, training is even longer and harder. But most of the better entertainment companies try to make this process as enjoyable as they can for trainees.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a35088c292b35324b739cbeef9fb717161b2eed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a35088c292b35324b739cbeef9fb717161b2eed8/0_0_4816_2891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feeling the pressure: a shrine to Kim Jong-hyun, 27, a member of SHINee, who took his own life in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling the pressure: a shrine to Kim Jong-hyun, 27, a member of SHINee, who took his own life in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Choi Hyuk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even for those who graduate to stardom, the hard work doesn\u2019t end. Kevin Lee realised this while working behind the scenes with BTS. \u201cWhen we went to dance practice for their shows, they\u2019d always be arriving straight from their tours in other countries,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they get back they would go to practise for seven hours a day. They don\u2019t rest, they work hard and that\u2019s why they are able to achieve this level of success.\u201d</p> <p>While some criticism regarding K-pop\u2019s gruelling training process is valid, the founder of the academy says South Koreans study just as much to pass <em>suneung</em>, the country\u2019s national university entrance exam, and work as hard at entering other careers, such as the civil service and legal professions.</p> <p>\u201cK-pop is portrayed as this factory-like industry, but I question this view, because everyone in Korea is forced to study for years. If anything, people who are training to become idols are training for something they actually want to become,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are living every day with a purpose and with a dream. And there\u2019s freedom in that.\u201d</p> <p>Many, however, see things differently. The demanding nature of the industry can mean signing contracts that can leave stars feeling trapped. According to K-pop star Prince Mak, contracts can lock you in for up to 15 years, and the term doesn\u2019t begin to count down until you are deemed a success, which can lock you in for years beyond the top line, while you are trained.</p> <p>The financial rewards are also limited. Prince Mak told SBS PopAsia radio that K-pop stars don\u2019t earn very much. The most common profit ratios are either 80% to the company and 20% to the artist, or 90% to the company and 10% to the artist. If you are in a group, the figures are worse still because the money is split between band members.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can be a top star, but they\u2019ll come after you with pitchforks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most stars are obliged to repay the cost of their training to their record companies. So, while to their fans, it looks as if many K-pop stars are wealthy and independent, many are contractually bound employees with little personal freedom. Add to that the pressures of maintaining impossibly high standards of appearance and behaviour, and the tragedies of Sulli and Goo begin to seem less like a surprise.</p> <p>In the wake of their deaths, the South Korean government discussed passing a new bill that would introduce cyber-bullying education at schools and workplaces. However, many believe policy alone is no solution, and the cause goes straight to the heart of societal expectations.</p> <p>\u201cK-pop has gone international and it brings pride to the country, but there\u2019s this cultural programme of gender and social norms that\u2019s impossible to win,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou\u2019d have to really thread a needle in a particular and perfect way, and I think that\u2019s the thing about these K-pop stars going out into the spotlight\u2026 They can\u2019t really win.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by David Lee</em></p>",
  "<p>For those of us who have to self-isolate in the coming months, gardening can be a great escape. A growing body of research suggests that being around plants can reduce stress and anxiety, thus gardening can provide not only a welcome distraction from the headlines, but much-needed signs of growth, new life and positivity.</p> <p>The best news is, you don\u2019t even need a garden to get these benefits. The beauty of houseplants is that even people like me, who might otherwise be looking at four walls and Netflix for weeks on end, can benefit from horticultural therapy. So, in that spirit, here are a range of houseplants you can propagate at home right now to lift your spirits. Home propagation is also an excellent way to get new plants for free.</p> <p>The three easy ways to clone your existing houseplants with little more than some compost and a few pots are cuttings, runners and division. The particular method you choose depends mainly on the species you are dealing with.</p> <p>For most trailing plants, from aroids to ivy, cuttings are by far the easiest way forward. Cuttings can be made by simply snipping off 20cm sections of the plants\u2019 growing tips and placing them in a glass of water in a bright spot away from direct sunlight. Other examples of easy-rooters include African violets and begonias, which can be started off from single leaf cuttings in either pots of gritty compost or (perhaps counterintuitively for plants prone to waterlogging when mature) you can also put the leaf cuttings in a jar of water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a1e035d2ecd43aca6c5c553d5eef51bdff1a3e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a1e035d2ecd43aca6c5c553d5eef51bdff1a3e4/553_210_3559_2134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"African violet flower in pot on isolated white background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Easy rooters: African violets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: lcrms/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some plants naturally produce \u201cbabies\u201d on the ends of runners in an effort to clone themselves. This includes a broad range of species from the spider plant <em>Chlorophytum</em>, to strawberry saxifrage <em>Saxifraga stolonifera</em> and <em>Episcia</em>, whose cascading runners, each with a small plant at the tip, are highlighted by growers selling them in hanging pots.</p> <p>To get propagating, just wait for the plants to produce five or more leaves on mini plants, the size of a 50p coin, and they can then be planted up in their own pots of gritty compost. Not enough pots at home? No need to go to the garden centre, any old yogurt pot or other plastic food container will work perfectly. Just poke a few holes in the base.</p> <p>Finally, the easiest and most instant technique of all \u2013 division. Most growers will sell multiple small plants crammed into the same pot to give the illusion of one lush, stocky, medium-sized specimen in far less time. This means that for all sorts of species, from ferns and begonias to fittonias and ficus, you already have many more plants than you realise.</p> <p>Knocking the plant out of its pot and gently teasing the individual specimens apart at their base, before potting them up separately, will give each of them far more space to breath, resulting in healthier plants and loads more of them.</p> <p><em>Follow James on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",

  "<p>Eva\u2019s gone to have her baby: I\u2019m emerging at the other end of the process. My boys are nearly 18 and 16, pretty much cooked.</p> <p>It\u2019s a slow then all-at-once thing, this parenting business. The days felt interminable for years (there was a single afternoon in 2004 when they both had chickenpox that definitely took five years off my life; and time seemed to take on a hallucinatory, elastic quality as my elder son examined every knob and twiddly bit of every train in the London Transport Museum every week for a year), now suddenly there\u2019s no time left.</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling the same panicked incredulity I remember when we were inexplicably allowed to bring the eldest home from hospital with absolutely no child-wrangling experience. What, that\u2019s it? My boy turns 18 and I have to just let him go and be a person all by himself? Shouldn\u2019t the authorities stop this madness?</p> <p>Part of the panic is about how little I can still do in the short time I have left. What can I teach them before they leave? They can load a dishwasher (poorly), feed themselves (pretty well); they seem kind. That\u2019s the basics covered. When you\u2019re sending two more privileged white men out into the world, that seems like the least you can do. There are still surprises: I realised recently they don\u2019t know how to post a letter (they thought the postman collected it from your house). A tin without a ring pull and the concept of \u201ctin opener\u201d leaves one utterly bewildered \u2013 it\u2019s not a skill I thought he\u2019d particularly need: life moves fast. But they\u2019ll learn practical things I\u2019ve forgotten in the time-honoured manner \u2013 by making an absolute dog\u2019s breakfast of them a few times.</p> <p>What about the deeper stuff? The temptation to grasp them by the shoulder and deliver pearls of hard-won wisdom, like a pound shop Kipling, is almost overwhelming at times. Sometimes I get as far as the grasping, but faced with their bemused expressions, the only life advice that comes to mind is that offered by Bertie Wooster\u2019s Uncle Henry in PG Wodehouse\u2019s <em>Carry on, Jeeves</em>: \u201cIf you stand outside Romano\u2019s in the Strand, you can see the clock on the wall of the Law Courts down in Fleet Street\u2026 You can win a lot of money betting on it with fellows who haven\u2019t found it out.\u201d I accept this is of limited use and may indeed no longer be true (note to self: check this out).</p> <p>Part of the problem is that their father and I snuck in under the lowering garage door of an era where everything was still on a broadly hopeful trajectory. We studied without mountains of debt, found jobs easily, managed to buy a flat and chose, happily, to have them at a time of relative optimism.</p> <p>It\u2019s strange watching them enter a world that has confounded our assumptions of progress: what could I possibly know about what lies ahead for them? The elder was supposed to be finishing A-Levels and going travelling: now he\u2019s facing months fighting for bandwidth and breathing space in a tiny house with his tedious #WFH parents.</p> <p>I don\u2019t, though, want to fall into shrugging helplessness, hoping their generation will sort everything out, somehow. Your mother grasping your shoulder then saying, \u201cWe\u2019re so sorry about everything\u201d probably isn\u2019t the cheeriest vibe either, even though I am, I really am. So instead I\u2019ve been trying to think what facts of life (no, not that kind, too late for that) might be helpful whatever their world looks like.</p> <p>The only thing I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve learned from my myriad mistakes in 45 years is that life doesn\u2019t tend to have the neat narrative arc of a book or film. People would like it to: we\u2019re programmed to want tidy, satisfying stories. But a life is sprawling, inconclusive, confusing; punctuated by heady instants of joy and patches of sadness. There\u2019s a lot of grey in between and right now, there\u2019s whatever this is: exceptional, awful, hopefully once in a lifetime.</p> <p>When you know that, I think you\u2019re better equipped to ride out the bad and really live the good. When it comes down to it, your parents don\u2019t \u2013 or shouldn\u2019t \u2013 care about the narrative arc, but I think it often feels as if they (we) do. I actually think that even the well-intentioned \u201cWe just want you to be happy\u201d can be quite unhelpful: who the hell knows how to do that?</p> <p>That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, but the problem is I don\u2019t know how to pass it on. When\u2019s the right moment to tell my soon-to-be-gone son this? When I\u2019m asking about next year\u2019s gang awry plans with the subtlety of a wounded hippo? Shouting perimenopausally about the recycling? Or when we\u2019re slumped in front of the telly in relative peace? I\u2019m anxious not to make things weird, especially now: I just want to hold on to these moments, rest a hand on his giant knee, furtively look for echoes of his baby self in his all-grown-up face.</p> <p>So instead, as he wanders through the kitchen, I slip him a pointless tenner and whisper the only other truly useful thing I know: \u201cYou can wash almost anything at 30C.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelgianWaffling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@BelgianWaffling</a></p>",
  "<p>I met Matthew Macfadyen on one of those days in ancient history, a couple of weeks ago, when we were still not quite sure whether to make silly jokes about elbow-touching greetings, or to fear for civilisation\u2019s immediate future. In many ways, Macfadyen is the archetypal actor for this kind of moment, a master of shifting and ambiguous tone, whose frequent bursts of laughter often threaten to turn hollow. One of the many joys of his portrayal of the bullied and bullying son-in-law Tom Wambsgans in the HBO show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\">Succession</a></em> \u2013 arguably the defining contribution to the defining TV drama of our times \u2013 is his winning ability to switch from empathy to psychopathy in a heartbeat.</p> <p>Next month, Macfadyen will bring all of that gift for nuance to the three-part ITV drama <em>Quiz</em>, in which he plays <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ingram\">Major Charles Ingram</a>, the \u201ccoughing major\u201d who was convicted of cheating his way to the top prize on <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> in 2001. The show, an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/12/quiz-review-exploration-of-the-thin-line-between-courtroom-and-showbusiness\">West End play by James Graham</a>, has been directed for television by Stephen Frears. Macfadyen\u2019s major takes the hot seat across from Michael Sheen, who adds Chris Tarrant to his repertoire of uncanny impersonations.</p> <p>If I\u2019m honest I hadn\u2019t really expected to enjoy the miniseries, which I watched in preview. I felt I knew the story of the major, who was eventually convicted of the deception, along with his wife Diana and their coughing accomplice Tecwen Whittock, in a widely publicised court case, but I was wrong. Graham\u2019s script and Frears\u2019s direction \u2013 but above all Macfadyen\u2019s characterisation \u2013 brings unexpected humanity as well as fabulous observational comedy to the events. It takes you back to a curious time when the whole nation was in thrall to the quiz show \u2013 audience figures peaked at 19 million \u2013 which was the first of a string of British TV formats to be sold to the American networks.

And I knew that Sian Clifford was playing the wife \u2013 and I was a big fan of hers from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/fleabag\">Fleabag</a></em> \u2013 and Stephen Frears, of course, and it was quite different from Tom Wambsgans so I immediately said yes.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things that makes the drama so watchable is that it maintains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami\">some reasonable doubt</a> about the scam itself right to the end.</p> <p>Even Macfadyen wasn\u2019t quite sure what to think. \u201cSian and I kept sort of grabbing each other during filming going: \u2018They did it! Guilty! Yeah.\u2019 Then, five minutes later: \u2018No, no, no, they didn\u2019t!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In some senses, I suggest, Ingram adds to Macfadyen\u2019s gift for playing that kind of contemporary everyman who finds himself suddenly in the midst of events way beyond his control.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think we all are like that, really.

He and the producers and Frears knew they had to persuade Macfadyen to take the role. \u201cComing from the theatre, I\u2019d known Matthew as one of our great stage actors, but vastly underappreciated,\u201d Graham says. \u201cBut then like everyone else, seeing him appear, or emerge, in <em>Succession</em> was a revelation. That is the most extraordinary performance, both buffoonish and terrifying simultaneously.\u201d</p> <p>Macfadyen finds a way to play the major as both a quite conventional military man and a genuine enigma. \u201cThe real Ingram has been lampooned to a degree that I think is out of proportion to his alleged crime,\u201d Graham says. \u201cI think Matthew is perfect because he does have this dashing aura of a Hollywood star, but also looks and feels incredibly nice. You just like him, everyone does.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting talking with Macfadyen it is hard to disagree with that impression. Nothing he says is quite in earnest, and he has a habit of laughing at your lamest joke. You can\u2019t help thinking some of this is performance, but then feel guilty for doubting his sincerity.</p> <p>Macfadyen is married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/17/keeley-hawes-we-all-need-to-be-more-positive-thriller-suspense-traitors\">Keeley Hawes</a>, who he met when they made <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/spooks\">Spooks</a></em> together. They have two children in their teens, along with a 19-year-old son from Hawes\u2019s first marriage. The thought of actors off stage and at home, particularly when they are married to other actors, is always intriguing. Both he and Hawes can convincingly inhabit any shade of emotion. How do their arguments go?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ingram is a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He laughs. \u201cI am really not good without a script. I\u2019m an absolutely hopeless fibber in real life. But even when I\u2019m acting I never feel I am inhabiting any emotion. You are just doing what the character does.\u201d</p> <p>He insists that he and Hawes are not competitive with each other, but both of them are in a rich run of TV success: Hawes with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/07/the-durrells-review-corfu-brits-keeley-hawes-final-series\">The Durrells</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/23/it-makes-you-go-oh-my-god-how-line-of-duty-broke-the-laws-of-police-shows\">Line of Duty</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/26/bodyguard-review-jed-mercurios-latest-thriller-is-as-dark-and-moreish-as-we-hoped\">The Bodyguard</a></em>, he with <em>Any Human Heart</em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/oct/14/ripper-street-a-ridiculously-underrated-victorian-thriller\">Ripper Street</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/04/howards-end-review-no-rollicking-finale-just-wit-and-humanity\">Howards End</a></em>, as well as <em>Succession</em>.</p> <p>He puts it down mostly to a determination to keep working.</p> <p>\u201cI think the trick is keep doing good work while you wait for those roles where everything comes together,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Keeley had that with <em>Line of Duty</em>.

I mean, if you\u2019re lucky enough to get sent things and they sort of blow your hair back then, great. Quite often though my immediate thought is \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t cast myself as this\u2019. Or, you know, \u2018Why didn\u2019t they ask Damian Lewis?\u2019 But then there are some parts you think: \u2018Yeah I know what makes him tick.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And that was the case with Charles Ingram?</p> <p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks.\u201d</p> <p>And apparently fantastically corruptible?</p> <p>\u201cWell that\u2019s the thing, was he? The tabloid narrative was that Diana, his wife, was the sort of controller, the Lady Macbeth, but who knows? A posh cheat? We rush to know and we rush to condemn. But maybe we always need to look a bit harder.\u201d</p> <p>Macfadyen did not find it hard to remain agnostic. \u201cYou are just playing incremental moments, so you can\u2019t add a wash of guilt or innocence anyway. Now and again Stephen would say, \u2018Let\u2019s turn the dial a bit one way on their culpability and then not so much\u2019 \u2013 just so he had options in the cutting room.\u201d</p> <p>It is a tribute to Macfadyen\u2019s skills that he could make every gradation of those reactions believable. I asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/lucy-prebble-interview-litvinenko-very-expensive-poison-old-vic-enron-succession\">Lucy Prebble</a>, one of the scriptwriting team on <em>Succession</em>, what it was like to write with his character in mind. \u201cI remember once half-joking [to Matthew] on set about a particular take: \u2018Yes, but Tom would feel 7% less shame,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe next take, on the monitor, there it was, not eight, not six, but 7% less shame. And completely true. It is the most exciting thing for a writer, because it gives you a completely open field in creating. It\u2019s what they mean when they say of an actor that there\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t do. There is nothing Matthew can\u2019t do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1002979be6226f4614b3a46d1377e820ab2720f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1002979be6226f4614b3a46d1377e820ab2720f/0_0_3456_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Tom and Nicholas Braun as cousin Greg in Succession.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Tom and Nicholas Braun as cousin Greg in Succession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Macfadyen discovered he might have that talent quite early. His mother trained as an actor and later taught drama. They did a bit of am-dram together, including <em>Oh! What a Lovely War</em>, and whenever there was mention of a school play, he recalls, \u201cmy heart was immediately banging away\u201d.</p> <p>His upbringing also supplied those elements of dislocation and hyper-observation that seem at the heart of his best performances. Macfadyen\u2019s father was a physicist who became an engineer in the oil industry. They lived in places as varied as Great Yarmouth, Aberdeen, London and Jakarta. \u201cThere was a lot of me standing next to a teacher announcing \u2018Say hello to Matthew, children\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He saw it as an adventure rather than any kind of trauma. \u201cMum and Dad were always excited by new places, so my brother and I were excited too,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He was something of a prodigy, accepted at Rada at 17, and then into Declan Donnellan\u2019s acclaimed Cheek By Jowl touring company at 21. He credits the latter in particular with opening his eyes to that magic potential of \u201creally standing in someone else\u2019s shoes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDeclan is a big proponent of the idea that everything that feeds you as an actor comes from outside,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience pays not for you to feel things, but for you to see things. You are not summoning emotions, it is all out there in front of you.\u201d</p> <p>He and Donnellan have remained friends. When I speak to the director, he recalls how he had never had such a young actor in the company before; Macfadyen starred in productions of <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em> and <em>Much Ado</em> that took them all over the world together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3327be8e3c2135a3295134845a354a7c418444b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3327be8e3c2135a3295134845a354a7c418444b8/189_0_1617_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Prince Hal and Michael Gambon as Falstaff in Henry IV Parts I and II at the Olivier theatre, London, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Prince Hal and Michael Gambon as Falstaff in Henry IV Parts I and II at the Olivier theatre, London, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Norrington/NIGEL NORRINGTON</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe thing that young actors often don\u2019t realise,\u201d Donnellan says, \u201cis that if you want to get on, the first thing you need to look after is the group. Looking after me me me, on stage or off, never pays out. You have to give full attention to who you are acting with. Matthew always understood that.\u201d</p> <p>He stresses one other thing that has always struck him as unusual in his experience. \u201cMatthew always had an extraordinarily close relationship with his parents, both father and mother. They were around, somehow, when we were in Rio one time. I remember once we were rehearsing and his dad came and they sat in the cafe at the next table and I was so impressed by how easy they were with each other. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d</p> <p>Donnellan is, like everyone, addicted to <em>Succession</em>. \u201cWhat is really wonderful about the series, is how they all are about the vacuousness of all that wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes you want to go down on your knees and thank God that you are not rich.\u201d</p> <p>It seems a telling coincidence that the cast of <em>Succession</em> did their first read-through of the script on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. It felt something like an omen, for their tale of power and its discontents. \u201cEveryone, all the Americans, kept telling us, you know, the election will be fine, he can\u2019t win,\u201d Macfadyen recalls. \u201cThen we went to the producer Adam McKay\u2019s apartment that evening to watch the results come in. There was that truly terrible moment when it became clear what was going to happen. And everyone went a bit quiet and disappeared into their phones.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l9TKHvvaMfE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\">Watch a trailer for the second series of Succession</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Since that night, it has often appeared that something of the barely credible character of Trump\u2019s America has been feeding directly into the two seasons of <em>Succession</em> almost by osmosis. No comic excess or private humiliation seems beyond either drama. \u201cI hope so,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThere does sometimes seem some feedback. Like a horrible loop of shit, you might say.\u201d</p> <p>The Roy family in the drama seem most directly based on the Murdoch dynasty, but in the nastier moments of their familial struggles they also seem to reference Trump and his dreadful sons. It captures what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/successions-brian-cox-i-was-touched-up-by-princess-margaret\">Brian Cox</a>, speaking of his patriarchal role as Logan Roy, has called elsewhere, \u201cthe horrible last gasp of the alpha male in America\u201d, the extended death throes of all that concentrated wealth, which still exerts its global influence. \u201cIt is the Bible salesman arriving in a private jet,\u201d Macfadyen says, \u201cand people queuing up to say: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll buy one of those off you\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Among the divides in our world just now, it sometimes feels like the most significant is between those who think the worst can\u2019t happen and those who understand that it can. <em>Succession</em> is cast in the no man\u2019s land between those attitudes. Critics of the series suggest that it is hard to sympathise with any of the characters. The genius of it, it seems to me, is that however loathsome and cynical they are, you can still sympathise with all of them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThe Roy children are all terrified. There is an awful absence of love from the father that has taken away all of their confidence. They can never talk about their feelings, though they want to.\u201d</p> <p>On the very edge of that orbit are Tom and his sidekick, cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), who understands even less of the vicious world in which they find themselves. The pair of them have become a kind of contemporary Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, tragically unsure of their roles, but scheming like everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, however badly they behave,\u201d Macfadyen says, \u201cthey still think they are heroic, or doing their best under very difficult circumstances. Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the collective angst comes from the way the series is filmed.</p> <p>\u201cWe shoot these great long scenes, often with three cameras. And you are never sure whether the camera is on you. It feels like a play and it is liberating because you are forced to listen all the time, like you would in real life. I think we are much more affected by other people than anything inside us. That is the great thing about playing Tom \u2013 he is a totally different person with everyone he is with.\u201d</p> <p>He never knows what to feel?</p> <p>\u201cExcept a sort of panicky ambivalence always.\u201d</p> <p>Again, that seems to capture a quite contemporary sense\u2026</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think we know life is quite scary but our vanity tells us we are in control \u2013 of our bank accounts and our careers and our relationships \u2013 until one day we are not.\u201d He pauses for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like, you know, my father died in November, quite suddenly, and when that happens the world tilts and changes for you.

It was a disciplined portrayal that gradually thawed as the episodes went by, taking Quinn from stern, focused operative to questioning outlier. The series introduced Macfadyen to his wife, Keeley Hawes: they\u2019ve been married since 2004.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvHX_jOS-6w\">In My Father\u2019s Den (Brad McGann, 2004)</a><br></strong>Not enough people saw New Zealander Brad McGann\u2019s heartfelt family tragedy, which gave Macfadyen his first big-screen lead and earned him a British independent film award nomination for best actor. It\u2019s a classic prodigal son role: a feted war photographer returning to his Kiwi homeland following his father\u2019s death, uncovering dark family secrets. The script spirals into melodrama, but Macfadyen gives it a quiet, humane and emotional core.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Afx8MGg00g\">Pride and Prejudice (Joe Wright, 2005)</a><br></strong>Many think of Colin Firth as the quintessential screen Mr Darcy, but Macfadyen was at least his equal: a more broodingly sensual take on the character, teeming with interior emotional conflict, which fits well with the unbuttoned realism of director Joe Wright\u2019s interpretation. Costumed and styled with a scruffy dishevelment that was equal parts rakish and little-boy-lost, his performance didn\u2019t please all die-hard Austenites, but younger viewers swooned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8004817a2795bfc97b5abfd4c5780f3164cb64c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8004817a2795bfc97b5abfd4c5780f3164cb64c/0_70_3072_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Oblonsky in Joe Wright\u2019s Anna Karenina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Oblonsky in Joe Wright\u2019s Anna Karenina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Working Title Films/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnzblqTGNnk\">Anna Karenina (Joe Wright, 2012)</a><br></strong>Joe Wright has been good to Macfadyen. The actor may not be as prominently featured in this whirring, theatrical, hyper-stylised adaptation of the Tolstoy novel, but in a film of wildly variable performances, his feckless, faithless Oblonsky \u2013 brother rather than lover of Keira Knightley\u2019s heroine this time \u2013 is one of the very best things in it. He\u2019s a cool, dry breeze of comic relief in otherwise hot, heavy surroundings.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/succession\">Succession, HBO (2018-)</a><br></strong>Following a career heavy on polite British period pieces, the role of Tom Wambsgans in Jesse Armstrong\u2019s critically adored US television drama is a wildly against-type opportunity that the actor palpably relishes. As the ambitious, obsequious third husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-inspired heiress, Macfadyen wittily plays him as both repulsive and queasily sympathetic: a hungry add-on to the Roy family who, as much as he plays their game, will never quite have their respect.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHRXtJoNL28\">Quiz, ITV (2020)</a><br></strong>Macfadyen returns to British TV next month as the <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> fraudster Major Charles Ingram in Stephen Frears\u2019s miniseries. It\u2019s a morally and psychologically complex part well suited to the actor\u2019s blend of vulnerability and very English propriety: his tragicomic performance is integral to making the series more than just a snarky take on a tabloid scandal. You may wind up thinking of Ingram a bit differently. <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>",

Ashley admitted that his business had been struggling to enforce the government\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions for thousands of workers at its Derbyshire warehouse, which continues to operate to fulfil online orders.

Staff have complained on social media about having to work without protective equipment, including in stores where groceries only account for one aisle. An \u201cadvice update\u201d to workers informed them that the company \u201cpresumed all our colleagues are key workers\u201d and that they would be paid for any time spent self-isolating, provided they qualified for statutory sick pay.

The backlash against JD Wetherspoon grew when it said it could not commit to paying its 43,000 employees beyond 24 March, before it had processed details of the government furlough scheme, as it didn\u2019t have the financial resources to do so. </p> <p>It later changed tack and said it had created its own reimbursement scheme so that it could pay its workers on 3 April, provided the government backed its interpretation of the measures. The firm says it is retaining all staff and has advised those who want to apply to work for supermarkets during the current period that they will be given priority for jobs at Wetherspoons when pubs reopen. The chain has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/jd-wetherspoon-refuses-pay-suppliers-until-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-ends\">told its suppliers that they cannot expect payment</a> until after the pubs reopen, even for items that have already been delivered.</p> <p><strong>Travelodge </strong>Hundreds of residents in its hotels, including homeless families housed there by local councils, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/homeless-travelodge-residents-turned-out-on-to-street-coronavirus\">were turned out on to the street </a>after the budget hotel chain closed its premises. The firm gave letters to all residents asking them to leave as soon as possible, apparently in defiance of government guidance, which said that hotels looking after homeless families in temporary accommodation should not close.</p> <p><strong>Britannia </strong>The hotel chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/scottish-hotel-admin-error-sacking-staff-covid-19\">blamed an administrative error for sacking staff</a> and leaving some without accommodation after it closed one of its properties in Scotland. It had terminated the employment of workers at the Coylumbridge hotel in Aviemore and asked them to leave their accommodation immediately. </p> <p><strong>Carluccio\u2019s </strong>The Unite union has accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/carluccios-set-to-file-for-administration-amid-coronavirus-shutdown\">Carluccio\u2019s </a>of \u201cwage theft\u201d after the Italian restaurant chain was closed due to the government-ordered shutdown. It claims workers have been informed they will only be paid 50% of their wages for the month of March, despite having worked until the chain\u2019s outlets closed on 20 March. The union believes the company\u2019s actions are a breach of employment law.</p> <h2>Brickbats \u2013 travel</h2> <p><strong>EasyJet </strong> The carrier\u2019s pilots and cabin crew have been asked to take three months\u2019 unpaid leave and accept a pay freeze.

The Dublin-based company has waived its change fees, but passengers still have to pay the difference if the new fare is higher. According to consumer group Which?, the airline has increased the cost of those replacement flights by as much as \u00a380. Pay for all staff, including executives, has been cut by 50% for April and May, but the airline\u2019s boss Michael O\u2019Leary has not ruled out redundancies. </p> <h2>Brickbats \u2013 <strong>other sectors</strong></h2> <p><strong>Regus </strong>Small firms who rent office space from Regus, one of the largest providers of serviced offices, complain that they are still being charged rent even though they are not able to use their offices.

One member of staff at a call centre in Runcorn operated by Capita said people were still taking calls for the mobile operator O2 involving retention of customers threatening to quit, complaining of a \u201cfilthy\u201d building, dirty toilets and empty hand sanitiser stations. They said they were concerned about catching the virus and giving it to family members with underlying health conditions and were too scared to speak out, as they could be fired.</p> <p>Capita said it had increased cleaning at sites, staff were working from home where possible, and it had no policy of sacking employees who complain on social media: \u201cThe top priority of Capita at this very difficult time is the wellbeing of our people.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Nine women who made complaints of sexual offences against Alex Salmond have urged other women to \u201cbe brave, be loud, be heard\u201d in the face of bullying, sexual harassment and assault, in a powerful rebuke to those who have accused them of conspiring against the former Scottish National party leader.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/alex-salmond-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-sexual-assault-trial\">a jury at the high court in Edinburgh</a> found the former first minister not guilty of 12 sexual assaults, including one attempted rape. It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was \u201cnot proven\u201d, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict, but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law.</p> <p>All verdicts were by majority, following an 11-day trial. Salmond was formally acquitted of one sexual assault charge midway through the court case after it was withdrawn by the prosecution.</p> <p>The nine different women, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and who included Scottish government officials and SNP employees, described in court alleged assaults, many of which they claimed took place late at night in the private rooms of the first minister\u2019s official residence, Bute House.</p> <p>Salmond denied all their allegations, describing them variously as \u201creinterpretations\u201d, \u201cexaggerations\u201d, and \u201cdeliberate fabrications for political purposes\u201d.</p> <p>In a highly unusual move, reflecting the frustration the complainants feel at being characterised as co-conspirators, the women have set out their response to the verdicts, which they describe as \u201cdevastating\u201d.</p> <p>In a joint statement signed jointly by all nine women who testified against Salmond, they write: \u201cWe remain firm in our belief that coming forward to report our experiences and concerns was the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>The women insist that they are still not in direct contact with each other, and that they do not know the identities of all their fellow complainers. The statement was released by Rape Crisis Scotland.</p> <p>Describing the trial as \u201ca traumatic process\u201d, the statement continues: \u201cAs politicians, commentators and society reflect on this case, we would ask you to consider whether behaviour which is so often merely described as \u2018inappropriate\u2019 or is tolerated by society, is acceptable towards your daughters, granddaughters, sisters, wives, friends, and colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>During and since the trial, the women have faced an onslaught of abuse online and have been issued with personal alarms by the police. They add: \u201cWe would also request that as you debate, you conduct it respectfully and stay mindful of the many women in Scotland who may have had traumatic experiences and are considering whether or not Scotland is a country in which they can come forward to seek help and support.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately after the verdict, Salmond\u2019s allies called for prominent officials in Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s office and the Scottish National party to be fired after text messages and emails came to light that Salmond argues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/salmonds-victory-in-court-leaves-questions-over-role-of-snp\">raises serious questions about their role in the case</a>, and their handling of allegations against him, including the botched Scottish government internal inquiry into complaints of sexual misconduct brought against him by two civil servants in 2018. Salmond is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/24/alex-salmond-allies-say-he-plans-to-sue-the-scottish-government\">expected to sue</a> the Scottish government and wants to put his case to the Holyrood inquiry into the handling of the initial allegations.</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s defence was that the allegations had been orchestrated by one of the complainers, witness A, a senior official in the Scottish government, while others had been exaggerated. Giving evidence, Salmond admitted with hindsight he wished he had been \u201cmore careful with people\u2019s personal space\u201d, while his defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC described his behaviour as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d during cross-examination. Since the verdict, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-alex-salmond-a-battle-ends-a-battle-begins\">Salmond\u2019s own former speechwriter described his defence </a>as \u201cI\u2019m sleazy but not criminal\u201d.</p> <p>The women write: \u201cIn defending Alex Salmond, Gordon Jackson quoted Woman H and said his client should have been a \u2018better man\u2019. He said behaviour which others described as demeaning, intimidating and humiliating, was \u2018trivial\u2019. The behaviours that Alex Salmond and his defence team admitted to in evidence were not and are not trivial\u201d. Today we want to send a strong and indisputable message that such behaviours should not be tolerated \u2013 by any person, in any position, under any circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Thanking Police Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service \u201cfor taking our experiences seriously and for allowing our voices to be heard\u201d, they assert: \u201cMany of us did speak up at the time of our incidents but were faced with procedures that could not deal with complaints against such a powerful figure. Others were silenced by fear of repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>The trial raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/salmonds-victory-in-court-leaves-questions-over-role-of-snp\">serious questions about the way the civil service and the SNP dealt with complaints</a>. In their evidence, some of the women said they feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or that the matter would be \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d.</p> <p>The court also heard from a number of witnesses who said that Salmond\u2019s behaviour led to an unofficial ban on him working alone with female civil servants at Bute House late at night. After a junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 \u2013 a charge Salmond denied, stating instead that the pair had \u201ca sleepy cuddle\u201d \u2013 the jury heard that instead of an investigation, civil service officials and Salmond\u2019s most senior aide brokered a private apology from the first minister.</p> <p>The women\u2019s statement argues that \u201cfor too long, women have been let down by organisational structures which should exist to protect them\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should all seek to create an environment in which people can challenge and report behaviours without hesitation or fear of retribution.\u201d</p> <p> Their statement concludes: \u201cWhile we are devastated by the verdict, we will not let it define us. We hope through shining a light on our experiences, it will serve to protect and empower women in the future.\u201d</p>",

Coronavirus presents opportunities for the government to strengthen its grip.\u201d </p> <p>More than 21% of Ugandans live in poverty. At least 60% of them might become poor in the face of disaster.

Children aren isolated without food, water or medicine.</p> <p>In some cases, phones and laptops have been taken away to silence quarantined critics, including <a href=\"https://observer.ug/news/headlines/63943-inside-uganda-s-coronavirus-quarantine\">Jimmy Spire Ssentongo</a>, a cartoonist and university lecturer. He spoke up for people facing coronavirus injustice after he shared his quarantine experience on Facebook and criticised government unfairness in charging people in quarantine $100 a day.</p> <p>In Uganda, the situation of poor people is encompassed in a euphemism, popularised last Christmas when prices rose sharply, as they do every year. \u201c<em>Omwavu wakufa</em>\u201d, the poor person is meant to die. This summary of powerlessness and resignation came up again in the face of Covid-19. Even as the government issues directives for people to stay at home, it has promised no financial bailout or tax relief. People who live from hand to mouth, barely earning enough to feed their families each day, know that hunger may kill them before coronavirus does.</p> <p>But Anthony Masake, <a href=\"https://www.africablogging.org/author/anthony/\">an activist</a> working with Chapter Four, one of the organisations that supported the challenge against the Public Order Management Act, is optimistic that coronavirus might be the lesson African autocrats need.</p> <p>\u201cPeople had their money, ready to run away in case of things like war. And now here is a pandemic, and they are stuck in the same broken hospitals as people they were running away from,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After the crisis, there will have to be candid conversations about the state of healthcare and the country. With this virus, people over 60 are most threatened \u2013 and those are the people with power.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Patience Akumu is a freelance journalist based in Uganda</em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cIt may seem a ridiculous idea but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.\u201d So says Dr Rieux, a central character in Albert Camus\u2019s 1947 novel <em>The Plague</em>. The moral thread running <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\">through the book</a>, and indeed through much of Camus\u2019s work, is the importance of decency to the choices one makes in life.</p> <p>Camus would probably have welcomed the moral choices made by most of the country in this pandemic. This might seem an odd judgment in light of the outcry about people acting selfishly, from supermarket hoarders to seaside revellers.</p> <p>Yet, given the degree to which our lives have been turned upside down, the extent to which we\u2019ve had to curb our usual behaviours, and the swiftness with which the changes have been imposed, what is extraordinary is not that some people are flouting the new social norms but that the vast majority comply with them so willingly and completely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ironically, it\u2019s social duty more than selfishness that is emptying the shelves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even empty supermarket shelves are a signal of how seriously official exhortations about social distancing are being taken. The <a href=\"https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/opinion/why-stockpiling-is-not-the-crazy-selfish-behaviour-that-it-seems/3483\">number of people selfishly hoarding </a>is small. But so many are now at home rather than at work, so many restaurants and cafes closed, so many people shopping less frequently and so buying more each time, that stocks inevitably run low. Ironically, it\u2019s social duty more than selfishness that is emptying the shelves.</p> <p>But if the pandemic has shown most people to be decent and communal-minded, it has also shown how differently we think of others. A YouGov poll suggested that 93% support government measures on social distancing \u2013 and that almost the same number fear that others are <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/03/24/how-covid-19-affecting-british-opinions-jobs-and-w\">not taking them seriously enough</a>.</p> <p>In part, this reflects the character of a pandemic. The US historian Jill Lepore has written of \u201cplague novels\u201d, such as Camus\u2019s work, that \u201cunlike other species of apocalyptic fiction, where the enemy can be chemicals or volcanoes or earthquakes or alien invaders, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/what-our-contagion-fables-are-really-about\">the enemy here is other humans\u201d</a>.</p> <p>This is true not just of plague fiction but also of pandemic fact. From the media to the public, we seem to take the actions of a few idiots, rather than the decency of the vast majority, as representative of human nature.</p> <p>In part, too, the tendency to see other people as the problem is nurtured by a more atomised society. And there\u2019s the paradox: the outpouring of community-mindedness \u2013 from the half a million people who volunteered to help out the NHS to the mutual aid groups that have sprung up nationwide \u2013 takes place against a background of a hollowed-out civic and public life and the fading of many of the organisations through which social solidarity has traditionally been nurtured. It\u2019s perhaps symbolic that social distancing has become the most vital expression of social solidarity.</p> <p>The paradox can be seen too, in the resetting of politics, and in the shifting of the relationship between society and the state. In the space of a few weeks, governments on both sides of the Atlantic have jettisoned policies long considered sacrosanct in good economic management. Commentators who for years have insisted on the need for small government and debt reduction now call for the authorities to \u201cembrace socialism\u201d to save the free market. A Tory minister told the journalist Robert Peston that the government was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boris-must-borrow-from-corbyn-s-playbook-to-prevent-a-coronavirus-crash\">implementing most of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s programme</a>\u201d. And all this after Corbyn was savaged at the polls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca2784762102e7be025c9b049eb8a4e40d43e3e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca2784762102e7be025c9b049eb8a4e40d43e3e4/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Tan and fellow members of the Covid-19 Mutual Aid musicians\u2019 group perform in west London before the two-metre rule was implemented\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Tan and fellow members of the Covid-19 Mutual Aid musicians\u2019 group perform in west London before the two-metre rule was implemented.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Perugia/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/03/21/the-virus-means-the-big-state-is-back\">\u201cbig state is back\u201d</a>, observed the <em>Economist</em>. But it is different from the big state of the past. The postwar Keynesian compact was shaped, at least in part, by the demands of a vibrant labour movement, and given impetus through a Labour government swept into power by popular acclaim. Today\u2019s big state is being brought into being by politicians who, just an election ago, were making the case for austerity, while we the public remain holed up in our houses watching press conferences in which the new social rules are laid down.</p> <p>Decency is a necessary underpinning of the good society, but not a sufficient one. Beyond decency lies politics. How decency is able to express itself, and what kind of society it can build, depends on political will and collective struggles.</p> <p>What happens to the energy unleashed by the mutual aid societies, the NHS volunteers, the food bank helpers, and to the willingness to upend our lives for the common good? Who will give shape to the new relationship being forged between society and the state? Once we have stopped social distancing, these are the questions we will need to address in the post-pandemic world.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>Detainees at immigration detention centers across the American south have alleged heavy-handed crackdowns amid increasing panic and protest over the coronavirus pandemic, according to advocates and recordings of detainees obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>A number of detainees have expressed concern they are not being properly cared for in packed detention centers. Former senior immigration officials and attorneys have <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/release-ice-detainees/608536/\">called for the release of nonviolent detainees</a>.

He has <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ice-detainees-hunger-strike-pepper-sprayed-excessive-force-1452953\">previously denied</a> that the privately operated facility possesses rubber bullets, after detainees have reported their use. Cox did confirm to <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/ice-geo-detention-pine-prairie-pepper-spray-louisiana/\">Mother Jones</a> that seven people at Pine Prairie were pepper-sprayed on Tuesday.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Louisiana, guards at the LaSalle Ice center allegedly sprayed a man with what he called \u201ctoxic gas\u201d on Monday after two other detainees cautioned detainees to forgo meals because food could carry Covid-19. The man was hospitalized, said Ver\u00f3nica Fern\u00e1ndez, a project coordinator with the SPLC\u2019s Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative.</p> <p>Cox did not respond to a request for comment on that incident. He did confirm a separate use of force at LaSalle on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/immigrants-coronavirus-outbreak-ice-protests\">to Buzzfeed News</a>.</p> <p>Since Covid-19 started spreading through the US, health and immigration experts have expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-immigration-centers\">concern </a>that Ice is unequipped to deal with the crisis. The US runs the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/detained-us-largest-immigrant-detention-trump\">largest immigration detention system</a> in the world and there is a well-documented record of infections ballooning <a href=\"https://www.outbreakobservatory.org/outbreakthursday-1/7/11/2019/outbreaks-in-migrant-detention-facilities\">into outbreaks</a> in such facilities. Now, coronavirus has infected some of the agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">employees and detainees</a>, which experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-immigration-centers\">said was inevitable</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">Two detainees</a> in New Jersey Ice facilities and five employees at four facilities in Texas, Colorado and New Jersey have confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Ice. No cases have been publicly announced in southern states.</p> <p>The Trump administration has massively expanded the use of immigration detention facilities, with hardline policies that have driven the detention population to record highs. States in the deep south have opened <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/12/this-map-shows-how-radically-trump-has-changed-immigration-detention/\">more new facilities than anywhere else</a>.</p> <p>Advocates say immigrants held in Louisiana suspect Covid-19 has reached their facilities as the state becomes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/new-orleans-surviving-katrina-battles-covid-19-coronavirus\">a major virus hotspot</a>. At Ice\u2019s South Louisiana center, a woman alleged she saw officers in hazmat suits feeding someone through a slot in a door, Cole said. At LaSalle, Fern\u00e1ndez said, a dorm has reportedly been quarantined, and detainees believe two people have the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not giving people what they need to protect themselves, and that is social distancing,\u201d said Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cThat\u2019s not something people can do in detention.\u201d</p> <p>Ice has said detainees\u2019 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">health, welfare and safety \u2026 is one of the agency\u2019s highest priorities</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince the onset of reports of Covid-19, Ice epidemiologists have been tracking the outbreak, regularly updating infection prevention and control protocols, and issuing guidance to Ice Health Service Corps (IHSC) staff for the screening and management of potential exposure among detainees,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">according to the agency\u2019s website</a>.</p> <p>Some detainees believe they will not receive fair treatment in government care. In a recorded call from Richwood correctional center in Louisiana, released by the Southeast Immigrant Rights Network and the New Orleans Workers\u2019 Center for Racial Justice and shared with the Guardian, one detainee said: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to take a facemask from anyone, from any American, to put it on an immigrant. This means we are going to die.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates say anyone in detention is likely to have a compromised immune system, but some also have pre-existing conditions. Lytle said she spoke to a 61-year-old asthmatic at Jackson Parish correctional center, another facility used by Ice in Louisiana, whom she said was \u201cvery, very worried\u201d and called to tell her people in his dorm were refusing meals.</p> <p>A woman named Denisse, whose husband is at Stewart detention center in Georgia, feared what might happen as new detainees arrived and guards came and went.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just spreading rapidly, you know?\u201d Denisse said. \u201cAnd his immune system is already weak.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband has a pre-existing condition that has become worse since he arrived at the facility in September, she said, adding that he recently underwent a procedure and uses a catheter. She shook with relief when she learned he would be released on Monday. The reason for his release was unclear.</p> <p>Hilda Jorge Perez, whose husband is at Richwood, said he had heart problems and high blood pressure. She worried that if he got infected, she would not be able to see him.</p> <p>Perez\u2019s husband was among at least 60 people who staged a hunger strike earlier this week. The protesters were forced to end the strike after officials told them they would be put in Ice\u2019s version of solitary confinement and have phone and television privileges removed, Perez said.</p> <p>Detainees at Stewart planned a similar strike. They demanded they either be released or deported instead of waiting to be infected, according to recordings of calls provided by a North Carolina advocacy group.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to eat until Ice comes here and gives us answers, and gives us a solution,\u201d one man said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Ice accused advocates of circulating rumors about a hunger strike at Stewart, which she said never happened.</p>",

I know nothing about either the artist \u2013 Stefan Betke, originally from D\u00fcsseldorf, now an in-demand studio technician \u2013 or his authorial intentions.

This punk musical punched through distinctions. Puppets and humans jostled together. The stories were grisly, but their effects were beautiful: when a child burned to death, the fire was evoked in a whirl of flame-coloured petticoats. The music \u2013 a creamy falsetto, a jaunty accordion \u2013 soared and attacked. I saw this during my first year at the <em>Observer</em>; I still think of it as one of my best ever nights in the stalls. <strong>Susannah Clapp</strong></p> <p><strong>Escaped Alone</strong><br>As I watched <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/31/escaped-alone-caryl-churchill-review-royal-court\" title=\"\">Escaped Alone </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/31/escaped-alone-caryl-churchill-review-royal-court\" title=\"\">in 2016</a>, I realised how central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/02/caryl-churchill-at-80-theatre-great-disruptor\" title=\"\">Caryl Churchill</a>\u2019s plays are to my idea of what makes a vital theatre: urgent subjects; provoking form; intensity of speech.

As surely as any of the site-specific performances which have been another major excitement of my years as a critic, Churchill\u2019s work has transported and immersed me. <strong>SC</strong></p> <p><strong>Cyrano de Bergerac<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/23/jamie-lloyd-theatre-director-interview-cyrano-betrayal-pinter-james-mcavoy\" title=\"\">Jamie Lloyd</a>\u2019s electric remaking of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/15/cyrano-review-playhouse-james-mcavoy-crimp-duchess-malfi-almeida-three-sisters-national-inua-ellams\" title=\"\">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></em> (2019) thrilled me by showing how the theatre is changing.

It should have been called \u201cTo Cyr, With Love\u201d. <strong>SC</strong></p> <p><strong>As You Like It</strong><br>The show that lit up the theatre for me a child was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/27/vanessa-redgrave-rosalind-as-you-like-it\" title=\"\">As You Like It</a></em> in 1961, with Vanessa Redgrave as Rosalind. She overflowed with feeling: every syllable seemed to argue with the next. She also wore a very interesting cap. I was fascinated by the sardonic Jaques, played by slinking Max Adrian, and I loved the shepherds making eyes at each other. I couldn\u2019t follow everything, but the drama seemed to promise such an intriguing world, of jokes and romance and sneering. <strong>SC</strong></p> <p><strong>Denise Gough</strong><br>When I admired but failed to recognise Denise Gough as she shimmered in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/21/red-velvet-all-fall-desire-elms\" title=\"\">Desire under the Elms</a> </em>(2012), I realised she was one of those unusual actors who vanish entirely into each role.

Having followed del Toro\u2019s career since <em>Cronos </em>(1993), through the traumas of <em>Mimic</em> (1997) and the success of <em>Hellboy</em> (2004) this proved once again that the greatest art is created by those following their own instincts, without compromise.<strong> Mark Kermode</strong><br><br><strong>Dougal and the Blue Cat</strong><br>Originally released in France in 1970 as <em>Pollux et le Chat Bleu</em>, this <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1409841,.html\" title=\"\">Magic Roundabout</a></em> feature was redubbed by Eric Thompson and Fenella Fielding for the English-speaking market in 1972.

Playing it over and over again would conjure images of the film\u2019s weird Caligari-esque visuals, teaching me that we can watch movies with our ears.<strong> MK</strong></p> <p><strong>Second Coming</strong><br>A reminder that the most exciting films are often the ones you know little about in advance.

Having grown up on horror movies, and lived through the \u201cvideo nasties\u201d panic about the corrupting influence of the genre, it was wonderful to find a modern auteur who cited a traumatic encounter with horror as a formative creative experience. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/09/raw-julia-ducournau-cannibal-fantasy-review-kermode\" title=\"\">Raw/Grave</a></em> (2017) is a thrillingly confident debut feature, buzzing with subversive energy.<strong> MK<br></strong><br><strong>The Ghost That Never Returns</strong><br>With Neil Brand and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/04/glastonbury-silent-cinema-dodge-brothers-beggars-of-life\" title=\"\">Dodge Brothers</a>, I have spent many years providing live, improvised musical accompaniment to silent films. Neil found this dizzying 1930 Soviet oddity, directed by Abram Room, which opens in a panopticon prison, moves to hallucinatory desert scenes, and finishes with a revolutionary call to arms. The strangeness of the narrative is accentuated by the fact that key scenes seem to be missing from surviving prints. Neil showed us how to fill the gaps, demonstrating the narrative power of music \u2013 using it to help the story make sense.<strong> MK</strong></p> <p><strong>Caravaggio </strong><br>Taped from the television on a VHS cassette which warped from repeated viewings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman\" title=\"\">Derek Jarman</a>\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1434768,00.html\" title=\"\">Caravaggio</a></em> (1986) was a game-changer for me. As a teenager with an interest in cinema but, at that point, rather rigid ideas about what movies were allowed to do, watching it was thrilling and unsettling. Transgressive, iconoclastic, seductive: Jarman\u2019s approach tore up the rules to period drama. It shaped my tastes and is one of the reasons that, even now, the cinema that excites me most is the cinema that pushes me out of my comfort zone. <strong>Wendy Ide</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fa953fe3b325917777e79d5d84e34f6df8971fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fa953fe3b325917777e79d5d84e34f6df8971fa/0_75_2760_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter and William Hurt in Broadcast News (1987).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter and William Hurt in Broadcast News (1987).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Broadcast News<br></strong>\u201cNews producer loves, also cries,\u201d so goes my five-word plot summary of the 1987 romantic comedy <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/jul/29/the-hour-broadcast-news-bbc\" title=\"\">Broadcast News</a></em>. I don\u2019t believe you have to see yourself represented to connect with a character, and certainly a brown girl growing up in suburban Birmingham doesn\u2019t appear to have much in common with an overachieving southern belle played by Holly Hunter. Brilliant, fearsome and prone to emotional outbursts, Jane Craig is a pragmatist, driven by her ethics and dogged by her insecurities. Before the days of op-eds about aspirational yet relatable on-screen heroines, she was mine. <strong>Simran Hans</strong></p> <p><strong>Three Colours Red</strong><br>When I was 11, we went on a family cinema trip to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/09/three-colours-red-review\" title=\"\">the third film</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/krzysztof-kieslowski\" title=\"\">Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski</a>\u2019s trilogy of human connection and communication. It was an alien form, but I was captivated: from the extraordinary, whooshing opening shot following a phone call across the Channel, it was the first film to make me consider what the camera could really do and why. I went home and attempted to put down in words what I\u2019d seen, starting a film review diary that never really stopped. <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>Art</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b742ddbfa5ed66dc8252c459541184f016d0f2bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b742ddbfa5ed66dc8252c459541184f016d0f2bf/0_0_4162_4736/879.jpg\" alt=\"Las Meninas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.\" width=\"879\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Las Meninas by Vel\u00e1zquez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Classic Image/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Las Meninas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez</strong><br>Flashing up before you is the mirror-bright vision of a little princess, her servants and the artist himself, gathered in a pool of sunlight at the bottom of a great volume of shadow that instantly sets the tenor of the scene. You know instantly these beautiful children will die, are already dead in fact, yet they live in the here and now of this moment, bright as fireflies \u2013 and what keeps them here, and alive, the artist implies, is not just his 1656 painting, but you. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/03/velazquez-vanishing-man-laura-cumming-john-snare\">It means more to me</a> than any other painting. <strong>Laura Cumming</strong></p> <p><strong>Eva Hesse<br></strong>I had scarcely seen anything by American artist<a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/eva-hesse-1280\"> Eva Hesse</a> before Tate Modern\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/nov/17/1\">2002 retrospective</a>. I\u2019ll never forget the intense beauty, wit and tragicomic force of these paradoxically fragile works, made of little more than beeswax or string. Hesse could create a whole crowd of characters, like this, out of slips of paper. Her work was almost as ephemeral as the artist, who died aged 34 in 1970. Nothing looked like this before, and the fact that so much has since speaks to her extraordinary influence over contemporary sculpture.<strong> LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Self-Portrait by Albrecht D\u00fcrer</strong><br>Someone gave me a postcard of <a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de/en/modules/module-image-text-marginal/1052\">D\u00fcrer\u2019s 1500 self-portrait</a> as a child. It was the first time I realised that art had such power to move. So immediate yet so remote, the hair a glowing triangle, the face transfixing yet closed; I found it/ him stunning, but also frightening. It is exponentially more overwhelming in reality, with its unearthly radiance, symmetry and perfection. This painting inspired me to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/05/laura-cumming-praise-of-self-portraits\" title=\"\">a book on self-portraiture</a>, of which it is exhibit A \u2013 amazingly frontal, Christ-like, epochal, the first great closeup. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>The Visitors by Ragnar Kjartansson<br></strong>Contemporary art absorbs elements of every other art form \u2013 poetry, theatre, cinema, music.

Shot in one take, in a crumbling mansion in upstate New York in 2012, each screen shows a solitary musician performing in a separate room. You can see them, but they are invisible to each other, unwittingly contributing to an overwhelmingly beautiful multi-part elegy for the artist\u2019s failed marriage. Shakespeare in Woodstock; it changed my idea of what art film could be. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Four Mandarin Oranges by \u00c9douard Manet<br></strong>If I had money, I\u2019d travel anywhere to see a Manet. They all come out of such deep looking and living. I saw this little canvas (from 1882) in a show of his still lifes in 2001 \u2013 lemons, asparagus, the flower paintings made when he was dying \u2013 and my exhilaration was completely primitive. I just wanted to be inside the pictures. One aim of criticism is to sustain that feeling, without any loss, while trying to express it in far more considered terms. <strong>LC</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Photography</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e592de6c3e199c2b2d7075cbca1706e3c024c375\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e592de6c3e199c2b2d7075cbca1706e3c024c375/0_0_5409_4240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photograph from Ed van der Elsken\u2019s Love on the Left Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photograph from Ed van der Elsken\u2019s Love on the Left Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed van der Elsken</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Love on the Left Bank</strong><br>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/feb/10/love-on-left-bank-in-pictures\" title=\"\">book</a>,<em> </em>first published in 1954, is a groundbreaking merging of fiction and reality, documentary and staged narrative that was way ahead of its time. Everything about the book \u2013 the images, the text, the characters, the setting \u2013 drew me in when I first picked it up decades later. Photographer Ed Van der Elsken brilliantly evokes the spirit of a short-lived Parisian demimonde where intellectualism and bohemianism went hand in hand. At its centre is cult icon, Vali Myers, as the semi-fictional Anne, her style - kohl-rimmed eyes, big hair and baggy polo necks - defining the beatnik sublime as she moves through the St. Germain night, trailed by a passing cast of beautiful outsiders. \u201cI report on young, rebellious scum with pleasure,\u201d he once remarked.

I didn\u2019t encounter much opera (outside the complete works of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/21/gilbert-and-sullivan-opera-north\" title=\"\">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>) until later. An enlightened music teacher took me to <em>Wozzeck</em> (1925), Alban Berg\u2019s tragedy about one soldier\u2019s humiliation at the hands of his seniors. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that opera could reflect the human condition so probingly, or hauntingly. I fell for the music, its codes and cyphers and hidden tunes, and I fell for opera.<strong> Fiona Maddocks</strong></p> <p><strong>The Trout</strong><br>Apart from being there and doing it, nothing has conveyed the excitement of music-making like this 1969 film of the young, gifted Daniel Barenboim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/from-the-archive-blog/2015/dec/01/jacqueline-du-pre-daniel-barenboim-interview-1969\" title=\"\">Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9</a> and friends (all famous in their own right) giddily performing Schubert\u2019s Trout Quintet. I saw it first as a child. I\u2019ve watched it, mesmerised, countless times since. Christopher Nupen, a pioneer in independent TV film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2015/may/27/schubert-the-trout-watch-a-clip-from-1969-documentary-barenboim-dupre-allegro-films\">caught a precious moment</a>. It became history, made all the more poignant by Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s, not to mention Schubert\u2019s, tragic demise. The joy remains indelible. <strong>FM</strong></p> <p><strong>Brahms\u2019s First Symphony</strong><br>Many works, more radical or off-centre, hooked me early: Stravinsky; Bart\u00f3k and Britten; the revelations of the conductor-composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/10/pierre-boulez-appreciation-nicholas-kenyon-agent-provocateur\">Pierre Boulez</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8o9ngx8Syw\">this symphony</a> made me realise for the first time how it\u2019s not the tunes but something deeper, more abstract and emotional, that speaks to the heart. As a teenager, I bought a secondhand LP, not knowing Brahms but because I liked the moody colours on the cover. The second movement, especially, I played over and over. It felt like my own discovery.<strong> FM</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_three\">BBC Radio 3</a><br></strong>It\u2019s guided me, exposed me to the unfamiliar, explained and informed and, yes, entertained, since as early as I can remember. It used to sound stuffy: old-style announcers. That\u2019s gone. Maybe it\u2019s too gushing at times, but better to enthuse than lecture. The emphasis on live music, still hanging on by a thread as the BBC teeters, gives it a vitality, energy, community: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/proms\">Proms</a>, orchestras, concerts. It\u2019s committed to experiment more than repetition.

It was shocking not only for the violence, but for the programme\u2019s audacity in killing off a seriously major character early. It affected me inordinately: years later, when I interviewed (with difficulty) Robbie Coltrane, it turned out the episode had the same effect on him.

Best of all <a href=\"http://hastingschronicle.net/features/the-hastings-net-shops/\" title=\"\">are the huts</a> erected on the shingle for storing and drying fishing nets, tarred black to resist the weather. They are built tall, like a mini-Manhattan, for lack of space. Their pitched roofs look domestic, but their shortage of windows makes them enigmatic and faintly menacing. There\u2019s a lesson in there about form following function, which may have been lost on my young brain. <strong>Rowan Moore</strong></p> <p><strong>The High Line, New York</strong><br>Yes, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/22/final-stretch-new-york-high-line-complete\" title=\"\">High Line</a> is now an urban Mona Lisa, an attraction so overwhelmed with visitors as to defeat the point of going there. Yes, too, the promise to build \u201ca high line\u201d has now become a gimmick of more-or-less cynical city-boosters around the world. But the original idea, of turning an old railway viaduct into a park like none other, remains brilliant. The execution \u2013 with the selective retention of old metal, semi-wild planting, and occasional moments of theatre \u2013 is not bad either. <strong>RM</strong></p> <p><strong>Dominus Winery, California</strong><br>When I first came across the Swiss architects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/15/herzog-de-meuron-interview-tate-modern-switch-house-extension\" title=\"\">Herzog and De Meuron</a>, in an exhibition at the long-defunct 9H Gallery in the 1980s, I loved their ability to be conceptual and physical at once \u2013 to have ideas and to bring them to life through building materials. Their <a href=\"http://www.dominusestate.com/\" title=\"\">Dominus winery</a> in Napa Valley is a long, low shed whose wrapping of rough stones calms the heat, filters the light and bonds the building to its terrain. As a way of housing an ancient activity in the New World, it\u2019s hard to beat. <strong>RM</strong></p> <p><strong>The Alhambra, Granada, Spain</strong><br>The Alhambra, which I first visited at the end of my first year at architecture school, is just plain heart-stoppingly beautiful. Not just to look at, but also for the ways it plays with your senses: the temperature of the air, the modulation of light, the scent of plants, the sound of water. It is bodily as well as visual, not just a building, but a landscape and garden too. Although it is hardly a secret, and is plainly in Europe, it somehow doesn\u2019t feature in official histories of \u201cEuropean\u201d architecture; as if this perfect summation of the power of architecture was somehow an exotic diversion. <strong>RM</strong></p> <p><strong>Architecture: SESC Pomp\u00e9ia, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil</strong><br>Brazilian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/09/lina-bo-bardi-together-review\" title=\"\">Lina Bo Bardi</a> (1914-92) was almost the perfect architect \u2013 her work is inventive and daring, rooted in the experiences and lives of those who use it. SESC Pomp\u00e9ia, a cultural, sports and social centre, is partly a subtle renovation of an old factory, partly unsubtle new build: three concrete towers linked by exhilarating bridges.

Like many, I first played the game when I was given a Game Boy for Christmas. More than three decades later, <em>Tetris</em>\u2019s pristine lustre is completely undiminished. It is a game whose design feels as eternal as the Pyramids, as unimprovable as the wheel.<strong> SP</strong></p> <p><strong>Rez</strong><br>Video games evolved in the world\u2019s amusement arcades, where financial imperatives led makers to design games orientated around taut tests of dexterity, reaction and high-score competition.

With its spiky, rritualistic movements, dread-filled undertow of sexual violence, folk influences and compulsive repetition, it shattered the elegant conventions of classical ballet. I saw it as a teenager on a late-night drama documentary about the Ballets Russes, and it was like nothing I\u2019d seen before. Choreographed by Nijinsky, scored by Stravinsky, produced by the Ballets Russes, it exists in fragments, memories and reconstructions. It\u2019s inspired many other choreographers, including Pina Bausch, Christopher Hampson and Yang Liping, and has fed into newer works like DV8\u2019s disturbing mid-90s riff on macho behaviour, <em><a href=\"https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/enter-achilles--film\" title=\"\">Enter Achilles</a></em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong>Bidisha</strong></p> <p><strong>Jerome Robbins\u2019 Dances at a Gathering</strong><br>As a ballet-crazed child, my first visit to see the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden was in 1970, for a performance of <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/jerome-robbins\" title=\"\">Jerome Robbins</a>\u2019 magical, breezy dances to Chopin\u2019s piano pieces, performed by a cast that included Rudolf Nureyev. My father had been determined that I would see my idol and bought great seats. We got lost en route because we\u2019d never been to London before. I cried at the end and the die was cast; I have loved ballet for ever. <strong>Sarah Crompton</strong></p> <p><strong>Nureyev and Fonteyn in Romeo and Juliet<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/25/rudolph-nureyev-ballet-triumph-tragedy\" title=\"\">Seeing them</a> on film convinced me that classical ballet could deliver just as much edge as more recent forms. Many critics found the fiery Russian wunderkind and the steely British star duetting as a middle-aged pair of supposed teenaged lovers from ancient Verona to be pathetic, but I disagree. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2015/oct/02/royal-ballet-romeo-and-juliet-50-years-of-star-crossed-dancers-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Their chemistry</a> and love for one another as dance collaborators shines out, and each moment sizzles with their history together. <strong>Bidisha</strong></p> <p><strong>In the Middle Somewhat Elevated</strong><br>Created for the wunderkinder of Nureyev\u2019s Paris Opera Ballet \u2013 the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sylvie-guillem\" title=\"\">Sylvie Guillem</a> among them \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/07/in-the-middle-somewhat-elevated-william-forsythe-dance\" title=\"\">William Forsythe</a>\u2019s deconstruction of classical ballet in 1987 has a casual insolence and a shattering brilliance that works like an electric shock.

There were classic dance movies like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/22/matthew-bourne-the-red-shoes-revival-sadlers-wells-review\" title=\"\">The Red Shoes</a></em>.

We don\u2019t knock on doors and hand parcels over. If we can, we avoid all contact. Many couriers know the safe places where customers are happy for us to leave packages. If it needs a signature we knock, put the parcel down and step right back. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>Some might feel we shouldn\u2019t be out delivering packages but we are keeping people supplied with what they need. Normally you don\u2019t find out what\u2019s in the parcels but customers have started telling us. I\u2019ve been delivering to some families in Whitby for years and this is the first time I\u2019ve actually spoken to them.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Some drivers are reporting peak volumes like they usually see at Christmas. I delivered a pair of warm joggers to an 82-year-old lady. She was worried about her heating bills going up with all the time she was spending indoors. I delivered some toys to a mother stuck at home.

I spend most of the day restocking the shelves. People are still pushing past me or leaning across me to get something on the shelf, rather than waiting for me to move out of their way.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>I am on the till. A couple of people exceed the amount they are allowed to buy, and when I tell them, they swear at me.

It is the first day I feel the message about staying in is slowly starting to get through. But then I see couples still bringing their kids into the shop. Surely one of them could stay at home with their children while the other goes shopping.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>An elderly gentleman is told he needs to stand behind the line while packing his shopping. He makes comments like, \u201cOh, who makes these stupid bloody rules?\u201d But then a man comes up and says he wants to thank us all for what we are doing.

So it was weird, before the lockdown, seeing the streets completely packed.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>Still seeing people on my way to work ignoring the lockdown blew my mind. The big challenge with managing Covid-19 patients is that it\u2019s not obvious when they\u2019re deteriorating. That\u2019s heartbreaking. Patients seem blissfully unaware they may be about to die. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>I have the day off, which I spend reading guidance on the disease and listening to a podcast for non-intensive-care doctors about how to, for example, manage a ventilator.

I have asthma, and my personal protective equipment is just a plastic gown, a pair of gloves and a surgical mask. It\u2019s pretty alarming going in to see a patient who\u2019s coughing their lungs out, and all you\u2019ve got is a piece of paper over your mouth. But Public Health England says that\u2019s all I need. I have got to trust that recommendation, and I do.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>I arrive at work for a night shift. More than 10 people with Covid-19 symptoms are waiting for beds. They all have an oxygen requirement. It gets busy but we remain in control throughout.

  "<p>In these unprecedented times, is wearing makeup a superficial occupation? I\u2019d argue it\u2019s a much-needed mood booster. Historically, women have boldly sported bright lipstick in challenging times. In 1912, Elizabeth Arden famously handed out red lipsticks to the suffragette movement and in the Second World War sent tubes of it to women serving in the military. Wearing a bold lip colour is a sign of defiance, it symbolises fearlessness and it will bring you a little comfort and joy every time you catch your reflection in the mirror.

A silky powder blush in colours for everyone</h2> <p>Blusher can be reassuring, making us look healthier and happier. Surely there\u2019s something in that. Lovers of blush are usually divided into two camps: cream and powder. I\u2019ve never really bought into the cream variety. On fair skin, it adds a youthful flush and the malleable texture means you\u2019re less able to go overboard with it. For darker skins it is a little more complicated \u2013 creams and liquids are rarely bold enough to show up. And if wearing foundation, it doesn\u2019t matter what colour you choose, it\u2019ll all turn to a brown sludge. So I prefer powder blushes. This one from KVD \u2013 a premium vegan, cruelty-free brand \u2013 is one of the best. There are six shades ranging from a nude beige to a tawny rose, with a bold orange thrown in for good measure. It\u2019s enough to suit all skin tones; no one needs a million blushers, just great colours and pigments \u2013 which this has. The texture is also impressive; it glides on like silk. It doesn\u2019t sit in pores and lines, and doesn\u2019t oxidise as the day goes on, so it\u2019s great for all skin types, including mature and oily. The things I love most, however, are that it lasts all day \u2013 hence the name \u2013 and it makes my face look happy. So, if you are looking for a small way to find pleasure in your beauty routine, this is a good place to start. <em>KVD Vegan Beauty Everlasting Blusher, \u00a322, <a href=\"http://boots.com/\">boots.com</a></em></p> <h2>On my radar: Treat your clean hands to some soothing lotion</h2> <p><strong>Soothe and smooth </strong>For a cream that acts as skincare for your hands, look no further.

It still had hundreds of elderly passengers from the UK, US and Australia onboard.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anything,\u201d said Broward county commissioner Michael Udine, who had voiced strong concerns about the ship coming into south Florida. \u201cThat\u2019s something that would have to go through Unified Command at the port first,\u201d referencing a group that includes the US Centers for Disease Control, the coast guard and Florida health department.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still very concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this ship arrives here, it\u2019s going to put a lot of pressure on our local health system.\u201d</p> <p>Panama\u2019s health ministry said it would make a humanitarian exemption to new rules about the global pandemic and allow the cruise ship to pass, adding that canal staff boarding the ship would be given biosafety gear. Canal staff must navigate ships through and the ministry had previously said that doing so would endanger staff.</p> <p>Dozens of symptom-free passengers were moved across from the Zaandam to its sister ship, the Rotterdam. Holland America Line said on Saturday night: \u201cWe are aware of reported permission for both Zaandam and Rotterdam to transit the Panama Canal in the near future. We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew. This remains a dynamic situation, and we continue to work with the Panamanian authorities to finalise details.\u201d</p> <p>While passengers and family members of people on board welcomed the news that the cruise liner would be allowed to pass through the canal, some warned that more passengers would die if better medical attention was not given to those remaining.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really surreal,\u201d said Jih-Hao Jim Cheng, a southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> resident, whose father was sick with a fever onboard the ship. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary for my parents and everyone onboard.\u201d</p> <p>He said his mother had been trying to call the ship staff to get medicine or help but no one was responding. \u201cThe cruise line doesn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that they are getting the well on to another ship. But unless they have a strategy for the sick, more people are going to die soon.\u201d</p>",

The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. </strong>He added: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates</strong> as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths.</strong> In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus</strong> and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d.

The UK prime minister, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus.

The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits</strong> from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. </li> \n   <li><strong>The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332,</strong> while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded.</strong> South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19.

Italy had 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended.</li> \n   <li><strong>France extended its lockdown by a fortnight.</strong> France has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, </strong>said the head of the French Hospital Federation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Four died on a cruise ship after the outbreak.</strong> Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US approved a $2.2tn economic stimulus package.</strong> Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T00:40:29.843Z\">at 12.40am GMT</time></p> \n</div>"
