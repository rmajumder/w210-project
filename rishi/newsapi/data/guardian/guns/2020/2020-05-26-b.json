  "<p>Joshua Kimmich\u2019s sublime chip gave Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at second-placed Borussia Dortmund in <em>Der Klassiker</em> as the Bundesliga leaders put one hand on the title. Kimmich\u2019s perfectly weighted effort left Roman B\u00fcrki stranded in the 43rd minute as the champions landed a big win at an empty stadium that normally seats 80,000 fans.</p> <p>\u201cWe now have a good cushion on Dortmund,\u201d Kimmich said. \u201cThat was brutally important today. \u201cIt\u2019ll be mentally difficult for Dortmund to keep up. We have to reaffirm this lead in the next games. You could see that it was very, very intense and we had to work our way up to the three points. It was relatively balanced, especially in the first half we made many simple mistakes. Dortmund were very bold.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/may/26/borussia-dortmund-v-bayern-munich-der-klassiker-live\">Borussia Dortmund 0-1 Bayern Munich: Bundesliga's Klassiker \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bayern are now unbeaten in 13 league matches in their quest for a record-extending eighth straight league crown and are seven points clear at the top with six games to play. RB Leipzig, who face Hertha Berlin on Wednesday, are third a further three points behind Dortmund.</p> <p>The Bundesliga became the first major league to restart 10 days ago after a break of more than two months because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with games played without supporters to reduce the risk of infection. <br>It all started well for Dortmund, who were on a six-game winning streak in the league at the start, when Erling Braut Haaland almost scored for the hosts in the opening seconds. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng had to clear the ball off the line.</p> <p>The visitors gradually found their footing and had their own effort cleared off the line when Lukasz Piszczek denied Serge Gnabry from close range. In a fluid and entertaining first half 19-year-old Haaland should have done better when he was sent through in the 33rd minute, but Alphonso Davies stole the ball away.</p> <p>It was Kimmich\u2019s delightful effort that settled the game when he spotted B\u00fcrki off his line and chipped the ball from the edge of the penalty area over the keeper. Bayern stayed in control after the break and an injury meant Dortmund lost Haaland, who earlier had another effort deflected wide by Boateng\u2019s elbow, with 18 minutes left.</p> <p>Dortmund\u2019s Mo Dahoud tried his luck from outside the boxpenalty area but Manuel Neuer, on his 400th league appearance, managed to preserve his clean sheet and Robert Lewandowski came close to giving Bayern a second goal, hitting a post in the 83rd minute.</p> <p>Dortmund\u2019s Mats Hummels, who used to play for Bayern, said: \u201cWe were too wasteful around the penalty area in the first half,. We had two or three opportunities to shoot. It was that all-important final ball. It was missing in certain moments, otherwise we would have had chances. When we did have the chances, then our finishing wasn\u2019t good enough. It was not a poor performance. We fell just a little short.</p> <p>\u201cEvery team apart from Bayern is now out of the title race. Now it is entirely up to Bayern to decide whether they win it or not.\u201d</p> <h2>Bundesliga roundup</h2> <p>Marin Pongracic scored his first two Bundesliga goals as <strong>Wolfsburg</strong> romped to a surprise 4-1 win at <strong>Bayer Leverkusen</strong>, boosting their hopes of playing in European competition next season. Cardboard fans in the otherwise empty stadium did little to inspire Leverkusen, who had won both their games since the season restarted. Centre-back Pongracic headed the visitors into a 43rd-minute lead when he met a Maximilian Arnold free-kick. Arnold made it 2-0 with a heavily deflected free-kick and Renato Steffen headed in the third soon after. Another fine cross by Arnold allowed Pongracic to make it four with a glancing header before Julian Baumgartlinger scored a late consolation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ffc05cdd1b34159c0e551df1be428f3cb43eb3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ffc05cdd1b34159c0e551df1be428f3cb43eb3b/43_0_5281_3170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marin Pongracic (bottom) scores Wolfsburg\u2019 opener to spark the unexpected thrashing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marin Pongracic (bottom) scores Wolfsburg\u2019s opener to spark the unexpected thrashing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marius Becker/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Werder Bremen</strong> drew 0-0 at home to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, a result which moved the visitors into the top four but kept Bremen in the relegation zone. Bremen came alive in the second half and missed a couple of big chances, above all when substitute Davie Selke cut into the area in the 89th minute but could only fire straight at visiting goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Gladbach had a flurry of early chances but their attacking ambitions faded. \u201cEvery point is important in our situation, but if you watched the game you would say that we deserved more,\u201d Bremen\u2019s Davy Klaassen said.</p> <p><strong>Eintracht Frankfurt</strong> ended a run of five successive Bundesliga defeats as they staged a late rally to draw 3-3 at home draw with <strong>Freiburg</strong>. Daichi Kamada and Timothy Chandler scored in the closing stages to rescue a vital point for the struggling hosts who had inexplicably slipped 3-1 behind in a match they dominated. Andr\u00e9 Silva scored the home side\u2019s other goal when he equalised in the first half for Frankfurt. Vincenzo Grifo had opened the scoring for Freiburg before Nils Petersen and Lucas H\u00f6ler also put away rare chances for the seventh-placed visitors, who were looking to boost their European hopes.</p>",

  "<p>Cometh the hour, cometh the man. There was a brief moment after Matt Hancock recovered from coronavirus when he appeared to be a man of principle. That proved to be nothing more than a chimera. Now he has revealed himself to be the most abject of career politicians, who will literally do and say anything to save his job. </p> <p>So there was no one Boris Johnson could have trusted more than Matt to have taken the Downing Street press conference on the day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">Dominic Cummings had been granted the freedom of the N</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">o 10 rose garden</a> \u2013 there\u2019s a code for special advisers specifically saying they should not make public statements \u2013 to annihilate what was left of his credibility. Needy Matt is the health secretary with the perfect grasp of the public good.</p> <p>When it came to a straight choice between sticking to government health guidelines or protecting the career of Boris\u2019s boss, it was a no-brainer. Who cared if thousands more might die because they couldn\u2019t see the point of sticking to the rules if Dom didn\u2019t, providing Downing Street\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/emily-maitlis-prince-andrew-was-unleashed-he-wanted-to-tell-me-everything\">very own Prince Andrew</a> was still in post? Long live the People\u2019s Government! Oddly, we haven\u2019t heard that slogan much lately. Can\u2019t think why.</p> <p>How did Matt let it come to this? What makes the tragedy so riddled with pathos is that Hancock deep down knows he is so busted. That he has traded what passed for his self-respect for loyalty to two men who think morality is for suckers. You can see it in the terror in his eyes and the increasing shirtiness in his responses. He is now so brittle, he could shatter into a thousand tiny fragments at any moment. I give it five days at most.</p> <p>Because not only has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/what-is-the-test-track-and-trace-system-in-england-coronavirus\">his track-and-trace </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/what-is-the-test-track-and-trace-system-in-england-coronavirus\">app proved to be totally useless</a>, but he\u2019s also only got five days to meet the arbitrary target of 200,000 tests a day that Boris set when under pressure from Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions. So far, we\u2019re on under 110,000. It\u2019s just not going to happen, Matt. And the public won\u2019t get fooled twice with fake testing targets. As it is, Laughing Boy Dom has already as good as turned the country feral.</p> <p>Having basically admitted he had nothing to say about anything, Needy Matt first took a question from a vicar in Brighton. That won\u2019t be allowed to happen again, because Martin asked if everyone who had been done for travelling with children could have their fixed penalty notices rescinded. Matt\u2019s eyes widened and darted about in panic. \u201cEr\u2026\u201d he said. Perhaps that might not be such a bad idea. He\u2019d have a word with the chancellor.</p> <p>It was now clear that there was no law Classic Dom might have broken over the past 20 years that the government wouldn\u2019t be willing to review, just to keep the de facto prime minister in his job. That dope Dom might have smoked at university? Maybe it was time to have drugs legalised after all. That time Dom had driven at 35mph in a 30mph zone? Maybe it was time to up the speed limit so that kids could learn to keep their wits about them in urban areas. That blogpost on pandemics Dom had said he wrote a year ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-faces-questions-over-claim-he-warned-last-year-of-virus-threat\">which it has now emerged had been updated </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-faces-questions-over-claim-he-warned-last-year-of-virus-threat\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-faces-questions-over-claim-he-warned-last-year-of-virus-threat\">few weeks back</a>? Actually, scrub that: duplicity has already become an accepted practice in the current administration.</p> <p>Having rewritten half the penal code, Matt got down to the real business of defending Dom\u2019s moonlight flit to Durham. Classic Dom had absolutely followed the guidelines to the letter. The instructions couldn\u2019t have been more clear. In the event of your partner getting coronavirus and you finding yourself in exceptional danger of having to be responsible for childcare on your own \u2013 just imagine! \u2013 you were expected to go into work the next day to pass on the infection before driving 260 miles north to your father\u2019s estate. It had been so sad Dom had only been able to stay in a concrete outhouse \u2013 so that you could overload the NHS services somewhere else when your son got ill.</p> <p>It would also be now mandatory for everyone to drive to Barnard Castle as part of the DVLA eyesight test for a nice family day out by the river. And there was no question of his wife being allowed to drive the car at any point even though she had frequently written about having done so. The Cummingses\u2019 car was a manual. Which meant it had to be driven by a man. There was also no need for Dom to have at any time told anyone where he was, because he was the nation\u2019s leader and he could do what he liked.</p> <p>Needy Matt was adamant, however, that the little people should continue to obey the government\u2019s instructions on self-isolation and freedom of movement because they were both too stupid and not important enough to be allowed to use their own judgment. \u201cPeople must keep their resolve,\u201d he pleaded tetchily. All other questions were basically dismissed. Robert Peston was sawn off at the knees before he had even completed his question and other journalists were given brief non-answers and no follow-ups.</p> <p>The 71% of the country \u2013 including the ever-so-brave Jeremy Hunt, who had written to constituents explaining that though Classic Dom had broken the guidelines on three occasions he was basically too timid to raise it with the prime minister \u2013 who thought Cummings was an establishment elite chancer were basically just wrong. And that was an end to the matter. </p> <p>The important thing was that he and Dom should remain in their jobs. It was just that Matt\u2019s job description had changed over the course of the brief 30-minute presser. Needy Matt had become Door Matt. A useful idiot to be walked all over, because there\u2019s no way the Dom story is going away. There is no happy ending. The government is hopelessly compromised. As is Matt. The hollowed-out health secretary without qualities. No integrity. No competence. No anything. Sans eyes, sans teeth, sans everything.</p>",
  "<p>A serial rapist plunged from a cliff and broke his back after police flushed him out of his hideout following a two-week manhunt on Corfu.</p> <p>Dimitris Aspiotis \u2013 dubbed the beast of Kavos after receiving a 53-year-sentence for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/31/rapist-british-holidaymakers-arrested-corfu\">sexually assaulting six British women</a> \u2013 had been released early from a lengthy prison term but is now wanted on fresh charges.</p> <p>On Tuesday the 47-year-old was under armed guard in Corfu\u2019s hospital after breaking his back and suffering multiple wounds in the 200-metre fall from a seaside cliff as he sought to evade arrest as officers closed in. It took the fire brigade and other emergency services three hours to extract him from the remote ravine into which he had fallen. </p> <p>\u201cHe is now severely injured,\u201d Corfu\u2019s police chief, Manthos Yiannoulis, told local television. He said there were signs that Aspiotis had been aided and abetted when he went to ground after an Albanian woman, aged 34, on the island reported that she had been repeatedly raped at knifepoint by him.</p> <p>\u201cIn the framework of the inquiry that is launched, when he recovers we will look into whether a third person, or not, was involved,\u201d Yiannoulis said.</p> <p>Police used drones, sniffer dogs and tracking devices for more than two weeks as they sought to find him. When his hideout was eventually discovered, deep in a forest setting, search teams found a loaded hunting rifle, several knives, screwdrivers, pliers, black rubber gloves, mobile phones and survival equipment.</p> <p>The police chief said that \u201cmore than 100 men\u201d were involved in the hunt. As the days went by his force had come under growing pressure to capture the criminal, he added, citing the threat of a tourist boycott of Corfu.</p> <p>\u201cAspiotis is a man of the forest. He knew the area very well and he managed to survive in conditions that would have been impossible for the average person,\u201d Yiannoulis said. \u201cIt was unacceptable for many in England that he had been freed from prison. It was a matter of honour for us to get him. We combed the area day and night.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors who examined the Albanian woman said it was clear she had been raped multiple times. The woman described how this May she was abducted at knifepoint and taken to a breeze-block animal shelter in the forest where she was kept for several days before she escaped.</p> <p>Aspiotis was convicted of raping three female tourists in the summer of 2010. He was given a 53-year sentence in 2012. The attacks occurred shortly after he was released from prison after being found guilty of three previous rapes. He was allowed to walk free in 2018 under a law aimed at lessening severe overcrowding in the country\u2019s prisons.</p> <p>The case has highlighted what is widely regarded as failure of the Greek judicial system to protect the public from hardened criminals. The controversial law has now been scrapped for cases of rape and other violent crimes. Under the terms of his release Aspiotis had to remain on the island and regularly report to the police.</p> <p>Describing Aspiotis as extremely dangerous the police chief said the serial rapist had been forced to emerge from his forest lair for food and was then seen by local residents.</p> <p>A public prosecutor will formally charge Aspiotis with another rape once he has had surgery on Corfu.</p> <p>Kayleigh Morgan, a British Airways steward, one of his victims, chose to publicly campaign against Aspiotis\u2019 release. She told the Sun newspaper: \u201cI warned he would strike again and was proved right. I\u2019m just glad he was caught before yet another woman\u2019s life was ruined.\u201d</p>",

Ross said the way that Cummings had interpreted the lockdown rules was at odds with the vast majority of the public who followed them. The prime minister\u2019s key aide was defended this morning by the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and at the daily press briefing by the health secretary Matt Hancock, who maintained his explanation had shown that he acted within the guidelines. A growing number of Tory MPs, however, disagree and have revolted against the government, calling for Cummings to either resign or be sacked.</li> \n   <li><strong>Westminster Opposition parties, bar Labour, penned a joint letter to the prime minister calling for Cummings to go</strong><em><strong>.</strong> </em>The leaders said in the letter, which was also sent to Patrick Vallance who chairs Sage, that the issue transcended politics and Cumming\u2019s behaviour is \u201ca matter of public health\u201d. The letter urged Boris Johnson to restore trust and clarity to public health messaging by sacking his key adviser. </li> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock said the government would review the fines imposed on families travelling during lockdown for childcare purposes.</strong> The pledge was made following a question from a member of the public at the daily press conference, which put Hancock on the spot. The government then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1265328468067311616\">said Hancock had not announced a review</a>, but that he had said he would pass on the concerns to colleagues. </li> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock described a new trial of the Remdesivir drug as \u201cthe biggest step forward\u201d in treatment since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.</strong> The anti-viral drug was used during the Ebola outbreak, and the health secretary said early data suggests it can shorten recovery time from Covid-19 by four days.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s death toll passed 37,000, rising by 134 to 37,048.</strong> The ONS figure, however, which includes all deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate \u2013 so, both confirmed or suspected cases \u2013 is <strong>42,173</strong> deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales were recorded to 15 May (registered up to 23 May).

Scottish Tory MSPs in particular are deeply vexed by the Cummings row, all too aware how it plays to Scottish voters in terms of entitlement of distant London elites, and no doubt missing their former leader Ruth Davidson\u2019s talent for distancing her group from Westminster clusterbourachs.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s worth remembering that these politicians face re-election next May, and are looking at Ipsos Mori polling for the BBC this morning that found 82% of Scots think <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has handled the coronavirus crisis well, in contrast to 30% saying the same thing about Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <p>Plus, Ross, who unseated the SNP\u2019s then Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, in Moray in 2017, has a majority of little over 500, which can only sharpen his response to the outrage of constituents that he detailed in his resignation statement. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T10:44:55.300Z\">at 11.44am

He wanted to make sure that before he took the journey down the A1 that he was safe to drive and, of course, during the course of that journey he confirmed to himself that he was safe to drive.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When highlighted that driving when your eyesight is not good enough is an offence under the Road Traffic Act, Gove replied: \u201cDominic\u2019s eyesight was good enough, that was the whole point of the journey, to determine that he could drive safely.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Pressed again over whether he was entirely happy with Cummings\u2019 explanation \u2013 especially given the trip to Barnard Castle was on his wife\u2019s birthday \u2013 Gove replied: \u201cYes, but, to my mind I can\u2019t see the relevance of that. He drove to Barnard Castle, the family stopped, he walked a few yards, sat on a bench for a short period of time, then walked back to the car and then drove back to his home.

  "<p>The most powerful indictments of Beijing\u2019s plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/beijing-to-impose-hong-kong-security-laws-without-delay\" title=\"\">impose a national security law</a> on Hong Kong have not come from pro-democracy activists, but from the authorities themselves. They have told the city\u2019s residents all they need to know about the proposals which China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament is due to pass this Thursday.</p> <p>Thousands have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/hong-kong-protests-unauthorised-rally-police-china-laws\" title=\"\">already protested</a> against the plans, which will bar subversion, separatism or acts of foreign interference. More are <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3086000/hong-kong-police-ramp-security-ahead-planned-protests\" title=\"\">expected</a> to take to the streets on Wednesday, as people oppose the second reading of a separate bill in Hong Kong that criminalises \u201cdisrespecting\u201d the national anthem, with a penalty of up to three years in jail.</p> <p>They believe that the national security law spells the end of China\u2019s promise that Hong Kong could maintain its way of life \u2013 which has long included rights such as freedom of expression and protest \u2013 until 2047, under the arrangement known as one country, two systems. The city\u2019s mini-constitution states that it should pass its own security law, but the unpopularity of the measure made authorities back off 17 years ago. Existing laws are more than ample if Beijing\u2019s true concern is security: they have allowed the arrest of more than 8,000 people in less than a year. There is already a specific ordinance to deal with terrorism, the other spectre invoked by officials.</p> <p>Authorities insist the legislation will not impact on Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, while at the same time underlining that it will, in fact, destroy it. The very decision to impose it from above is one of those signals. (Hong Kong\u2019s bar association has <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3085991/hong-kong-bar-association-questions-beijings-legal-power\" title=\"\">questioned</a> whether Beijing has the legal authority to do so.) But others have followed last week\u2019s shock announcement. China\u2019s foreign commissioner in the region said that freedoms of the press and speech would be unchanged \u2013 before warning the media against using them as a \u201cpretext\u201d to undermine national sovereignty and security.</p> <p>Even more striking was the time limit implied in the <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2020/05/26/freedoms-assured-under-security-law-hongkongers-can-say-what-they-like-for-time-being-says-leader-carrie-lam/\" title=\"\">response</a> of Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, to criticism of the proposed security laws: \u201cWe are a very free society, so for the time being, people have the freedom to say whatever they want to say.\u201d Pressed on whether the law could be applied retrospectively, as many fear, she would not rule it out.</p> <p>The populist state newspaper Global Times was more openly threatening, <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1189312.shtml\" title=\"\">writing</a> that the pro-democracy billionaire Jimmy Lai\u2019s Twitter account had \u201cprovided evidence for national security agencies of acts of subversion, experts warned\u201d.</p> <p>None of this will surprise Hong Kong\u2019s people. They are painfully aware of how national security legislation is used to punish dissidents, scholars, lawyers and activists on the mainland. The most famous, the Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo, died three years ago while serving his 11-year sentence for inciting state subversion, having co-authored and gathered signatures for a letter calling for democratic reforms.</p> <p>These pronouncements are designed to sow fear and undermine opposition. The vote will pass on Thursday; the question for Hong Kong\u2019s future is how it is implemented and enforced. That is why other countries, particularly Britain, must take a stand \u2013 including at next month\u2019s G7 meeting \u2013 and why businesses and others should do so too. We know how China wants to use this law. How it actually does so is yet to be determined.</p>",

The US rights organisation Freedom House classified Hungary as a \u201chybrid regime\u201d this year, placing the country somewhere between a democracy and an autocracy.</p> <p>Hungarian government officials have seized on some incorrect international reporting that claimed that parliament had been suspended, saying all international criticism of the measures was \u201cfake news\u201d. Although the measures are likely to end by the end of next month, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s critics say this should not obscure the damage done, which follows a decade of gradual erosion of democratic norms in Hungary.</p> <p>More than 100 decrees have been issued since April, some of which appeared to have little direct relevance to fighting coronavirus, such as those that stripped opposition-led municipalities of decision-making power and financial resources.</p> <p>A separate measure also included potential prison sentences for spreading false information. Although no cases have yet come to court under the decree, police have launched more than 100 investigations and in some cases have hauled citizens in for questioning over critical Facebook posts.</p> <p>The emergency laws \u201cstill have a month to go, and we also don\u2019t know which measures will remain in place after the state of danger is ended\u201d, said P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, who runs the Political Capital thinktank in Budapest.</p> <p>During the past two months, parliament has also passed a number of controversial legislative bills in the normal way, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/hungary-votes-to-end-legal-recognition-of-trans-people\">one that strips transgender people of legal recognition</a>.</p> <p>Varga said the emergency legislation had allowed the government \u201cto act quickly and effectively against the pandemic\u201d. As of Tuesday, Hungary has reported a total of 3,771 coronavirus cases and 499 deaths, low numbers in comparison with western European countries. Orb\u00e1n implemented an early lockdown, which in recent weeks has been gradually eased.</p>",
  "<p>As Governor Andrew Cuomo faced a spirited challenge in his bid to win New York\u2019s 2018 Democratic primary, his political apparatus got a last-minute boost: a powerful healthcare industry group suddenly poured more than $1m into a Democratic committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/nyregion/cynthia-nixon-cuomo-anti-semitism-mailer.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\">backing</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/03/12/new-york-democrats-launch-gun-ad-campaign-featuring-cuomo-310558\">his campaign</a>.</p> <p>Less than two years after that flood of cash from the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), Cuomo signed legislation last month quietly shielding hospital and nursing home executives from the threat of lawsuits stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

Amid <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/nursing-home-coronavirus-deaths-dont-match-official-ny-state-tallies/\">allegations</a> of undercounted casualties, the governor also <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/21/nursing-homes-responsible-for-coronavirus-case-reporting-cuomo/\">pushed back</a> against pressure to have state regulators more stringently record and report death rates in nursing homes.</p> <p>And then came <a href=\"https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=%0D%0A&amp;leg_video=&amp;bn=A9506&amp;term=0&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Memo=Y&amp;Text=Y\">Cuomo\u2019s annual budget</a> \u2013 which included a little-noticed passage shielding corporate officials who run New York hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities from liability for Covid-related deaths and injuries.</p> <p>GNYHA \u2013 a lobbying group for hospital systems, including some that own nursing homes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gnyha.org/news/gnyha-secures-immunity-for-hospitals-and-workers-from-liability-in-connection-with-the-covid-19-emergency/\">said</a> it \u201cdrafted and aggressively advocated for\u201d the immunity provision.

In pushing for a vote on the legislation, bill author Kim is circulating a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/4cnp9drx3vf17lk/2020_RK_ImmunityKills%20Report%20DRAFT%20TWO%20Final.pdf?dl=0\">report</a> to other lawmakers that he says shows that liability shields are linked to higher nursing home death rates.</p> <p>To date, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6927790-Kohn-Roberts-Chart-05-25-20.html\">19 states</a> have enacted some form of immunity for hospitals and nursing homes during the pandemic. Based on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-cases-nursing-homes-us.html\">data reported by the New York Times</a>, Kim\u2019s analysis asserts that more than three-quarters of total nursing home deaths from Covid-19 come from states that have granted corporate immunity to healthcare facilities.</p> <p>The analysis found that \u201cof the 10 states with the highest fatality rates, eight have corporate immunity and represent 93% of all fatalities, or 63,187 deaths\u201d. The report also says the data show that \u201cstates with corporate immunity saw more than three times the absolute number of fatalities than states without such immunity. The average rate of death per state is 7.5 times higher in states with corporate immunity than states with no immunity for corporations.\u201d</p> <p>In all, the report concludes: \u201c77% of total deaths come from states that gave immunity to corporations who owned nursing homes and healthcare facilities; moreover, 76% of total nursing home deaths come from states that have legal immunity status for these facilities.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Giving immunity to corporations in care work before the apex of a pandemic leads to higher fatalities</p> <footer> <cite>Ron Kim</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSimply put, people are 7.5 times more likely to die from Covid-19 in states with corporate legal immunity,\u201d Kim said. \u201cGiving immunity to corporations in care work before the apex of a pandemic leads to higher fatalities. It is clear that businesses, especially nursing homes that interface with Covid-19 positive individuals, are less compelled to implement proper procedures that save lives.\u201d</p> <p>Azzopardi disputed the report\u2019s findings, calling it a \u201cflaming hot pile of bad math and inaccurate, skewed metrics\u201d. He said the report initially overstated the per-capita death rate in the state\u2019s nursing homes, and he questioned whether it accounts for the fact that other states may share less information than New York.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is the states cited happened to also be mainly those hardest hit east coast states that received the 3 million travelers from Europe, which brought the virus here for weeks after travel from China was blocked, greatly helping the west coast,\u201d Azzopardi said.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The </strong><strong>industry </strong><strong>gets </strong><strong>caught </strong><strong>with </strong><strong>its </strong><strong>pants </strong><strong>down \u2026 </strong><strong>we\u2019re </strong><strong>now </strong><strong>telling </strong><strong>them </strong><strong>they </strong><strong>don\u2019t </strong><strong>have to </strong><strong>wear </strong><strong>pants\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Azzopardi asserted that the new immunity law \u201cbuilds on NY Good Samaritan laws which say that if you provide medical help to someone at the scene of an accident in an emergency you are immune from suit\u201d.</p> <p>But some legal experts counter that the new provision represents a significant departure from the state\u2019s longstanding laws.</p> <p>Prior to the change, New York <a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/public-health-law/pbh-sect-2808-a.html\">statutes</a> went out of their way to declare that nursing home companies and their executives are liable for corporate misconduct. In one high-profile class action case in central New York last year, a judge <a href=\"https://cnycentral.com/news/local/james-square-legal-battle-continues\">denied</a> James Square nursing home\u2019s motion to shield owners and shareholders from liability over allegations that the company\u2019s cost-cutting measures endangered patients.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t have a problem with giving frontline workers immunity, it is the people who make the business decisions that kill people</p> <footer> <cite>Jeremiah Frei-Pearson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with giving frontline workers immunity, it is the people who make the business decisions that kill people \u2013 they are the ones who have to be held personally responsible,\u201d said attorney Jeremiah Frei-Pearson, who represented James Square residents in their <a href=\"https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2018/06/13/new-owners-of-former-james-square-nursing-home-offer-settlement\">successful</a> suit, which ultimately forced the company to spend more money to increase staffing at the facility. \u201cMany of the corporate owners are just trying to make money \u2013 they don\u2019t care about the elderly people in their custody, and if you take them off the hook, they are going to do the absolute minimum, which risks lives.\u201d</p> <p>Under Cuomo\u2019s new liability shield law, that kind of ruling may be harder to secure at a time when the Trump administration has been <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/nursing-home-fines-drop-as-trump-administration-heeds-industry-complaints/\">reducing fines</a> against nursing home operators and is now <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/499286-nursing-homes-need-increased-staffing-not-legal-immunity\">suspending</a> safety enforcement during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a longstanding problem holding nursing homes responsible, because if you look at government enforcement, it\u2019s typically a slap on the wrist. A private lawsuit is often all you have left to hold a nursing home accountable,\u201d said Syracuse University\u2019s Kohn. \u201cGranting immunity sends a terrible message for the future. The industry gets caught with its pants down during the crisis, and we\u2019re now telling them they don\u2019t have to wear pants.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>They </strong><strong>could </strong><strong>sue </strong><strong>but </strong><strong>now </strong><strong>because of </strong><strong>this </strong><strong>immunity </strong><strong>they </strong><strong>cannot</strong></h2> <p>As they push to expand immunity laws across the country, the hospital and nursing home industries have continued to cast their campaign as a necessary defense of medical workers.</p> <p>\u201cAs our care providers make these difficult decisions, they need to know they will not be prosecuted or persecuted,\u201d said an emblematic <a href=\"https://dig.abclocal.go.com/kgo/PDF/050120-kgo-immunity-pdf.pdf\">letter</a> from industry groups pressing California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to issue an executive order shielding them from legal liability.</p> <p>And yet Kohn\u2019s research shows that 16 out of the 19 states that created liability protections extended immunity to both individual workers and nursing home facilities as a whole. New York \u2013 unlike many other states \u2013 explicitly extended the immunity to company executives and corporate board members who are not on the frontlines, but who are making key budget and staffing decisions that affect workers and patients.</p> <p>Kim says that the expansion beyond healthcare workers is not an accident \u2013 he said it deliberately \u201cdiscourages medical staff and frontline workers in nursing homes from safely coming out against malpractices they might observe from executive leadership\u201d.</p> <p>That assertion was echoed by University of Wyoming law professor <a href=\"http://www.uwyo.edu/law/directory/mike-duff.html\">Michael Duff</a>, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on workplace law. He said that while the change does not modify traditional workers\u2019 compensation protections for hospital or nursing home employees, it could reduce the legal rights of contract workers to demand better safety protections at precisely the moment that healthcare facilities are outsourcing work to third-party staffing firms.</p> <p>\u201cOften medical personnel in operating rooms and emergency areas are contracted out [and] the same often goes for groups like janitorial services,\u201d said Duff, a former National Labor Relations Board investigator. \u201cOrdinarily, employees of the institutions would be unable to sue because of workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy rule. But independent contractors aren\u2019t bound by that rule. They could sue but now because of this immunity they cannot.\u201d</p> <p>For its part, the Cuomo administration has struck a defiant tone. During a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlG-WWm1T4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2656\">televised press conference this weekend</a>, DeRosa suggested that New York\u2019s nursing-home casualty rates are not anomalously high \u2013 and she argued that the state\u2019s \u201cconfirmed\u201d death rates are in line with other states, though <a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/05/ny-didnt-count-nursing-home-coronavirus-victims-for-weeks-then-a-stumbling-rush-for-a-death-toll.html\">others</a> have asserted that the state has been undercounting nursing home casualties.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cuomo has <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavirus/billionaires-re-imagine-new-york-1.44474410\">enlisted</a> titans to lead a <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-20\">15-member commission</a> focused on \u201creimagining\u201d New York and its public policies.

  "<p>When you heard that Foxtel had launched a new streaming service, two questions may have sprung to mind: do we really need <em>another</em> one of these? And didn\u2019t Foxtel try this twice already \u2013 and fail terribly both times?</p> <p>While some would argue Australia is spoiled for choice when it comes to subscription TV, there has been a gap in the market. Netflix is primarily focused around its original productions, while competitors such as Stan are buying up the rights to the limited smattering of shows that aren\u2019t already locked away under other deals.</p> <p>Following on from Foxtel\u2019s previous less-than-half-hearted and overpriced efforts, Binge is entering the Australian streaming market with the strength of pre-existing Foxtel deals as its foundation \u2013 and a more affordable price tag.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuB2VNA8MLQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MuB2VNA8MLQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Here\u2019s everything else you need to know.</p> <h2><strong>What is Binge, how much does it cost and what does it offer?</strong></h2> <p>After years of being seen as old-fashioned and overpriced, Foxtel \u2013 controlled by News Corp \u2013 has launched a streaming product that emulates its rivals Netflix and Stan (the latter which is owned by Nine).</p> <p>Like those services, Binge offers movies, TV series, reality and specials \u2013 and it has a very similar user interface: rows of things to watch broken up into different categories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/from-hannah-gadsbys-douglas-to-the-great-whats-new-to-streaming-in-australia-in-may\">From Hannah Gadsby's Douglas to The Great: what's new to streaming in Australia in May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also remarkably similar in terms of price. Binge has three month-to-month plans: an entry-level tier that allows users to stream on one device at a time, in standard definition, for $10 per month; a standard plan, which most will sign up for, which costs $14 per month and allows two devices at once in high definition; and an $18 premium monthly plan, which also offers HD, for four simultaneous devices.</p> <p>Binge\u2019s major advantage is its library. Through deals struck with Foxtel, it delivers content from WarnerMedia (which owns HBO), NBC Universal, FX, the BBC as well as Sony. Think: Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Succession, Friends, Seinfeld, The Sopranos, Law &amp; Order: SVU, 30 Rock, Chernobyl and Big Little Lies.</p> <p>These are the same shows already available through Foxtel, but at a significantly cheaper price \u2013 and delivered in a way that younger and more tech-savvy viewers actually want.</p> <h2><strong>How does Binge fit in with Foxtel\u2019s current offerings?</strong></h2> <p>If you feel like we\u2019ve seen this before, that makes sense: Foxtel\u2019s track record in direct-to-consumer streaming has been prolific, and not very good.</p> <p>Their initial effort was the too-expensive movie-only subscription service Presto Movies \u2013 at $19.99 a month. Soon realising that people actually wanted to binge TV series, Foxtel launched companion service Presto TV, a joint effort with Seven West Media. Presto Movies and Presto TV could be bundled together to both save money and confuse the marketplace.</p> <p>Presto only lasted two years, after which Foxtel revised its digital strategy to focus on Foxtel Now. This service \u2013 initially (and confusingly) branded as Foxtel Play \u2013 is still available to subscribe to.</p> <p>Subscribers to Foxtel Now can watch Foxtel channels live, and access on-demand TV shows through the app. But even at launch, its focus on branded linear channels seemed old-fashioned.</p> <p>Foxtel Now is also considered to be too expensive. It costs $25 to join, and an extra $10-$29 to buy add-on packs that give you access to the best stuff. Compare that with a $13.99 Netflix subscription, and the value just isn\u2019t there.</p> <p>Binge is seen as a major departure. It has scrapped linear channels as the focus, and marked down pricing. Most of the content remains the same, but has been repackaged to be more customer-friendly.</p> <p>There has, so far, been no announcement about the future of Foxtel Now \u2013 but it seems unlikely many subscribers will remain with the dated product.</p> <h2><strong>What will Binge mean for Foxtel?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ventureinsights.com.au/product/streaming-wars-and-the-future-of-foxtel/\">The traditional Foxtel service has been atrophying</a>. Subscribers after general entertainment have abandoned it in favour of other streaming services. Sport was always considered the jewel in its crown, but people were already heading to Kayo for that \u2013 at least before Covid-19 shut the sports world down.</p> <p>There is still an audience for viewers who want Foxtel\u2019s traditional linear channels: people who enjoy flicking around with their remotes and sitting down at specific times to watch the shows they like.</p> <p>While the company has plans to phase out cable TV delivery by 2023, <a href=\"https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/foxtel/iq4k/satellite-vs-internet.html\">it will continue to serve those viewers through satellite delivery</a>.</p> <h2><strong>How does Binge fit in with the broader, ever-expanding landscape of streaming services in Australia?</strong></h2> <p>Australia is not short of options when it comes to big players such as Netflix, Stan and now Binge. But it is an increasingly competitive market with smaller and specialty services too, such as the family-focused Disney+, sports streamer Kayo, the anime-focused Crunchyroll, and reality telly library Hayu.</p> <p>Add to the mix Amazon Prime Video \u2013 which offer video streaming as an add-on to subscribers of Amazon home delivery \u2013 and Apple, which gives away free subscriptions for its Apple TV+ service to people who buy a new phone or tablet (and costs $7.99 a month for everyone else). There\u2019s Kanopy, which streams free movies to anyone with a local council library card; and there are free ad-supported platforms too, such as the fun-to-say-aloud Tubi.</p> <p>Disney are talking about launching Hulu internationally, and 10 All Access will become a much bigger service when owner ViacomCBS rebrand it into an international platform later this year, with a deep bench of movies and shows from Paramount Pictures, CBS and Viacom libraries.</p> <h2><strong>Is the market TOO crowded for them all to survive? </strong></h2> <p>Conventional thinking in the industry is that most people will only look to subscribe to two or three services at a time. That\u2019s a lot of competition, and it takes only a little bit of math on the back of a napkin to realise that some aren\u2019t going to survive.</p> <p>One of the reasons <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/14/why-disney-is-rupert-murdochs-preferred-buyer.html\">Rupert Murdoch sold Fox to Disney</a> was because he understood that Fox wasn\u2019t at the right scale to continue to compete. Fox\u2019s content library, distribution channels and company infrastructure wasn\u2019t as large or as globally focused as say, Netflix or Disney, but it was also too big to downscale effectively. That\u2019s the challenge all large media companies are facing: they need to scale up to compete with Disney, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Google (via YouTube) and all the rest of the global companies that have access to an international subscriber base and can use that money to pay for the best content.</p> <p>Can local media companies such as Stan continue to compete with these international powerhouses? It is going to be a challenge. Foxtel itself will likely struggle once its content partners WarnerMedia and FX (through corporate owner Disney) scale up, and take their streaming services global. The problem isn\u2019t just the potential subscriber base being spread thin; it\u2019s being able to licence the high-profile, sought-after content that makes Binge such an appealing prospect.</p> <p>The launch of Binge represents both the future of the quality of libraries that we will come to expect from streaming services as well as a harsh reality: that this could be the last gasp of a local company competing against international giants.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Dan Barrett is the publisher of Always Be Watching, a daily email newsletter and weekly podcast dedicated to TV news, culture, and reviews.

Cancer is totally unpredictable, and should something happen to me I didn\u2019t want Chris to be here on his own so far away from family.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on the last round of a three-month treatment that will then be reviewed, but the oncologist has said after this we look at immunotherapy.

We had two garage sales and sold the ladder and the lawnmower.\u201d</p> <p>The day before the scheduled settlement, Margie and Chris went into Mayfair\u2019s Mission Beach office and asked if they could rent the house back for another few weeks after the sale went through.</p> <p>\u201cMayfair rang and said that it would be fine to rent back, just let the settlement go through and then go down and see [the real estate agent] and give him $300 a week rent. It was a generous rental arrangement.</p> <p>\u201cAround 4pm that day, we got a call from our conveyancer who said they had got this letter and Mayfair was not going to proceed with settlement, because of the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>During the past few months, their real estate agent has sent two \u201ccompassionate\u201d pleas to Mayfair to prioritise the settlement.

Most say they have been told little to nothing in the past two months.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mayfair 101 has been busy in court fighting the corporate regulator over allegations, which it denies, that advertising of some of its investment products was misleading and deceptive because it compared them to bank term deposits.</p> <p>It is also fighting the trustee of one of its feeder funds, IPO Wealth, which last week put more than a dozen Mayfair 101 companies into receivership after the group failed to repay $3m due earlier in the month.</p> <p>The fund, which has about 180 investors, has loaned more than $86m to the Mayfair 101 group.</p> <p>In an affidavit filed with the court, Craig Dunstan, the managing director of trustee company Vasco Trustees, said he had also become concerned when, in April, Mawhinney sent him an email saying the value of two investments, UK business management software group Accloud and Indian payments company Paymate, had plunged by $17.7m.</p> <p>Dunstan said Mawhinney did not return calls and emails from his office a fortnight ago, apart from an email last Wednesday in which Mawhinney said Mayfair 101 was restructuring its business.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://0c993c22-483e-4d86-9901-98f23568c693.usrfiles.com/ugd/0c993c_a1cf21445a8f4ce799bbc0dd040e4b3b.pdf\">statement posted to Mayfair 101\u2019s website</a>, the group complained that Dunstan did not respond to this email and described the appointment of receivers as \u201ca premature and imprudent measure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDespite contrary media reports, no attempts were made by Vasco to contact the Group in the week leading up to the appointment of receivers,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>It said it had been \u201cimpacted by Covid-19 and is working diligently and tirelessly through the unprecedented challenges these circumstances have presented\u201d and said legal action by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission \u201cexacerbated the already challenging circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>For Margie and Chris, the situation is concerning. The unusual clause in their property contract \u2013 which is more typically used in contracts for major projects \u2013 notionally allows Mayfair to delay the process indefinitely.</p> <p>\u201cThe clause says because of the unforeseen event they were suspending the settlement and \u2018time is no longer of the essence\u2019. To us, time is of the essence.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I had my diagnosis, Chris and I decided was there really wasn\u2019t much we could control, but we could control our situation.

She was told she could refuse to consent to the search, but that if she did her ticket would be confiscated and she\u2019d be asked to leave the festival.</p> <p>Feeling she had no choice, she was taken to a large transit van where a female officer first instructed her to lift her top while Becca could see a group of male officers through the uncovered windscreen of the van.</p> <p>\u201cShe asked me to lift my top up, which I replied that I didn\u2019t have a bra on, looking out at the [male officers].

I really disconnected until I left and that\u2019s when all the emotions came rushing in. It was really traumatising.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, her story mirrors dozens of others that have come to light in the past year.

Now I see them and it\u2019s like, I\u2019ve got to stay away, even if not doing anything wrong. It ignites a fear, rather than feeling safe around them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>It\u2019s a common response from people who have been strip-searched, some something Slater and Gordon senior associate Ebony Birchall said was \u201ceroding community confidence in NSW police\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are entitled to expect that police will follow the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are systemic problems such as inadequate police procedure manuals which are providing incorrect instruction to officers on how to lawfully conduct searches.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have been subjected to unlawful and invasive searches by NSW Police have rights to seek redress. By grouping these claims into potential class actions, people can stand together and demand change.\u201d</p>",

If this visual disturbance had persisted, could she not have driven the family back to London? Did Mr Cummings mention this symptom to the doctor who is said to have approved the return car journey?

  "<p>A newly discovered vulnerability in iPhones allows users to bypass Apple\u2019s built-in limitations \u2013 known as \u201cjailbreaking\u201d \u2013 including, for the first time in four years, on new devices.</p> <p>The release of a functional jailbreak for iOS 13.5, the latest version of the iPhone operating system, represents a breakthrough for the small community of users who rely on jailbreaks for everything from serious security research to simply running games and software that Apple does not allow on iPhones.</p> <p>It also poses a security problem for the company, since the techniques are in effect the same ones used by malicious attackers to take over targets\u2019 devices.</p> <p>As a result, the pseudonymous developers who released the jailbreak have not gone into detail about the exact nature of the vulnerability they are exploiting.</p> <p>Pwn20wnd, the iOS security researcher who discovered the flaw, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dyz8nw/iphone-ios-ios13-jailbreak-uncover-unc0ver\">admitted to Vice</a> that Apple would fix it \u201csooner or later\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the nature of it,\u201d they added. \u201cIt will most likely take them at least two or three weeks to release a patch. Even when they release a patch, users can downgrade to the previous iOS version for about two weeks usually, and after that the users should stay on their versions so that the jailbreak keeps working.\u201d</p> <p>Typically, iPhones contain a host of security measures that ensure that only software approved by Apple can be downloaded and installed on the devices. The move has a twin purpose: it helps ensure the devices remain difficult to hack, and it gives Apple control of the iOS economy.</p> <p>But the company\u2019s restrictive policies about what can be listed on the App Store has long led to demand from some users for ways to install software from other sources. The company does not allow apps that break the law, for instance, preventing gamers from installing \u201cemulators\u201d to play retro video games, and it imposes strict limits on what apps can do when running.</p> <p>The first jailbreak was released in 2007, less than six months after the iPhone launched and pre-dating the App Store. Using a vulnerability in Safari, it allowed users to install their own programs.</p> <p>The ability to bypass security limitations is also a powerful draw for malicious hackers, and many jailbreaks have been repurposed as malware, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between Apple\u2019s security teams and the developers who try to get around their barriers.</p> <p>In the past few years Apple has been on top, with extra hardware in newer iPhones making it extremely difficult for any code not approved by Apple to be installed.</p> <p>Pwn20wnd told Vice they did not think their success represented a change to that status quo. Instead, iOS was \u201cjust a big target for attackers\u201d, they said. \u201cApple is constantly adding more features to iOS that introduce new attack surfaces.\u201d</p> <p>Apple did not reply to a request for comment.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 and 27 May 2020 to restore text lost in the editing process, which clarifies that the jailbreak is the first in four years to also work \u201con new devices\u201d.

In particular, if the government start to give us clear advice on lifting of lockdown, are people going to trust it, or just wait to see what Dominic Cummings does?\u201d Bayes said.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had said \u2018we\u2019re so sorry, it was a mistake to have hidden the truth for so long, it was unfortunate that the guy felt the need to do this and he regrets it very much\u2019, if we had heard stuff like that I think the credibility of the government going forward would have been greater.</p> <p>\u201cRather, what we got was \u2018 I don\u2019t regret anything.

I feel concern for the person who sent it and will hold him or her in prayer.\u201d The previous night she had posted that she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the prime minister\u2019s defence of his adviser.</p> <p>There are concerns that Cummings\u2019 example would lead to others breaking lockdown amid the perception \u201cthere\u2019s one law for the government and its cronies, and another for the rest of us\u201d, said the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petespurs/status/1264594301738246144\">Rt Rev Pete Broadbent</a>, the bishop of Willesden.</p> <p>\u201cI was glad he was prepared to try to explain things. I don\u2019t think his explanation was satisfactory,\u201d he added. \u201c Their [the government\u2019s] way of operating is never apologise, never explain, and has also become never engage.</p> <p>\u201cI am more worried about the long-term effects. In the end, Cummings is a barometer for the way in which government might be going under this regime.</p> <p>\u201cThe bishops who made their concerns known \u2013 OK, we may all be characterised as a bunch of \u2018remainers\u2019 trying to get vengeance \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing to do with that.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe there needs to be a place where there\u2019s proper accountability, proper democracy, and the capacity for government to be held to account for the policies it has implemented.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 May 2020 because an earlier version referred to the bishop of Ripon as \u201cthe Rev Helen-Ann Hartley\u201d.

The reek of cashing-in emanates most strongly from those productions wholeheartedly embracing their B-movie origins, such as the \u201cThe Ultimate Lockdown Film\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=external&amp;v=269657987504576\">19 Covid</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=external&amp;v=269657987504576\"> Lane</a>, a winking ripoff of 10 Cloverfield Lane in concept and design.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRAv6tKKHE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FxRAv6tKKHE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A limited handful have exploited the potential for pressure-chamber suspense inherent in a world under lockdown, all of them hasty and cheap. Several virally-tinged concepts have been rumored to be up for sale at the virtual marketplace accompanying the not-taking-place Cannes film festival. A bare-bones IMDb page credits \u201cSergey A\u201d as the director, writer, and star of Coronavirus. The movie [sic], with a budget listed as an estimated 10 Russian rubles, or about $0.14 in American currency. The New York Times conferred a bit more legitimacy on Mostafa Keshvari\u2019s 63-minute feature simply titled Corona with a feature piece detailing the thriller trapping a Chinese woman and a neo-Nazi in an elevator. The article ominously concludes, \u201cAs for Keshvari\u2019s cast and his crew of 25, he said, so far they are well.\u201d</p> <p>Though Keshvari rushed through a three-day shoot before social distancing protocols ramped up, the bigger treatments still to come will have to contend with harsher restrictions. It\u2019s been announced that Sliding Doors director Peter Howitt will tackle the pandemic as an Irwin Allen-style ensemble piece, tracking seven lives across Los Angeles over the course of 60 days. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/sliding-doors-laws-attraction-director-peter-howitt-to-direct-coronavirus-pic-lock-down-fortitude-launches-sales-cannes-1202940825/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Deadline_BreakingNews&amp;utm_content=207388_05-21-2020_headline&amp;utm_term=167038\">The Deadline exclusive</a> breaking the news mentions that the producers are \u201ceyeing\u201d a launch of principal photography in September 2020, by which time they\u2019re presumably banking that things will have returned to relative normalcy. Whether that\u2019s an unduly optimistic start date will be determined in time, but even if that\u2019s how the chips fall, it won\u2019t be business as usual by any means.</p> <p>Michael Bay and the other producers behind the gestating Songbird plan on forging ahead, viral threat be damned. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/michael-bay-adam-goodman-songbird-pandemic-themed-thriller-start-in-five-weeks-1202937906/\">A report last week on Deadline</a> detailed a schedule that has shooting commencing in five weeks\u2019 time, employing novel means to make working on the streets of Los Angeles safe for the actors and crew. While the article refrains from specifying how that could possibly work, there\u2019s mention of \u201cremote training\u201d for actors. More importantly, the guilds responsible for looking after the well-being of performers and craftspeople have all given the okay for these mystery methods. While a half-dozen issues immediately come to mind \u2013 how unmasked actors can share screen time, maintenance of proper distance for crew during takes, getting everyone fed when the craft services table provides a breeding ground for germs \u2013 some industry insiders are busying themselves figuring it all out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb16af79426b73a38f5deee54f3a4991e9e6550e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb16af79426b73a38f5deee54f3a4991e9e6550e/0_121_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Blum, the producer behind Blumhouse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Blum, the producer behind Blumhouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Prommer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most eyebrow-raising notice comes from the horror factory Blumhouse, where the top brass have been devising a new approach to working on a studio lot. They\u2019re full steam ahead on a $6.5m genre picture to be shot on Universal\u2019s sound stages, with a \u201cset of safety protocols\u201d in place. The specifics include an end to the craft services table, and more notably, putting up all of the cast and crew in a single hotel to contain the flow of contagions. A quote from a source at Universal makes clear that \u201cBlumhouse and Universal aren\u2019t moving forward with any plans until we get the green light from city, county and public-health officials.\u201d However, the risk remains so great that no insurance company will agree to cover the production. If disaster strikes \u2013 as it did not so long ago, when Paul Walker died while working on Universal\u2019s Furious 7 \u2013 Blumhouse and Universal will be left with a massive financial liability.</p> <p>Whether new laws change that much will number among the deciding factors in the evolution of a post-viral industry. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blumhouse-plans-film-shoot-universal-lot-insurance-risks-1294936\">That article from the Hollywood Reporter</a> delves into the legal muck of this sticky situation, theorizing that Democrats in Congress will push new legislation requiring insurers to offer virus policies. That will be a long and arduous fight, however, with insurance corporations expected to push back as hard as possible on a mandate they see as setting them up for failure. Even if the film industry isn\u2019t following its own example of post-9/11 delicacy, they\u2019re hoping those chaotic days can still provide a precedent today in Washington; following much debate and acrimony, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was passed in 2002 to force insurers to cover the eventuality of terrorist attacks.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a disparity between the crisis that opened the millennium and the crisis unfolding now, a factor making them comparable and yet different enough that there would be no waiting period for Covid cinema. The vast majority of Americans related only symbolically to the destruction of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a broadside against America that we all were supposed to fight as vicarious patriots. Everyone feels a sense of ownership over the coronavirus quagmire, because it has affected every single citizen\u2019s life in an immediate, perceptible way. This has freed up Hollywood (and the wannabes lurking around its fringes) to claim these stories as their own for the telling. But that ubiquity is a double-edged sword. If we all share in custody of the story\u2019s drama, we all share its hazards as well. Any film-maker hoping to capitalize on the fact that we\u2019ve all been touched by the virus must also accept that that leaves the possibility of having been literally touched by the virus.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservative revolt over Dominic Cummings\u2019 decision to drive across England during the lockdown has grown, as a government minister resigned and the leader of the Scottish Tories joined 24 Conservative MPs in calling for Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser to consider his position.</p> \n<p>Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray, stepped down as a Scotland Office minister, saying he accepted Cummings felt he had acted in the best interests of his family when fearing he had coronavirus but these were \u201cdecisions others felt were not available to them\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile the intentions may have been well meaning, the reaction to this news shows that Mr Cummings\u2019 interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked,\u201d he said on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have constituents who didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn\u2019t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a sign of growing unrest among Tories in Scotland, Jackson Carlaw, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, told the BBC Cummings should consider his position.</p> \n<p>The developments deepened the crisis engulfing No 10, with at least 24 backbench Tory MPs calling on Cummings to resign because of his actions and the damage to the government following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">his attempt to explain himself</a> on Monday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"51a50601-7c2d-44aa-8071-361bc5cb7093\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VorWcL0H3Sg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A further seven Conservatives MPs previously suggested over the bank holiday weekend that he should resign but have not made clear whether his press conference from the Downing Street rose garden was enough to change that view.</p> \n<p>Tory MPs began to speak out as initial polling suggested public support has drained away from Johnson because of his backing for Cummings.</p> \n<p>A SavantaComRes survey showed the prime minister\u2019s net approval rating had fallen 20 points, down from 19 to -1, over the course of four days during the Cummings crisis. Polling for YouGov found 71% of people said Cummings did break lockdown rules, slightly up from 68% when asked on Saturday. It found this was the majority view across voters from all major parties and among both leavers and remainers.</p> \n<p>Among those to break their silence on Tuesday to call for Cummings to go were Harriett Baldwin, a former Treasury minister, Mark Harper, a former chief whip, and Stephen Hammond, a former transport minister. </p> \n<p>One of the new intake of MPs, Simon Jupp, also went public on Tuesday, saying he felt \u201canger, disappointment and frustration\u201d at Cummings\u2019 actions and that the adviser should resign. </p> \n<p>The MP for East Devon, wrote on his Facebook page: \u201cWe are all making significant sacrifices and coping with situations we couldn\u2019t imagine just a few months ago. Many of us, including myself, have lost people in our lives and haven\u2019t been able to see family and friends. It\u2019s been incredibly tough for everyone \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough I believe his [Cummings\u2019] actions were motivated by a father\u2019s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances, if placed in the same situation I wouldn\u2019t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position.\u201d</p> \n<p>And Jupp\u2019s Tory colleague William Wragg, who chairs parliament\u2019s public administration and constitutional affairs select committee, tweeted: \u201cWe cannot throw away valuable public and political good will any longer. It\u2019s humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an adviser. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said he thought Johnson should order an independent investigation into Cummings\u2019 conduct.</p> \n<p>The Tory backbencher Peter Bone told the Guardian he still believed Cummings should resign. \u201cThe rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have 400 emails from people and I\u2019m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we\u2019d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think more ministers will resign. None of this is organised. This is individual MPs making up their own minds. There\u2019s no orchestration \u2013 this is MPs looking at their constituents\u2019 comments and deciding what to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another Tory MP said they expected more junior ministers to quit over Cummings\u2019 lockdown breaches.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would expect it to happen because MPs are being asked to defend something they know is wrong and they still don\u2019t know the full facts on. I fully expect more people to stand down. A lot of cabinet ministers owe their jobs to Dominic Cummings but I would expect to see people resign at the junior minister level,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pressure from constituents is immense and Douglas Ross\u2019s resignation is very understandable given how thin his majority is, and it\u2019s the same in England and in the red wall in particular.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Johnson has rallied behind his senior aide \u2013 a key architect of Brexit and the prime minister\u2019s election victory \u2013 and marshalled top cabinet ministers, including Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock, to do the same.</p> \n<p>Michael Gove, a Cabinet Office minister, insisted on Tuesday that \u201cfair-minded people\u201d would have to make up their own minds.</p> \n<p>The longtime ally of Cummings was sent out to defend him in broadcast interviews the day after the aide gave a statement explaining why he drove 264 miles from London to Durham during the lockdown and risked spreading coronavirus.Police, medics and scientists continued to say that Cummings\u2019 actions risked undermining the lockdown and public health advice.</p> \n<p>Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said officers were frustrated by the case, which made it difficult to see the future role of the police in controlling lockdown.</p> \n<p>He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion and it feels like there\u2019s quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and what\u2019s happening on the street.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s quite hard to see the role the police have in the future \u2013 the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused, when you see the crowds on Bournemouth and Southend beaches and other places yesterday, it\u2019s hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS organisations, told the same programme: \u201cBecause of the way this story has unfolded there is certainly concern among our members, health leaders, that it could damage staff and public confidence in official guidance.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-press-conference-leaves-questions-unanswered\">Key contradictions about Cummings\u2019</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-press-conference-leaves-questions-unanswered\"> story remain</a>, with Gove pressed to explain how the government can continue to claim that the adviser acted within the rules.</p> \n<p>In a round of broadcast interviews, Gove was asked:</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why Cummings went back to work in No 10 after suspecting that his wife could have contracted coronavirus, risking spreading the virus further among colleagues. Gove said she was unwell but did not have official coronavirus symptoms of a cough or fever at that time.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why the aide decided that same night to drive 264 miles to Durham to stay on his parents\u2019 estate because of concerns that he and his wife had coronavirus, despite government instructions to self-isolate at home. Gove said he had been acting out of concern that they would be unable to care for their child, despite neither of them having classic coronavirus symptoms at that point.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Whether it was acceptable for them to have risked spreading coronavirus from the hotspot of London to rural Durham where there were few cases, given their son later needed hospital treatment in the north-east. Gove said his actions had been appropriate.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why people should accept his explanation that he needed to make a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot with his family to test his eyesight before travelling back to London. Gove said it was safe for him to have driven and that Cummings had been \u201cpreparing for work\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why the aide needed to seek help with possible backup childcare in the north-east when long-time friends in London could have helped, including Gove himself.

  "<p>Renowned Jamaican record producer Robert \u201cBobby Digital\u201d Dixon died in a Kingston hospital on 21 May, aged 59. The cause of death was kidney disease.</p> <p>One of the most respected producers of the dancehall era, Dixon transformed contemporary reggae several times over, enjoying tremendous international success with Shabba Ranks, Garnett Silk, Sizzla Kalonji and Morgan Heritage. He is also considered as an architect of the reggaeton genre that swept Latin America in the early 1990s, since some of its earliest hits sampled his work with Ranks.</p> <p>Born in Kingston in 1961, Dixon was raised in the underprivileged community of Olympic Gardens, commonly known as Waterhouse, where his father was a carpenter and his mother a dressmaker. After taking an overseas correspondence course, Dixon became a repair technician, fixing radios and televisions at the shop his brother established at the family home. But music was a passion from an early age and Waterhouse a hotbed of talent, leading Dixon and his friend Michael Jemison to launch a sound system called Heatwave in the early 1980s.</p> <p>When Jemison began producing local artists such as Half Pint and Black Crucial, Dixon accompanied him to the Channel One recording studio where he observed engineer Anthony \u201cSoljie\u201d Hamilton at work. There he also met fellow sound system owner and upcoming producer Lloyd \u201cPrince Jammy\u201d James, who was establishing his own four-track studio at St Lucia Road in Waterhouse. Dixon began engineering there with Al Campbell and Pat Kelly for hit-making producer Bunny \u201cStriker\u201d Lee, who later gave Dixon the nickname Digital due to his swift mastery of digital recording technology.</p> <p>Dixon was the in-house engineer at Jammy\u2019s from 1984-88, helping to record Wayne Smith\u2019s ground-breaking Under Mi Sleng Teng, which changed Jamaican popular music overnight, shifting its focus to synthesisers and drum machine rhythms. Dixon\u2019s perceptive engineering skills on hits by Tenor Saw, Cocoa Tea, Frankie Paul, Admiral Bailey, Super Cat and Chaka Demus helped Jammy maintain his status as Jamaica\u2019s top producer, until Dixon struck out his own, opening the 16-track Digital B recording studio at his home in the neighbourhood of Maverley, soon upgrading the studio to 24 tracks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjw7m-BKmQ8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wjw7m-BKmQ8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wayne Smith: Under Mi Sleng Teng \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Working with rhythm builders Steely and Clevie, Dixon achieved immediate and lasting success with Shabba Ranks, whose explicit, aggressive raps perfectly suited Dixon\u2019s rugged productions. Hits such as Peenie Peenie, Just Reality and Wicked in Bed turned Ranks into an international superstar who signed a recording contract with Epic Records. His albums As Raw as Ever (1992) and X-tra Naked (1993) both won Grammys.</p> <p>Dixon\u2019s next discovery was Garnett Silk, whose powerful singing voice and Rastafari orientation helped shift the focus of dancehall back to its roots during a time when sexually suggestive \u201c<a href=\"https://www.soulrebels.org/dancehall/w_slackness.htm\">slackness</a>\u201d and violent \u201cgun talk\u201d dominated, typically delivered by hardcore rappers; Silk\u2019s debut album, It\u2019s Growing (1992), heralded the arrival of a significant new talent. Dixon began to broaden the backing tracks featured on his productions, grafting live horns, guitar, percussion and other acoustic instrumentation on to electronic drums and keyboard bass. The result was a broader musical palette that referenced the classic reggae of the past while striving for the new styles of the future, the wooden interior of Dixon\u2019s studio allowing for maximum sonic texture. Sizzla\u2019s stunning Black Woman &amp; Child (1997) epitomised this more complex format: although the vocalist often made hastily recorded albums with an array of collaborators, his second record with Dixon, Da Real Thing (2002), was considered of a high standard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/10/bob-marley-75th-birthday-how-ghetto-reggae-star-rebranded-jamaica\">Bob Marley at 75: how a ghetto reggae star rebranded Jamaica</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1997, a connection with the Brooklyn, New York-based band Morgan Heritage yielded Help Us Jah, the first of many successful albums and a long musical partnership that elevated the group to become one of the most successful reggae acts of the new millennium.</p> <p>Along the way, Dixon mentored his two sons, who made tentative forays into production. Although Dixon\u2019s own output significantly slowed during the last decade, he continued to be in demand as a producer. He is survived by his wife, Merva, three children, two grandchildren, a sister and two brothers.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s favourite hobbies seem to consist of golf, Twitter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/muslim-americans-trump-travel-ban\">banning people from the US</a>. Alas, he may no longer have the opportunity to do as much of the latter, because who would now want to come to the US anyway? The country is doing such a bad job of containing coronavirus that you are better off almost anywhere else. Indeed, last month, a number of American citizens in Lebanon declined a repatriation offer, saying they were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/middleeast/us-citizens-lebanon-coronavirus-intl/index.html\">safer in Beirut</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a trip to the US that looks unappealing right now; it seems many countries aren\u2019t exactly salivating at the prospect of hosting American visitors in the near future. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for example, called the border with the US a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-canada-border-coronavirus/index.html\">clear \u201cvulnerability\u201d</a> for Canada in terms of infections; the US-Canada border has been closed since March, and will remain closed to nonessential travel until at least 21 June.</p> <p>Meanwhile, officials in Mexican border cities are reportedly <a href=\"http://www.therepublic.com/2020/05/24/lt-virus-outbreak-mexico-border/\">tightening checks</a> on visitors from Texas, because they\u2019re worried new coronavirus cases are coming from the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/in-mexican-border-cities-many-fear-virus-is-coming-from-us\">American side of the border</a>. Which brings to mind a joke that is going around: what borders on stupidity? Canada and Mexico.</p> <p>An American passport used to be an asset, now it\u2019s looking rather more like a liability. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">Italy </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">plans to </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">reopen to </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">travellers on June 3 \u2013but </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">not to Americans</a>\u201d ran a recent headline in the travel magazine Afar. This is somewhat misleading: Italy is opening its borders and removing quarantine restrictions only for people from other countries in Europe, it is not singling out Americans. However, Americans aren\u2019t used to being told they can\u2019t do things and a screenshot of the article <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_amburgerrr/status/1263225000171102220?s=20\">quickly went viral</a>.</p> <p>While Italy might not have explicitly implemented an American ban (yet), it seems increasingly likely that \u2013 as the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/with-coronavirus-american-travelers-are-about-to-find-out-what-its-like-to-be-the-pariah\">Daily Beast</a> put it \u2013 \u201cAmerican travellers are about to be pariahs in this new world.\u201d The travel industry is still figuring out how to keep tourists safe, but it makes sense that countries doing a good job of managing the pandemic will heavily restrict entry to travellers from those doing a poor job. And the US is doing an extremely poor job.</p> <p>Most worryingly, it feels as if Trump has given up trying to pretend to do any sort of job at all. The US neared the morbid milestone of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">100,000 dead </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">at the weekend</a>; Trump marked the occasion by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/25/donald-trump-twitter-coronavirus-golfing\">going to play golf</a> (without a mask) and shaking people\u2019s hands.

Just as America has grown resigned to school shootings and preventable gun violence, he suggests, it looks as if it is becoming numb to Covid-19 deaths. Just as the US has prioritised the rallying call of \u201cfreedom\u201d over common sense gun control, it looks set to prioritise \u201cfreedom\u201d over public health.

The motivation was simple. \u201cAs a female football player, how much of my salary goes back into my business?\u201d says Lindahl, who has 169 caps for Sweden. \u201cHow often do I pay for women\u2019s football? Not a lot of money from players\u2019 salaries goes back into women\u2019s football. So that\u2019s money leaving the game.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to find a way to put money back in the women\u2019s game as much as possible, so money from our sales goes to programmes or projects that operate around women\u2019s and girl\u2019s football. We funnel the money from the top. From kits and fans back into grassroots.\u201d</p> <p>The One Goal is a way of helping players do something good while promoting their own image. It has also proved there is a market for women\u2019s merchandise and memorabilia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy if you\u2019re a women\u2019s football fan to get memorabilia,\u201d Lindahl says. \u201cGetting hold of my goalkeeper jersey for Sweden was super hard. I had to really nag the provider.</p> <p>\u201cThe 2013 Euros at home in Sweden saw the tiny number of jerseys available sell out very quickly but there was no backup plan. Nobody thought there would be demand. We\u2019re offering authentic kit to fans. It\u2019s bridging a gap in the demand.\u201d</p> <p>In the grand scheme of things, their numbers are not huge \u2013 bidding on the 14 signed shirts they have so far for the current campaign is at \u00a36,360 \u2013 and Lindahl is aware that one event with a male player \u201cwill raise that in one evening with ease\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ba3c0e07400765c5a17676c11c5d41f3ff2cd25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ba3c0e07400765c5a17676c11c5d41f3ff2cd25/0_105_3156_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lindahl in action during the World Cup semi-final against the Netherlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hedvig Lindahl in action during the World Cup semi-final against the Netherlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She adds: \u201cYou have to start somewhere. We\u2019ve broken the first hurdle: players think we\u2019re serious and they want to be seen with us. We\u2019ve got really good names for this campaign and suddenly it\u2019s interesting for players to be around us and that\u2019s so important.\u201d</p> <p>An urge to give back and build the game was triggered by two coinciding events \u2013 the arrival of the first of two children with her wife, Sabine, in 2014, and watching the impact of the war in Syria. \u201cWhen you have that child and you\u2019re snuggling with them, caring for them, and you see how vulnerable they are and how much love they give you, then you see and read about children [in Syria] and it\u2019s like: \u2018What? This is not OK,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d just became a parent and was able to connect the dots more.

I had a slow awakening but I feel a strong need to be active.\u201d</p> <p>The 37-year-old is preparing to resume the season with Wolfsburg having signed last summer after four and a half years at Chelsea. They began training five weeks ago in small groups and have progressed to full workouts \u201cwearing all the protection, keeping distance, cleaning all of the gym stuff, not changing into our training gear in the dressing room, going home to shower\u201d.</p> <p>Was there any fear about restarting? \u201cGermany is known for being very organised. The healthcare system and leadership has been very good. It feels like they have control,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the beginning I really thought about whether our children would be at greater risk because we don\u2019t know much about this virus. I can only hope my team are being very careful because we all put each other at risk.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always had a lot of self-belief.

But that last spring at Chelsea really got to me deep down inside. I started to doubt myself for the first time in my career.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the big goals for me at Chelsea was to build the club into one that could compete for the Champions League. We were finally there, we were going to face these big clubs and I\u2019m not involved any longer. I was thrown out in the end when we were going to tie it up.

  "<p>Speaking to the press on Monday, Dominic Cummings said he drove, with his wife and child, on a 30-mile trip to Barnard Castle during lockdown to see if he could drive safely, concerned that his eyesight might have been affected by coronavirus.</p> <p>In a press conference later the same day, Boris Johnson also claimed to have experienced problems with his eyesight following Covid-19, brandishing a pair of glasses and saying: \u201cI\u2019m finding that I have to wear spectacles for the first time in years \u2026 I think that\u2019s very, very plausible that eyesight can be a problem associated with coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Eye problems are not on the UK\u2019s list of coronavirus symptoms.

But it is pretty uncommon.\u201d He added that such eye problems were more frequent among patients who had been ventilated.</p> <p>Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the eye, and typically has symptoms including pinkness of the eye, watering and a sticky discharge.</p> <p>Robert MacLaren, the professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford, said reports from Wuhan suggested a link between Covid-19 and conjunctivitis, as well as conjunctival hyperemia (red eye), chemosis (eye swelling), epiphora (watery eye) and increased secretions (sticky eye). MacLaren noted such symptoms could affect vision.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said the college was unable to report on an association of vision impairment with Covid-19 due to the lack of evidence. But, they added, the college had previous noted <a href=\"https://www.rcophth.ac.uk/2020/03/viral-conjunctivitis-and-covid-19-a-joint-statement-from-the-royal-college-of-ophthalmologists-and-college-of-optometrists/\">coronavirus might cause conjunctivitis</a>.</p> <p>Hammond said it would be clear to an individual if they had conjunctivitis. \u201cYou would be aware that you had a bit of a pink eye and it was a bit watery and discharging. A bit like a windscreen wiper on a car, you have to blink to clear the muck off the tear film.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond said a report from Brazil suggested that, from scans, some Covid-19 patients appeared to have some damage to the retina, but the patients did not have any symptoms of eye problems or loss of vision.</p> <p>Hammond added that severe Covid-19 might mean patients needed their reading glasses more. </p> <p>\u201cIt is true when you have been significantly unwell, that as all your muscles are a bit weaker, the muscles that control the focus of your eyes can be weaker,\u201d he said. But the situation, he noted, applied only to far-sighted people, adding that Cummings appeared to wear glasses for short-sightedness \u2013 myopia \u2013 being unable to see well in the distance.</p> <p>As for getting behind the wheel of the car to test your eyesight, Hammond said the Highway Code stated that drivers needed to be able to read a vehicle number plate at a minimum distance of 20 metres. \u201cWhen you have your driving test to see if you are seeing well enough to be allowed to drive, they test whether you can read the number plate before they allow you in the car,\u201d he said.</p>",

After his admission, TripAdvisor was deluged with spoof reviews for Barnard Castle, many purportedly from Cummings.</p> <p><strong>What did they say?</strong> They\u2019ve all been taken down now, because they \u201cdo not describe a firsthand experience\u201d.</p> <p><strong>At least non-firsthand reviews </strong><strong>can\u2019t be accused of </strong><strong>violat</strong><strong>ing either</strong><strong> the letter </strong><strong>or the spirit of the government\u2019s pandemic restrictions. </strong>True.</p> <p><strong>Is it wrong to say that I\u2019m furious, but that I also really want to see that automated</strong><strong> swan?</strong> I think your feelings mirror popular opinion in this case.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cRemember the rule \u2013 never apologise, over-explain.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cCome to Barnard Castle \u2013 if you can read the road signs to find it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps on Sunday you watched the entire nation being lectured on what constitutes fatherly responsibility by Boris Johnson, a man who won\u2019t even say how many children he has, and leaves women to bring up an unspecified number of them. Perhaps on Monday you watched the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason being lectured in journalism by Johnson, a man sacked from a newspaper for fabricating quotes from his own godfather, and who blithely discussed helping a friend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/black-eyes-boris-johnson-plot-attack-reporter-darius-guppy\">have another journalist beaten up</a>. Perhaps today, you heard Michael Gove tell LBC he has \u201con occasion\u201d driven a car to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7JO-mcIrH8\">check his eyesight.</a></p> <p>If you <em>did</em> see these things, I can only direct you to the slogan flyposted all over Paris during the 1968 civil unrest. \u201cDO NOT ADJUST YOUR MIND \u2013 THERE IS A FAULT WITH REALITY.\u201d The term \u201cgaslighting\u201d is much overused, but let\u2019s break the glass on it for the events of the past few days. As for \u201cindefensible\u201d\u2026 well, I don\u2019t think that word means <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3sLhnDJJn0\">what you thought</a> it meant.</p> <p>Anyway. I see the latest science Dominic Cummings knows more about than you is optometry. Half an hour late on Monday afternoon \u2013 like he\u2019s Mariah Carey and not some spad in inside-out pants \u2013 the Islington-dwelling humanities graduate took to Downing Street\u2019s rose garden. There, he delivered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">most preposterous address</a> to a nation since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA7ty2LQwc0\">Tiger Woods stood in front of an audience</a>, including his mother, and apologised to his wife and sponsors. The difference is that Woods had a problem with cocktail waitresses, while Cummings fucks entire public health messages in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Also, he\u2019s not remotely sorry.</p> <p>By now, you may be dimly aware that his wife showing coronavirus symptoms saw Cummings first return to Downing Street, then embark on what we might call an Odyssean project: a heroic 260-mile quest all the way to County Durham, breaking the spirit and letter of lockdown rules he helped to write. I guess he just wanted to be a rule-maker, not a rule-taker. Then, he explained, he embarked on a 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle, with his child in the car, to see if his eyes were so banjaxed that it was unsafe for him to drive. Which is \u2026 but no. I\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t with that one. Maybe later. Hopefully he\u2019s at least nuked his car insurance premium.</p> <p>Apologies for having to get tough with a guy who has always cultivated an image of himself as the Roy Keane of Westminster, even if that is like being the Clint Eastwood of the DVLA. But if Cummings and his wife didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d done was wrong, why would they choose to <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/getting-coronavirus-does-not-bring-clarity\">write a lengthy article last month</a> about their virus experience \u2013 full of personal family information \u2013 which omitted all of these dramas, all of these material facts. Or as Cummings addressed these questions of what is <a href=\"http://www.davidgorman.com/4quartets/1-norton.htm\">unredeemable in the rose garden</a>: \u201cI stress to people that they should not believe everything in the newspapers.\u201d And I stress to people that by far the most inaccurate account of the period in question was in the Spectator, bylined Mary Wakefield and Dominic Cummings. As for his querulous domestic exceptionalism, you\u2019d think they were the first parents ever to get properly ill in possession of children. Or child, in this case. God knows, it\u2019s not much fun. But, dare millions of us say, it is kind of what you sign up for \u2013 a reality not lost on the ICU nurse couple I heard on the radio, explaining about both of them being hard hit by Covid-19, and having to isolate with their own three children without help.</p> <p>Cummings\u2019 university history tutor once described him as <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street\">\u201csomething like a Robespierre\u201d</a>, \u201cdetermined to bring down things that don\u2019t work\u201d. Five years after his revolution, Robespierre himself was deemed to be something that didn\u2019t really work, and was \u201cbrought down\u201d, to euphemise the business of being relieved of your head in front of an ecstatic mob. I must say I found the footage of Cummings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rz0zG2taew\">being screamed at</a> in his street on Sunday distinctly disturbing when set alongside his account of his family\u2019s house having become a target for threats of violence. This is never right.</p> <p>Part of what\u2019s disturbing was the vignette of a Britain Cummings himself did much to foment: grimly polarised, reflexively aggressive and running with an undercurrent of menace. His crowning triumph \u2013 the successful campaign to leave the EU \u2013 was a masterclass of stoking and exploiting divisions, unpleasantly emotive half-truths or untruths, and evidently considered itself above the law. I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/27/tories-dominic-cummings-people-v-parliament-election\">wrote last year</a> about the dangerous folly of whipping up people versus parliament narratives, and how quickly those who imagine themselves on the side of the people can suddenly be reclassified as an enemy politician. But even I would have thought it too neat, too written, for Cummings to find himself on the wrong end of his sorcery as quickly as he has been. The thing about playing to angry mobs is that eventually they get angry with you. They came for Robespierre in the end, too.</p> <p>For all the draw of the Cummings character, though, the last few days are ultimately a terrible story about Johnson. \u201cWash your hands, wash your hands\u201d the prime minister kept gibbering <a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/media/fdd4af2b-66b2-4916-96ab-45a75108fbb7\">last night</a>. He\u2019s certainly washing his hands of it all. All populists secretly hate their people, and Johnson is no different. But that \u201csecretly\u201d is key. His decision to keep Cummings brings his contempt for those he is meant to serve into the open. He would rather endanger their lives by compromising a vital public health strategy.</p> <p>But why? The thing about Johnson is that he desperately wanted to become prime minister, and he desperately wanted to have been prime minister. It\u2019s just the bit in between he struggles with. With Othello, it was jealousy. Macbeth: ambition. Lear: pride. Johnson: career liar, hollowed out by narcissism, who not even his friends would joke was motivated by public service. I guess it\u2019s the little things that trip you up, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>Anyone who imagines his defence of Cummings is born of loyalty is unfamiliar with the concept \u201cBoris Johnson\u201d. This is actually a simple story: man with no ideas is too terrified to sack his ideas man. Or to put it in the complex intellectual terms it deserves, some street heckler once shouted at David Hasselhoff: \u201cOi! Hasselhoff! You\u2019re nothing without your talking car!\u201d Cummings is the talking car to Johnson\u2019s Hasselhoff.</p> <p>So here we are. Cummings stays, and only irresistible external events will make Johnson do the right thing. He is not himself capable. We have the highest death toll in Europe, we left the care homes to their fate, our test-and-trace blunders are an international embarrassment, and we didn\u2019t even save our economy. Johnson takes daily runs, but appears only once or twice a week in a crisis to fail at leadership.</p> <p>This is the utter smallness of the man, and the tragedy for everyone stuck being governed by him. Perhaps the greatest tragedy is the acceptance. It would be nice to think we\u2019re not so beaten that we don\u2019t expect better than what he\u2019s given us. After all, lives literally depend on it.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Voters in the former coalfield constituency of Leigh in Greater Manchester elected a Conservative MP in December for the first time in its 134-year history. Before the coronavirus hit, the Guardian assembled a panel of local voters to talk about why the Tories won Leigh and what it would take for Labour to win it back. Here, four first-time Conservative voters react to the Dominic Cummings controversy.</p> <h2>Keith Park, 67, recently retired NHS infectious diseases nurse</h2> <p>What Dominic Cummings did doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with me at all. Especially with me being a past healthcare worker. He just showed complete disregard for the rules. The most ridiculous thing that sticks in my mind is how he did a 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle with his wife and child in the car to test his eyesight. I wonder what the DVLA will think about that? I don\u2019t like that and I think Boris [Johnson] is a complete idiot for sticking by him.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got a grandchild we\u2019ve not seen since lockdown and he was only born on 1 January. I\u2019d love to be there and get hold of him, but we follow the rules, we do the right thing, we stay away. They said you shouldn\u2019t go to your second home, well me and my wife Jacqueline, a diabetes nurse, we were actually at our second home, a caravan up in Yorkshire, on the Sunday, the day before the lockdown, and they came around on the Sunday and asked people to leave. We\u2019ve not been able to go back and check on the caravan because it wouldn\u2019t be right to. Yet here\u2019s a guy who works for the government who can do whatever the hell he wants.</p> <p>To be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve never had much regard for him. His manner, his attitude, his dress. You wouldn\u2019t expect somebody to turn up at No 10 in bloody tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt. What does that portray to the rest of the world?</p> <p>Our next-door neighbour but one died of Covid. He was cremated last week. He was the same age as me, 67. We used to share a desk at school. We were very close and yet we couldn\u2019t go to the crematorium \u2013 then you see someone like Dominic Cummings doing that kind of thing.</p> <p>I still think Boris is the right person at the moment and I don\u2019t like people trying to make political mileage about the crisis because we should all stick together. But Cummings should have fallen on his sword.</p> <h2>Catherine Guest, 60, retired cook</h2> <p>I think it is very silly that Dominic Cummings put other people at risk, as well as his own family. Especially given his position in government. It\u2019s a bit ridiculous. And yet it\u2019s what I expect now. People aren\u2019t sticking to the rules, are they heck. You should see what it\u2019s like around here, people meeting in the streets, playing football. They have no idea what it\u2019s like not being able to breathe. I do. I have emphysema and had throat cancer five or six years ago and had to have a tracheostomy so I know how scary it is, how frightening and painful to have your lungs fill up.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t left the house for 10 weeks, not once, since well before Boris Johnson announced lockdown. I\u2019ve not seen my grandchildren, nobody. I think Cummings should be made to pay. He shouldn\u2019t be able to get away with it. Mind you, nobody should.</p> <h2>Andrew Twentyman, 51, owns Twentymans pizzeria and bakery in Leigh</h2> <p>I\u2019m more annoyed with the BBC and newspaper reporters than I am with Dominic Cummings. I don\u2019t like people in close proximity at the best of times \u2013 we have screens up at the restaurant so that people can\u2019t get too close when they come in for takeaways. But the media have hounded him. The BBC in particular should be setting an example. I\u2019ve had to stop watching it. I watch RT now (Russia Today), and get news from all around the world instead.</p> <p>He should\u2019t have done it, should he? He\u2019s gone to Durham and he shouldn\u2019t have. I think his cocksure attitude and white shirt yesterday might have lost him a whole load of people. He\u2019s not sympathetic, is he? He doesn\u2019t do himself any favours. I do think Boris has lost some credibility. Cogs are turning in one direction and the masterplan has to continue in that direction. If Cummings is a key figure in that, then he\u2019s got to stay, but longterm he\u2019s got to go. You wouldn\u2019t want to get someone off your main board because they made a mistake if they are a key decision maker.</p> <h2>Declan Flannery, 24, works for gas company</h2> <p>I am not really bothered about what Dominic Cummings did. Maybe I had my Tory blinkers on, but the thing that wound me up was seeing all the reporters outside his house really close together. Pot, kettle, black springs to mind. I had his press conference on but I wasn\u2019t really listening to it because I was playing on my PlayStation, but I don\u2019t get people who say it\u2019s one rule for him and another for everyone else: people can go and see loved ones, they just have to stay apart. Did he come into contact with anyone when he went to Durham? I think it\u2019s ridiculous calling for him to resign, wishing for someone to lose their job for what is basically a mistake, isn\u2019t it?<br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Much of the attention over Dominic Cummings\u2019 family trip from London to Durham has focused on the moral and legal questions. Did his actions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/did-dominic-cummings-break-the-law-on-lockdown-rules\">obey the letter of lockdown restrictions</a>, which require every person to stay close to home except under severe personal circumstance? And with these restrictions placing an enormous toll on families around the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home\">was it morally right</a>?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/cummings-contempt-lockdown-rules-public-catholic-church-ireland\">Cummings\u2019 contempt for lockdown rules makes the public feel like fools | Fintan O\u2019Toole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18474097.cummings-went-beauty-spot-wifes-birthday-test-eyes/\">questions still remaining</a> over some of his assertions, these remain important issues; but even more important is the potential impact of his actions on the behaviour of others. There is evidence that, even with the lockdown rules mostly in place, people are now moving about more frequently, even in <a href=\"https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/coronavirus-covid-19-mobility-report\">the most heavily hit areas of the country</a>.</p> <p>Partly this change is a consequence of people having a better understanding of the restrictions, and therefore pushing the boundaries. Partly it is likely due to a desire to go out in the warm weather. In Germany, which is well ahead of the UK in controlling coronavirus and easing lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52786242\">local clusters</a> of infection have arisen due to the resumption of some pre-pandemic activities. This is an almost inevitable outcome of easing restrictions.</p> <p>While that easing is both justified and necessary, it must be done slowly and with caution. If normal behaviours resume too rapidly, there is potential for the number of Covid-19 cases to increase while our control over its spread remains fragile. In this context, Cummings\u2019 actions have the potential to impede Britain\u2019s recovery from the pandemic.</p> <p>Intuitively we know that influential people in the public eye can have a profound <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8354291/Fears-lockdown-collapse-crowds-hitting-parks-beaches-79F-heatwave.html\">impact on the behaviour of others</a>. Understanding all this is the domain of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-legacy-of-john-nash-and-his-equilibrium-theory-42343\">game theory</a>, which shows us that when each person simply <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/09/06/what-is-the-nash-equilibrium-and-why-does-it-matter\">chooses what</a><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/09/06/what-is-the-nash-equilibrium-and-why-does-it-matter\"> seems best for them</a>, the outcome can be terrible for the group. Ironically, Cummings himself has <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/category/economics-finance/game-theory/\">written extensively</a> on this theory. Game theory has been central to the work of many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory#Prize-winning_achievements\">Nobel prize-winners</a> in economics, and it is now widely recognised as important in subjects ranging from evolution to public health, most notably in studying the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/101/36/13391\">voluntary uptake of vaccines</a>. This is particularly relevant given the number of \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/europes-covid-predicament-how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-the-anti-vaxxers\">resisting the possibility of being vaccinated against Covid</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/europes-covid-predicament-how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-the-anti-vaxxers\">-19</a>.</p> <p>The success of vaccination relies on enough people taking part to induce herd immunity; and while there may be a small risk associated with taking the vaccine, that risk is outstripped by the benefits of eradicating the disease. However, if too few people take up the vaccine, the benefit of herd immunity is lost, leading to greater infection. What game theory tells us is that mass behaviour has a tipping point: below it, that behaviour is isolated and can ultimately die out; but above it, the behaviour can spread rapidly through the entire population.</p> <p>Critical to all this is the concept of trust. If a positive behaviour change is required \u2013 such as abiding by the lockdown rules \u2013 individuals must trust that enough others will do so to make their own sacrifices worthwhile.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/leaving-lockdown-together-why-we-are-better-united-against-coronavirus\">exhortations to stick together</a> \u2013 to \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d \u2013 are a real-world expression of this concept. Each individual action is likely to be small; but each is important because it also influences other people\u2019s behaviour. If we see others obeying a given set of rules, we tend to do the same. This can be very difficult when we do not know people who have had Covid-19, or have not seen <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52760992\">how serious it can be</a>. But if even a small number of individuals act with a very different set of values and priorities, it can result in a cascade of selfish behaviour.</p> <p>The combination of social contact patterns and selfish behaviour can have a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118127\">profound influence</a> on the ability of a disease to spread, even when those individuals starting the cascade have no more inherent influence than anyone else. There is some evidence from the US that this <a href=\"http://ide.mit.edu/news-blog/news/cost-uncoordinated-responses-covid-19#overlay-context=users/pklein\">social connectivity</a> has been important in determining how people adhere to lockdown restrictions. The impact of public figures acting in their personal interest can therefore be disastrous \u2013 not because of the individual disease risks they pose, but because of their potential, as a public example, to set off catastrophic behaviour change.</p> <p>We all hope that Britain has turned the tide against the coronavirus pandemic. However, with no immediate prospects for a vaccine, health services stretched and continued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-plans-for-contact-tracing-in-doubt-as-app-not-ready-until-june\">uncertainty over testing and tracing</a>, that success remains fragile. While Cummings\u2019 actions have the potential to undermine that success, what game theory tells us is that we are all influencers. In this sense, it is not only the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0000559\">needs of the many</a> that matter more than the needs of the few, but their actions as well. We cannot change the past actions of others, but our own actions now and in the future are critical for the successful control of Covid-19.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rowland Kao is professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The suspension of vaccination programmes, school closures and a surge in domestic violence during coronavirus lockdowns are likely to derail a decade\u2019s worth of progress for children, according to new global research.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://kidsrights.org/\">Kidsrights Foundation</a> on Tuesday published its <a href=\"http://www.kidsrights.org/kidsrightsindex\">annual rankings</a> of children\u2019s rights in 182 countries with Iceland scoring top for the second year running followed by Switzerland, Finland and Sweden.</p> <p>The UK fared poorly, ranking in 169th place behind countries including Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

Now we expect the economic consequences of the crisis to turn the clock back 10 years on the progress made around the wellbeing of children, unless governments take swift action.\u201d</p> <p>Countries are scored using UN data and evidence collected from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. They are assessed across five areas including health, education, and enabling an environment that promotes child rights.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, we see two big red flags in the findings this year,\u201d said Dullaert. One is lack of government funding around children\u2019s health, education and protection.</p> <p>The other is around the discrimination of children with more than a third of countries having the lowest possible score in this area.</p> <p>\u201cWe see in 91 of 182 countries that girls do not have the same rights as boys in terms of inheritance rights, access to education and equal treatment in legislation. It is not only in developing countries that there is a problem with discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>Italy ranked 15th in the index, up from 74, after being commended for adopting laws on cyberbullying and protecting children with disabilities. It was criticised for smear campaigns against organisations helping migrants.</p> <p>The index is not an absolute ranking of countries where children have the best life but nations are scored relative to their capacity to implement children\u2019s rights.</p> <p>\u201cOnce we take this into account, surprising rankings might occur,\u201d said Professor Karin Arts, of the International Institute of Social Studies, who was among those who compiled the data.</p> <p>\u201cExamples are the ultra-low scores of Australia (135), New Zealand (168) and the UK (169), and the high ranks of Thailand (8) and Tunisia (17),\u201d she said.</p> <p>Australia has dropped from 19 last year to 135 because of the poor treatment of refugee and migrant children, as well as Aboriginal young people who were found to be discriminated against in ways that affected their rights to education and health.</p> <p>Dullaert said: \u201cIt is really sad to see that recent welfare reforms have pushed more children into poverty in a rich country like the UK. We are also concerned about children in detention who, because of the indirect impact of Covid-19, are effectively in solitary confinement and have nearly no contact with family or the outside world.\u201d</p> <p>The Kidsrights Foundation said the fallout from measures taken by governments to reduce the spread of Covid-19 would have lasting effects on children globally.</p> <p>School closures in 188 countries affect 1.5 billion children, leaving them vulnerable to child labour, child marriage and teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>\u201cMillions of children were out of school for a long period and we see especially in developing countries that, even after the easing of lockdown, there is an enormous drop-off rate, with large numbers of children failing to return to school again,\u201d said Dullaert. \u201cAs with the Ebola crisis, this will result in more children being put into work and early marriages for girls.\u201d</p>",

People who suffered the greatest hardship \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/my-dad-died-lockdown-barnard-castle-dominic-cummingss-visit-repellent-county-durham-betrayed\">losing a loved one</a> without being able to say goodbye \u2013 would, of course, have been dismayed. Everyone else would have thought of their own misdemeanours and shrugged it off. Few of us enjoy being the world\u2019s scold. Lockdown is such a freak event that nobody really relishes policing it (not even, I suspect, the police). \u201cOne rule for them, and another for us\u201d is, naturally, an insult, but it\u2019s a pretty familiar one.</p> <p>The real scandal is what\u2019s happened since \u2013 a display of collective dishonesty from the most senior members of government that has amounted to a kind of verbal violence against the electorate. In the immediate aftermath of the story, cabinet ministers trotted out to defend the adviser without even having been granted the honour of a conversation with him, as though he were a prince, or a god. Grant Shapps was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/23/grant-shapps-attempts-to-defend-dominic-cummingss-260-mile-lockdown-trip-video\">appointed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/23/grant-shapps-attempts-to-defend-dominic-cummingss-260-mile-lockdown-trip-video\">gaslighter-in-chief</a>, explaining calmly that the rules we thought we had understood <em>because they really couldn\u2019t have been clearer</em><em> </em>were actually quite nuanced and complex, and we actually hadn\u2019t understood them at all.</p> <p>The prime minister taught us all about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/boris-johnson-says-people-should-make-up-own-minds-on-dominic-cummings-video\">the meaning of fatherhood</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/attorney-general-faces-calls-to-resign-defends-dominic-cummings-suella-braverman\">attorney general</a> schooled us on the law, without any of its pillars \u2013 evidence, transparency \u2013 in place. The less intelligent of the ministers couldn\u2019t even remember from one tweet to the next whether poor Dom was supposed to have symptoms or not, and when.</p> <p>It was a painful demonstration partly because we\u2019d thought ourselves embarked on some collective project to fight this pandemic, only to find ourselves treated not as compatriots but as idiot minions. More than that, though, with the outright lies, the obfuscations, the assertively meaningless statements, the excruciatingly weak excuses, it\u2019s been an assault on the intelligence of the public. \u201cFrightening\u201d is a strong word, but it would be a grave mistake to accept this with equanimity.</p> <p>We\u2019re in danger of descending into what the psychotherapist Aaron Balick once described as a \u201chysterical emotional response\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/16/living-in-an-age-of-anger-50-year-rage-cycle\">venting our anger in public</a> without any intention of doing anything about it. \u201cA hysterical emotional response is when you\u2019re having too much emotion, because you\u2019re not in touch with the foundational feeling,\u201d Balick explains. \u201cAn example would be office bitching. Everybody in the office is bitching and it becomes a hysterical negativity that never treats itself; nobody is taking it forwards.\u201d We\u2019re in exactly that position, where there is so much wrongdoing, so much plain nonsense, that we circle it endlessly, castigate it relentlessly, but we can\u2019t see our way past the authority of those responsible, and can\u2019t see any way of acting on our anger.</p> <p>We are right to be alarmed. This stage of the crisis is only the start. A series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/what-will-coronavirus-mean-for-the-british-economy\">profound economic shocks</a> will certainly follow. The coming challenges will demand the greatest possible social cohesion, and a government that lies is corrosive to such a thing. Never mind the huge question marks around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/uk-coronavirus-response-nhs-local-government-care-homes-british-politicians\">competence</a> \u2013 will we even have a working <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/covid-19-track-and-trace-what-can-uk-learn-from-countries-got-it-right\">track and trace</a> system by the second peak? \u2013 it lacks any respect for the principles of government by democratic consent.</p> <p>New details keep surfacing to fuel the furnace of our distrust: it appears that one of Cummings\u2019 first acts upon returning to work from Durham, was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1265034438645293056?s=20\">to go back and alter his blog</a>, to make it look as though he\u2019d warned about coronavirus back in 2019. This was naturally part of his flaccid defence on Monday: how could anyone accuse him of not taking the crisis seriously, when he\u2019d warned about it a year before anyone else?</p> <p>There will always be some new scandal: Boris Johnson is a known liar. Cummings believes himself to be so intellectually superior to those who would question him that he is effectively above scrutiny. The cabinet has so far provided no natural braking mechanism to the runaway bullshit \u2013 and we shouldn\u2019t expect it to, since it was selected for subservience.</p> <p>It would be very easy to succumb to \u201chysterical emotion\u201d at this point and lose touch with the foundational feeling, which is that we need a new government. We cannot sit this one out until 2024. We cannot navigate a depression, and Brexit, and an uncontrolled virus, through the fog of flagrant dishonesty. We do not have four years to get our ducks in a row.</p> <p>Cracks are appearing, not just within the Conservative party, but among its cheerleaders and natural allies. They will heal, no doubt, but equally inevitably, they will open up again with the next assault on public trust. It may not be obvious today how to bring down a government in the middle of a crisis, but that has to remain the objective, and all activity and critique must build towards it. Otherwise Cummings is just toying with us \u2013 strengthened by the impotence of our anger.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>A Chinese city is planning to make a health-tracking app introduced as part of the coronavirus response a permanent fixture for its population of 10 million.</p> <p>Versions of the app have been used across mainland China. It displays a QR code with an individual\u2019s virus status, which can be used to determine the extent to which the individual is allowed to move about.</p> <p>Authorities in the city of Hangzhou, a tech hub home to e-commerce giant Alibaba where the app was first launched, have announced they will seek to launch a broader version to monitor people\u2019s health.</p> <p>Sun Yongrong, the director of the Hangzhou health commission, told a meeting on Friday a number of advancements in healthcare administration had already been achieved through the health code app, and proposed integrating the data with more health indicators to develop individual index rankings.</p> <p>In the proposed app an individual\u2019s status would be colour-coded and scored out of 100 based on medical records, physical test results, levels of activity and other lifestyle choices such as smoking.</p> <p>Screenshots of the proposed app showed a numeral and colour bar indicating the relative health of the user, and the tracking of factors that contribute to the score, including the number of cigarettes smoked that day, steps taken, or hours slept.</p> <p>For example, drinking a glass of white wine could set your score back by 1.5 points, while sleeping for seven hours could improve it by one point.</p> <p>According to Chinese media reports, Hangzhou authorities plan to have the app ready by the end of next month. The city\u2019s health commission said the proposed system would be a \u201cfirewall to enhance people\u2019s health and immunity\u201d after the pandemic.</p> <p>Although apps used during the outbreak have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/07/how-global-health-crisis-turns-into-state-run-surveillance-opportunity\">raised concerns about privacy</a> and a lack of transparency in how they operate, Chinese people generally appear to have accepted them as necessary.</p> <p>However, the push to make a permanent version appears to have crossed a line for some. \u201cOutside of the epidemic periods, it has strong privacy issues,\u201d said one commenter on a news article posted to Weibo.</p> <p>Another said: \u201cThe boundary between personal health and public health should be reflected. The health code is for others to read. Others have no right to read your personal health reports.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell do my smoking, drinking and sleeping habits have to do with you?\u201d read another comment on Weibo.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no privacy left whatsoever,\u201d lamented another user.</p> <p>The existing apps have run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat, developed for the Chinese government. One commenter said they would delete Alipay from their phone if the app became permanent.</p> <p>Others expressed fear it would be used by insurance companies for tiered pricing, or by employers to screen job applicants.</p> <p>Chinese tech commentator and privacy advocate Lawrence Li said that the new app should ideally be an opt-in system to protect citizens\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Covid [data collection] I think people willingly participated, but it\u2019s another story if the government wants to make it the \u2018new normal\u2019,\u201d he told AFP.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s annual meeting of the Chinese Communist party heard calls from delegates to strengthen oversight of security breaches.

  "<p>Stanley Ho, the flamboyant and charismatic godfather of gambling in Macau, who steered gaming in the autonomous Chinese region to eclipse Las Vegas, has died in Hong Kong aged 98.</p> <p>A one-time smuggler turned gambling impresario with alleged but unproven links to the the 14K and Sun Yee On triad societies \u2013 which his family always denied \u2013 Ho was also a philanthropist and construction magnate whose business empire spanned the globe, including investments in North Korea.</p> <p>With 20 casinos under his control in Macau, the only Chinese territory where such businesses are allowed, he was credited with bringing in about half the region\u2019s tax receipts via the \u201cLas Vegas of Asia\u201d and was personally worth almost $7bn (\u00a35.7bn), only retiring aged 96.</p> <p>He leaves 14 surviving children he fathered with four wives. During his later years his extended family engaged in high-profile squabbles over his empire.</p> <p>\u201cMy father has passed away peacefully just now at around 1pm at Hong Kong sanatorium and hospital,\u201d said Pansy Ho, one of his daughters. \u201cAs Stanley Ho\u2019s family member, we are really sad to inform you of this.\u201d </p> <p>A passionate and accomplished ballroom dancer, slender and impeccably well-dressed, Ho was also a member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the advisory body to the legislature.</p> <p>China\u2019s state broadcaster, CCTV, described Ho as a \u201cpatriotic entrepreneur\u201d. Ho built up the gaming industry in Macau under a monopoly licence until 2002, when the arrival of foreign investors sparked a boom which resulted in casino takings contributing to about 80% of its annual revenue and overtaking Las Vegas.</p> <p>Born in 1921 in Hong Kong into a wealthy and politically well-connected Eurasian family which had made money from the British trading company Jardine Matheson, the family fell on hard times during the Great Depression in the mid-1920s, before the impoverished Ho fled to neutral Macau \u2013 then a Portuguese colony \u2013 during the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cI was a very poor man,\u201d Ho told Reuters in an interview about his arrival in Macau with the few dollars he had earned working with the air raid administration in the week before Hong Kong\u2019s capture by the Japanese.</p> <p>\u201cI started with only HK$10. That was my capital.\u201d</p> <p>It was there, however, that Ho would make his first fortune before the age of 24, smuggling goods into China while collaborating with the Japanese, before establishing himself as one of the players in Hong Kong\u2019s postwar reconstruction.</p> <p>By 1961, he was well enough established to secure the monopoly for Macau\u2019s new legal gambling franchise that would propel him to stellar riches and prospered even after the region returned to Chinese control in 1999.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d7a8f5a47b0514bed2b6d978d8f468990ddfd9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d7a8f5a47b0514bed2b6d978d8f468990ddfd9b/0_90_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pansy Ho, centre, announces the death of her father outside a hospital in Hong Kong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pansy Ho, centre, announces the death of her father outside a hospital in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recognising that he needed to attract high-rollers from Hong Kong, Ho built a harbour to accommodate the high-speed boats that would ferry Hong Kong gamblers to his casino hotels.</p> <p>Credited with transforming Macau into the world\u2019s biggest casino centre, he would only lose his monopoly when it was opened after four decades to wider competition including from the US billionaire Sheldon Adelson\u2019s Sands China.</p> <p>Ho\u2019s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau Holdings (SJM) empire remains a major player in Macau. The company took a hit alongside its competitors after China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/22/xi-jinping-tigers-flies-corruption\">high-profile corruption crackdown in 201</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/22/xi-jinping-tigers-flies-corruption\">3</a>, triggering a dramatic decline in high-rollers visiting Macau.</p> <p>Allegations of Ho\u2019s connections to organised crime, including from US regulators, dogged him for years.</p> <p>In 2010, after a long investigation, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/708998/triads-thrive-hos-casinos-us-report-says\">the New Jersey gaming authorities issued a report</a> declaring a link between Ho and the triads and requiring that MGM Mirage Macau (a joint venture with Ho) divest its interest in an Atlantic City casino.</p> <p>The 74-page report said Ho was an associate of known and suspected triads who had permitted \u201corganised crime to operate and thrive within his casinos\u201d.</p> <p>In particular law enforcement officials suspected his casinos\u2019 VIP rooms were used by triads to launder money, a claim put to Ho by the New York Times in 2007. Ho did not deny the allegations but said that during the 1980s and 1990s \u201canyone involved in gaming was vulnerable to such accusations\u201d.</p> <p>His last years, however, would be marked by illness and infighting among the factions in his sprawling family.

  "<p>The government\u2019s test, track and trace system to help curb the spread of coronavirus is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/boris-johnson-pledges-england-wide-coronavirus-tracing-by-1-june\">supposed to be up and running by Monday 1 June</a>. But what do we know about how the system works and if it will be ready by next week?</p> \n<p><strong>What is contact tracing \u2013 is is just about a new phone app?</strong></p> \n<p>No. The NHS app being trialled on the Isle of Wight is a very useful addition to contact tracing, but no replacement for human beings who will get in touch with people who may have been in contact with those who have coronavirus symptoms.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Is the contact tracing system ready to go?</strong></p> \n<p>Not yet. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said 25,000 telephone contact tracers had been recruited \u2013 more than the 18,000 he set as a target \u2013 although we do not know whether they have all been trained and are ready to start work. However, the much-discussed NHS app that is supposed to alert people who have been close to somebody who has Covid-19, has been delayed and will not be ready until 1 June. Last Thursday, Prof John Newton, of Public Health England, told the Downing Street briefing there were advantages to starting one part of the operation ahead of the other.</p> \n<p><strong>How important is the app?</strong></p> \n<p>The government initially set great store by it. Hancock is known to be a great fan of technology. It was hoped it would make the work of contact tracing much easier, but the trial on the Isle of Wight has thrown up problems. For one thing, it appears the app does not work so well with Google- and Apple-operated phones.</p> \n<p><strong>What will the call handlers do?</strong></p> \n<p>They will work from home initially, and possibly in call centres later. They will be given the details of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 and call them to find out whom they have met in the previous two days. The call handlers will phone those people and advise them and their family to self-isolate for 14 days. They should then check on them regularly to ask how they are and whether they are coping. If any of those contacts becomes ill, the call handlers will ask them in turn for the names and numbers of people they have been with.</p> \n<p><strong>Will people who get a call and are told to self-isolate cooperate?</strong></p> \n<p>Some will and some may not. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/uk-first-coronavirus-contact-tracing-group-warns-of-difficulties\">pilot project run by a group of doctors</a> in Sheffield found a number of problems, including a reluctance by some people to self-isolate when it meant being unable to earn money. Several of those people were working in care homes.</p> \n<p>Many public health doctors think the tracing schemes should be run at local authority level, by people who are part of the community and will be better able to find and support people, rather than call handlers who may be located in a different part of the country. Contact tracing in the past has been done by local environmental and public health officers.</p> \n<p><strong>Will Dominic Cummings\u2019 decision to travel 264 miles to Durham to self-isolate</strong><strong> make it more difficult for call handlers to persuade people to stay </strong><strong>at home</strong><strong>?</strong></p> \n<p>That is the fear of some behavioural scientists. Some families may think if he can interpret the rules how he likes, then so can they.</p>",
  "<p>My friend Susy Powlesland, who has died aged 90, was a radical educationist. With her husband, John, she set up the alternative Kirkdale school in south London in the mid 1960s. The school adhered to principles of self-sufficiency, equality and creative learning, focusing on the particular interests of the individual child. It ran for over a decade and created a community that still exists today.</p> <p>Susy was an only child born to Jewish parents, Emilie (nee Preis) and Felix Michlowitz, in Vienna, where her father ran a watchmaking and jewellery business. When she was nine the family managed to get on the last train out of Austria before the border was sealed at the approach of the second world war. They were billeted initially in London but were driven out by the blitz, and taken in by a woman in Reading, where Susy never felt fully at home.</p> <p>She attended local schools, and after leaving Kendrick girls\u2019 grammar school at 16 trained as a nursery nurse in Reading, then was accepted for teacher training at the residential Gypsy Hill Training College, in Kingston, Surrey. She taught at primary schools in Stratford, east London, and in Leicestershire. She met John Powlesland when they worked together at Forest School camps. They married in 1954 and later settled in London.</p> <p>Susy was keenly attuned to racial and religious intolerance, and had a passion in particular for the underdog and outsider. In his 2007 book The Islamist, Ed Husain describes a terrifying incident when a group of National Front thugs threatened him and other Muslim school children in a local playground. Susy and the other teachers raced to the side of the children and roared at the shaven-headed bigots.</p> <p>Susy lived in Tower Hamlets for more than 40 years. During her headship at Sir William Burrough school (1980-95) she had a huge impact on the children and families. She went out of her way to support newly arrived Bangladeshi children, especially those without immediate family. In the 1980s, she learnt some Sylheti and travelled to Bangladesh to learn more about the cultural background of her pupils.</p> <p>In 1984 she was the driving force behind the establishment of the Limehouse Housing Project, whose chief aim was to improve the lives of black and minority ethnic communities through the provision of good quality housing. In 2003 she co-founded a new local charity called the Globe Community Project, which aims to provide activities for young and old residents from diverse communities. She was appointed MBE in 2007 for services to BAME people in east London.</p> <p>After retirement, she became interested in meditation and Buddhism and was ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order in 2003, taking the name Shraddhapuspa (Flower of Faith).

  "<p>Brexit talks risk reaching a stalemate if there is no progress in the next round of negotiations between the European Union and the British government, EU sources have said.</p> <p>The two sides are due to resume talks next week, the final round scheduled before a \u201chigh-level conference\u201d in June to assess progress before the end-of-year deadline.</p> <p>After the chief negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/brexit-gove-confirms-plans-for-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea\">exchanged testy letters last week</a>, a senior EU official said there was a risk of stalemate if the EU did not see progress on its vital interests, including how to ensure fair competition, or a level play field, between British and EU companies under a free-trade deal.</p> <p>\u201cThat is a crucial round,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf there is no parallel progress \u2013 level playing field, protection of fundamental rights and governance \u2013 then we risk going into July with a major problem, the stalemate Barnier warned about.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator said \u201cparallelism is a condition for progress\u201d, meaning that talks had to advance in all areas, including priorities for the EU, such as the level playing field and an agreement on fishing rights.</p> <p>Frost argues the UK has set out<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886168/Letter_to_Michel_Barnier_19.05.20.pdf\"> a \u201ccomprehensive set of proposals\u201d</a> to prevent unfair competitive advantages, but multiple EU sources say the British ideas are inadequate.</p> <p>In a setback for Frost, EU diplomats have rejected calls for the union to change its approach to the negotiations.</p> <p>One of several diplomats who spoke to the Guardian and were opposed to the idea of rewriting the negotiating mandate, said: \u201cA large majority of member states, maybe all of us, think that we have to stick to the mandate at this point of time and I don\u2019t see a lot of movement \u2026 there are not many lights in the tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>In a further blow to the UK, diplomats also backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/negotiators-gloomy-as-eu-uk-brexit-talks-end-in-stalemate\">Barnier\u2019s accusation that the British were trying to \u201ccherrypick\u201d</a> benefits from the EU single market that were not available to other countries with a free-trade agreement, such as Canada and Japan.</p> <p>\u201cThe demands of the UK government at the moment are very unilateral,\u201d said a second EU diplomat. \u201cThey want to keep the things that are suiting them, but give away things in our interest.\u201d</p> <p>The diplomat referred to British interest in an agreement on professional services, such as law and auditing, that goes beyond what the EU has done with other trade partners. \u201cTo have British lawyers providing services around the EU, I am not sure that is of interest to our lawyers, especially when you [the UK] don\u2019t want to be in the common ecosystem [of] common controls and rules.\u201d</p> <p>EU diplomats are tired of the repeated reminders from Frost\u2019s team about the importance of UK sovereignty, pointing out that their governments are also sovereign. \u201cThe EU accepts that the UK is sovereign, but that is not the issue,\u201d said the EU official. \u201cThe issue is what you as a country are going to commit to to get access to our market. That is the real question.\u201d</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said it was to be \u201cexpected at this stage in a very difficult negotiation that both sides are making their case robustly and ensuring it is understood. We will continue to approach negotiations constructively, but our position hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 we won\u2019t agree to any EU demands for us to give up our rights as an independent state.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve never asked for anything special, bespoke or unique \u2013 we\u2019re looking for a free-trade agreement, based on precedent and similar to those the EU has already got with other countries like Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Adding to pressure on Barnier not to concede on fishing rights, on Monday night the European parliament\u2019s fisheries committee threatened to veto any deal with the UK that did not include a \u201cbalanced\u201d agreement on fish quotas, allowing EU fleets continue access to British waters.</p> <p>\u201cNo fisheries agreement means no post-Brexit agreement,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, the French centre-right MEP \u2013 and member of Barnier\u2019s Les R\u00e9publicains party \u2013 who drew up a report that was adopted with near unanimity by the committee.</p>",

Why no, he had not \u2018offered his resignation, or even thought of offering it\u2019, because he had absolutely no idea why he should have. Over and over again he repeated: \u2018I acted reasonably\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Of Cummings\u2019 Easter jaunt to Barnard Castle, undertaken \u2013 by his account \u2013 to check that his eyesight was up to the journey back to London, Lib\u00e9ration remarked: \u201cTo many, driving 30 miles with blurred vision and a four-year-old in the back might not be considered entirely reasonable.

They never speak in public ... But for more than an hour, Cummings delivered his version of the facts, assuring all that he had \u2018acted reasonably\u2019, without breaking the rules.\u201d</p> <p>There was \u201cno question of apologising. At most, he conceded one or two minor errors \u2026 But will the operation have been successful? It will, in any case, have shown how deeply Cummings wants to keep his job. And how deeply Boris Johnson cares about this very special special adviser.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-05-25/el-asesor-estrella-de-johnson-asegura-que-no-se-arrepiente-de-haberse-saltado-el-confinamiento.html\">Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds said</a> Cummings was meant to be \u201cthe breath of fresh, irreverent air that was going to help Boris Johnson design a new country after Brexit\u201d. But the adviser\u2019s \u201crefusal to express any remorse for breaking the lockdown rules has caused a political gale that may irreparably damage the prime minister\u2019s political credibility\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s \u201cmachiavellian henchman is asking for a display of understanding and empathy that at another time, and for another person, might have seemed humane and reasonable\u201d, the paper said.</p> <p>\u201cBut Cummings has left a trail of political enemies along the way, and the patience of British public opinion is at breaking point. The adviser so famously capable of scenting the mood of the people has not grasped that sometimes a resignation is not fair or unfair, but necessary to protect a superior.\u201d</p> <p>In Germany, <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article208272341/Lockdown-Affaere-um-Dominic-Cummings-Bizarrer-Auftritt-im-Rosengarten.html?cid=onsite.onsitesearch\">Die Welt described</a> a \u201cbizarre\u201d event at which \u201cthe second most powerful man in Westminster after Boris Johnson \u2026 refused to step down or even apologise, despite massive criticism of his trip to relatives during the coronavirus crisis. Cummings could have irreparably damaged confidence in the government.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/corona-warum-johnson-nicht-auf-dominic-cummings-verzichten-will-16786221.html\">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said</a> Cummings had \u201cgone down in history as the first adviser to give a live press conference in Downing Street\u201d. Usually, the paper said, \u201cpolitical advisers work for the government. In Cummings\u2019 case, it is ministers who work for the adviser: one after another has been sent out to defend him.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the adviser\u2019s trip broke the rules \u201cremains a matter of interpretation,\u201d the paper said, but there was no denying the extent of \u201cthe outrage that has shaken the country in the past few days. Not just politicians and commentators, but academics and churchmen \u2013 all echoing the chorus of citizens demanding Cummings go.\u201d</p> <p>In the Netherlands, <a href=\"https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/05/24/johnsons-adviseur-cummings-vond-dat-de-strenge-lockdown-niet-voor-hem-gold-a4000600\">NRC Handelsblad</a> said Johnson was now stuck with \u201ca growing problem. Firing Cummings, even temporarily, would remove his right hand \u2013 and Johnson\u2019s most important ministers were appointed because of their views on Brexit, not their expert special knowledge or leadership experience.\u201d</p> <p>But keeping him \u201cis equally dangerous\u201d, the paper said. \u201cIt will show the British public that they do not need to observe the lockdown rules so strictly.

After being interviewed in custody, he was ultimately driven back to his grandmother\u2019s home in Waltham Forest at 3am.</p> <p>The coordination of services between Bournemouth and London was not as strong as it could have been, the report said, calling this a \u201creachable moment\u201d, based on a concept in education that describes an unplanned chance for a breakthrough with a child.</p> <p>\u201cThe response to Child C while detained in Bournemouth and then on his return from there in October 2018 did not capitalise on a \u2018reachable\u2019 moment for a child who was clearly being criminally exploited, and nor was all the information available from the authorities in Bournemouth transferred to their counterparts in Waltham Forest,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the importance of maximising the potential of reachable moments in working with children is beginning to be recognised, there is as yet no satisfactory approach to covering the whole country when a child who is exposed to \u2018county lines\u2019 style operations is found a distance away from their home and so reachable moments are being missed.\u201d</p> <p>From 2011 to 2018, Moodie and his family were living in Nottinghamshire. From 2016, he began to have a troubled time at secondary school, leading to suspensions and other disciplinary measures. His mother decided to educate him at home from 2017, and he was then at home for more than a year.</p> <p>However, by the end of the summer of 2017 these arrangements were beginning to break down, eventually leaving Moodie with a lot of unsupervised time, a pattern that repeated at regular intervals for the rest of his life.</p> <p>In April 2018, his mother decided to move him to Waltham Forest to live initially with his grandmother while she applied to be rehoused in Waltham Forest from Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>At the time of his death, the 14-year-old was sleeping on a sofa at his maternal grandmother\u2019s house while his mother, who was staying nearby, pursued the housing application.</p> <p>The serious case review highlighted other significant concerns. Moodie spent all but three of his last 22 months out of school and for much of this there was limited adult guidance or supervision.</p> <p>\u201cTime spent out of school, for whatever reason, is recognised to constitute a significant risk to children who are vulnerable to criminal exploitation,\u201d the report added.</p> <p>The report found that current arrangements governing home education contributed to his vulnerability to criminal exploitation.</p> <p>There was a delay in processing his mother\u2019s application for a place for Moodie at a Waltham Forest high school in May 2018, the report said.</p> <p>The initial response to his mother\u2019s application for housing in Waltham Forest was slow and no new action was taken after her request that her request for rehousing be reopened by Waltham Forest in August until the end of October 2018.</p> <p>The report concluded that this could have had an impact on Moodie\u2019s mother\u2019s ability to exercise parental control and supervision over her son.</p>",

  "<p>A week before the Covid-19 lockdown was announced, playwrights, directors and actors were invited to create short dramas about the vicissitudes of pandemic life as it unfolded. Headlong and Century Films hoped that the commissions would explore how theatre could be made in, and about, the new reality that has hit us.</p> <p>The idea, in effect, was to capture the storm on camera in a series of 14 films that document and dramatise real-life issues, although the endeavour to turn life, as it is happening, into the stuff of gripping drama is not without its risks.</p> <p>In the first eight films, collected into three episodes screened on BBC Four this week, we find much familiar fare about the pains and inconveniences of life in quarantine. There are glitches on Skype (\u201ccan you hear me now?\u201d) and small talk about bread-making. An awkward office meeting with a cut-throat boss on Zoom is the subject of John Donnelly\u2019s Going Forward, while a neighbourhood party online ends in a drunken, disorderly state in April de Angelis\u2019s House Party. The lockdown is shown from generational points of view, from James Graham\u2019s frustrated teenagers in Viral to Duncan Macmillan\u2019s baby-boomers in Grounded, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/live/2019/feb/04/katherine-parkinson-webchat-the-it-crowd-home-im-darling\">Katherine Parkinson</a> and Alison Steadman, who carry on having get-togethers and going to Zumba classes after lockdown is announced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59549563c53e367d865e56e4feb7dcd994d0026d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59549563c53e367d865e56e4feb7dcd994d0026d/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archie Madekwe, Laurie Kynaston and Stuart Thompson in Viral by James Graham, directed by Ola Ince.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archie Madekwe, Laurie Kynaston and Stuart Thompson in Viral by James Graham, directed by Ola Ince.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Headlong and Century Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But although the films press our noses against our own realities, each one weaves its own magic.

Directed by Brian Hill, it tells the story of a pregnant wife (Gemma Arterton) who makes Skype calls to her mother-in-law (Geraldine James) in which they speak about everyday things. Behind the smiles and shows of affection between Arterton and her husband (Rory Keenan), a growing tension hints at his abusive behaviour and her powerlessness. It is a subtly told and sinister story, brilliantly performed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3b5e712d7131ef1430dac97f83ebdf0a2065703\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b5e712d7131ef1430dac97f83ebdf0a2065703/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lennie James in Penny by Charlene James, directed by Holly Race Roughan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lennie James in Penny by Charlene James, directed by Holly Race Roughan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Headlong and Century Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other films sound equally strong notes: Charlene James\u2019s Penny, directed by Holly Race Roughan and starring Lennie James, illuminates the experience of homelessness during lockdown, while Tim Price\u2019s Romantic Distancing, directed by Jeremy Herrin, captures a blundering, and lovable, masculinity as a musician (Arthur Darvill) gets dumped on Skype by a woman (In\u00e8s de Clercq) he had just begun dating before lockdown, and woos her back with earnest, romantic words.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/16/prasanna-puwanarajah-patrick-melrose-benedict-cumberbatch-planet-acting-didnt-need-someone-like-me\">Prasanna Puwanarajah</a>\u2019s Fear Fatigue, directed by Brian Hill, is the most documentary-like of all the dramas.

It is up to AHEIA to explain why at least 17 of its members have abandoned the solution it negotiated on behalf of the universities.</p> \n   <p>The worst crisis in the history of Australian universities demanded a collective solution to save careers and livelihoods. Too many vice chancellors are now baulking at the strong oversight provisions in the jobs framework that guarantee transparency and ensure that any contribution our members make will be dedicated to saving jobs. </p> \n   <p>Vice chancellors appear to have abandoned their industrial association, and demonstrated they are allergic to scrutiny.

Our safety, our security, our social safety net of which we\u2019re so proud. </p> \n   <p>To strengthen and agree our economy, the boats we need to go faster are the hundreds of thousands of small and medium and large businesses that make up our economy and create the value upon which everything else depends.

  "<p>Greece fears a fresh standoff on its border with Turkey after the Turkish foreign minister suggested migrants and refugees would shortly return to the frontier as the two countries emerge from coronavirus lockdowns.</p> <p>Speaking to a local television station in Antalya, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said: \u201cDue to the pandemic, the movement of migrants has slowed down. But they will definitely want to leave after the outbreak is over.\u201d</p> <p>The statement set off alarm bells in Athens, where analysts are increasingly voicing fears of an iteration of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/refugees-europe-closed-tensions-greece-turkey-border\">the crisis that erupted earlier this year</a> when the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, declared the doors to Europe were open and migrants free to cross into Greece.</p> <p>After a hiatus of almost three months, Greek authorities reported several boats of men, women and children landing on the shores of Lesbos last week.</p> <p>Some 37,000 asylum seekers remain on the outposts in vastly overcrowded conditions that have been deplored by human rights groups.</p> <p>As a precautionary measure against coronavirus, Turkey sealed its north-western land frontier, demarcated by the Evros River in mid-March, but only after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/thousands-gather-at-turkish-border-to-cross-into-greece\">weeks of chaos and high drama</a> in which thousands attempted to cross the border amid a hail of rubber bullets and teargas fired by elite forces on either side.</p> <p>In recent days, there has been renewed tension over moves by Athens to extend a 12.5km-long razor wire fence along the frontier in land disputed by Ankara.</p> <p>\u201cAs the region gradually emerges from coronavirus lockdown, we are seeing a rise in tensions on all fronts,\u201d said Angelos Syrigos, professor of international law at Panteion University and an MP in the governing New Democracy party. \u201cIt is clear Turkey wants to continue weaponising migrants and refugees to extract European support for its geopolitical goals. My worry is that very soon we could see a new border crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Athens\u2019 centre right government, rallying EU support earlier this year, deployed riot police and military patrols to the land border while dispatching gunships and coastguard vessels to conduct around-the-clock patrols off the Turkish coast.</p> <p>But Frontex, the EU border agency that is participating in the patrols, has reportedly also predicted that the easing of coronavirus restrictions in Turkey will likely result in thousands of migrants and refugees attempting, once again, to cross into Greece. Internal documents seen by the German newspaper, Die Welt, suggested a mass movement of people towards the Greek-Turkish border and shores opposite outlying Aegean islands once internal containment measures are lifted. The document, dated 5 May, indicated that 262 officers had been seconded to bolster the Evros border region.</p> <p>In March, the Turkish interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, also warned that Europe-bound migrants would be able to return to the Greek-Turkish land border once the pandemic receded. \u201cWhen this epidemic is over we would not prevent whoever wants to leave,\u201d he said, after ordering the evacuation of men, women and children from the region. </p> <p>As home to more than 4 million refugees \u2013 more than anywhere else in the world \u2013 Turkey has repeatedly threatened to open the gates to Europe, arguing that Brussels has failed to provide adequate funding to host such numbers. The vast majority are displaced Syrians.</p> <p>Ankara\u2019s deteriorating economy and pressure on Erdo\u011fan himself has underpinned crisis fears. Hostility has risen noticeably in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean where belligerent rhetoric from Turkey has been backed by brazen overflights over Greek isles and alleged harassment of patrol boats.</p> <p>Bilateral tensions come against a backdrop of disquieting reports of Greek authorities forcibly sending refugees back to Turkey. Allegations of expulsions have mounted in recent months with human rights activists accusing the government of exploiting the pandemic to engage in extrajudicial deportation of asylum seekers.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned about recent reports that have reached UNHCR of informal forced returns at Greece\u2019s borders over land and sea,\u201d said Boris Cheshirkov, the agency\u2019s spokesperson in Athens, describing the allegations as credible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/14/coronavirus-cases-among-refugees-on-lesbos-spark-fresh-calls-for-evacuation\">Coronavirus cases among refugees on Lesbos spark fresh calls for evacuation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have received reports of testimonies \u2026 and have approached authorities to express our concern and ask [them] to investigate and correct these practices if they are confirmed.\u201d</p> <p>Human rights groups claim conditions in island camps have also worsened as a result of restrictive measures to stem the spread of the virus. Although lockdown policies have gradually been lifted across Greece they are still enforced in holding centres with night curfews still in place.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen a noticeable rise in all sorts of violence, from tent violence to sexual violence because people are forced to spend much more time in camps,\u201d said Apostolos Veizis, the medical director of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Greece. \u201cThese people are not treated as human but numbers.

Democrats\u2019 entire 2018 electoral campaign told America that the opposition party needed to win back Congress in order to block Trump\u2019s regressive agenda. And yet, when the Republicans proposed a bill to let Trump\u2019s appointees dole out government cash to their corporate allies with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2020/03/31/the-500-billion-in-corporate-assistance-will-end-up-as-a-corrupt-cash-grab-if-we-dont-ask-the-right-questions/#2969dfb55d4a\">no strings attached</a>, this same opposition party mustered <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html\">not a single recorded vote</a> against the package. Not one.</p> <p>Thanks to that, Trump appointees and the Federal Reserve can now hand out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/fed-coronavirus-stimulus.html\">$4tn</a> to politically connected corporations as they lay waste to our economy and steamroll progressive reforms. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-coronavirus-stimulus-offers-taxpayer-cash-to-buyout-firm-companies-11586988495\">Private equity firms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/-stealth-bailout-shovels-millions-of-dollars-to-oil-companies\">fossil fuel companies</a> get new tax breaks as they buy elections and try to lock in permanent climate change.</p> <p>These bailouts were part of a larger legislative package that included good things like expanded unemployment benefits \u2013 and so you could argue that Democrats simply had to swallow a bitter pill and vote yes. Except, they subsequently proposed their own standalone legislation that would further strengthen the corporate opponents of progressive reform.</p> <p>For example, there is the Democrats\u2019 push to alter the so-called paycheck protection program (PPP). Those loans were designed to help employees of mom-and-pop enterprises throughout the country. House Democrats\u2019 new stimulus legislation would open up the small business lending program to what they call \u201csmall nonprofits\u201d, but their language was crafted to provide the forgivable loans to industry trade associations. Those lobby groups represent the planet\u2019s biggest corporations \u2013 and their political action committees have delivered more than <a href=\"https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-does-amazon-rip-off-the-postal-service/\">$191m of campaign cash</a> to lawmakers in the last two decades.</p> <p>Democrats have pitched their legislation as a \u201cmessage\u201d bill that declares their values \u2013 and in this case, they are reassuring Washington power-players that money meant for workers at neighborhood restaurants, local shops and other mom-and-pop concerns can be raided by the front groups representing giant drug companies, health insurers and Wall Street firms. If the legislation passes, it would not merely be an epic tale of greed \u2013 the new funding stream for corporate lobbying groups would bolster the very forces that make sure federal policy disempowers workers, maximizes private profit and generally protects the ruling class.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The tragedy is we\u2019re already moving in that wrong direction, and chances to change the dynamic don't come around often</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s an even worse story on healthcare. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/us-health-insurance-layoffs-coronavirus\">43 million Americans</a> face the prospect of losing private health insurance, Democrats had a huge opportunity. After Trump himself suggested he wanted the government to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-plans-to-pay-hospitals-to-treat-uninsured-coronavirus-patients-11585927877\">pay healthcare providers directly</a> for treating uninsured Covid-19 patients, they could have called his bluff and passed <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3790/cosponsors?r=1&amp;s=1&amp;searchResultViewType=expanded&amp;KWICView=false\">existing legislation</a> to expand a Medicare program that provides actual medical care. Instead, House Democrats passed a bill to support lightly regulated private insurance marketplaces and to subsidize existing private insurance plans through a Rube Goldberg machine known as Cobra \u2013 and they passed this giveaway just after receiving an <a href=\"https://prospect.org/coronavirus/dems-health-insurer-bailout-follows-bundled-checks/\">infusion</a> of campaign cash collected by insurance lobbyists.</p> <p>Taken together, these initiatives would route yet more public money through a corporate insurance bureaucracy in hopes that medical care eventually trickles down to Americans who desperately need it. Such a system is totally inadequate during a pandemic: it doesn\u2019t guarantee healthcare \u2013 it only only guarantees insurance coverage, which is so often <a href=\"https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/aca-plans-denied-nearly-1-in-5-in-network-claims-in-2017/549312/\">denied</a> or restricted when a medical claim is actually filed. Moreover, corporate health insurance has far <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-costs-administration/more-than-a-third-of-u-s-healthcare-costs-go-to-bureaucracy-idUSKBN1Z5261\">higher administrative costs</a> than single-payer programs like <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20110920.013390/full/\">Medicare</a>, and even the much-vaunted Affordable Care Act allows insurers to siphon up to <a href=\"https://pnhp.org/news/why-medical-loss-ratio-rebates-benefit-the-insurers/\">20%</a> of customers\u2019 premiums to corporate profits rather than actual medical care.</p> <p>But then, Democrats\u2019 Cobra plan is not merely a financial bailout for insurers \u2013 it is also a political bailout when the industry needs it most. At a time when popular support for Medicare for All is <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/\">surging</a> \u2013 when even a Republican president feels the need to make rhetorical (if empty) <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-plans-to-pay-hospitals-to-treat-uninsured-coronavirus-patients-11585927877\">gestures</a> toward the concept of government-funded healthcare \u2013 the Cobra plan would use public money to firm up the private health insurance industry\u2019s dominance over the healthcare system, just in time to short circuit a Medicare expansion.</p> <p>That\u2019s probably why insurance companies have been <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/05/12/heroes-act-coronavirus-health-insurance-industry/\">lobbying for it</a>. They know that such a program would boost their short-term profits, and they know that once such a program is in place, it would be politically difficult to get it repealed and replaced by progressives\u2019 far better Medicare for All program. In other words: Democrats\u2019 Cobra plan may secure insurance companies\u2019 profit-skimming position between Americans and their healthcare providers for decades to come.</p> <p>If you get the sense that the fix is in and this is all deliberate, you\u2019re not wrong. Many of the self-styled <a href=\"https://front.moveon.org/progressives-mobilize-to-pass-heroes-act-house-covid-relief-bill/\">progressive advocacy groups</a> in Washington that posture as #resistance leaders turned a blind eye to the bill\u2019s problems and endorsed the legislation shortly after it was introduced, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/05/15/coronavirus-relief-house-heroes-act-progressives/\">undercutting progressive lawmakers</a> off the bat.</p> <p>Making matters worse was the theater on the House floor. During the debate over the Democratic bill, nine progressive lawmakers made a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/498034-progressives-to-buck-party-by-voting-against-3t-relief-bill\">public show</a> of <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll106.xml\">voting</a> against the procedural measure to advance the bill, along with a tiny group of moderates. When it came to the real vote on actually passing the bill, a larger group of moderates ended up voting against it, but only one progressive lawmaker, Representative Pramila Jayapal, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll109.xml\">voted no</a>. Had the progressives and moderates combined forces on either of the votes, they would have forced the bill back to the drawing board.

  "<p>\u2018It\u2019s a golden era of male ballet dancers.\u201d So says Emma Cahusac, the commissioning editor behind a new documentary, Men at the Barre, part of BBC Four\u2019s dance season. It\u2019s not just hyperbole. The young men rising up at the Royal Ballet are some of the most exciting in dance right now: principals Matthew Ball and Marcelino Samb\u00e9, first soloists Cesar Corrales and William Bracewell, and first artist Joseph Sissens all feature in Men at the Barre. With the majority of them British or UK-trained, it\u2019s a giant leap from the grumblings of a decade ago about the lack of local dancers making it to the top.</p> <p>I spoke to Ball, Corrales and Samb\u00e9 by phone, all staying resolutely positive during this enforced break from their intensive dancing lives, but all desperate to get back to work with colleagues they\u2019re certain are something special. \u201cI see so much beauty and so much strength and power in that company,\u201d says Samb\u00e9. \u201cThere has been a surge in this younger generation,\u201d says Ball.</p> <p>Why this wealth of talent has arrived right now isn\u2019t easy to pinpoint, but they definitely spur each other on. There\u2019s healthy competition \u2013 ballet boys can\u2019t resist a pirouette-off; Corrales\u2019 record is \u201cat least 15\u201d \u2013 but they all talk about how secure they feel because each dancer is very different.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"577f84fe362e76d086394e4fafbfbf6b5cee29dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577f84fe362e76d086394e4fafbfbf6b5cee29dd/0_0_4345_3097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesar Corrales in Mayerling at the Royal Opera House, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cesar Corrales in Mayerling at the Royal Opera House, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liverpool-born Ball, 26, who trained at the Royal Ballet School from the age of 11, is the tall athlete-poet with a flair for drama.

When you see him move it\u2019s like a fish to water, it just makes sense.\u201d Samb\u00e9\u2019s joy as he springs and bounds has made him an outright audience favourite, although he admits his beaming smile was originally a mechanism for coping with nerves. \u201cThe one thing that made me feel comfortable was a big smile, to connect with the audience,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All those negative comments, the bullying, gave me the power and explosiveness to become who I am today</p> <footer> <cite>Cesar Corrales</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Corrales, at 23, is the virtuoso prodigy. The son of Cuban ballet dancers, raised in Canada, he joined English National Ballet aged 17, was a principal at 20 and moved to the Royal two years ago. \u201cHe\u2019s a real firecracker,\u201d says Ball. \u201cHe certainly pushes us to achieve one more centimetre higher or an extra turn. People often talk about British dancers being controlled or mannered and that\u2019s something I personally don\u2019t want to buy into.\u201d</p> <p>A notable line in Men at the Barre comes from ballet master Christopher Carr, who was a dancer in the Royal Ballet in the era of Rudolf Nureyev. He says that if Nureyev was around now, he wouldn\u2019t be such a big star: \u201cThere are now better dancers.\u201d Corrales takes issue with that. \u201cNureyev was on another planet!\u201d he says. But it\u2019s true that while Nureyev was ahead of his time, and had blazing power and charisma, there are technically better dancers with every generation. The expectations on young dancers now are much greater than their predecessors. Everything is bigger, faster, higher; training draws on hi-tech sports science, and they must master not only the exactitudes of classical technique, but be versatile enough to perform the most contortive contemporary moves. They don\u2019t just follow directions, either, but help develop movement with choreographers. \u201cIt\u2019s very different to other generations,\u201d says Corrales. \u201cYou need to have that skill of contributing, bringing ideas to the table.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"630b691145d2adb3835f0ef3af38dd6e68d9054b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/630b691145d2adb3835f0ef3af38dd6e68d9054b/0_0_4412_2968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Ball (The Conductor), Marcelino Samb\u00e9 (The Instrument) and Lauren Cuthbertson (The Cellist) in The Cellist by Cathy Marston at the Royal Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Ball (The Conductor), Marcelino Samb\u00e9 (The Instrument) and Lauren Cuthbertson (The Cellist) in The Cellist by Cathy Marston at the Royal Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With two ballet dancers for parents, Corrales had the genes and the set-up for a smooth career path. In Cuba dancers are revered, with footballer-like status, but growing up in Canada he experienced bullying, \u201cespecially since I was the smallest in the class,\u201d he says. He could laugh, because \u201cthey just had no clue\u201d about dance, but at the same time he thinks that spurred him on to literally jump higher. \u201cAll those negative comments, the bullying in school from a young age, gave me that power and explosiveness to become who I am today.\u201d</p> <p>The teasing Corrales experienced probably chimes with most people\u2019s expectations about the lingering stigma attached to boys who do ballet \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/26/lara-spencer-prince-george-ballet-lessons-apology\">mocking comments made by US television presenter Lara Spencer</a> about Prince George doing ballet feature in Men at the Barre.

I was actually quite supported, which some people might be surprised by, especially in Liverpool which is such a football city.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Ball and Corrales, Samb\u00e9 doesn\u2019t come from a dancing background. From a poor family in Lisbon, his construction-worker father died when he was eight and he was fostered by another family with a daughter at the Lisbon Conservatory, where Samb\u00e9 studied. His earliest dance experience was in African dance and he first saw ballet on YouTube.

  "<p>The US is nearing the bleak milestone of 100,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths. But the actual death toll will probably have hit that figure days before the official tallies reflect it. And despite scientists\u2019 best efforts, that date may for ever go unmarked.</p> <p>Coronavirus was probably spreading through the US before the Trump administration restricted travel from China, before the US had a reliable supply of diagnostic tests, and before the disease caused by the virus was even named. Models of the Covid-19 outbreak estimate that the virus was making its way through America\u2019s major cities, undetected, weeks before a California woman in early February became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought\">first American known to have died</a> of related causes.</p> <p>Researchers are now doing detective work, revisiting autopsies from early this year and studying how the virus has subtly evolved to try to trace when Covid-19 may have first sickened and killed people in the US. Infectious disease experts caution, however, that finding a \u201cpatient zero\u201d, or even figuring out exactly how many Americans were infected and died before testing was available, will be nearly impossible.</p> <h2><strong>The first \u2018first case\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-us-cdc-case-china-health\">first report</a> of coronavirus in the US came on 21 January, when a man in Washington state who had traveled to Wuhan, China, tested positive. The Seattle area soon became a hotspot, with cases soaring after an outbreak at a nursing home outside the city. On 29 February, Washington state reported what at the time was believed to be the nation\u2019s first death from Covid-19.</p> <p>Coronavirus cases were also identified in California in late January, initially among those who had recently travelled to Wuhan. By late February, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said officials were monitoring more than 8,400 patients \u2013 but the state had only 200 testing kits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"707af33893ee48d2448bdf41ceb95e0c0d47a2eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/707af33893ee48d2448bdf41ceb95e0c0d47a2eb/0_0_5310_3576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers man the Medical Health and Coordination Center at the California Department of Public Health on February 27, 2020 in Sacramento, California.

Initially, only the most severely ill patients were being tested, and those who had recently travelled were prioritized.</p> <p>It was only by looking back that California officials realized that the virus may have been spreading through the state and killing residents earlier than they had thought. Large hospitals and academic medical centers routinely preserve and store tissue samples from autopsies for six months to a year. In April, an analysis of samples from the autopsy of a 57-year-old Santa Clara woman who died suddenly in her home on 6 February revealed that she succumbed to the disease. The woman probably contracted the virus at least a week or two before she died. The fact that she had not travelled outside the country means that coronavirus was spreading within the community by mid-to-late January.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>As we do more testing, I think it would be quite likely that we will find cases that go back several months in North America.</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Badley, Mayo Clinic</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recently, Washington officials have been looking into the cases of two patients with symptoms typical of Covid-19 in late December, after they recently tested positive for antibodies to the virus. These patients could have suffered from a severe flu or other respiratory illness, and contracted the coronavirus later \u2013 but more research and widespread serological tests could help clear up whether some severe cases in late December or January that appeared to be cold or flu were in fact Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely there\u2019s a chance that there were more infections that resulted in death, at a time when we didn\u2019t know about this novel coronavirus,\u201d said Andrew Badley, chair of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Covid-19 research task force. \u201cAs we do more testing, I think it would be quite likely that we will find cases that go back several months in North America.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We\u2019re not going to exhume bodies\u2019</strong></h2> <p>But much about these early cases is \u2013 and will remain \u2013 unclear.</p> <p>Newsom, the California governor, ordered coroners in the state to review autopsies back to December, and the Mayo Clinic is one of many academic medical centers giving cases of pneumonia and flu-like illness a second look.

While researchers know that there were sporadic cases early on, more research is needed to figure out how widely the virus was circulating in January and February, according to Stanford\u2019s Benjamin Pinsky, who led the testing effort.</p> <p>That the US saw a late, severe flu season makes it even trickier to tease apart whether it was the flu or coronavirus that was making people sick in January and February, said Rutherford. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more early cases turned up, but he said it was unclear why, if the virus was circulating early, patients were not overwhelming hospitals early on. \u201cThe big mystery is why don\u2019t we have even more cases now, if it was spreading before we had shelter in place and all that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Elsewhere, researchers are hoping to learn more by studying the virus\u2019s genetic makeup. \u201cAll viruses have the ability to mutate and change a little bit over time,\u201d said Badley. By tracing different strains of the virus, and working out the rate at which the virus tends to change, researchers can estimate when each strain was introduced to a region, Bradley explained. But the process is tricky and requires that the older strains of the virus still be around \u2013 either preserved in tissue samples or spreading through the population.</p> <p>A genetic analysis found at least eight lineages of the coronavirus circulating in northern California, suggesting that the virus was introduced to the region several times from different sources. That research has yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal, but these early findings support what many epidemiologists believe: that there wasn\u2019t a single \u201cpatient zero\u201d who sparked the outbreak in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4aa02b08d85084678e7c9fd149369234a4e28a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4aa02b08d85084678e7c9fd149369234a4e28a7/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of UC Davis Medical Center on February 27, 2020 in Sacramento, California.

It may also pose a risk to all our health, continues Daghlian: \u201cIf you can\u2019t feed yourself without working, you will go to work if you possibly can, even if you\u2019ve been exposed to Covid-19 or have symptoms.\u201d</p> <p>Migrants make up a disproportionate number of the workers in the frontline of the Covid crisis. <a href=\"https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/2020/between-immobility-and-resistance-low-skilled-migrants-in-the-pandemic/\">In 2019</a>, around 20% of health workers were migrants, along with 18% of those in social care and 26% in the transport and storage sectors. They are also <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-labour-market-an-overview/\">more likely than others to work in insecure employment</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSome migrants have worked here for years (and paid taxes) and NRPF hasn\u2019t been a problem,\u201d Daghlian continues, \u201cbut when a crisis like Covid-19 comes along and they lose their job, or worse, the family breadwinner, there\u2019s no safety net.\u201d</p> <p>Families who have lost their income may resort to using money saved for their next visa renewal, says Daghlian. Non-EU migrants (and potentially EU citizens as well after the Brexit transition period ends) must renew their visas periodically: in many cases every 2.5 years until they have been here 10 years and are able to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Each renewal can cost a family thousands of pounds, says Daghlian: \u201cThe government is profiteering. They have raised fees to extortionate levels that are causing real hardship.\u201d</p> <p>She cites the example of Praxis client Michelle (not her real name) from west Africa<strong>,</strong> who has two British children and works for the NHS in what the government would call an \u201cunskilled\u201d role. \u201cShe has been cleaning Covid-19 wards and feeding Covid patients\u201d explains Daghlian. \u201cWe clap every Thursday, but she was still expected to pay \u00a32,000 to renew her visa (which expired earlier this month) and \u00a31,000 of that was an NHS surcharge, required on top of her tax and national insurance, to allow her access to the NHS\u201d.</p> <p>Following pressure from all sides, the government last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">dropped the NHS surcharge</a> for all those working in the health service, but it is not yet clear if this is retrospective. And while visas are being automatically renewed for many health workers and some social care staff until October, this does not apply to support staff, such as cleaners and hospital porters.</p> <p>The charity is helping Michelle apply for a fee waiver on grounds of destitution. Her case may be helped by a new court ruling that the <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/21/court-rules-home-office-setting-bar-too-high-for-visa-fee-waivers\">Home Office\u2019s definition of inability to pay is too harsh</a>. Applying for a waiver is complex, says Daghlian, and without support, some destitute migrants simply fail to renew their visas, becoming undocumented migrants with no rights at all \u2013 unable to legally work, rent a room, open a bank account or fully use the NHS.</p> <p>Some migrants are too scared to seek healthcare, says Daghlian. \u201cEveryone is meant to be entitled to GP care and A&amp;E does not turn people away, but a bill may be sent for hospital treatment.

  "<p>Public health experts have warned about the risks of low supplies of coronavirus test kits as lockdowns in African countries begin to ease and urban populations become more mobile.</p> <p>Different countries on the continent have adopted a range of testing strategies, but international competition for test kits and a lack of global coordination of resources have meant many African countries are testing with significantly limited reach.</p> <p>More than half of African countries are experiencing community transmission as lockdown measures relax.</p> <p>Kate Dooley, the director for West Africa at the Tony Blair Institute, said: \u201cMost governments are currently rationing their use of test kits given limited supplies. We are aware of some cases where African governments who placed orders in early March are still yet to receive the supply, six to eight weeks later.\u201d</p> <p>Testing capacity, logistics and staffing challenges posed structural constraints to the ability of many countries to increase testing even when supplies became available, she said. Some countries, such as Nigeria, had been waiting months for deliveries of test kits.</p> <p>There are 112,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Africa, and 3,000 people are confirmed to have died from the virus.</p> <p>Total infections are lower than in most other continents, owing in part to the effectiveness of lockdown and control measures, adopted early by several countries when cases were in their low dozens.</p> <p>According to the World Health Organization, 1.5m Covid-19 tests have been conducted in Africaover the last 6 weeks. South Africa and Ghana account for half of the tests, and just eight African countries have administered more than 3,000 tests per million people.</p> <p>The Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has set up a digital purchasing platform, being piloted this week, to let African governments bulk order test supplies and protective equipment. It is hoped the platform will improve the continent\u2019s negotiating position when bidding for supplies.</p> <p>The ACDC director, Dr John Nkengasong, said last month that \u201ca collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have shoved Africa out of the diagnostics market\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAfrican countries have funds to pay for reagents but cannot buy them,\u201d he added.</p> <p>According to Dr Iruka Okeke, the editor of the African Journal of Laboratory Medicine, gains made by African countries in the early stages of the outbreak could be at risk from a lack of test supplies.</p> <p>\u201cUnless we can vastly ramp up testing we risk entering a stage where it spreads through communities where there isn\u2019t the capability to test them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The prevalence of virus response measures and detection systems in countries that have already experienced deadly viruses has been vital, according to Okeke.</p> <p>\u201cResponses to Ebola, HIV and Lassa fever have improved the level of molecular biology in Africa, which countries have leveraged well. </p> <p>\u201cThe problem is countries were preparing for an epidemic not a pandemic, so now African countries are competing for the same consumable resources as the other countries.\u201d</p> <p>Parts of Ghana\u2019s virus response have emerged as a model in the region. With a population of 29 million, the country has tested almost 200,000 people, one of the highest rates in Africa. The country has registered 6,800 infections with over 2,000 recoveries, while 32 people have died.</p> <p>Ghana has just five laboratories that can test for Covid-19 but has innovated to improve test levels, running laboratories for 24 hours, using drones to deliver samples from rural areas, and testing multiple samples at the same time.</p> <p>Improving the level of testing in Africa\u2019s most populous country has been difficult. Nigeria has 7,800 confirmed infections, with a third recovered and 226 deaths.</p> <p>But according to Dr Casmir Ifeanyi, the president of the Association of Medical and Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria, a medical union, confirmed cases were \u201can underestimation of Covid-19 mobility.</p> <p>\u201cWe have conducted fewer than 40,000 tests. For a country of 200 million where we have community transmission across the country, that is not the sample size to make any deduction about the spread of the virus.\u201d Mass deaths in Kano have put pressure on authorities to increase testing.</p> <p>There are now 25 laboratories that can test for Covid-19, up from five before the first confirmed case in February. But despite a capacity for 2,500 tests a day, Nigeria often administers less than half, hampered by personnel and logistical constraints, particularly in rural and insecure areas.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a very severe situation especially now the government is talking about further easing the lockdown,\u201d Ifeanyi said. \u201cWithout testing this will create problems.\u201d</p>",

She recalls people telling her, \u201cI want to stay here a little because if I go home there is nobody there. I am always lonely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the first year, because it wasn\u2019t known in Ghana, nobody was coming,\u201d says Asomani. It was only after the care home switched their adverts from a local language radio station to an English language station popular with educated professionals that the business started to look up.<br><br>Today, there are seven residents aged between 70 and 89. The home can accommodate up to 10 people, says Mensah. Fees are on average around $250 (\u00a3202) a month depending on the type of care residents need. Apart from hypertension, some of the residents have Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease, or are recovering from strokes.</p> <p>The home has a structured daily routine, with nurses on hand to help with medication, hospital visits and other assisted living services such as grooming. Family visits usually happen at the weekend and there are occasional excursions.<br><br>\u201cWe had one client who had been alone in the house for a long time and in the end, the woman couldn\u2019t talk. But when she came here, she started talking because we were always engaging [with] her,\u201d says Asomani. \u201cWe give them total nursing care. When you come here, you stay as if you are in your house.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bb1df0ff2a6a1843dd3d311d25757d35fe2f09d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bb1df0ff2a6a1843dd3d311d25757d35fe2f09d/0_70_3008_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TV and conversation time at Comfort For The Aged.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TV and conversation time at Comfort For The Aged.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ernest Kodjo Ayikpah</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the three-week coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/03/coronavirus-easing-of-lockdown-a-relief-to-ghanas-poor-despite-fears-it-is-premature\">lockdown of Ghana\u2019s two largest metropolitan areas</a>, staff stayed at the residential home and visitors were banned to prevent the virus from spreading into the home, a restriction that remains in place.</p> <p>Benjamin Ocansey, an electronics technician in Accra, moved his 89-year-old mother from a village in Ghana\u2019s central region to the care home six months ago because of her mobility issues. \u201cIn the rural area, the management of such conditions is next to nothing [but in the care home], she is going to get all those services and the management will be better than when she is on her own in the family home,\u201d he said.<br><br>However, the main challenge is confronting societal perceptions about care homes. \u201c[They are] culturally perceived as a foreign or western concept, which is alien to the Ghanaian culture,\u201d says Dr Delali Adjoa Dovie of the Centre for Ageing Studies at the University of Ghana.</p> <p>One thing nearly all of the residents have in common is that they have previously lived, or their children currently live, in the west.<br><br>Initially, Ocansey\u2019s five younger siblings were not happy about their mother\u2019s move to the home. \u201cThey had no knowledge of how the care system worked so they thought that I was going to dump her somewhere and forget about her,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But after visiting the home, there was a change of mind and some siblings have begun contributing to the monthly costs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3188a43036761590ccb5d73cc1e68d84871a6ebf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3188a43036761590ccb5d73cc1e68d84871a6ebf/0_0_3008_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lois Anim Yirenkyi, a health worker at Comfort For The Aged, talks to one of the home\u2019s residents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lois Anim Yirenkyi, a health worker at Comfort For The Aged, talks to one of the home\u2019s residents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ernest Kodjo Ayikpah</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no government-run care homes for older people and the cost of private care homes puts them out of reach for many Ghanaians struggling to look after ageing parents.

A source likened it to a \u201creading list\u201d or \u201creference paper\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian understands from a source who has read the 15-page document that the material relevant to the Wuhan lab leakage theory makes up only a small portion of the file, and it does not include any conclusive findings.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-26/china-coronavirus-dossier-came-out-of-us-state-department/12282994\">Australian Broadcasting Corporation first reported on Tuesday</a> that the original paper was a background research report compiled and widely distributed by the US state department. The ABC went on to say that the US embassy in Canberra has held private meetings with Australian government officials to clarify the matter.</p> <p> The embassy declined to respond to these claims when contacted by the Guardian on Tuesday.</p> <p>But the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, a longstanding critic of Murdoch\u2019s News Corp empire, told the Guardian: \u201cThese revelations should be utterly humiliating to the Murdoch media, except that the Murdoch media has zero shame.\u201d</p> <p>Rudd says the damage has already been done. He believes the document \u201cwas leaked to News Corp in Australia with the clear intention that it would be funnelled back into the American media, giving the appearance that Australian spies were backing Trump\u2019s claims\u201d. In reality, though, \u201cAustralian intelligence officials don\u2019t believe Trump at all\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Origins of a suspect scoop</strong></h2> <p>The saga began on 2 May when the <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/coronavirus/bombshell-dossier-lays-out-case-against-chinese-bat-virus-program/news-story/55add857058731c9c71c0e96ad17da60\">Saturday version of Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph trumpeted</a> a \u201cWORLD EXCLUSIVE\u201d under the headline \u201cCHINA\u2019S BATTY SCIENCE: Bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d.</p> <p>The journalist, Sharri Markson, noted in the original story that the dossier included a raft of criticisms of China\u2019s \u201cassault on international transparency\u2019\u2019 and concerns about practices at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but she also referred in other paragraphs to an ongoing investigation by Five Eyes intelligence agencies.</p> <p>Those two elements got conflated when the story was picked up and amplified by rightwing media in the US and elsewhere, with many reporting that it was a joint report by western intelligence partners.</p> <p>When Markson was <a href=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6154191641001\">interviewed a few days later on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News</a>, the graphics referred to a \u201cleaked intel dossier\u201d and the US host declared that \u201cthis is the most substantial confirmation of what we suspected that we\u2019ve had so far, and because it\u2019s a multinational effort I think it would be hard to dismiss it as a political document\u201d.</p> <p>Markson told Carlson everything in the document was \u201cfactual\u201d but there were \u201cleftwing sections of the media that don\u2019t want to believe that this virus may have leaked from a laboratory\u201d. She added: \u201cOf course we don\u2019t know that yet, that\u2019s being investigated, but they don\u2019t want to even think about it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would attach no significance to it whatsoever. It\u2019s just a list</p> <footer> <cite>Allan Behm, Australia Institute</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Markson was also interviewed about the story by rightwing Trump backers Sebastian Gorka and Steve Bannon. In the Bannon interview, Markson herself clarified that it was not an intelligence document that formed the basis of her report. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an intelligence dossier,\u201d she told Bannon. \u201cThis is a factual report that builds the western case against China\u2019s cover-up over this virus and it\u2019s a case that China is denying.\u201d</p> <p>It came against the backdrop of claims by Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">that there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the coronavirus came from a lab</a> \u2013 a view that is at odds with the mainstream scientific view about the likely origins.</p> <p>The resulting media coverage in the US was part of a \u201cboomerang effect\u201d, according to one Australian official.</p> <h2><strong>What is the \u2018dossier\u2019?</strong></h2> <p>The Guardian understands the 15-page research paper doesn\u2019t have any markings on it showing who authored it, and nor does it contain any classification markers, but it includes a chronological list of relevant public open-source reporting from 2013 to late April.</p> <p>The document points to published news reports and journal articles about a range of issues including the Chinese officials moving to silence doctors and whistleblowers and the delays in acknowledging human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. The ABC reported it had the status of a \u201cnon-paper\u201d, a document that can be used to trigger discussion or debate with foreign governments.</p> <p>Peter Jennings, the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and a former defence department deputy secretary for strategy, says a \u201cnon-paper\u201d usually means a document that does not have \u201cpolicy weight\u201d behind it.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems very clear that this is not classified intelligence product. It seems to have been a summary of publicly reported information about the outbreak of the virus,\u201d Jennings says.</p> <p>\u201cI would expect that our own departments would be doing precisely the same thing. Often these things are compiled as reading lists for senior officials. This is absolutely routine business for bureaucracies anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Allan Behm, the head of the international and security affairs program at the Australia Institute and a former senior defence official, says the reporting had made \u201ca mountain out of a molehill\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI would attach no significance to it whatsoever. It\u2019s just a list,\u201d Behm says.</p> <p>\u201cI think the net result was to build up a nothing into something and that fed into the kind of shrill hysteria we saw a few weeks ago, and it still echoes.\u201d</p> <p>Behm says from what he knows about the document he doesn\u2019t believe it was created maliciously or represented an attempt \u201cto set Australia up\u201d with dodgy intelligence. Instead it was \u201chyped\u201d up in media reporting.</p> <p>Jennings doesn\u2019t write off the labs theory as a possibility to explain what happened, saying it should continue to be explored, and he argues China\u2019s lack of transparency over the issue \u201cdoesn\u2019t help\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut equally I think a major concern that does seem to have been lost in the discussion of the labs has been about China\u2019s handling of wet markets,\u201d Jennings says.</p> <p>Prof Rory Medcalf, the head of the Australian National University\u2019s national security college, played down the significance of the fact the document was leaked to media, telling the ABC all governments were likely to be \u201ctrying to persuade media organisations of their world view, their policy positions, their perspective\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Overreach\u2019 to help Trump</strong></h2> <p>Rudd, the former prime minister, says the version of reality repeated in news reports around the globe had the side-effect of \u201cpoliticising and discrediting western intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>He argues the dossier was never intended to put pressure on China, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/08/murdoch-media-china-coronavirus-conspiracy-trump-kevin-rudd\">to bolster Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and distract from the US president\u2019s failures</a> to manage Covid-19 at home.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it may have helped Trump, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s overreach has only helped efforts by China to wriggle off the hook for the questions they actually must answer \u2013 including the role of wildlife wet markets, failures to control the virus early on, and dealings with the World Health Organization,\u201d Rudd says.</p> <p>Markson declined to comment, saying she had no intention of speaking about confidential sources, while News Corp Australia did not respond to requests for a response.

  "<p>It is not news that Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings treat rules with contempt. But there is one rule even they might be expected to obey, because it is crucial to the maintenance of power. Never, ever, make the people who place their faith in you feel like fools.</p> <p>Or, to put it another way, never let the people who think they are making a sacrifice realise that in fact they <em>are </em>the sacrifice. Before breaking this rule <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">so flagrantly</a>, Johnson and his consigliere would have done well to consider the fate of what used to be one of the most powerful institutions on these islands: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/23/pope-francis-ireland-irish-catholicsm-catholic-church-abusive-institution\">Irish Catholic </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/23/pope-francis-ireland-irish-catholicsm-catholic-church-abusive-institution\">church</a>.</p> <p>Watching the Cummings road movie made me think, disturbingly enough, of my mother. She was, for almost all of her life, a devout Catholic \u2013 and it\u2019s the \u201calmost\u201d that is most interesting. She was a kind and compassionate woman, and she did not judge other people. But she followed the rules. There was one rule in particular she found awfully hard: the church\u2019s ban on contraception. But she believed in the authority of the church. She made the sacrifices, and did what she was told.</p> <p>I will never forget her rage and disgust when, in her late 70s and early 80s, she discovered that the same church she loved and obeyed had been covering up the sexual abuse of children for decades. She was revolted by those crimes, of course. But she also felt that the bishops had made a mockery of her faith. They made her feel gullible. Her belief that she and the people she looked up to were together in this thing, that they had shared a tough commitment and the pain it involved, had turned out to be a charade.</p> <p>She was not alone. And there was no going back from this moment of betrayal. The authority of the church melted away in the heat of this anger. For while people forgive their leaders a great deal \u2013 often far too much \u2013 there is no forgiveness for that terrible moment when you realise that the anguish you have endured for the greater good was, to those in authority, just a mark of your credulousness and inferiority.</p> <p>If Cummings were half as smart as he is supposed to be, he would have shown in his press conference some glimmer of understanding that this kind of betrayal is of a completely different order to the one he and Johnson engage in so routinely. The ordinary treachery of saying one thing and doing another \u2013 there will be \u00a3350m extra every week for the NHS; there will never be a border in the Irish Sea \u2013 is mother\u2019s milk to them. Perhaps because it is so habitual or because they are so used to getting away with it, their sense of how it works has become dulled. They missed the crucial fact that this time it\u2019s different. This time it\u2019s personal.</p> <p>The mundane duplicity that is Cummings\u2019 and Johnson\u2019s stock in trade comes with a knowing smirk: you didn\u2019t really think we meant that literally, did you? It is part of an elaborate, highly performative, game. But the rules for collective survival in a pandemic are not ironic. They are intimate. They are embodied. They are the detailed texture of the lives we live every day. Like the rule that said Catholics must not use contraceptives, they inhabit people\u2019s most private selves. You mock those selves at your peril.</p> <p>If we were all coolly rational creatures, the reasons why Cummings should not be anywhere near the levers of power in a self-respecting democracy would already have been abundantly clear. His contempt for law and order was obvious from Vote Leave\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/17/vote-leave-fined-and-reported-to-police-by-electoral-commission-brexit\">flouting of funding rules</a> in the 2016 Brexit referendum. His scorn for the very idea that he might be held to ordinary standards of public accountability was amply demonstrated by his literal contempt for a parliamentary committee looking into that abuse. But he got away with that stuff.</p> <p>So why does his odyssey during lockdown produce a whole different kind of emotion? Because it reaches into the innermost experiences of millions of people. It cuts right through to the pain of a loved one dying alone, of grandchildren growing distant, of precious human bonds being forcibly severed. It grabs hold of that torment and it squeezes the meaning out of it.</p> <p>We endure these things individually because we understand ourselves to be also enduring them collectively. Cummings\u2019 actions \u2013 and, even more, Johnson\u2019s valorisation of them \u2013 strip away the second part. The big, communal and institutional structure that gives a value to the millions of individual sacrifices has been kicked away \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s defence of Cummings, the only value is the individual \u201cinstinct\u201d of the members of the ruling caste. To use the Blitz analogy that England apparently cannot escape, it\u2019s fine to leave your lights on during the blackout if you\u2019re an important person with documents to read.</p> <p>As the Catholic church found in Ireland, people don\u2019t forgive this violation of the sense of meaning that gives dignity to their own sufferings. They don\u2019t forgive because they can\u2019t forget. This kind of betrayal is not just an event out there in the public world of media and politics and power. It is an experience that happens to every citizen individually and privately. It is not possible for people to think about it without thinking of love and loss, of the grief they have felt and the intimacies they have foregone. To do so is to hear, as the soundtrack to the images stored from these months in the mind and the heart, an unpardonable snigger of elite condescension.</p> <p>\u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Two days after their first date \u2013 which was also their first meeting \u2013 the comedian Peter Sellers gave Britt Ekland a dachshund puppy called Pepper.</p> <p>Ekland had just arrived in London from Sweden to be 20th Century Fox\u2019s next big star. She was 21 years old and living at the Dorchester hotel; a dog was a ridiculous gift, she says. So was Sellers\u2019 previous largesse \u2013 every bloom in the hotel\u2019s flower shop. \u201cThat was the way he wooed me.\u201d</p> <p>Just 10 days after their first date, Ekland and Sellers \u2013 17 years her senior \u2013 were married, and the puppy was lost in the whirlwind. \u201cAll these years, I always wondered: what happened to Pepper?\u201d says Ekland, now 77. Two weeks ago, she found out. A woman wrote to Ekland\u2019s agent, saying she had taken Pepper, and that he lived a \u201clong and happy life\u201d. Ekland sighs, audibly relieved.</p> <p>Although she lives mostly in Sweden and Los Angeles, Ekland was in the UK touring in the play The Cat and the Canary when the coronavirus hit. She is coping well in lockdown in London, walking her dog and cleaning. But, as a \u201c<em>totally</em> nonessential worker\u201d, life has slowed dramatically.</p> <p>Ekland\u2019s career began when she was a teenager, appearing in chewing gum adverts and doing modelling jobs. She would go on to become one of the most-photographed women of the 1970s: as Sellers\u2019 young bride, Roger Moore\u2019s Bond girl in The Man With the Golden Gun and in high-profile relationships with the record exec Lou Adler and rock stars Rod Stewart, Phil Lewis and Slim Jim Phantom.</p> <p>That she remains so prolific today \u2013 a fixture of reality television, talkshows and the panto circuit \u2013 is down to her work ethic. \u201cIf you want publicity, you\u2019ve got to do something to deserve publicity,\u201d she says.

When Sellers realised, he suggested a trip to the cinema \u2013 to see The Pink Panther, in which he played Inspector Clouseau. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t about you telling him about yourself,\u201d says Ekland. \u201cThis was about him telling you.\u201d</p> <p>His marriage proposal, if you can call it that, was similarly brazen. About a week after they met, Ekland left for New York. Sellers called her. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve told the press we\u2019re getting married. Is that OK with you?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what to say. Even to this day, I don\u2019t know what I said.\u201d</p> <p>Ekland says she wasn\u2019t the type to look for red flags. She describes herself as wilful and \u201cextremely impulsive \u2026 I\u2019m like a steamroller \u2013 I just go forward. I don\u2019t have that stopper in me \u2026 Someone falls down in front of me, then I fall in love with him.\u201d As a teenager in Stockholm, she \u201cfell in love every five seconds\u201d, once writing in her diary in blood while playing Tchaikovsky\u2019s Swan Lake. \u201cYou had a bit of a snog, then it was over, so you wrote in blood,\u201d Ekland says pragmatically, when I bring it up.</p> <p>Her father was delighted when she married Sellers, despite the age gap. \u201cFame overcomes a lot of things,\u201d she says drily. Not that he could have stopped her. She was \u201cdeliriously happy\u201d, \u201cmadly in love\u201d and soon to be a big star.</p> <p>Then, she says: \u201cIt all came crashing down.\u201d Days after their wedding, Sellers flew to Los Angeles for a film and sent her a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/5940486/New-Peter-Sellers-letter-on-marriage-to-Britt-Ekland.html\">three-page letter</a> obsessing that she might leave him or be unfaithful, and saying he wanted to have \u201cviolent\u201d sex with her. It was signed with 25 kisses.</p> <p>Sellers urged Ekland to join him for Easter, waving away her commitments<strong> </strong>to shoot the film Guns at Batasi. She acquiesced. Within days of her arrival in Los Angeles, he had the first of a series of heart attacks. \u201cBy the following Sunday, he was on life support.\u201d Ekland\u2019s parents flew out to join her, and she learned to drive between Sellers\u2019 mansion and the hospital. \u201cI prayed to God a lot, even though I\u2019m not a religious person \u2026 just hoping and believing that he would pull through.\u201d He did, and their daughter Victoria was born in January 1965.</p> <p>By then, Ekland had been fired by Fox for breach of contract for leaving Guns at Batasi, and knew about Sellers\u2019 dark side. In company, he was \u201cthe joker, the fabulous comedian\u201d, she says sarcastically. \u201cHe kept the table going for hours \u2026 everyone loved him: \u2018Such a fun evening!\u2019\u201d The question she has been asked most in her life is: \u201cHow fun was Peter Sellers at home?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"122babbda34d8a93b6537ed9f41e4293bbd8eb9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/122babbda34d8a93b6537ed9f41e4293bbd8eb9e/0_186_2781_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ekland with Rod Stewart in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ekland with Rod Stewart in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, he was \u201cvery possessive and very, very moody\u201d. He would threaten Ekland with divorce, then just as capriciously make up, and fly into jealous rages. The abuse was never physical \u2013 if it had been, Ekland says she \u201cmight have left sooner \u2026 I know that sounds horrible. [But] I\u2019m just being practical.\u201d Did she see the relationship as abusive at all? She hesitates. \u201cWell, I realised it wasn\u2019t right \u2013 someone putting me through emotional and psychological warfare.\u201d</p> <p>Once, Hugh Hefner told Sellers he had nude pictures of Ekland as a ploy to get Sellers, a keen photographer, to supply some himself. Ekland, who was always \u201cvery prudish\u201d, knew it was a bluff. \u201cI never purposely posed half-naked.\u201d Even shooting films, she would cover herself up with black camera tape \u2013 \u201chowever painful it was to take off\u201d. She scoffs to hear herself described as a sex symbol. \u201cI don\u2019t know what a \u2018sex symbol\u2019 is.\u201d<strong><br><br></strong>Sure enough, Hefner\u2019s smoking gun showed Ekland with scarcely a bare shoulder. But Sellers had not believed her. \u201cIt was just horrifying that he should accuse me of something that was so very far from who I was.\u201d</p> <p>No fight was too petty, says Ekland. \u201cIf I spoke to my mother in Swedish, that would be a huge rant for hours, like this \u2026\u201d She mimics an unintelligible, screeching tirade. \u201cHe never took a pause.\u201d Ekland confided in the actor Nanette Newman and her husband, the director Bryan Forbes \u2013 the couple\u2019s closest friends in Hollywood. \u201cOne night, I just got in the car and drove to them to seek shelter \u2026 this continued throughout my marriage.\u201d</p> <p>It all ended as abruptly as it began. After dinner at the Excelsior hotel in Rome, Ekland permitted the paparazzi to take their photograph, enraging Sellers. In their room, his \u201chigh-pitched waffling\u201d went on all night, prompting noise complaints.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cd26faac2ee1f419ac220022d9acb6a617396aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cd26faac2ee1f419ac220022d9acb6a617396aa/0_507_3961_2378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Sellers in the 1965 film After the Fox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Sellers in the 1965 film After the Fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEventually, at 5am, I\u2019d been so traumatised, I couldn\u2019t take any more,\u201d says Ekland. (Some accounts say she took a Valium.) \u201cAnd he suddenly just said: \u2018That\u2019s it. You\u2019re out of here.\u2019\u201d Sellers called the couple\u2019s agent, who took Ekland to another hotel nearby, \u201cwhere I hid until I got the flight to Sweden\u201d. There she was reunited with Victoria, then about five, who had been in the UK with her nanny.</p> <p>Sellers made several efforts to reconcile, but, says Ekland: \u201cI knew that this was it \u2013 I\u2019d had enough.\u201d Only someone \u201cmentally super-strong\u201d could have withstood four years, she adds. They divorced in December 1968.</p> <p>Sellers died of a heart attack in 1980. Although he was never diagnosed, Ekland believes him to have had bipolar disorder. Though she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_92twoB5-h/\">has disputed</a> accounts of Sellers\u2019 alcohol and cocaine dependency, she told the recent BBC Two documentary that he was unable to get help for his mental health problems \u201cbecause he was such a valuable asset\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m the proudest Bond girl there is, because there are not a lot of us left</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ekland has only ever sought help for her mental health once \u2013 in the 80s, after her mother died of Alzheimer\u2019s aged 78. Although she disliked her father, she and her mother were very close. \u201cWherever I worked, she always came.\u201d Ekland was prescribed antidepressants after her loss, but stopped taking them after three days.</p> <p>She is used to getting on with things. \u201cI am so used to taking care of myself, I don\u2019t need anyone to do anything for me.\u201d Her most recent marriage, to the Stray Cats drummer, Slim Jim Phantom, ended after eight years in 1992. After three children by three partners, Ekland was preaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/06/self-partnered-emma-watson-is-right-we-need-more-ways-to-be-single\">\u201cself-partnership\u201d</a> long before Emma Watson, back when there really was a stigma.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a modern woman, and I still am,\u201d says Ekland now. That said, she is scathing of some modern women \u2013 specifically, social media influencers. Without naming names, she says she pities \u201cthose poor Plasticine models \u2026 throwing themselves explicitly over their Instagrams. All that effort, for such little payback.\u201d<br><strong><br></strong>Even Bond girls do not make the same impact today, says Ekland. \u201cI\u2019m the proudest Bond girl there is because there are not a lot of us left, and there won\u2019t be any in future.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/man-with-the-golden-gun-siren-britt-ekland-says-modern-bond-girls-have-tough-time-8168115.html\">has said</a> modern Bond girls have it harder than she did, there now being \u201cso many demands\u201d \u2013 she believes, imposed by political correctness.<br><br>\u201cThe Bond girl has to look good in a bikini: that was her role \u2026 The Bond girl of my era exists no more because they\u2019re not presented that way.

Once outspoken in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/17/healthandwellbeing.celebrity\">her praise of it</a> for over-40s (\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful\u201d), it is now among her biggest regrets thanks to a botched lip procedure in 1994. \u201cExcruciatingly painful\u201d corrective attempts \u201cto try to melt the stuff\u201d injected into her lips have not been quite successful \u2013 as is \u201cconstantly\u201d pointed out on social media, says Ekland exasperatedly. \u201cTo all the people who say: \u2018She\u2019s destroyed her face,\u2019 \u2013 yes! I didn\u2019t do that purposely; I don\u2019t want to look like this, but I have no choice. I\u2019ve learned to live with it, so you\u2019d better learn to live with it.\u201d</p> <p>Until \u201ca few years ago\u201d, Ekland observes ironically, \u201cI was always striving to look older\u201d. She credits her youthful appearance with keeping her from the predation in Hollywood exposed by #MeToo. \u201cI knew that was going on, but I was never in the inner [circles] where it was gossiped about \u2026 men were a little bit intimidated by the naivety of me. I think they\u2019d just look at me and say: \u2018She\u2019s so young \u2013 we can\u2019t touch her.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Today, Ekland is grandmother to seven-year-old Cash and three-year-old Lucas \u2013 born to her second child, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4989393/?ref_=nmbio_trv_5\">Nic Adler</a>, in Los Angeles. Months after he was born, Lucas was found to have <a href=\"https://www.alextlc.org/what-is-a-leukodystrophy/the-different-leukodystrophies/adrenoleukodystrophy-ald/\">adrenoleukodystrophy</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.alextlc.org/what-is-a-leukodystrophy/the-different-leukodystrophies/adrenoleukodystrophy-ald/\">untreatable genetic condition</a> that causes progressive degeneration of the brain in boys and is often terminal. Lucas\u2019s early diagnosis from routine newborn screening in California allowed for early interventions. Ekland has since become a patron for the UK leukodystrophy charity <a href=\"https://www.alextlc.org/britt-ekland-alex-tlc-patron/\">Alex TLC</a> to campaign for the condition to be added to the birth screen in the UK, \u201cso that all these boys have a future\u201d.<br><strong><br></strong>When she will next be able to see her family in person is a concern \u2013 but as ever, Ekland takes a pragmatic view. \u201cI\u2019m very much a person who lives for the day. Today, I feel good, nothing is really horrible \u2026 so: I find that I\u2019m lucky.\u201d For now, her plans are only to write back to the woman who took in her dog 56 years ago, \u201cand find out exactly what happened\u201d. But, says Ekland emphatically, \u201cthe only thing I care about is that Pepper had a <em>wonderful</em> life.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The first time Wael Amr got on a plane was not quite what he had hoped for.

  "<p>My grandma, who lives in Derry, had never been to England until last year, so it was a great honour when she made the trip to London to visit me and my sister, who have both lived on the mainland (in one city or another) for the best part of a decade. We had \u201cgreat craic\u201d during her stay. We went to the big art galleries and museums, which everyone in the UK helps fund through their taxes, but many never get to visit; she accidentally attended a pro-Brexit protest; and she charmed the waiter of a pizza restaurant with what she calls her \u201cDerry eyes\u201d, striking because of their unusual blue and orange-yellow irises, which she has passed down to my mum, my siblings and me. She wore a lime green suit for the duration of her stay, like a very elegant leprechaun.</p> <p>That was almost a year ago and I haven\u2019t seen her in person since. I\u2019m always a bit jealous of people for whom family get-togethers like these aren\u2019t a rarity. As they are for many young people in the UK who grew up outside of the economic hub of the south-east, the job prospects in the region where I\u2019m from are, shall we say, not great. So, like many young people, I moved away for university, then to London for work, and now my life feels awkwardly spread across several versions of home. I don\u2019t see most of my family as much as I\u2019d like and I feel like I move every few years for reasons not totally within my control. Now that a pandemic has prompted this mass experiment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/18/from-boardroom-to-spare-room-the-working-from-home-revolution-coronavirus\">working from home</a>, I have been thinking more about whether it has to be this way.</p> <p>The well-trodden path of young people moving to London was detailed in a 2016 report, the Great British Brain Drain, which found that almost a quarter of all UK graduates from the three previous years were <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/great-british-brain-drain-where-graduates-move-and-why/\">working in London within six months</a> of graduating. Of course, some of those students would have gone to universities in London, but the report looked at movement between regions too. It found that, of graduates who moved from the city where they studied, more than a fifth were working in London within six months. For graduates with a first or a 2:1 from Russell Group universities, this jumped to 38%, and for Oxbridge graduates the figure was more than half.</p> <p>The report discussed this \u201cbrain drain\u201d mostly in terms of the negative economic impact it has on the regions that young people leave, but there is a social and cultural one too, which is harder to quantify. I\u2019ve often thought about this and discussed it with friends in similar positions, but the first time I saw any reference to it written down was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/20/new-model-island-alex-niven-review-mark-fisher\">New Model Island</a>, a book by Alex Niven. In it, he described the \u201cprofound emotional and practical difficulties that come with being uprooted from successive locales\u201d<strong> </strong>experienced by young people from places such as \u201cLiverpool, Newport or Belfast\u201d who move constantly in search of work. It stuck with me because usually this issue is framed only in terms of economics, with no mention of the value of social ties or community. There is an irony here that, while it was Margaret Thatcher who famously declared, \u201cThere is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/state-intervention-agenda-dont-assume-neoliberalism-dead\">neoliberal economic model</a> she pioneered has driven a geographic wedge into families.</p> <p>Young people from London who aren\u2019t born wealthy fare no better (as Niven also points out), as they are forced out of the boroughs they grew up in (if not the city itself) by ever-rising rents. Communities that were formed by working-class immigrants, who have taken care to preserve elements of their cultural heritage, are broken up to make way for renters, who will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/uk-freeze-private-rents-homelessness-coronavirus-labour\">likely be replaced by new renters</a> in a higher salary bracket a few years later. Last week the activist group <a href=\"https://london.eater.com/2020/5/21/21259754/nour-brixton-eviction-hondo-enterprises-brixton-market\">Save Nour</a>, which is campaigning against the eviction of Nour Cash and Carry from Brixton market in south London, released a video in which members of the local community eloquently explained how gentrification had impacted their lives. In this way, London is being hollowed out; a city, as well as a generation, in constant flux.</p> <p>Professional life in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-imbalance-centuries-old-more-than-shaking-money-tree-correct-it\">orbits around the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-imbalance-centuries-old-more-than-shaking-money-tree-correct-it\">south </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-imbalance-centuries-old-more-than-shaking-money-tree-correct-it\">east</a>; and while politicians may speak of the need to regenerate \u201cleft behind\u201d areas in the rest of the country around election time, it seems unlikely that this government will affect meaningful change any time soon. But now the pandemic has prompted this mass experiment in home working, it seems a shift in the relationship between UK geography and job opportunities doesn\u2019t have to be led by the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/pandemic-failings-centralised-state-councils-coronavirus\">The pandemic has exposed the failings of Britain's centralised state | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the UK started taking the coronavirus seriously, in late March, we\u2019ve seen many societal changes that were supposedly logistically impossible implemented quickly and with relative ease. Almost overnight, most people who work in an office were sent home, and it now seems clear that many could do their job remotely, if not all the time, then at least for most it. Several big tech companies (an industry famous for its early adoption of working practices such as flexible hours, free food and the wearing of hoodies by senior staff), including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/facebook-coronavirus-remote-working-policy-extended-years\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52628119\">Twitter</a>, have already said employees will be given the option to work remotely for good. A set-up in which people work from home or a local co-working space and commute to the main office once or twice a month seems feasible for a lot of \u201cknowledge\u201d work, and if this does end up filtering out to other industries it would not be the worst thing for the UK\u2019s regional divide and the rising cost of living in London.</p> <p>I won\u2019t say there would be no drawbacks to the atomisation of the workforce; it may make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/lockdown-union-power-coronavirus\">union organising</a> harder, for example, but it could be a way of starting to transition from a society in which so many elements of our lives are organised around what job we want to do. The neoliberal agenda pursued for the past few decades, in which people are encouraged to maximise their usefulness to private companies and property developers by moving to wherever their skills might be most lucratively deployed, has proven itself to be incompatible with forming or maintaining communities. This could be a chance to reset.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Connolly writes about technology, cultural trends and politics</p>",
  "<p>On 16 March, when Boris Johnson advised people to avoid pubs and theatres, the effect on live comedy was instant. \u201cThat night was like Take Me Out when all the lights go off, but with my diary,\u201d says standup Lauren Pattison. \u201cThe first month of work went in the space of a couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, Pattison finally became a full-time comedian after years of working in restaurants, shops and bars to support her standup career. Soon after, she was nominated for best newcomer at the Edinburgh Comedy awards. Now, she\u2019s working in a supermarket. Pattison had moved back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/04/howay-the-laughs-is-there-a-geordie-sense-of-humour\">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> a few weeks before lockdown to save money for the Edinburgh fringe while living with her parents. Like many standups, she relies on live comedy for the bulk of her income, gigging most nights of the week. Some gigs are rescheduled for later this year, but, says Pattison, \u201cI\u2019ve got to mentally and financially prepare for the fact they might get pulled.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People assume I\u2019m gutted that I\u2019ve had to get a job but to me it\u2019s the most sensible thing to do</p> <footer> <cite>Lauren Pattison</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those without savings or familial financial support, the sudden closure of comedy clubs was troubling. Like Pattison, some already have new jobs. Pope Lonergan has returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/21/comedy-care-home-dementia\">care work</a>, a job he did for eight years until becoming a full-time comedian in 2019. </p> <p>In lockdown, Lonergan started doing livestreams where audience members could pay through tips, but it became clear he needed reliable paid work. After waiting weeks for a new DBS check, he\u2019s now signed up with a care work agency where you can pick shifts at the start of each week. \u201cThat will be really good going back into comedy,\u201d he says. \u201cI think a lot of comedians will be going back with secondary jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Although Lonergan and Pattison miss being on stage, they\u2019re staying positive. \u201cI find it weird that people assume I\u2019m gutted that I\u2019ve had to get a job,\u201d Pattison says. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the most sensible thing to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a51c2b425ba961f7fb00427ef7ad00b120dad323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51c2b425ba961f7fb00427ef7ad00b120dad323/0_1280_3840_4480/857.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s going to be a long time until people can make a living out of live performance\u2019 \u2026 Jacob Hawley\" width=\"857\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s going to be a long time until people can make a living out of live performance\u2019 \u2026 Jacob Hawley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, she\u2019s done stints on the shop floor and customer service helpline and found unexpected upsides. \u201cAt a time when everything is so chaotic,\u201d she says, \u201chaving a set day where I get paid is lovely.\u201d</p> <p>Lonergan, meanwhile, is looking forward to spending time with the care home residents: \u201cI enjoy having a purpose that helps improve the lives of others. And I like to chit-chat the elderly because they always tell me I\u2019m a handsome boy!\u201d</p> <p>Jacob Hawley has been a comedian for six years and went full-time \u2013 his \u201cdream life\u201d \u2013 a year ago. During lockdown, he\u2019s been recording a new BBC podcast, Jacob Hawley\u2019s Job Centre, in which comedians Richard Gadd, Mark Olver and Nish Kumar discuss how work has changed during the pandemic.</p> <p>With two-thirds of his income coming from live work and a baby on the way, Hawley says: \u201cThis podcast came about through necessity \u2013 I had driving job applications up on my browser.\u201d</p> <p>The conversations Hawley is having with guests haven\u2019t always been open subjects between comedians. Who is paying your rent and who has an additional, non-comedy job are often shrouded in secrecy.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started doing standup, I was working in retail, and all I ever wanted to do was stop, because I didn\u2019t feel like a real comedian,\u201d Hawley says. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of shame around that in comedy. That will have to change, because it\u2019s going to be a long time until people can make a living out of live performance again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b6137dc61fae0e422369417d6a11b709b07237a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b6137dc61fae0e422369417d6a11b709b07237a/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I miss feeling like I\u2019ve got a purpose\u2019 \u2026 Tom Mayhew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I miss feeling like I\u2019ve got a purpose\u2019 \u2026 Tom Mayhew</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, secrecy leaves many wondering why they\u2019re falling behind their peers. Pattison says: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think, \u2018How did they climb the ladder so quickly?\u2019 Maybe they didn\u2019t have to work a day job, so of course they\u2019re going to get seen more and get better quicker. If more people were transparent about help they\u2019ve had, it would take the pressure off everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Lonergan agrees: \u201cI would love to look at every comedian\u2019s parents\u2019 bank account. Privilege is a huge thing in comedy. It creates a two-tier system \u2013 the ones who have financial resources can get ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Some comics can\u2019t view their secondary job as a temporary lockdown measure. Sikisa Bostwick-Barnes has always juggled multiple jobs, at times doing 50-plus hours a week as a solicitor, pub worker and comedian, so she could pay student loans and support her parents. This hiatus feels like a step back, with Comedy Store and tour support gigs cancelled. \u201cI had a plan for my career and it all went up in the air,\u201d she says. \u201cMy day job is intense \u2013 I work for a domestic violence charity \u2013 and having something that was creative, fun and social helped my mental health.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35c04b8439f3b0f3b9ba3744fc370fdd656fc0cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c04b8439f3b0f3b9ba3744fc370fdd656fc0cf/0_0_480_720/333.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I had a plan for my career and it all went up in the air\u2019 \u2026 Sikisa Bostwick-Barnes\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had a plan for my career and it all went up in the air\u2019 \u2026 Sikisa Bostwick-Barnes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone is able to work now.

I miss the financial side and feeling like I\u2019ve got a purpose.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s concern that the loss of live comedy could also mean the loss of working-class comics. \u201cThere are more working-class voices on the live circuit than in writers\u2019 rooms or on television,\u201d says Hawley. \u201cLive work was a genuine meritocracy \u2013 anyone could get on stage. It\u2019s not perfect, but it was a more even playing field. That drawbridge has been pulled up.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, says Pattison, working-class comics are used to putting in the extra work that will be needed to make up for lost time. \u201cMy first fringe, I saved every penny of my tips to pay for it,\u201d she says. \u201cI would turn up to gigs still in my uniform.

Pattison says: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of places saying they\u2019re not going to open until next year. In coming months more people will turn to other jobs, which is why I wanted to get in straight away.\u201d</p> <p>With such a long hiatus, this could be a chance for industry-wide change. The recently established <a href=\"https://livecomedyassociation.co.uk/about\">Live Comedy Association</a> is a source of hope. Lonergan has been elected to its steering group. \u201cI want to fight for live comedy and its preservation,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to push to make it more egalitarian.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/14/seriously-funny-political-comedians-mash-report-nish-kumar\">Seriously funny: political comedians on humour in horrific times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The way we value comedy could change, too.

  "<p>The first final after the rebranding of Europe\u2019s premiere club competition as the Champions League took place 27 years ago this Tuesday. It was a stinker. Marseille, who beat Milan 1-0 in Munich, had contested an even grimmer final two years previously, losing the European Cup on penalties to Red Star Belgrade. Two lustreless showpieces are part of the reason why Marseille\u2019s then manager, Raymond Goethals, is seldom recalled as a great outside France and his native Belgium despite an extraordinary career spanning nearly four decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d83416976ac02df19ab3d44ac16f6afeb20e8b04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d83416976ac02df19ab3d44ac16f6afeb20e8b04/0_0_3524_2315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Goethals in the Marseille dugout\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raymond Goethals, with his trademark cigarette, in the Marseille dugout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Stevens/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are other reasons. He was a canny coach and an entertaining character who nearly always had a cigarette in his mouth, with his distinctive hair visibly dyed black , while wearing, most match days, a billowing anorak that superstition forbade him from washing. Goethals tended to be overshadowed during his time at Olympique Marseille, however, by the club\u2019s outrageous owner, Bernard Tapie, who had bought OM in the same week in 1986 that Silvio Berlusconi took over Milan. For years European football was a battleground between two colossal egos seeking a form of validation that they could not get through their business and political conquests. For Tapie, who also fancied himself as an actor, turning Marseille into European champions was \u201clike taking [Jack] Nicholson\u2019s role in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58653dad7bb44357ca9f4263f06355e31a4bf124\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58653dad7bb44357ca9f4263f06355e31a4bf124/0_0_2200_1707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Goethals talking with Bernard Tapie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raymond Goethals and Bernard Tapie in combat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even more significant for Goethals\u2019 legacy, however, is the fact that two of his greatest triumphs \u2013 with Marseille in 1993 and his Belgian title with Standard Li\u00e8ge in 1982 \u2013 were soiled by corruption. He was not implicated in Marseille\u2019s cheating: Tapie and others were sentenced to prison for bribing players from Valenciennes to go easy in their last domestic match before facing Milan. But that scandal bore uncomfortable similarities to Standard\u2019s practice in 1982, when Goethals was found to have helped bribe players from his team\u2019s last domestic challengers, Waterschei, before facing Barcelona in the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final (Bar\u00e7a ultimately beat Standard 2-1). Goethals had to resign from Standard and was banned from working in Belgium for a year. He always denied any wrongdoing and devoted just one short paragraph of his 1994 autobiography to the affair, dismissing it as \u201cpolitical score settling\u201d.</p> <p>There was more than a whiff of the wild west about Belgian football back then. Standard\u2019s nearest pursuers in 1982 were Anderlecht, whom Goethals had previously managed successfully and whose president, Constant Vanden Stock, would later bribe a referee to help them beat Nottingham Forest in the 1984 Uefa Cup semi-finals.</p> <p>For all the murk, Goethals was clearly an excellent coach. He had shown that ever since the end of his so-so goalkeeping career, after which he took a trio of small clubs from obscurity to prominence before, in 1966, being appointed assistant manager of Belgium under Vanden Stock. Two years later Vanden Stock left to move into club administration and Goethals took the top job. He immediately ended Belgium\u2019s 16-year absence from the global stage by guiding them to the 1970 World Cup, then led to third place in the 1972 European Championship.</p> <p>One of Goethals\u2019 many nicknames was \u201cRaymond-La-Science\u201d thanks to his ability to devise tactics to thwart the most gifted opponents; usually the plan involved a high defensive line, meticulous use of the offside trap and clever pressing, ploys he repeated throughout his career, including against Milan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f14d4354fb973d8e4e2acf6a1cd8fc43b09982\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f14d4354fb973d8e4e2acf6a1cd8fc43b09982/0_0_2048_1419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Goethals wearing his unwashed anorak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raymond Goethals wearing his unwashed anorak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mychele Daniau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of his most satisfying feats came at a time when connoisseurs were starting to swoon over the Netherlands\u2019 \u201ctotal football\u201d revolution. Johan Cruyff\u2019s team failed to score home or away against Belgium in the qualifiers for the 1974 World Cup and would not have made it to the tournament if a perfectly good last-minute goal by Belgium in Amsterdam had not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/feb/10/rob-smyth-forgotten-story-holland-belgium\">been wrongly ruled out for offside</a>. The Netherlands squeaked through to the finals on goal difference, as Goethals\u2019 team became the first to fail to qualify for the tournament despite not conceding a single goal.</p> <p>Yet Goethals\u2019 teams could attack. After moving back into the club game he guided Anderlecht to a 4-0 victory in the 1978 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final and two impressive Super Cup wins, a 5-3 aggregate destruction of Bayern Munich in 1976 and a 4-3 defeat of Liverpool in 1978.</p> <p>Then came spells managing in France and Portugal before glory and disgrace with Standard. He was not in the oubliette for long. Racing Jet, in his hometown of Brussels, hired him in 1985 before he left for Bordeaux, where Goethals often made life difficult for Tapie\u2019s Marseille on the pitch and mocked them in the press. So a blissful union was not necessarily on the cards when Tapie asked him to replace Franz Beckenbauer as Marseille manager midway through the 1990-91 season.</p> <p>But they prospered together, even if sparks flew constantly over the next three years. Goethals won three French titles (though the were subsequently stripped of the 1993 one), reached two European finals and was twice ousted as manager without actually being sacked, instead being moved upstairs for a few months before returning to the dugout when his replacements, Tomislav Ivic and Jean Fernandez, fell short of Tapie\u2019s expectations.</p> <p>\u201cI was never sacked in a career lasting nearly 40 years,\u201d Goethals once recalled when asked about his relationship with the tempestuous Tapie. \u201cBut I was shown the door several times a week at Marseille.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/30/daniele-massaro-milan-marseille-barcelona-champions-league\">Daniele Massaro: \u2018The Marseille defeat filled us with grief. But we came back\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goethals was nearly 70 when he stepped into the Marseille cauldron and he was not afraid of Tapie, whom he knew needed him. With few exceptions, notably Eric Cantona, the players affectionately called him <em>papy</em> (grandad) and liked him for his tactical cunning, his humour and the fact that he gave them plenty of freedom outside match days, an important valve that relieved the incomparable pressure of playing for Marseille and Tapie.</p> <p>Marseille were first drawn against Berlusconi\u2019s Milan in the quarter-finals of the 1991 European Cup. Goethals said Tapie rang him near 3am every morning for the next three months to ask: \u201cAre you planning the match?\u201d to which Goethals invariably replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to,\u201d before hanging up. When the first leg at San Siro finally came around, what Goethals and his team did was remarkable.</p> <p>Milan were Europe\u2019s kings, continental champions two years on the trot. Marseille pitched up in Italy with only 14 players instead of the permitted 16, as Goethals omitted Cantona and Jean Tigana, having fallen out with both. \u201cCantona simply did not fit into my team,\u201d he later said, years after being vindicated by the consistently thrilling attacking trident of Chris Waddle, Jean-Pierre Papin and Abedi Pele.</p> <p>The game at San Siro heralded OM\u2019s arrival as a European force. Marseille conceded a sloppy early goal but recovered to control the match in a way visitors never did against Arrigo Sacchi\u2019s lords. Milan escaped with a 1-1 draw.

By the end of 2020, China\u2019s state council expects the total value of the country\u2019s TCM industry to reach about $420bn, according to <a href=\"http://www.scio.gov.cn/37236/38180/Document/1626694/1626694.htm\">a white paper</a> it released four years ago. In China\u2019s TCM capital of Bozhou, Anhui province, the industry is estimated to be worth 109bn yuan ($15bn).</p> <p>The report also indicated that there were 900 million TCM practitioners in 183 countries, and growing.

Three Chinese NGOs and two global organisations <a href=\"https://www.iucncongress2020.org/motion/108\">recently proposed</a> that all members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) support a halt to the use of threatened species in traditional medicine.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.iucncongress2020.org/motion/108\"> proposal</a> was listed by the IUCN and will go before members for approval or debate in January next year.

What we are concerned about is the illegal consumption of highly threatened wildlife, often seen as a delicacy.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that wild meat hunting and consumption is heavily impacting the world\u2019s wildlife, giving rise to what is called \u201cthe empty forest\u201d, where few large mammals remain. A <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160498\">2016 Royal Society paper</a> shows that the bushmeat trade is growing fast, with devastating results. \u201cAs wildlife populations outside protected areas decline, poaching pressure is increasing in many parks and reserves,\u201d say the authors. \u201cAs a consequence many forests, savannahs, grasslands and deserts in the developing world are now becoming \u2018empty landscapes\u2019 devoid of harvest-sensitive wild mammals.\u201d</p> \n<p>What has changed over 50 years, say scientists, is the scale of the commercial wild meat trade. In the past, local subsistence hunters killed animals in small numbers. Today a high-volume industry supplies fast-expanding Asian and African cities. No longer run by local hunters, it is helped by modern firearms and cellphones, and utilises a vast network of new roads driven deep into forest concessions by the international logging industry. Hunters can strip a forest or wetland in a few nights and access home and export markets for their meat. And as the forests are emptied of their animals, the price of wild meat soars and it becomes a luxury commodity for urban elites.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674/0_0_4134_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead pangolins seized by authorities in Belawan, North Sumatra.

I am not saying that people should not eat wild animals [but] there is not enough to go round any more. Commercialisation is the problem. The first priority must be to stop the commercial markets. They can\u2019t go on. Practices that originated hundreds of years ago have to stop. The amount it would cost to provide chicken and farmed fish to everyone [in Africa] is negligible compared to what this pandemic is costing.\u201d</p> \n<p>But critics of a ban say that the legal wildlife meat trade employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides protein for between 30 million and 70 million people in Africa alone and kills few threatened, or rare animals.</p> \n<p>What about the environmental impacts of farming? According to a <a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">major 2011 study</a> led by Robert Nasi, director general of the Center for International Forestry Research (Cifor), a switch to cattle to provide protein in place of wild animals would have huge impact.</p> \n<p>Hunters, says Nasi, take about <a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">4.5m tonnes of bushmeat a year from forests in the Congo </a><a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">basin and </a><a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">possibly 1.299</a><a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">m tonnes in the Amazon</a>. \u201cWe would need to transform large areas of tropical forests or savannas into pasture to replace [this amount of] bushmeat by cattle. For comparison, Brazilian beef production is considered responsible for about 50m hectares [124m acres \u2013 twice the size of the UK] of deforestation. If bushmeat consumption in the Congo basin was to be replaced by locally produced beef, an area as large as 25 m hectares might have to be converted to pastures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Factory farming has devastating effects on wildlife, says Philip Lymbery, director of UK-based <a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/\">Compassion in World Farming</a>. \u201cIt is a main driver of wildlife decline and the destruction of the world\u2019s remaining wild lands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping animals caged in sheds, which sounds efficient but you have to devote vast areas of land to grow their feed. It drives encroachment into wild lands and the destruction of habitats.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would cause unimaginable suffering to the animals, and even more environmental devastation. It would also create the perfect breeding ground for the next pandemic. Factory farming and pandemics are strongly linked.

You can\u2019t just say to people: \u2018You can\u2019t do it any more.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Wildlife hunting bans mostly fail, says Stephanie Brittain, who spent five years in Cameroon researching bushmeat consumption and now works with Oxford University\u2019s Interdisciplinary Centre for Conservation Science. After the 2013\u201316 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, she says, bans were brought in by several countries but could not be policed. The result was <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730758X\">a marked increase</a> in hunting for wild meat. \u201cThere [is] no conclusive evidence that banning the wildlife trade will prevent the emergence of zoonotic diseases in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cThe legal trade for species that can be safely harvested can facilitate improved hygiene and animal welfare, while complete bans can drive trade underground, resulting in illegal markets with lower hygiene regulation and increased risk of disease transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for the idea that disease is more likely to accompany wild meat, experts point out that illnesses like Mers and Sars, BSE, swine and bird flu, E coli, MRSA and salmonella, originated in intensive poultry, pig and livestock farms where the overuse of antibiotics and unhygienic conditions can spread disease quickly. Many are common. According <a href=\"https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2017/\">to the OIE</a>, the World Organisation for Animal Health, there are currently more than 25 outbreaks of H5 and H7 avian flu having to be controlled in more than 20 countries, including the US, Germany, India and Saudi Arabia. Any one, if unattended by vets, could develop into an epidemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIntensive farming is an area that must also be looked at\u201d, says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at Liverpool University. \u201cAs we select for better milk cows, better beef cows or better egg-laying chickens, we create populations of animals that often live in intensive conditions, but where the genetics are very similar. This creates risks for [the] emergence of diseases, because if these genetically uniform large populations are susceptible, things can spread very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ed8205adf6e85bcd80bdd6ceaecd173de363fac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed8205adf6e85bcd80bdd6ceaecd173de363fac/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Congo, part-time hunters boost their income with bushmeat.

In the UK we like farmers\u2019 markets with fresh cornfed chickens, farm-sourced meats and nice looking sausages. That\u2019s basically a wet market, though in a different cultural context. They are essential to bring fresh food to urban populations, and provide for the food security of millions of people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey do need to be regulated and controlled. They should not be blanket banned, as that is not sensitive to the needs of their clients who depend on them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Conservationists are struggling to diminish consumption of wild animals through behaviour campaigns, legislation and law enforcement \u2013 especially in urban Africa, says Congo analyst <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/author/Theodore-Trefon\">Theodore Trefon</a>, a researcher at the Belgian Royal Museum for central Africa.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany consumers [there] believe that eating bushmeat is quite simply normal, respectful of tradition, healthy, desirable and commonsensical,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a well-known challenge to wildlife conservationists but one that is relatively new to public health experts confronted by known and yet-to-come zoonotic diseases.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>This piece was edited on 27 May 2020 to clarify Stephanie Brittain\u2019s experience in Cameroon and correct the name of her institution</em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cWe call it \u2018strange school\u2019,\u201d says Caitlin, 15, slightly raising her voice across the the open space of the school hall where the pupils are carefully observing physical distancing. \u201cLiterally everything here is different now.\u201d </p> <p>Since lockdown, Caitlin has been coming to school five days a week, as she is among those whose schooling is considered a priority. With three younger siblings at home, she has to take on \u201ca lot of responsibility for helping out\u201d. Even in normal times, school is a haven for her. Over the past seven weeks it has become even more than that: an oasis of calm.</p> <p>Rednock secondary is a specialist science college in the small market town of Dursley, Gloucestershire. This is not the affluent north Cotswolds of honeyed stone cottages, and the school is a typical comprehensive. Usually 1,500 students troop through its gates every morning. Today, 42 pupils are in.</p> <p>At the moment there is one teacher to four students, which means pupils such as Caitlin can be given unprecedented tailored pastoral and academic support, without the usual pressures of time. \u201cI think without school right now I\u2019d be an emotional mess,\u201d Caitlin says with a nervous smile. \u201cIt\u2019s my GCSEs and I\u2019m worried \u2013 we\u2019re missing a massive chunk of learning. But I\u2019ve had a teacher to help me whenever I\u2019ve wanted. It\u2019s given me that extra confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Here at Rednock, pupils have been encouraged to try a huge range of new creative and practical activities: knitting, Zumba, TikTok, baking, kite-making and sign language.</p> <p>The school has ripped up timetables in a way no state school could normally contemplate. \u201cWe\u2019ve said, we will be completely flexible to your needs,\u201d says Kerala Cole, assistant headteacher. \u201cWe work in partnership with parents to personalise the deal for the students. It can be that they come in for just a couple of hours. And I think we are seeing huge benefits to that.\u201d</p> <p>One boy who had refused to attend for eight months, has been coming in every day, thanks to this flexibility and the attention he can now be given. Another year 8 child, \u201cwho arrived midway through this year and has been struggling \u2026 he\u2019s been attending for four weeks now and he\u2019s really benefited\u201d, says Cole. \u201cYou can just see how his shoulders have relaxed.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://epi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Closing-the-Gap_EPI-.pdf\" title=\"\">gap in GCSE results</a> between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and the rest is thought to be around 19 months and, without changes in policy priorities, at the current rate it will take 50 years to close, according to the Education Policy Institute thinktank.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a550ff529c89e87f687129c804198c3b24ee796\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a550ff529c89e87f687129c804198c3b24ee796/0_117_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a child on his own in a classroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">School is now \u2018quieter\u2019 and \u2018calmer\u2019, the children say - \u2018it\u2019s more relaxed\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Shepherd/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many fear children will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/27/schools-shutdown-likely-to-widen-attainment-gap-says-ofsted-chief\">fall even further behind</a> during the pandemic, one reason the government gives for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/government-rows-back-on-1-june-english-primary-schools-reopening-plan\">wanting to reopen schools</a> to more pupils by 1 June.

But to these children, a caring school has never felt as much of a reality as it does now. There is no testing or targets, no pressure to achieve academically. They feel adults are there for them. And despite the immense stresses and limitations of living in a time of pandemic, they are blossoming.</p> <p><em>* All children\u2019s names have been changed.</em></p>",
  "<p>In 1906 in England, literature was dominated by the well-behaved worlds of novelists such as Arnold Bennett, EM Forster and John Galsworthy. At the same time in Italy, Marta Felicina Faccio, who later became a leading feminist, published her first book under the pseudonym Sibilla Aleramo. <em>A Woman</em> is a groundbreaking, earthquaking vision, a story and a manifesto, and a literary performance so energetic it almost demands to be read aloud.</p> <p>As a child, the narrator \u2013 who is unnamed, though the novel is essentially a memoir of Aleramo\u2019s early life \u2013 worships her father and disregards her mother: which is where the trouble begins. How could it be otherwise? Her father is the source of knowledge, of money, of all that seems valuable; her mother is \u201creadily prone to tears, while my father could not bear the sight of them\u201d. When the family moves from Milan to southern Italy, things get worse. In a shocking, disorienting scene, her mother tries to take her own life and never fully recovers.</p> <p>The girl\u2019s own struggles have barely begun. Helping in her father\u2019s factory at the age of 15, she attracts the attention of a worker, who rapes her. This overturns her thinking to the point that she wonders, \u201cDid I belong to this man now?\u201d, ultimately marries him, and they later have a son together. Yet it is from this experience that she begins to see that the self often works against its own interests; that by favouring her father over her mother \u201cI had never stopped to imagine my future life as a woman\u201d. It leads to a suicide attempt of her own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Readers who like to underline striking passages will need to keep their pencils sharp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But from this crisis comes an awakening, delivered in prose that ascends to a higher and higher pitch, eventually leaping out with such force that the words almost crash on to the opposite page. \u201cBlessed tears! At last I had got a hold of myself; at last I had accepted the hard task of walking alone, of struggling alone, of bringing into the light everything within me that was unpolished, beautiful and strong.\u201d Readers who like to underline striking passages will need to keep their pencils sharp.</p> <p>The narrator\u2019s desire to progress \u201calone\u201d is a challenge not just to marriage but to parenthood \u2013 \u201cthe mother in me could not be reconciled with the whole woman\u201d \u2013 and she finally understands her own mother, who had experienced precisely the same difficulty. \u201cWhy,\u201d she says, delivering the book\u2019s central message, \u201cdo we idealise self-sacrifice in mothers? Where does this inhuman idea of maternal self-immolation come from? It has been passed down from mother to daughter for centuries. It has produced a monstrous causal chain.\u201d</p> <p>As the title suggests, <em>A Woman</em> (in a new translation by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre; the book has been out of print since 1982) seeks to be both individual and universal, and its influence echoes still. The chain image was adopted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a> in her novel <em>The Lost Daughter</em>: \u201cAll the hopes of my youth seemed to have been destroyed, I seemed to be falling backward toward my mother, my grandmother, the chain of mute, angry women I came from.\u201d</p> <p>This is a human story as well as a political one, and there is the blackest of comedy in scenes where, following her suicide attempt, the narrator\u2019s sister-in-law asks her to sign a legal statement confirming that her husband was not to blame. But the greatest sadness comes when the tension between motherhood and \u201cthe better self that I had neglected\u201d causes an inevitable crisis, revealing the book\u2019s purpose. Aleramo left her son when he was aged six, in 1902, and wrote <em>A Woman</em> \u201cso that my words will reach him\u201d.

Not until October 2022, or possibly September 2023 depending on any second or third waves of the virus, will the rate return to 87%. The forecasts assume, perhaps optimistically, availability of a vaccine by May 2021.</p> <p>While a drop of eight percentage points may not seem dramatic, operating surpluses lie mainly in that margin.

Some <a href=\"https://www.carehomeprofessional.com/first-care-homes-close-due-to-coronavirus-impact/\">\u201ctemporary\u201d closures</a> are already occurring.</p> <p>For homes that can survive to 2022, however, the long-term picture may be much rosier. Carterwood is projecting occupancy rates <a href=\"https://www.carterwood.co.uk/latest-covid-19-research-care-home-occupancy-to-recover-in-2-years/\">at or exceeding 90%</a> by the end of 2024 and <a href=\"https://www.knightfrank.com/\">Knight Frank</a> believe the market will be at full capacity by 2029. Investors behind the big providers will be tempted to hold their nerve and soak up short-term losses. One reason for this is<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/august2019\"> simple demographics</a> \u2013 the number of people aged 85 or over is set to double over the next 25 years \u2013 but another is lack of alternatives to residential care.</p> <p>That is not to say there are no alternatives. Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/31/take-care-of-your-elderly-mothers-and-fathers-says-tory-minister\">periodic ministerial exhortations</a>, experts agree that the UK is not about to undergo a cultural revolution and resume large-scale caring for older people within the extended family home. But there are other care models more commonly found in other countries.</p> <p>One such model is live-in care, where a full-time care worker moves in to share the home of the older or disabled person. <a href=\"https://www.promedica24.co.uk/\">Promedica24</a>, Europe\u2019s leading provider of the service, claims its popularity in Germany has been a key factor in that country\u2019s relatively low level of Covid-19 infection. But with charges of \u00a3700 a week for the most basic package, in addition to living costs and accommodating the care worker, it is hard to see it as anything other than a niche solution.</p> <p>More promising is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/19/extra-care-housing-older-people\">\u201cextra care\u201d</a>, also known as \u201cretirement communities\u201d, in which older people have their own flat \u2013 either leasehold or rental \u2013 with communal facilities and on-site care support. These schemes went early into lockdown, with communal areas closed but extra services such as food delivery and daily check calls introduced. <a href=\"https://www.arcouk.org/\">Arco</a>, the sector\u2019s trade body, says Covid-19 infection rates among its members have been very low, with the \u201cvast majority\u201d having only isolated cases and no outbreaks.

But the sector remains small: according to Arco, just 75,000 people or 0.6% of all those aged 65 or over in the UK live in extra-care housing, compared to 6.1% in the US, 5.4% in New Zealand and 4.9% in Australia. Finding sites and getting planning consent is difficult and it can take seven years to get a scheme from conception to completion.</p> <p>There are other options, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/03/co-living-the-end-of-urban-loneliness-or-cynical-corporate-dormitories\">co-housing</a> to intensive community support, which offer alternatives to life in a care home for people seeking more than drop-in domiciliary help. In the chastening aftermath of Covid-19, or at least its first wave, all should be thoroughly evaluated and, where proven, given central and local government backing to grow.

The prime minister\u2019s defence of Dominic Cummings\u2019 rule-flouting is no Westminster bubble brouhaha, but it drives right to the heart of voters\u2019 lived experience. Typhoid Dom and Mary escaped London at peak infection, within talking distance of parents while others pined for family. </p> <p>By clinging on, both Cummings and his leader expose an alienation from public sentiment, after nine weary weeks of isolation with so much grief and ruin. But they have opted to take on a flock of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/bishops-turn-on-boris-johnson-for-defending-dominic-cummings\">bishops</a>, police, medics, scientists and a flotilla of Tory MPs whose inboxes overflow with public indignation. Any minister would have been rapidly expelled. This is no mere storm in a Westminster bubble: illegally shutting down parliament and lying to the Queen did Boris Johnson no harm in the election because few voters felt personally prorogued. But this is personal.</p> <p>For as long as Cummings stays, Johnson is damaged, burning through political credit when he has very little to spare, sliding in polls that show <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/05/23/56b74/2\">52% of voters calling for Cummings to go</a>, only 28% to stay. We know Johnson to be a man without loyalty \u2013 not to friend, lover or family, faithful only to himself. So why is Cummings indispensable?</p> <p>This exposes the weakness and dependency of a prime minister who is only an empty frontman, entirely unfit and unwilling to shoulder the job\u2019s heavy lifting, relying dangerously on a svengali who has persuaded him of his genius. But as long as Johnson cleaves to him, he looks the servant not the master.</p> <p>Look what else looms as a flurry of devastating analyses of Johnson\u2019s mishandling of the epidemic emerges, even from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/25/daily-mail-cummings-challenge-uk-pm-conservative-newspaper-boris-johnson\">his Tory press</a>. As infections doubled every three days there were \u201c38 days when Britain sleepwalked into disaster\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/boris-johnson-sunday-times-prime-minister-coronavirus\">Sunday Times found</a>, excoriating a lockdown delay that \u201ccost thousands of lives\u201d. Blithely Johnson ordered \u201cbusiness a usual\u201d, boasting in true Trumpian style on 2 March that Britain was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-51706391/coronavirus-pm-boris-johnson-says-the-uk-is-well-prepared\">very, very well prepared</a>\u201d, with \u201cfantastic testing systems\u201d and \u201camazing surveillance of the spread of the disease\u201d. Radio 4\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qshd\">More or Less</a> has just demolished the daily lies on testing. It has never been anywhere near 100,000 people a day \u2013 in fact, barely half that, once duplicate tests and non-tests are deducted.</p> <p>Cummings doesn\u2019t matter. What really matters is the damage done to trust in future official coronavirus messages. This week Johnson will relax the rules further, partly bowing to pressure from the impatient right wing of his party. Persuading people to stick to more complicated rules will be hard while gradually easing out of lockdown.</p> <p>I talked to an experienced contact tracer, now working on the Covid-19 track-and-trace scheme: she describes the chaos of its overcentralised non-functioning computerised system which will certainly not be up and running by next Monday, let alone fulfil Johnson\u2019s fatuous promise of a \u201cworld-beating\u201d system.</p> <p>But here\u2019s what worries her most. She will be cold-calling people with no symptoms to order them to strictly home-isolate for 14 days, just as everyone else is easing up. If Cummings couldn\u2019t obey this, even with florid infection in his family, how much harder will it be to convince others not infected?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/explain-apologise-move-on-johnson-statement-dominic-cummings\">Explain, apologise, move on: what Johnson should have said about Dominic Cummings | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe know there are mountain ranges of surges ahead of us each time there\u2019s an easing of rules.

Freedom from lockdown means chasing down every new Covid-19 case, commanding rigid obedience from all they\u2019ve contacted, even those who can barely remember meeting the infected person. By defending Cummings, Johnson has demolished a sense of moral obligation, undermining the public spirit that says \u201cI will if you will\u201d. He has allowed us all to follow our \u201cinstinct\u201d, not the contact tracers\u2019 instructions.</p> <p>In a cry of despair, Prof Stephen Reicher, of the Sage behavioural insights subcommittee, says: \u201cBoris Johnson has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReicherStephen/status/1264606173212409857\">trashed all the advice</a> we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19.\u201d </p> <p>A government with a majority of 80 is rock solid. But a Tory prime minister is never safe. Leaders in this ruthless party last only so long as they remain winners. After the outrage over her poll tax, even Margaret Thatcher fell under their undying lust for power. It\u2019s an impulse that keeps Conservatives in office most of the time \u2013 and one which Labour often lacks.</p> <p>The tens of thousands of lives needlessly lost during Johnson\u2019s cavalier handling of the epidemic will weigh heavily on his premiership from now on. Indulging one of his own to disobey rules that everyone else followed may linger long in public memories too. They will hope this blows away, but I suspect it will leave behind political scars \u2013 yet another signal that we are never \u201call in this together\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>The summer of 1952 was hot, even by Texas standards: 25 days above 100F (38C), the \u201ccool\u201d days not much cooler. But across the state, swimming pools were shut. Cinemas, too, and bars and bowling alleys. Church services were suspended. Cities doused their streets with DDT insecticide; by now, health officials knew that mosquitoes didn\u2019t spread the disease, but they had to be seen to be doing something. Nothing seemed to work. As the summer wore on, the numbers of polio cases grew.</p> <p>One day in July, in a quiet Dallas suburb, a six-year-old boy named Paul Alexander was playing outside in the summer rain. He didn\u2019t feel well \u2013 his neck hurt, his head pounded. Leaving his muddy shoes in the yard, he walked barefoot into the kitchen, letting the screen door slam behind him. When his mother looked up at his feverish face, she gasped. She made him run out and grab his shoes, then ordered him to bed.</p> <p>Paul spent the first day in his parents\u2019 bed, filling in Roy Rogers colouring books. But even as his fever soared and aching pains blossomed in his limbs, the family doctor advised his parents not to take him to hospital. It was clear that he had polio, but there were just too many patients there, the doctor said. Paul had a better chance of recovering at home.</p> <p>Over the next few days, the boy\u2019s condition worsened. Five days after he had walked into the kitchen barefoot, Paul could no longer hold a crayon, speak, swallow or cough. His parents rushed him to Parkland hospital. Though the staff were well trained and there was a dedicated polio ward, the hospital was overwhelmed. There were sick children everywhere, and nowhere to treat them all. Paul\u2019s mother held him in her arms and waited.</p> <p>When the boy was finally seen by a doctor, his mother was told that there was nothing to be done for him. Paul was left on a gurney in a hallway, barely breathing. He would have died had another doctor not decided to examine him again. This second doctor picked him up, ran with him to the operating theatre and performed an emergency tracheotomy to suction out the congestion in his lungs that his paralysed body couldn\u2019t shift.</p> <p>Three days later, Paul woke up. His body was encased in a machine that wheezed and sighed. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t speak. He couldn\u2019t cough. He couldn\u2019t see through the fogged windows of the steam tent \u2013 a vinyl hood that kept the air around his head moist and the mucus in his lungs loose. He thought he was dead.</p> <p>When the tent was eventually removed, all he could see were the heads of other children, their bodies encased in metal canisters, nurses in starched white uniforms and caps floating between them. \u201cAs far as you can see, rows and rows of iron lungs. Full of children,\u201d he recalled recently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e50eda9dc218c47b29aee55b8f61e889d817c54b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e50eda9dc218c47b29aee55b8f61e889d817c54b/0_0_2550_1971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in iron lungs during a polio outbreak in the US in the 1950s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"773\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children in iron lungs during a polio outbreak in the US in the 1950s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next 18 months were torture. Although he couldn\u2019t talk because of the tracheotomy, he could hear the cries of other children in pain. He lay for hours in his own waste because he couldn\u2019t tell the staff he needed to be cleaned. He nearly drowned in his own mucus. His parents visited almost every day, but his existence was unrelentingly boring. He and the other children tried to communicate, making faces at each other, but, Paul said: \u201cEvery time I\u2019d make a friend, they\u2019d die.\u201d</p> <p>Paul recovered from the initial infection, but polio left him almost completely paralysed from the neck down. What his diaphragm could no longer do for him, the iron lung did. Paul lay flat on his back, his head resting on a pillow and his body encased in the metal cylinder from the neck down. Air was sucked out of the cylinder by a set of leather bellows powered by a motor; the negative pressure created by the vacuum forced his lungs to expand. When the air was pumped back in, the change in pressure gently deflated his lungs. This was the regular hiss and sigh that kept Paul alive. He could not leave the lung. When medical staff opened it to wash him or manage his bodily functions, he had to hold his breath.</p> <p>What Paul remembers most vividly about the ward is hearing the doctors talk about him when they walked through on their rounds. \u201cHe\u2019s going to die today,\u201d they said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d It made him furious. It made him want to live.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>In 1954, when Paul was eight, his mother got a call from a physical therapist who worked with the March of Dimes, a US charity dedicated to eradicating polio. Paul\u2019s months on the polio ward had left him with a fear of doctors and nurses, but his mother reassured him, and so the therapist, Mrs Sullivan, began visiting twice a week.</p> <p>Paul told the therapist about the times he had been forced by doctors to try to breathe without the lung, how he had turned blue and passed out. He also told her about the time he had gulped and \u201cswallowed\u201d some air, almost like breathing. The technique had a technical name, \u201cglossopharyngeal breathing\u201d. You trap air in your mouth and throat cavity by flattening the tongue and opening the throat, as if you\u2019re saying \u201cahh\u201d for the doctor. With your mouth closed, the throat muscle pushes the air down past the vocal cords and into the lungs. Paul called it \u201cfrog-breathing\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3fca8160357d42749d61ba6078e97f14f23620e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fca8160357d42749d61ba6078e97f14f23620e3/0_709_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Alexander in his iron lung at home in Dallas Texas September 12, 2019,\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Alexander in his iron lung.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sullivan made a deal with her patient. If he could frog-breathe without the iron lung for three minutes, she\u2019d give him a puppy. It took Paul a year to learn to do it, but he got his puppy; he called her Ginger. And though he had to think about every breath, he got better at it. Once he could breathe reliably for long enough, he could get out of the lung for short periods of time, first out on the porch, and then into the yard.</p> <p>Although he still needed to sleep in the iron lung every night \u2013 he couldn\u2019t breathe when he was unconscious \u2013 Paul didn\u2019t stop at the yard. At 21, he became the first person to graduate from a Dallas high school without physically attending a class. He got into Southern Methodist University in Dallas, after repeated rejections by the university administration, then into law school at the University of Texas at Austin. For decades, Paul was a lawyer in Dallas and Fort Worth, representing clients in court in a three-piece suit and a modified wheelchair that held his paralysed body upright.</p> <p>At a time when disabled people were less often seen in public \u2013 the Americans With Disabilities Act, which banned discrimination, wouldn\u2019t be passed until 1990 \u2013 Paul was visible. Over the course of his life, he has been on planes and to strip clubs, seen the ocean, prayed in church, fallen in love, lived alone and staged a sit-in for disability rights. He is charming, friendly, talkative, quick to anger and quick to make a joke.</p> <p>At 74, he is once again confined to the lung full-time. Only one other person in the US still uses one. The last person to use an iron lung in the UK died in December 2017, at the age of 75. No one expected someone who needed an iron lung to live this long. And after surviving one deadly epidemic, Paul did not expect to find himself threatened by another.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>Poliomyelitis kills by suffocation \u2013 not by damaging the lungs, as Covid-19 does, but by attacking motor neurons in the spinal cord, weakening or severing communication between the central nervous system and the muscles. The ensuing paralysis means that the muscles that make it possible to breathe no longer work.</p> <p>Polio existed in isolated outbreaks around the world for millennia, but it didn\u2019t become epidemic until the 20th century \u2013 helped, ironically, by improvements in sanitation. Poliovirus enters the body through the mouth, via food or water, or unwashed hands, contaminated with infected faecal matter. Until the 19th century, almost all children would have come in contact with poliovirus before the age of one, while they still enjoyed protection from maternal antibodies transferred from mother to baby during pregnancy. However, as sanitation improved, children were less likely to come into contact with poliovirus as babies; when they encountered it as older children, their immune systems were unprepared.</p> <p>In the US, from 1916 onwards, each summer brought an epidemic of polio in some part of the nation. At its peak in the 40s and 50s, the virus was responsible for more than 15,000 cases of paralysis in the US each year. During this same period, it killed or paralysed at least 600,000 people annually worldwide. The year Paul contracted the virus, 1952, saw the largest single outbreak of polio in US history: almost 58,000 cases across the nation. Of those, more than 21,000 people \u2013 mostly children \u2013 were left with varying degrees of disability, and 3,145 died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29cbe4e7f8e1521d2d01cf916d2306b6b86f5231\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cbe4e7f8e1521d2d01cf916d2306b6b86f5231/62_1431_4052_5065/800.jpg\" alt=\"A caregiver adjusts Paul\u2019s head rest as he lies in an iron lung in his apartment in Dallas, Texas.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A caregiver adjusts Paul\u2019s head rest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though polio was not the most lethal of epidemic diseases, it transformed everywhere it touched. \u201cIt was like the plague, it drove everybody mad,\u201d Paul told me when I first spoke to him last year. In places where outbreaks occurred, families sheltered in fear at home with the windows shut. All kinds of public gathering places closed. Human interactions were laced with uncertainty. According to the historian David Oshinsky, some people refused to talk on the phone out of concern that the virus could be transmitted down the line. During the first major outbreak in New York in 1916, 72,000 cats and 8,000 dogs were killed in one month after a rumour went around that animals transmitted the disease (they don\u2019t). By the 40s, parents had their children perform \u201cpolio tests\u201d every day during the summer \u2013 touch their toes, tuck their chin to their chests, checking for pain or weakness \u2013 while insurance companies sold \u201cpolio insurance\u201d to parents of new babies.</p> <p>Before the arrival of a vaccine in 1955, what made polio so terrifying was that there was no way of predicting who would walk away from an infection with a headache, and who would never walk again. In most cases, the disease had no discernible effect. Of the 30% or so who showed symptoms, most experienced only minor illness. But a small proportion, 4-5%, exhibited serious symptoms, including extreme muscular pain, high fever and delirium. As the virus hacked its way through the neural tissue of the spinal cord, a few of those infected were paralysed; this progression of the virus was known as paralytic polio. Roughly 5-10% of patients who caught paralytic polio died, although this number was far higher in the days before widespread use of the iron lung.</p> <p>If we had forgotten the terror of epidemics, we are now being forcibly reminded. The last time I spoke to Paul, in April, it was over Skype, from our respective lockdowns \u2013 him in his iron lung in an apartment in Dallas, with a rotating staff of full-time carers and an Amazon Echo next to his head, and me in my house in Surrey, England.</p> <p>Like polio, Covid-19 can be transmitted by silent carriers who don\u2019t know they have it. Like polio, it has put normal life on hold. And just as with polio, we are pinning our hopes on a vaccine. There is even talk of bringing back the iron lung \u2013 a UK-based <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-04-07/cambridge-engineers-working-on-new-design-of-iron-lung/\" title=\"\">initiative</a> is trying to bring a new negative-pressure ventilator called Exovent to hospitals for Covid-19 patients. Unlike positive-pressure ventilators, this smaller iron lung would fit over the patient\u2019s chest, allowing them to remain conscious, speak, eat and take medication orally as a machine breathes for them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the way it was, it\u2019s almost freaky to me,\u201d Paul said of the parallels between polio and Covid-19. \u201cIt scares me.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>Though this virus, if he gets it, will likely kill him, life hasn\u2019t changed dramatically for Paul since the start of the pandemic. He hasn\u2019t been able to venture outside of his lung for more than five minutes in years. As one of his friends told me: \u201cIt\u2019s not a strain for him, it\u2019s his life. This is Mr Shelter-in-Place.\u201d I asked Paul if he is worried about Covid-19. \u201cSure, sure,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cWell \u2013 I don\u2019t sit around and worry about it. I\u2019m dying a lot. It doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</p> <p>Paul\u2019s health has always been precarious, but it has declined in the past few years. When I first met him in May 2019, he was a long-term inpatient at Clements Hospital in north Dallas. More than four months earlier, he had developed a persistent respiratory infection, which had sent him to hospital. He also suffers pain in his legs every time he is moved. He had hoped the doctors could help him manage that pain, but, he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s not about to go away,\u201d looking up from a pillow on a wide board attached to one end of the lung. His voice is slow, raspy and sometimes punctuated by gasps. Hearing Paul over the machine\u2019s constant sighs requires the listener to focus on him and tune out the lung; accordingly, he is used to being listened to.</p> <p>Next to Paul\u2019s head was a clear plastic stick, flat and about a foot long, with a pen attached to the end of it. His father crafted a stick like this when Paul was a child, and he has been using versions of it since. He clamps the end of the stick in his mouth and manipulates the pen to write, type and push buttons on the phone; he used it to sign the hospital\u2019s waiver allowing him to talk to me, although he bristled at having to sign anything at all to tell me his own story. \u201cThat is the most ridiculous thing,\u201d he grumbled. Paul\u2019s teeth are flattened and worn from years of using the stick. Though his body inside the lung is scarcely larger than it was when he was a child and his muscles atrophied, his neck measures 18 inches around and his jaw muscles bulge.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s iron lung \u2013 his faithful \u201cold iron horse\u201d as he calls it \u2013 is the butter-yellow colour of 50s kitchen appliances. Its metal legs, ending in black rubber wheels, raise it to a height that suits a caregiver, while windows at the top allow them to see inside, and four portholes on the sides let them reach in. To open the machine, which weighs almost 300kg, carers must release the seals at the head and slide the user out on the interior bed. The portholes, the pressure valves, the cylindrical shape and the colour all give the impression of a sturdy miniature submarine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e3b32bae89b6d6713d939ef4393eed5e9d69d762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3b32bae89b6d6713d939ef4393eed5e9d69d762/6_0_1589_1986/800.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Alexander, who was paralysed by polio in 1952, painting with his mouth inside an iron lung, circa 1960s\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul inside his iron lung as a child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Paul Alexander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iron lungs were built to last, even if no one thought the people in them would. The device was invented in 1928 by Philip Drinker, a medical engineer, and Louis Shaw, a physiologist, at Harvard. Drinker had visited Boston Children\u2019s Hospital to investigate a malfunctioning air conditioner in the ward for premature babies, but he came away haunted what he saw in the polio ward \u2013 \u201cthe small blue faces, the terrible gasping for air\u201d, as his sister and biographer, Catherine Drinker Bowen, later wrote. His invention was a simple mechanism, doing the job of depleted muscles, and it meant that thousands of children who would have died didn\u2019t. The iron lung was intended to be used for two weeks at most, to give the body a chance to recover.</p> <p>Over time, the claustrophobic iron lung became emblematic of the devastating effects of polio. Only the sickest patients ended up in one; if they made it out, a lifetime of disability was likely to follow. But once the vaccine was administered to children across the US from 1955, incidence of the disease plummeted. Those who needed short-term breathing assistance were treated by more invasive but much smaller positive-pressure ventilators, invented in 1952 by an anaesthetist during a polio outbreak in Copenhagen. These push air directly into and out of the lungs either through the mouth, via a tube that is snaked down the throat while the patient is sedated, or through a hole made in the trachea. These, like the iron lung, were only intended for short-term use; those few people who needed help breathing for the rest of their lives saw a hole in their throat as an acceptable price to pay for the increased mobility that positive pressure offered. The last iron lungs were manufactured in the late 60s.</p> <p>By the time positive-pressure ventilators were in widespread use, however, Paul was used to living in his lung, and he had already learned to breathe part of the time without it. He also never wanted a hole in his throat again. So he kept his iron lung.</p> <p>With the decline of the disease, and the visual reminders of it hidden away in a handful of homes and care facilities, across much of the western world the terror of polio faded from collective memory. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe how many people walked into my law office,\u201d Paul said, \u201cand saw my iron lung and said: \u2018What is that?\u2019 And I\u2019d tell them: \u2018It\u2019s an iron lung.\u2019 \u2018What does it do?\u2019 \u2018Breathe for me.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018I got polio when I was little.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s polio?\u2019 Uh oh.\u201d David Oshinsky, the author of Polio: An American Story, believes that the success of vaccines in eradicating so many deadly diseases is precisely why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/europes-covid-predicament-how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-the-anti-vaxxers\" title=\"\">anti-vaxx</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/europes-covid-predicament-how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-the-anti-vaxxers\" title=\"\"> movement</a> has gained ground in recent years. \u201cThese vaccines have done away with the evidence of how frightening these diseases were,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>When I visited him at Clements Hospital, Paul seemed like a kind of medical celebrity \u2013 none of the hospital staff had ever seen an iron lung before. As we talked, two women in nurses\u2019 scrubs came in. They were from another unit, but they just wanted to meet the man in the iron lung, they said. Paul told them that he was in the middle of an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, sir,\u201d the older nurse said, \u201cwe\u2019ll just listen for a bit.\u201d After they left, Paul told me this happens all the time. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is \u2013 like living in a zoo,\u201d he said.</p> <p>People often come away from meeting Paul humbled. Norman Brown, a retired nurse who has been good friends with Paul since 1971, said: \u201cThe guy is such an impressive character \u2026 most people are in awe when they first meet him.\u201d Paul doesn\u2019t mind answering people\u2019s questions: \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer, I\u2019m paid to talk!\u201d He likes talking about polio and the lung, and about his life, because what terrifies him, even more than the possibility of Covid-19, is that the world will forget what polio was like, and what he achieved in spite of it.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>On Christmas Eve 1953, a year and a half after Paul was admitted to Parkland Hospital, his parents rented a portable generator and a truck to bring him and his iron lung home. It was a short, nerve-racking drive: \u201cAny minute it looked like that old generator would go off,\u201d his father Gus later told a Texas newspaper. \u201cIt kept popping. I didn\u2019t know if we would make it home or not.\u201d Part of the reason Paul was cleared to leave the hospital was that no one expected him to live much longer.</p> <p>But Paul didn\u2019t die. He gained weight; the day he got home, his older brother made him a plate of bacon \u2013 the best he\u2019d ever tasted, he said. His parents slept in the same ground-floor living room with him, always half-awake in case the swish-swish of the machine stopped. It did during power cuts \u2013 even today, Texan storms and tornadoes sometimes knock down power lines \u2013 and his parents had to pump the machine by hand, calling neighbours in to help.</p> <p>After three years, Paul could leave his lung for a few hours at a time. His frog-breathing had become muscle memory \u2013 like riding a bicycle, he told me. His education had been left to founder during his 18 months on the ward. One day, his mother walked in with a pile of books borrowed from the local elementary school: she was going to teach him to read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e74435fae5f1245431870a6c8d541b41fd3b9fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e74435fae5f1245431870a6c8d541b41fd3b9fe/1_0_502_628/400.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Alexander, who was paralysed by polio in 1952, in a wheelchair while taking a break outside his iron lung, circa 1960s\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul as a young man, outside his iron lung.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Paul Alexander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had all these ambitions. I was going to be president,\u201d he said. But it took his parents, along with the parents of several other disabled children, more than a year to convince the Dallas school system to allow him to take classes from home. In 1959, when he was 13, Paul was one of the first students to enrol in the district\u2019s new programme for children at home. \u201cI knew if I was going to do anything with my life, it was going to have to be a mental thing. I wasn\u2019t going to be a basketball player,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Most days, he would leave the lung around the time other children got out of school, and sit out front in his wheelchair. Friends would push him around the streets; later, as they got older, the same friends took him to diners and cinemas, then restaurants and bars.</p> <p>And he went to church. The Pentecostal church, to which the Alexanders belong, is a denomination characterised by a personal, passionate experience of God. At the end of each service, congregants are invited to come to the front of the church and pray. \u201cMy dad would take me down there sometimes to pray with him, and he would let all of his emotions out then,\u201d Paul\u2019s younger brother, Phil, told me. \u201cHe\u2019d just cry and cry.\u201d</p> <p>Paul dealt with his emotions in a different way. Polio had robbed him of his independence. \u201cHe let his anger out a lot. He had a mouth,\u201d Phil recalled. \u201cI completely understand it. He would yell and scream and curse and get it all out, and my parents would just let it happen, because obviously, Paul would need a release \u2026 he was normal.\u201d It hurts Paul to think about it now. \u201cThere were frustrating times, times I\u2019d get really mad, scream. But Mom and Dad were so tolerant, they seemed to just understand,\u201d he said. As he spoke, tears trickled down his temple to the pillow.</p> <p>In 1967, Paul, now 21, graduated from high school with almost straight As. His one B was in biology, because he was unable to dissect a rat. \u201cI was so mad,\u201d he said. (He still is.) He applied to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, but despite his academic record, he was rejected. \u201cI was too crippled,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cBroke my heart. I fought for two years, repeatedly called them. \u201c\u2018Well, wait a minute,\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018I want you to reconsider, think about this. I\u2019m coming over, I want to talk to you!\u2019\u201d His high school teachers backed him. Eventually, the dean of admissions relented, on two conditions: that he find someone to help him get to his classes, and that he get the polio vaccine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa91760f59d9decce5e9b2f372de725abc598181\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa91760f59d9decce5e9b2f372de725abc598181/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Alexander, reflected in a mirror attached to his iron lung, Thursday, September 12, 2019, in his apartment in Dallas, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul reflected in a mirror attached to his iron lung.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul was \u201cscared to death\u201d rolling into his first class. \u201cYou have to understand, back then, there were no cripples. There was none on campus, I was the only one. Wherever I went, I was the only one. Restaurant, movie theatre \u2013 I thought: \u2018Wow, there\u2019s nobody else out here. I\u2019ll just pave the way,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI kind of thought of myself as representing a group. I fought for that reason. \u2018What do you mean I can\u2019t go back there? I want to go back there!\u2019 \u2026 \u2018You can\u2019t do that.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes I can!\u2019 I was always fighting.\u201d</p> <p>Paul met a woman, Claire, and fell in love. They got engaged. But one day when he called, her mother \u2013 who had long objected to the relationship \u2013 answered, refused to let him talk to her, and told him never to speak to her daughter again. \u201cTook years to heal from that,\u201d he said. He transferred to the University of Texas at Austin. At Southern Methodist University, he\u2019d been living at home, but now he was on his own. His parents were terrified.</p> <p>At UT, the caregiver Paul had hired never turned up, so for a month, the guys in his dorm took care of him \u2013 even \u201cthe most intimate things\u201d, he said \u2013 until he was able to hire a new one. Paul graduated in 1978, and later began studying for a postgraduate degree in law. He again made headlines in November 1980: \u201cIron-willed man leaves iron lung to vote\u201d, declared an article in the Austin American Statesman newspaper. </p> <p>Paul struggled with trying to pay for a full-time carer and his education at the same time, but in 1984, he graduated from the University of Austin with a degree in law, and found a job teaching legal terminology to court stenographers at an Austin trade school. When a newspaper reporter asked if his students found it uncomfortable to be in his class, he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t allow people to feel uncomfortable for very long.\u201d</p> <p>He passed his bar exams, and on 19 May 1986, he slightly raised his right thumb as he took the oath promising to conduct himself with integrity as a lawyer in front of the chief justice of the supreme court of Texas. He was 40 years old, wearing a natty three-piece suit, living on his own, and able to spend most of his day outside the machine that still kept him alive.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>The story of how Paul taught himself to breathe is central to how he thinks about himself. It represents the determination that made everything else \u2013 getting into university, the law degree, the life of relative independence \u2013 possible. It even inspired the title of the memoir, Three Minutes for a Dog, that he self-published in April. It took him more than eight years to write it, using the plastic stick and a pen to tap out his story on the keyboard, or dictating the words to his friend, former nurse Norman Brown.</p> <p>But the title of the book was Kathy Gaines\u2019s idea. Kathy, 62, has been Alexander\u2019s caregiver since he graduated from law school and moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, although neither can remember precisely when she found his advert in the paper and became his \u201carms and legs\u201d.</p> <p>Kathy is a type-1 diabetic and, as a consequence of the disease, has been legally blind for years, so she can\u2019t drive. During Paul\u2019s five-month stay in hospital last year, she took the bus or got a lift there every day. She taught the nursing staff how to manage the machine and, to some degree, Paul. While we talked, Kathy brought us foam cups of hospital coffee, and a plastic bendy straw for Paul. She left it close enough for him to reach with his tongue and mouth, but not so close as to be in the way. Kathy knows how to shave Paul\u2019s face, change his clothes and sheets, trim his hair and his nails, hand him his toothbrush, do his paperwork, make his appointments, do his grocery shopping, and that when he says \u201cbiscuit\u201d he usually means \u201cEnglish muffin\u201d. Sometimes, if she sees his head in a position that she thinks will be uncomfortable for him, she\u2019ll move it without asking. (He doesn\u2019t always appreciate that.)</p> <p>Kathy knows everything about him, Paul says. \u201cKathy and I grew together \u2026 she stretched herself over as many things as I needed,\u201d he said. For most of their relationship, Kathy has either lived with Paul or nearly next door. They\u2019ve moved a lot: his legal career was not lucrative, and he has struggled financially. Today, Kathy lives upstairs in their communal apartment building. She sees him every day, whether she\u2019s working or not.</p> <p>Though Kathy and Paul have never been romantically involved, his brother Phil describes their relationship like a marriage. \u201cPaul has always been aggressive about things that he wants and needs around other people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty demanding. But Kathy is more demanding than he is. They\u2019ve had their moments, but they always work it out.\u201d</p> <p>Paul has always craved independence. But his life depends on his caregivers showing up for work, on his iron lung not blowing a gasket, on the electricity staying on. \u201cHe\u2019s been 100% depending on the kindness of others since he was six years old \u2013 100%. And he\u2019s done it by virtue of his voice and his demeanour and his ability to communicate,\u201d said Norman Brown. \u201cI would do things for him that I wouldn\u2019t do for people. For example, he got evicted from an apartment, and he says: \u2018I want to egg that manager\u2019s door.\u2019 And when he says \u2018I want to do something\u2019, he means you\u2019re going to do it. So we got a bunch of eggs and drove over to that manager\u2019s apartment,\u201d Brown said, laughing.</p> <p>What Paul hates is being invisible. He remembers going to restaurants where the server asked his companion, \u201cWhat will <em>he</em> be having?\u201d His voice shook with anger at the memory. \u201cI think it\u2019s why I fight so hard, because there\u2019s people standing there with the gall to tell me what I\u2019m going to do with my life \u2026 You have no right to tell me what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should get down on your knees and thank God it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p> <p>Paul has now outlived both his parents and his older brother, Nick. He has outlived his old friends. He has even outlived his original iron lung. In 2015, the seals were failing and it was leaking air. Not surprisingly, spare parts for iron lungs, and mechanics who know what they\u2019re looking at, are difficult to find, but after a friend posted a video of Paul on YouTube asking for help, a local Dallas engineer fixed him up with a refurbished one.</p> <p>Paul still has big plans \u2013 he has hopes that his memoir is \u201cgoing to smack across the world\u201d \u2013 but Covid-19 is a new danger. Paul is, Phil said, \u201cprobably the most vulnerable you can get\u201d to a virus like this one. \u201cHe\u2019s staying positive, but we\u2019ve also had conversations that this is probably going to do it. It\u2019s very likely.\u201d</p> <p>Paul has always thought that polio, the \u201cdemon\u201d that tried to destroy him, was going to come back. \u201cI can see hospitals inundated by polio victims again, an epidemic, I can see it so easily. I tell the doctors, it\u2019s going to happen. They don\u2019t believe me,\u201d he told me when he was in hospital last year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/12/gp-doctor-on-how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-has-progressed-edinburgh\">'The past six weeks have been unlike anything I\u2019ve known': a GP on how the pandemic has changed his work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is only thanks to concerted vaccination efforts that there hasn\u2019t been a new case of polio in the US since 1979, or in the UK since 1984.

The virus is now only endemic to three countries in the world \u2013 Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan \u2013 and cases of polio number in the dozens.</p> <p>But Paul was right that most people have largely forgotten about the terror of polio, just as we have forgotten the terror of other diseases we now routinely vaccinate against \u2013 diphtheria, typhus, measles and mumps.

  "<p>If you want to see how little the government would prefer things to change once the coronavirus pandemic has subsided, look at its immigration policy. Over the past few months the Home Office has fought hard to maintain the labyrinthine bureaucracy, exorbitant fees and harsh punishments that govern the lives of migrants from outside the European Union. Rules that ban some people from accessing NHS treatment, food banks and emergency housing have <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2020/may/the-hostile-environment-continued\">only been partially eased</a>; while detention centres have not been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52560093\">fully evacuated</a>, and the Home Office has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/home-office-accused-of-pressuring-judiciary-over-immigration-decisions\">putting pressure on immigration judges</a> releasing detainees on bail.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, who has previously been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/priti-patel-home-office-asylum-seekers-detention-coronavirus-a9480036.html\">avoiding scrutiny</a> during the crisis, began a publicity drive for the second reading of the new immigration bill. \u201cThis historic piece of legislation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1283319/priti-patel-news-immigration-EU-free-movement-brexit\">Patel wrote</a> in the Express, \u201cends the European Union\u2019s free movement of people and lays the foundations to build a fairer, firmer, skills-led points-based immigration system.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour rightly pointed out the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of pushing through legislation that will prevent many health and care workers find work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The bill, which passed its second reading in a parliamentary vote on 18 May, is being presented as the fulfilment of the central demand of Brexit voters. But it is better described as a leap in the dark. Rather than setting out what the new immigration system \u2013 due to come into force in January 2021 \u2013 will look like, it gives the government powers to amend the law as it sees fit, without bringing it back to parliament for full scrutiny. Key areas remain undetermined, such as rights to family union and permanent settlement, visas for NHS workers, and the treatment of trafficking victims and asylum seekers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/immigration-bill-2020-second-reading-briefing\">describes</a> the bill as a \u201cblank cheque\u201d that will transfer EU citizens into \u201cthe same system as non-EU nationals which is dysfunctional and chaotic, with a long history of incorrect decision-making\u201d.</p> <p>To many people, the bill will seem an entirely fair proposition. It purports to offer a system based on merit \u2013 where \u201cpeople can come here based on their skills, not where they\u2019re from\u201d, as a slogan floating above the union jack, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1262430422954389504\">tweeted by Patel</a>, puts it. High earners and people with certain specialisms, such as research scientists, are in; \u201clower-skilled\u201d workers, who have jobs with salaries below \u00a325,600, are not. But this rests on a claim that has been exposed as false by the pandemic, which is that \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers are worth less to society, and easily replaced.</p> <p>Labour, which voted against the government on the second reading, rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/tories-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-key-workers-with-immigration-bill\">pointed out</a> the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of pushing through legislation that will prevent many health and care workers find work in the UK in future, and leaves a question hanging over the visas of some already here, even as these workers are publicly celebrated for their role during the pandemic.</p> <p>In truth, the contradiction was beginning to show even before Covid-19 arrived. When the immigration bill last came up for public discussion in February, a series of industry representatives warned they would face dire shortages if they were expected to replace workers from the EU by the start of next year. The public services union Unison warned of \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d in the care sector, while farmers and builders also said they would face labour shortages. At the time, Patel\u2019s response was that businesses should focus on training up the 8.5 million \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d people already resident in the UK, a figure that critics soon <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51560120\">pointed out</a> was largely composed of people who were too old or too sick to work, or who were students or carers.</p> <p>This stance was regarded by some as a gaffe, yet it is consistent with Patel\u2019s ideology. Since becoming home secretary last year, she has openly positioned herself as an heir to Margaret Thatcher: so far the most prominent part of this has been her hardline stance on borders and crime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/11/reckless-tory-pantomime-authoritarianism-thatcherism\">displayed</a>, for instance, at last October\u2019s Conservative party conference. But she is also an acolyte of Thatcherite economics. Patel, along with other ministers including the foreign secretary Dominic Raab, is a co-author of Britannia Unchained, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">2012 book</a> by what was then a new crop of rightwing Conservative MPs who argued that the UK should strip away employment laws and other state protections to better compete with rival global economies. \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world,\u201d the authors infamously declared.</p> <p>Although ending EU free movement has sometimes been dressed up as a way to protect British workers\u2019 interests, this is far from the government\u2019s primary concern. What\u2019s more likely is that it expects British residents to assume the same low-paid and precarious jobs that were previously being filled by immigrants from elsewhere in the EU. And when that proves impossible, the government will most likely look to create temporary exceptions that allow immigrants to take up jobs in sectors where there are labour shortages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone. Why did it take such a fight? | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike free movement, which at least gave EU workers the choice to come and go as they please and to look for other jobs when they were mistreated, these exceptions will come with heavy restrictions on migrants\u2019 rights \u2013 time limits, visa conditions, bans on accessing state support \u2013 that make it easier for employers to push them around, or for traffickers and abusers to exploit them. This already happens with many low-paid migrant workers from outside the EU, and the conditions are being set for a repeat. The JCWI <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/points-based-immigration-system-briefing-2020\">warns</a> that a temporary visa scheme for seasonal agricultural workers, which the government plans to expand to make up for the shortfall once free movement ends, is ripe for exploitation, and that workers \u201cwill have no meaningful way of challenging abusive employers\u201d.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just an issue for the UK: countries around the world have belatedly discovered the need for people who clean, care and provide food, even though they are frequently underpaid and their jobs frequently reserved for those societies find easier to exploit: migrants from poorer countries and regions, women, and people from minority ethnic backgrounds. The pressure to keep these jobs going during a pandemic has opened up a debate in many countries about how they are valued: undocumented migrant workers in <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2020/may/invisible-in-the-fields\">southern Europe</a> and the US; Romanians flown in to pick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/western-europe-food-east-european-workers-coronavirus\">western European crops</a>; Ukrainians desperate to avoid travel restrictions <a href=\"https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/24830/ukrainian-workers-struggle-to-reach-the-eu-amid-coronavirus-restrictions\">to work in Poland</a>.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://spectrejournal.com/the-covid-19-crisis-and-the-end-of-the-low-skilled-worker/\">recent essay</a>, the labour researchers Sara Farris and Mark Bergfeld suggest that we stop calling the jobs that underpin the economy \u201clow-skilled\u201d and instead describe them as \u201clife-making\u201d.

The \u201cputting out\u201d method might have entailed dreary toil for minimal pay but it allowed workers to exercise some control as to what they did and when. They could continue to supervise their children, tend their animals and maintain their gardens, while celebrating the religious and folk holidays central to early modern society.</p> <p>By contrast, as the historian NSB Gras says, factories emerged \u201cpurely for purposes of discipline so that the workers could be effectively controlled under the supervision of foremen\u201d.

A senior clerk in the 1850s might, for instance, expect to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-26346-2_9\">perform his duties in a work environment</a> that \u201cclosely resembled his home in its furniture, its open fire, curtains and, by the end of the century, gas lighting\u201d.</p> <p>But, as clerical work proliferated, the office became subjected to the same supervisory techniques by which Frederick Winslow Taylor broke industrial labour into simple, carefully-timed components. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00076791.2013.838034\">Management texts</a> from the first decades of the 20th century reveal an obsession with controlling the most humdrum of tasks, with \u201cthe seemingly innocuous act of blotting [\u2026] accused of wasting 35 seconds [and] the minuscule time differences in fastening together papers by way of a paperclip versus a tag [\u2026] the subject of much discussion\u201d.</p> <p>Today, most of us don\u2019t get assessed on the basis of how quickly we turn in our swivel chairs (it should take 0.009 of a minute, <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ibwUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=harry+braverman+swivel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi81uD0r8bpAhWTV30KHcd0DFkQ6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20braverman%20swivel&amp;f=false\">according to a guide from 1960</a>).</p> <p>That\u2019s because, by bringing workers out of the home, the office (just like the factory) gave them collective social power.
