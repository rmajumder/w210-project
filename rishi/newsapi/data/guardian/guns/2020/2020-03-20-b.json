  "<p>The data tells us that climate change is real, but sometimes the feeling on the ground is far from convincing. A spell of hot weather can always be compared to a similar spell of hot weather from way back in the past. Similarly a big storm, intense rain and flooding often have parallels from long ago. Now a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL086259\">study in Geophysical Research Letters</a> reveals that the signs of climate change are harder to spot in mid-latitude countries such as the UK and US, and easier to see in the tropics.</p> <p>Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared global mean temperature fluctuations with local temperature fluctuations for different parts of the world. They show that while the global average temperature has wiggled smoothly upwards, a mid-latitude location such as Oxford in the UK has always had wild swings in temperature. \u201cClimate change impacts in some countries are being hidden by their own changeable weather,\u201d writes Hawkins. By contrast increasing temperatures in tropical regions are more obvious because the background climate is steadier in these regions.</p> <p>When it comes to rainfall, the data reveals a clear signal of increasing extremes, masked in mean rainfall plots. Large parts of the UK have now experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/uk-weather-weekend-rain-could-cause-further-flooding\">exceptional deluges</a>, incomparable to historic records.</p>",

Given that this situation continues to evolve, ministers must also keep the door open to additional measures to support business cash flow.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matthew Cady</strong>, investment strategist at <strong>Brooks Macdonald</strong>, an investment manager, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Today\u2019s steps by the chancellor are building on the confidence that we\u2019re now seeing from markets that the policy responses arriving are getting to the size that\u2019s needed. Within the gains in UK equities today, we\u2019re seeing relative outperformance in more UK-focused domestic companies, unwinding some of the weakness they\u2019ve seen coming into today\u2019s announcement. </p> <p> What is needed from governments and politicians is a \u2018right-now\u2019 plan, and it\u2019s good to see that the chancellor has finally recognised this with the measures he is taking today. For markets, the coronavirus outbreak will clearly drive a significant jolt to the UK economy over the next one or two quarters. But with UK policy makers now giving it both fiscal and monetary barrels, there are good chances that this stays a short-term impact. Today\u2019s actions should start to give investors some encouragement to take advantage of the pullback in valuations as they think about their longer-term investment horizons. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kallum Pickering</strong>, senior economist at <strong>Berenberg</strong>, an investment bank, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK is now running a \u2018virus war\u2019 economy. The usual rules do not apply.</p> <p> Providing cash-strapped firms with generous subsidies to retain their staff will dramatically lower the risk of surging unemployment during the corona virus recession. Encouraging firms to hoard their labour while authorities tackle the medical emergency raises the chance that the economy can get back to normal quickly once any containment restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>It is hard to say at this early stage exactly how much the employment subsidy scheme will cost. As a proportion of annual GDP, quarterly aggregate employees compensation is around 12.5%. If the scheme runs into two quarters or more, the cost in % of GDP to the treasury will easily be double-digits. <br></p> <p> Across the world central banks and governments are working a hard to prevent the inevitable corona-virus recession from developing into a financial crisis. We continue to see enough evidence that, in the UK and in other advanced economies, policymakers will likely pull it off, in the end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e75020a8f08e0999e6b747c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T17:50:03.729Z\">5.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And the pound is now back to a 1.5% gain, at $1.1665 against the US dollar.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e7500a38f08dcc95cc20427\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T17:46:00.783Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some reaction is starting to come in from business groups and unions.</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Izza</strong>, chief executive of the <strong>ICAEW</strong>, an accountancy body, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The real battle now is for public confidence: if we can sustain that, the economics will follow.

The state\u2019s governor has said that initial claims totalled 40,000 on Sunday, and doubled to 80,000 by Tuesday. If you average that over a week, it is consistent with initial claims in California alone spiking to 525,000 - a level that is entirely without precedent. </p> <p>Based on an upward trend, and the recently announced lockdown, the risk is that the final figure ends up higher. Across the states for which we have data, claims so far this week are running at a rate that is 15 times higher than they were in March last year. That figure is consistent with a rise in jobless claims from 281,000 to around three million next week. That would be the largest such increase by a factor of more than ten.</p> <p>If it comes to pass, that would be consistent with the unemployment rate increasing by around 2 percentage points in a single week - a figure that is more than double the largest ever <em>monthly</em> increase in the unemployment rate. For what it is worth, that scale of increase is consistent with reported figures coming out of Ireland. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e74c5ae8f08a08573fbe57c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T13:34:36.615Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street edges higher at open</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The bell has rung on Wall Street and markets have opened higher - but the gains are pretty limited so far.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dow Jones: +0.8%</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nasdaq: +1.6%</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>S&amp;P 500: +0.9%</strong></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T13:37:21.851Z\">at 1.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e74c3348f08e0999e6b70b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T13:27:34.544Z\">1.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Government borrowing falls in Feb but will spike due to Covid-19</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As employees, employers and investors await the chancellor\u2019s package of measures to protect pay and jobs during Covid-19 - expected later this afternoon - the ONS has published the latest snapshot on the public finances.</p> <p>The figures show a slightly better borrowing picture than expected in February.

Now voters have to provide one of the specific and approved reasons for lacking ID to vote. The legislators also tweaked the law so that IDs from other states were not acceptable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/crystal-mason-texas-upholds-sentence-voter-suppression\">Texas upholds sentence for woman who didn\u2019t know she was ineligible to vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state, Michael Adams, a Republican, praised the measure in a statement. He noted that the bill would allow anyone who did not have an ID to get one for nothing and allowed people to vote if a poll worker recognized them. \u201cI ran for this office to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The lawmakers made the changes in a committee days after Kentucky\u2019s governor, Andy Beshear, a Democrat, closed the state capitol to the public over coronavirus concerns. DMV offices, one of the most common places people would obtain a photo ID throughout the state are also closed as Kentucky deals with 47 cases of Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/news/coronavirus/article241343376.html\">thus far</a>. The Kentucky primary is scheduled to take place on 23 June (the state postponed it from 19 May amid the coronavirus outbreak) and the deadline to register is 20 April.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d Douglas, who has advised Adams on the legislation, said of the timing of the changes. \u201cIt makes me question how much the legislature really care about the Kentucky voters.\u201d</p> <p>The measure now goes to Beshear, who will probably veto the measure. But the Kentucky legislature, where Republicans control a majority of seats, can override that veto with a majority vote.</p> <p>Kentucky already has a voter identification requirement, but Republicans pushed the new measure after the state narrowly elected Democrat Beshear and want it in effect this fall when Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, faces re-election. The law will probably go into effect <a href=\"https://legislature.ky.gov/Law/Statutes/Pages/KrsEffDates.aspx\">this summer</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMany Kentuckians will not even have the option to obtain a new ID because county clerk\u2019s offices throughout the commonwealth have closed following the recommendation of public health officials,\u201d Corey Shapiro, the legal director of the Kentucky chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. \u201cIt is unconscionable for politicians to move this legislation at a time when Kentuckians are not allowed in the capitol and are losing their jobs, their small businesses, access to childcare and more.\u201d</p> <p>The push for additional voting restrictions contradicts a national push to ease voting regulations so that people can vote by mail without having to gather at polling places this year.

Rationing is already taking place unofficially in supermarkets but in a way that takes no account of people\u2019s need, he has told Downing Street along with fellow authors, Prof Erik Millstone of Sussex University, and Prof Terry Marsden of Cardiff University. </p> \n  <p>They warn that food banks and food share schemes that give food to those on low incomes are reporting serious shortages, while key workers who can only shop at the end of their shifts are finding shelves empty and nothing to eat. </p> \n  <p>Lang said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am aware of at least one London borough where the food bank has alerted the council of serious shortages despite an 80% rise in visitors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The food bank was unable to source food and essentials such as tinned meat and vegetables, long-life milk, and toiletries such as toilet paper and soap even though it had funding to buy them. </p> \n  <p>Kris Gibbon-Walsh, head of operations at Fareshare, a charity that supplies food manufacturing and retail surplus to charities that would usually feed 1 million people a week, said it too was struggling to get supplies. He called for the government to step in immediately with funding and mandatory allocation of supplies:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have more demand than ever, and some of it is different demand \u2013 people who can\u2019t go to food banks or might be self-isolating, people who might have eaten at a lunch club for the elderly before. Government needs to instruct industry to keep supplying us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The experts\u2019 letter to the prime minister says \u201cthere is a dangerous tendency to blame consumers\u201d and that the problems only arise because of panic-buying. In the absence of clearer planning, with market mechanisms failing, consumers are only acting rationally in preparing for being confined at home, the authors add. </p> \n  <p>Before coronavirus struck, nearly 8bn meals a year in the UK were being eaten out of home. Suddenly people are having to make nearly all their meals at home.<br></p> \n  <p>Gibbon-Walsh said supermarkets were struggling to adapt their algorithms quickly enough. These limit the amount delivered to stores to the amount of shelf space, number of people available to stack them, and number of drivers, so even though retailers have surplus at distribution centres, they cannot get it to stores to meet current demand.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T15:37:39.089Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e74de148f08a08573fbe6d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T15:18:03.248Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Parking app JustPark has launched a nationwide appeal to increase the number of <strong>free parking spaces near hospitals</strong> by allowing the general public to list spaces for free via their app. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustPark/status/1240994749139562497\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NHS</a> needs your help!

Psychology research shows that <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02309/full\">shared adversity often brings out the best in us</a>, motivating us to be adaptable and creative.</p> \n<p>On top of that, when we suffer <a href=\"https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/affective-and-physiological-responses-to-the-suffering-of-others-\">we are motivated to help others who also suffer</a>. Sure there are the some who are opportunistic or self-interested and, yes, we saw some of this in the early waves of coronavirus when it came to consumer actions (the empty shelf syndrome) but as the implications of the virus settles in, and as more people are suffering, we have seen a surge in global kindness and people taking proactive steps to generate solutions that will work for everyone.</p> \n<p>A psychology professor, Dacher Keltner of UCLA Berkeley, suggests that <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-00681-000\">kindness has always been a central aspect of human nature</a> going right back to our ancestors because it helped us survive. Out on the harsh savannah it was kindness that prompted close bonds and cooperation among our early descendants, allowing them to band together to share food, defend themselves against predators, solve problems and raise children. </p> \n<p>This is equally true today and has becomes strikingly evident in this time of crisis. Shelly Taylor, another psychology professor at UCLA, suggests that \u201cwe are fundamentally a nurturant species\u201d and that times of threat trigger an instinctive response that she calls \u201c<a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/marianabockarova/files/tend-and-befriend.pdf\">tending and befriending</a>\u201d where we step in protect others (tend) and band together against the threat (befriend).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/18/drop-off-dinners-five-easy-to-reheat-dishes-to-cook-for-your-neighbours\">Drop off dinners: five easy-to-reheat dishes to cook for your neighbours</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"http://ccare.stanford.edu/article/compassion-an-evolutionary-analysis-and-empirical-review/\">Our brains are hard-wired for compassion</a>, and survival of the kindest must outweigh survival of the fittest now.</p> \n<p>Now is a time where we all must \u201ctend and befriend\u201d. Here are some simple things you can do to the global wave of kindness.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>. Drop a note in your neighbours\u2019 letter boxes inviting them to be part of a Street WhatsApp group so you can check in on each other and let people know if you\u2019re doing a supermarket run or see if someone needs a friend to talk to.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Support local and online business: the coronavirus is having huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/05/coronavirus-global-economy\">economic fallouts</a>. Support your local restaurants through take-away orders, get fresh fruit from your grocer, have flowers delivered to a friend who is struggling, put your family holiday snaps into an album with an online store, spend money on books, kits, crafts or activities that you can read/do with your new spare time during social distancing.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Share positive stories on social media: research shows that when you share a story that makes someone happy this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=80U__KwX0iU&amp;feature=emb_logo\">positive emotion spreads on to others in the social network</a>.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Give blood. Right now the <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html\">Red Cross</a> has a severe blood shortage and donors are needed urgently. The Red Cross assures us that giving blood is safe and does not put you at risk of contracting the coronavirus.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Sit down and <a href=\"https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_letter_for_students\">write a thank you letter</a> to someone who has made a positive difference in your life. Send them the letter or better yet call them and read the letter to them.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Wash your hands and practise social distancing. This is still the most effective thing you can do and is a way of showing kindness by not risking the spread of infection to others.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Kindness can come in the intentional actions above and it can come through your small daily gestures. When getting pulled into several battles with my two teenage kids today over e-learning and the fact that school closure does not mean brain closure, I had to remind myself \u201csometimes it\u2019s better to be kind than to be right\u201d, take a deep breath, disengage and find a more constructive way of talking to them. It took effort, but then all the good things do.</p> \n<p>The pace, intensity and magnitude of the coronavirus has the whole world reeling. By committing yourself to be kinder during the crisis you are helping others, helping yourself and helping the world. Now more than ever, we must pause, be patient and choose kindness.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Lea Waters AM, PhD, is a psychology professor at the University of Melbourne and executive board member of the International Positive Psychology Association</p></li> \n</ul>",

Waging war against a Rio Tinto aluminium plant, Halla (Halld\u00f3ra Geirhar\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir) is an almost Batman-like figure, viewing arguably extreme measures \u2013 such as sabotaging transmission towers and disrupting power lines \u2013 as a moral obligation.</p> <p>The Foucauldian elements of the script (co-written by Erlingsson and \u00d3lafur Egilsson) explore the pervasiveness and fragmentation of power, with the suggestion that average citizens have a responsibility to rise up against authorities when they fail to act in the best interests of the people. These are meaty ideas but the film has a fun and bouncy tone, often veering into the realm of offbeat comedy \u2013 complete with a fourth-wall-breaking band who regularly pop up and deliver daffy tunes.</p> <h2><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70019062\">Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind</a></strong> (film, Netflix)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59d08133366080514b2c2db4165964527b0bb924\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59d08133366080514b2c2db4165964527b0bb924/0_0_2177_1306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the animated film Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind by Studio Ghibli\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the animated film Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind by Studio Ghibli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Optimum Releasing/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a long time the extraordinary catalogue of the beloved Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli was virtually impossible to access online. But most Ghibli films have now arrived on Netflix, with the last of <a href=\"https://www.flicks.com.au/news/21-studio-ghibli-classics-are-coming-to-netflix/\">three batches</a> landing on 1 April. I\u2019ve highlighted Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind not because it\u2019s the best (my favourites are Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and Pom Poko) but because this awe-inspiring film tends to be overlooked, existing in the shadows of so many other magnificent productions.</p> <p>Directed by the great Hayao Miyazaki, it is set 1,000 years after the collapse of industrial civilisation. An awful \u201ctoxic jungle\u201d has spread across the earth, which is roamed by huge mutant slug-like creatures. The titular character is a princess determined to find ways for humans and hideous mutant thingamajigs to co-exist. Miyazaki contrasts great beauty with extreme danger, taking to the skies to match visions of grand, picturesque horizons with kooky contraptions and flying machines.</p> <h2><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.foxtel.com.au/watch/devs.html\">Devs</a></strong> (TV, Foxtel)</h2> <p>The novelist-cum-film-maker Alex Garland\u2019s previous feature, the highly ambitious sci-fi Annihilation, was famously described as \u201ctoo intellectual\u201d by a producer at Paramount \u2013 before the studio sold it to Netflix. Wait until they get a load of the auteur\u2019s new and intensely cerebral eight-part TV series: a slow-burning mind-boggler revolving around a highly secretive new technology developed by a company led by Forest (a meditatively gloomy Nick Offerman).</p> <p>The company has created something that, to borrow the words of one of the developers, \u201cliterally changes everything\u201d. What exactly is it? Well. Well... Well! That would be telling.

Five of them, he says, were thinking about ending their lives.</p> <p>While there\u2019s been no comprehensive research into the Australian industry, non-profit organisation CrewCare believes that the suicide rate among live entertainment crew and roadies \u2013 who number around 10,000 in Australia \u2013 could be 10 times the national average.

Streaming technology could bring a bit of money back to musicians and performers, but it won\u2019t help the backbone of their industry: the roadies, tech teams, tour managers and riggers who set up the shows that sustain their careers.</p> <p>For now, all their work is gone \u2013 bookings have dried up until late this year or early next, and there\u2019s no sign of when it will return.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think we're all just in disbelief in how fragile the industry turned out to be.

Your income is job to job, and you answer to many; Alberts, for instance, works \u2013 or worked \u2013 for nine production companies as a contractor, and three as a casual. All those companies now have empty schedules ahead of them, and have had to stand down staff. For casuals and contractors, there\u2019s no leave, no sick days, no security. \u201cThis week\u2019s pay cheque pays next week\u2019s bills, and there\u2019s not enough to put in the bank,\u201d he says. \u201cLong service leave? That\u2019s a 45-minute lunch break.\u201d</p> <p>The hours are long and often at night, meaning your colleagues are your social life. When you\u2019re on tour, there\u2019s no home to go to at the end of the show. When you\u2019re off tour it\u2019s quiet \u2013 and often, you\u2019re alone.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that. \u201cOur industry is full of tough old bastards, male-dominated, and they don\u2019t like reaching out for help. They don\u2019t want to ring Beyond Blue because they feel they won\u2019t understand, because our job is more a lifestyle than a job,\u201d Alberts says. \u201cEven the young ones are hardened like that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-why-the-pandemic-has-left-the-arts-industry-in-crisis\">Coronavirus: why the pandemic has left Australia's arts industry in crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He\u2019s worried that the social distancing being recommended by government and health authorities could make matters worse. \u201cEverything we do for a living is about creating happiness for others.

Keep up that contact.\u201d</p> <p>All Access Crewing in Brisbane, one of many agencies who have stood down staff, has set up a daily food bank for its employees, and are paying core crew the equivalent of the dole for six weeks as they wait for benefits. The managing director, Dee Dimmick, told the Guardian not everyone is in a position to do that. The best thing the government could do right now, she says, is get rid of the welfare waiting period. \u201cThat would make an enormous difference.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime Alberts and some other colleagues are working on a Facebook tool for roadies: a sort of crisis check-in for people to tell the world they\u2019re OK each day.</p> <p>As the email from Freeman reads: \u201cThe live events industry is always the first one to put up their hand to help out others.

The wellbeing of the teachers is not acknowledged and there\u2019s a lot of frustration and just a feeling of helplessness.\u201d</p> <p>Adding to the frustration is a sense that besides the cancellation of assemblies and excursions, nothing has changed within schools as the virus spreads.</p> <p>While teachers have been told to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/australian-schools-stay-open-amid-coronavirus-but-nsw-brings-in-social-distancing\">enforce social distancing and hygiene measures,</a> they say keeping a 1.5m distance between students is \u201cimpossible\u201d in a classroom setting and that basic items such as hand sanitiser are in short supply.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels like I\u2019m a glorified babysitter and that my own health and wellbeing is no longer important</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe kids are literally just going about their days as usual, moving between classes, sharing desks, sharing pens, it\u2019s physically impossible to enforce the social distancing the government has been talking about but there\u2019s been no attempt to even try,\u201d one secondary teacher in Sydney\u2019s Sutherland shire said of the attitude at her school.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the stance is, there\u2019s nothing we can do, what is the point of even trying.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really so weird going home and watching ABC news, seeing how serious it is, watching the other measures being taken in other workplaces and yet we\u2019re just told to keep going as if nothing is happening.\u201d</p> <p>Teachers over 50 are particularly concerned, given their increased vulnerability to the virus. One 55-year-old science teacher from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches said it felt \u201csurreal\u201d to travel to work everyday knowing the advice for most other people was to stay at home.</p> <p>\u201cI have been a teacher for more than 20 years and I\u2019ve always been proud of the job that I do because I know it\u2019s important work, but this week I feel expendable,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m a glorified babysitter and that my own health and wellbeing is no longer important. I\u2019ve had to bring my own cleaning products from home to scrub the desks between classes.\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of the uncertainty, many teachers also reported reduced attendance at schools. The teacher from Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs said attendance had been at about 55% this week.</p> <p>\u201cYou almost feel relieved that the school is emptying out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAs teachers we\u2019re thankful. We\u2019re obviously not telling kids to stay home but we\u2019re thankful the place is thinning out a bit.

  "<p>Polly Toynbee makes the point that hospitals will have to ration ventilators and therefore exclude elderly people because they are least likely to benefit (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-force-nhs-terrible-choices-covid19\" title=\"\">Coronavirus will force hospital chiefs to make some terrible choices</a>, 17 March).</p> <p>As an almost 70-year-old retired GP, I consider that I have about a 5% chance of dying from the virus \u2013 and have a high expectation of catching it. I do not wish to die in a hospital in chaos, or use up a ventilator that could be put to better use. Nor do I wish my family to suffer a traumatic bereavement as a result of a badly managed death (as a bereavement support volunteer, I am well aware of how the circumstances of death impact on grief).</p> <p>I have therefore told my GP and those around me that, if I contract the virus, I do not want to go to hospital if I develop the severe form. I would prefer to be cared for at home with adequate drug control of symptoms and oxygen (unventilated) if necessary. I suspect many others would like the same.</p> <p>I propose that NHS England sets up a homecare service for Covid-19 and staffs it with retired GPs, district nurses and palliative care nurses, who will all have had experience in caring for sick and dying patients at home. This would give a realistic option for patients who did not want to go into hospital.

  "<p><strong>London</strong></p> \n<p>Pubs in Penge, south-east London, had started filling up well before the prime minister\u2019s announcement that they must close down \u2013 and no one showed signs of leaving.</p> \n<p>The high street, where there are six pubs, still had five open as Boris Johnson addressed the nation.

  "<p>The afternoon of 10 August 1976 in the Provisional IRA heartland of Andersonstown in west Belfast was hot and sunny. But, as ever, the ongoing conflict was being played out, this time with a British army patrol pursuing a suspect speeding car through streets busy with people shopping and walking.</p> <p>At about 2pm, when the chase reached Finaghy Road North, soldiers opened fire on the speeding car, killing \u201cVolunteer\u201d Danny Lennon, the 23-year-old driver. His car immediately went out of control and veered on to the pavement outside a church. Before it careered to a halt against the railings, it had run down three children and their mother, Anne Maguire. Eight-year-old Joanne and her six-week-old brother, Andrew, died immediately while another brother, two-year-old John, died from his injuries the next day. Anne, after days in a coma, survived, but killed herself eight years later. Another son, Mark, aged seven, who was on his bicycle ahead of the family group escaped injury. A second person in the car fled the scene.</p> <p>A local woman who worked as an office receptionist, Betty Williams, heard the gunfire and was among the first at the scene. Horrified, in the immediate aftermath she began a petition, knocking on doors and calling for peace in Northern Ireland, and quickly gained 6,000 signatures.</p> <p>\u201cThere had been other tragic deaths,\u201d Williams, who has died aged 76, said at the time, \u201cbut the tragedy of the little Maguires was the moment when I felt we just could not take any more.\u201d</p> <p>At the tearful triple funeral Williams sought out Mairead Corrigan, an aunt of the children, to commiserate. It was a conversation that was to have life-changing consequences for both.</p> <p>A hitherto confidential memorandum, written in the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont on the day of the crash, described the incident as a \u201ccarefully planned operation\u201d and \u201ca major success\u201d for the army, while plans were laid to exploit the tragedy to drive a propaganda backlash against the Provos.</p> <p>However, the NIO quickly lost control of the situation as an unprecedented wave of loathing cascaded from both sides of the religious divide in Belfast, right across Ireland and further afield.</p> <p>Much of it was led by women grieving for the victims and demanding an end to the Troubles, which were then in their ninth year. Williams and Corrigan themselves led a march of 10,000 Catholics and Protestants through Andersonstown. The scene of the deaths had become a flowered grotto, while spontaneous prayer marches throughout Ireland were taking place every night.</p> <p>It was while being interviewed at a television studio about the protests that Williams and Corrigan met Ciaran McKeown, a local journalist. He offered to help the pair handle the intense media interest that was already engulfing them.</p> <p>Guided in the background by McKeown, Williams and Corrigan emerged as the figureheads of a new peace movement, which became known as the Peace People after a declaration written by McKeown and read out by the pair at a rally on 21 August.</p> <p>The movement attracted significant support and funding, and for weeks dominated the headlines. A good news story from Northern Ireland after years of civil disorder and failed political initiatives was universally welcome.</p> <p>There followed a clamour for Williams and Corrigan to be awarded the Nobel peace prize, an honour bestowed the following year. The pair were the youngest recipients of the prize and the monetary award was worth about \u00a3560,000, equivalent to about \u00a33.6m today. The money was equally divided but, while Corrigan donated her share to the Peace People organisation, Williams kept hers, saying she intended to use it to promote peace beyond the boundaries of Ireland. This led to criticism from many that she was using the prize as a ticket to fame and personal fortune. Williams said she needed the money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7d4d9323ef16c0dc04fba58026564215045ecf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7d4d9323ef16c0dc04fba58026564215045ecf5/0_60_4228_2538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betty Williams (left) and Mairead Corrigan during a rally for peace in Northern Ireland \u2013 the pair first met at the funeral for three children killed during the Troubles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Relations between the two women soured and they were soon completely ignoring each other. In 1978 Williams severed links to the movement she had co-founded. While Corrigan, a devout Catholic, stuck to her primary concern of bringing an end to the local troubles, Williams, dazzled by the attention she received from journalists and broadcasters, focused on becoming an international peace activist and enjoying the associated lifestyle.</p> <p>In the years to follow she travelled widely on her own global peace mission, rubbing shoulders with Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, Yasser Arafat and Aung San Suu Kyi. She was showered with invitations to lecture worldwide and invited to participate in many global peace initiatives. In the process she came to know activist celebrities such as Joan Baez and Sharon Stone and the US presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, together with senior figures at the UN. In all she accumulated 20 awards and doctorates and served on the boards of 15 international peace and children\u2019s organisations.</p> <p>It was all a far cry from her early life in wartime Belfast, the daughter of a Protestant butcher, Jim Smyth, and his Catholic wife, a part-time waitress. Betty, who had a younger sister, Maggie, first attended St Teresa\u2019s primary school and then St Dominic\u2019s grammar.

  "<p>Has the national life of this country ever been transformed so completely and at such a speed? In the course of a week, the British landscape has changed and changed utterly. Once crowded streets are deserted. Schools are closed, summer exams cancelled. Football grounds are shuttered and padlocked. Theatres are dark, cinemas silent.

Each day has brought news that, in normal times, would constitute an epochal, ground-shaking development but which, in the current climate, has struggled for airtime. The Bank of England cut interest rates to their lowest level since the Bank was founded in 1694, and announced an infusion of \u00a3200bn. The pound slid to its lowest level against the dollar since the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, a Conservative government has torn up 40 years of small-state, free market doctrine, first promising to spend a staggering \u00a3330bn, and then on Friday evening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">committing to pay</a> 80% of the wages of workers who have had to down tools, with \u201cno limit\u201d on the funds available. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, did not exaggerate when he said nothing like this had ever been done before. Even hardcore socialism usually stopped short of calling for the government to take on the payroll of private sector employers. Now it\u2019s Tory party policy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

Just as there are no atheists on a sinking ship, there are no free-marketeers in a pandemic. Suddenly the old arguments of left and right have melted away, as a Tory health secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1240899149303894017\">commands </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1240899149303894017\">the British manufacturing industry</a> to start making ventilators, explaining that only government \u2013 not the private sector \u2013 has the clout to fight this menace.</p> \n<p>Even the language has changed with astonishing speed. \u201cSocial distancing\u201d, \u201cself-isolation\u201d and \u201cWFH\u201d entered near-universal usage in a matter of days, matching the velocity with which personal behaviour had to change. It began with the awkwardness of the rejected handshake, an elbow-bump offered in its place, a practice which seemed novel a mere fortnight ago \u2013 and it ends with people sharing a pint by each drinking alone in their homes, but doing it on a screen via FaceTime, Skype or Zoom.</p> \n<p>In this new landscape, the only meeting places are virtual, with social media the obvious forum. Much of the online conversation has consisted of bickering over the best way to resist the disease, with last year\u2019s armchair Brexit experts now miraculously reborn as amateur epidemiologists, seamlessly able to move from offering detailed commentary on international trade to the finer points of herd immunity. </p> \n<p>Social media\u2019s most energetic function has been as village rumour mill. On Wednesday, the Twitter talk was of a \u201cLondon lockdown\u201d, as people traded frantic word they\u2019d picked up \u2013 often from a friend of a friend in the government/police/army \u2013 that the capital was about to be sealed off, all entry in and out prohibited, armed checkpoints on the M25. But the next day, Boris Johnson was at his 5pm podium in Downing Street installing no ring of steel around the city, but merely issuing advice and recommendations \u2013 not even ordering the pubs to lock their doors, let alone locking down London.</p> \n<p>Throughout, Britons have groped for the right comparison and of course there was only ever going to be one. \u201cThe Queen\u2019s blitz spirit pledge: I\u2019m ready to play my part,\u201d splashed Friday\u2019s Daily Mail. In this telling, the coronavirus is the Nazi enemy and Britons will once again stand together, united, ready to endure any hardship and sacrifice any personal comfort for the sake of our collective survival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS/\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>It barely matters that that\u2019s a shaky version of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14c86fe8-69d4-11ea-a6ac-9122541af204\">what actually happened in the blitz</a> \u2013 when East Enders booed the visiting King and Queen, when the rich had access to better, more comfortable underground shelters and when black marketeers made a nice living out of everyone else\u2019s suffering. Never mind that, 1940 remains <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/enemies-within-11-february-2012\">the creation myth of modern Britain</a>, the ultimate yardstick by which any national experience is measured. In the case of the coronavirus, though, it feels an especially bad fit.</p> \n<p>For one thing, stoicism in the face of danger has not quite been our national look. Those images of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/11/monday-night-toilet-roll-fights-sport-age-coronavirus-marina-hyde\">shoppers coming to blows in the supermarket aisles</a>, wrestling over bulk packets of toilet roll, might not be ones to inspire our grandchildren. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/1240916975276175360\">one observer put it</a>, contemplating yet another shared photograph of a denuded grocery store: \u201cAll those empty shelves in supermarkets are where the stiff upper lips were supposed to be. So much for national self-mythology.\u201d </p> \n<p>Still, what many mean to invoke when they speak of the second world war is unity. It\u2019s too early to say now whether Britons are united in the face of this crisis, which has a long way to run. The initial signs were encouraging. Opposition politicians have been willing to support their government counterparts, with political point-scoring kept to a minimum. Johnson\u2019s readiness to defer to the experts, sharing his daily platform with the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser, has marked a welcome contrast with his own, populist, expert-bashing during the 2016 Brexit referendum \u2013 and the public had seemed to follow the PM\u2019s cue. When it was a matter of just washing our hands and singing Happy Birthday twice, it was easy to maintain consensus, guided by the science.</p> \n<p>But cracks are showing now. Even those who want to be trusting of those in authority, who\u2019ve been willing to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt, have been asking why Britain is not testing for the virus with the same thoroughness as, say, Germany.</p> \n<p>Why are doctors and nurses not being routinely tested, or given the right protective equipment? Why were more ventilators not ordered weeks ago? And if the government is asking people to stay home, what will it do to ensure they can afford to do that? How will it put money in the pockets of the self-employed now earning nothing? How will it prevent small businesses going under, enabling them to pay their workers, so they can feed their families? Sunak sought to address those last three questions with his extraordinary announcement on Friday. But the government has been on the back foot, forced to react, on all of them.</p> \n<p>These are not mere differences of opinion. As in the blitz, there are differences in behaviour, which seem to speak, ultimately, to differences in character. Britannia Hotels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/scottish-hotel-sacks-12-staff-over-coronavirus-making-them-homeless\">sacked more than a dozen staff</a> from their hotel in the Scottish Highlands this week via a \u201cservices no longer required\u201d letter, ordering those workers to leave the premises, instantly rendering them homeless. At the same time, football pundit Gary Neville <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-gary-neville-says-nhs-staff-will-stay-at-his-hotels-for-free-video\">announced that the two hotels he owns</a> with his former teammate Ryan Giggs would be closed to the public, and given over instead, free of charge, to NHS workers unable to stay with their families. The employees would keep their jobs and be paid in the normal way.</p> \n<p>There were reports of local grocery stores creating care packages for the elderly, delivering them to their door for free. But there was also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1240890320008642562?s=20\">a viral video of a nurse</a>, Dawn Bilbrough, sobbing into the camera after coming off a 48-hour shift only to discover there was no food left in the shops. Bilbrough warned those picking the shelves clean that they would need nurses like her to look after them \u201cwhen you\u2019re at your lowest\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many of these divisions come down to the government\u2019s preference \u2013 which held until Friday \u2013 for the voluntary over the compulsory. By making a visit to a pub or cafe a matter of individual choice, it opened up a rift between those who chose to stay home and those who didn\u2019t, with the former increasingly resenting the latter. On one side, you had Wetherspoons\u2019 owner Tim Martin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1240965216634109954?s=20\">demanding pubs like his stay open</a> \u2013 breezily asserting without evidence that \u201cthere\u2019s hardly been any transmission of the virus within pubs\u201d \u2013 while an intensive care consultant called a phone-in programme, <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/tom-swarbrick/doctor-nhs-cant-cope-with-coronavirus-stay-home/\">imploring listeners</a> to understand that if you go to the pub, \u201cit\u2019s going to kill people\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some of that divide is regional \u2013 London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/london-hospitals-struggle-to-cope-with-coronavirus-surge\">infection rates have soared</a>, as the buses and underground have stayed running and bars remain packed \u2013 and some of it is generational, with young people singled out for failing to heed the advice and stay home. But all of it arose from Johnson\u2019s reluctance to lay down the law. Long a social libertarian who bristled against the roundhead diktats of \u201cthe nanny state\u201d, Johnson realised too late that his approach was just too cavalier.</p> \n<p>Once controls become more stringent, some of the current divisions will surely fall away. Once everyone is in the same situation, even if that means everyone equally confined to their homes, it will be hard, painfully so. But we will all be in it together.</p> \n<p>What has been spoken of less in this week of transformation is the emotion driving it all: namely, fear. When people see that Britain is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1240723388336877569?s=20\">on an even steeper death curve than Italy</a>, they become terrified. Arguing about policy on Twitter is a good displacement activity for people petrified of dying a horrible death in a hospital too overrun to help. Even before it has killed Britons in huge numbers, it\u2019s already got under our skin \u2013 reminding us that we are not masters of nature, but vulnerable to a tiny, microscopic virus; that even the mighty civilisation we have built on these islands hangs by a thread.</p>",

  "<p>Online romance is rarely easy, but when Elin and David matched on Tinder a week ago, little did they think that by getting together they would be falling foul of government advice. </p> <p>\u201cWe were talking [on the app] for a few days and planning to meet up,\u201d said David, who is 29 and lives in Manchester. \u201cBut over the weekend the coronavirus situation was getting progressively worse and everything started getting cancelled.\u201d</p> <p>Like many others who have found their lives upended by an international crisis, they decided to work out an alternative. Elin, 33, from Calderdale, West Yorkshire, had an idea: she suggested that they Skype each other while cooking the same dish.</p> <p>David found them a Nigel Slater recipe from the Guardian to try: slow-cooked spiced aubergine. \u201cPart steam, part fry,\u201d the instructions said. It seemed promising. It wasn\u2019t exactly Channel 4\u2019s First Dates, but it was something.</p> <p>When the evening arrived, the quality of the video wasn\u2019t good enough, so they switched to speaking on the phone. Despite the technical difficulties, though, it seemed to go well.</p> <p>\u201cWe got to talk loads and find out about each other,\u201d said David. \u201cThere were a couple of moments when we just went quiet because we were concentrating on cooking, chopping the vegetables or something,\u201d said Elin. \u201cThen I took it to the bedroom, in that I just sat on my bed.\u201d</p> <p>Elin and David are not the only ones to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/singleton-search-love-coronavirus-dating-risks\">persevering with dating</a> as the global pandemic turns people\u2019s lives upside down. OKCupid said 50m messages were sent on its dating service in the past month by people talking for the first time, with still more expected to do so this month. The dating app Tinder also noted that as an area becomes affected by isolation measures, new conversations are taking place and they last longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59160bddadf78f0d623e0ea603f71c20596bee38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59160bddadf78f0d623e0ea603f71c20596bee38/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two spiced aubergine dishes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The meals Elin and David cooked</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Handouts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for Tinder said: \u201cThis epidemic is also changing the tenor of connection in the hardest hit places. More people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/10/looking-for-love-wash-your-hands-first-say-dating-apps\">using Tinder bios</a> to show their concern for others. For example, asking \u2018how is everyone\u2019 instead of putting their life motto.\u201d</p> <p>One online dater, Pete, 34, said everyone now has an easy icebreaker: \u201cI would say there is an easy opening chat subject at the moment. How are you surviving? Are you working from home? There is a good reason to start talking.\u201d</p> <p>But the difficulty of taking the conversation offline, he said, was a source of frustration.</p> <p>\u201cI was supposed to be going on a date with a doctor tonight but she has been treating those with coronavirus ... We have taken the view it is not a good idea to meet but we will do a FaceTime call over the weekend. However, it is not the same.\u201d</p> <p>For those at a more advanced stage in their relationships, the prospects are ambiguous. Divorce lawyers suggest that marriages may be tested by the exceptional circumstances, but that time together could in the end help iron out more problems than it creates.</p> <p>Karin Walker, family lawyer at KGW divorce law, said: \u201cSadly divorce rates go up at Christmas when people spend too much time together.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think this is very different. It will cause people to look at family and relationship and relationship breakdown in a different way. I have noticed more people out walking together early in the morning. Normally it\u2019s just me and my dog and no one else but couples are out walking together ... Maybe we will go back to games and talking to each other, which we do far too little of in our rush around lives.\u201d</p> <p>Mandy Rimmer, a partner at the family department of Stephensons Solicitors, said: \u201cShortly after world war two there was a peak in divorce rates. I do think when people go through something like this, with so much uncertainty and idea of what will happen and how long it will go on for they think life\u2019s too short.\u201d</p> <p>David and Elin\u2019s date might have been an unusual one, but David is hoping for a repeat, virtual or otherwise. He did say, though, that he hoped to find a tastier recipe next time. \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to know that life is carrying on, people are still finding ways to do things like dating,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Elin said: \u201cI think people are maybe more conscious at the moment about the need to be social with others. They are making extra effort, whether it\u2019s through communal video calls or chatting with their entire family and their friends.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u2022 This advice is based on current US guidelines. For specific advice in other countries please check your government or public health authority website</strong></p> \n<p>As schools close around the world, families are spending more time in close quarters. Three experts weigh in on how kids, and everyone else, can stay safe.</p> \n<h2><strong>What do we understand about Covid-19\u2019s risks to children?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Akiko Iwasaki: </strong>Kids are definitely exposed and infected with this virus \u2026 They have to be hospitalized and some of them have to be intubated. So it\u2019s not that kids are completely resistant, but the lethality is much lower than in other age groups. <em>[Editor\u2019s note: A <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702\">report</a> </em><em> </em><em> found that of over 2,000 confirmed and suspected cases among children in China, nearly 6% </em><em> became seriously ill and one 14-year-old boy with a confirmed case died.]</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Do we have to worry about kids spreading Covid-19 to others?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> John Carl:</strong> The probability probably is higher because for toddler-age kids, there\u2019s more need to have direct contact to control where they are. So <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/how-to-social-distance-convince-friends-family\">social distancing</a> becomes a little bit more difficult.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is it possible to become infected by changing diapers?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Gregory Poland:</strong> In adults, 3-5% of the people affected do excrete the virus in their stool. I don\u2019t have any data, but there\u2019s no reason to think that wouldn\u2019t also happen in kids. So I would err on the side of caution and handle diapers as if they might be [contaminated]. Throw them into a plastic bag and wash your hands.</p> \n<p>For older kids, in addition to hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, teach them about bathroom habits. One thing people don\u2019t know about is the \u201ctoilet cloud plume\u201d. When you flush the toilet with the lid open, you spray virus over every surface in that bathroom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/coronavirus-dashboard-blog-size\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Should we be keeping kids away from grandparents? What if a grandparent is a primary caregiver?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Carl:</strong> If they\u2019re showing symptoms, yes. The issue, of course, is that if they\u2019re having much milder symptoms than the standard adult would then it\u2019s less obvious that they themselves may be infected.</p> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>That\u2019s why public health measures to close down schools and daycares need to happen immediately. That way, kids aren\u2019t going to be exposed to the virus so they can live and be cared for by grandparents without the risk of them bringing the virus home. The earlier that can be done, the less risk the grandparents will be exposed to.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should I take my kid out of daycare if it isn\u2019t closed already?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>If you have a choice. I would not put my children in daycare right now. Some people have no choice if they\u2019re earning daily wages and need to go to work to even survive.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is it safe to go to playgrounds?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Carl: </strong>It\u2019s absolutely helpful both for the parent and child\u2019s mental health, in limited amounts, to go outdoors. Go for a walk, walk the dog, but monkey bars, playsets and gyms? That\u2019s a time when you\u2019d have to use extraordinarily good <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2020/mar/04/cleaning-up-the-best-20-second-songs-to-wash-your-hands-to\">hand-washing</a> and I\u2019m not sure how you do this effectively.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about playdates? Or if a friend or neighbor asks you to babysit?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki:</strong> Playdates are a bad idea right now. And of course, in any other time, it would be a very nice gesture to watch a friend or neighbor\u2019s kids, but right now I\u2019m not even allowing my children to play with friends\u2019 or neighbors\u2019 kids.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bde155c3-43e7-4929-8506-bb043a798a88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JsWf-2nN1Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>How can you isolate yourself from your own children if one of you has been exposed?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Carl:</strong> If there\u2019s another parent in the household that can carry the ball, then that person becomes the primary caregiver, at least for a while. But, wash your hands, try to not cough if you\u2019re cooking over the stove \u2013 you\u2019re going to do things that you need to do to get through the day, but remove yourself as much as possible. Isolate yourself in your bedroom.</p> \n<p>Probably the greatest issue, which is something the [American] Academy of Pediatrics would probably frown on anyway, is co-sleeping. That\u2019s probably a huge likely risk factor.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s much easier when the kids are older. I have a 20-year-old who came home from college four or five days ago with a viral respiratory infection and a low-grade fever. We\u2019re insisting pretty strictly that he maintain isolation in his room as much as possible. I\u2019m checking in with occupational health, monitoring my temperature pretty regularly, so I can maintain my activity and see patients. I have no symptoms whatsoever at the present time, and sure as heck don\u2019t want to and I want to protect my own patients.</p> \n<p><strong>Poland:</strong> One thing that\u2019s really, really important is you got to teach people <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsyhQ0oBs\">how to wash their hands</a>. Everybody thinks they know how. I have never, ever \u2013 and in case I\u2019m not being clear \u2013 never, ever seen a layperson wash their hands properly.</p> \n<h2><strong>Experts:</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr John Carl, pediatric pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr Akiko Iwasaki, professor of immunology at Yale University</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr Gregory Poland, vaccine expert and internal medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic</p></li> \n</ul>",

  "<p>The residents of a remote village on the Japanese island of Shikoku have spent almost two decades reusing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/recycling\">recycling</a> and reducing, united behind a mission to end their dependence on incinerators and landfill as the world struggles to tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate emergency</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plastic\">plastic waste</a> crisis.</p> <p>Although Kamikatsu, an hour\u2019s drive from the nearest city, Tokushima, and 370 miles from Tokyo, has not managed to banish waste altogether, its heroic efforts have inspired other communities in Japan and further afield to take up the zero-waste challenge.</p> <p>Household waste must be separated into no fewer than 45 categories, before being taken to a collection centre where volunteers ensure items go into the correct bin, occasionally issuing polite reminders to anyone who forgets to take the lid and label off a plastic bottle or remove nails from a plank of wood.</p> <p>Items still in good condition end up at the Kuru Kuru recycling store, where residents can drop off or take home merchandise \u2013 mostly clothes, crockery and ornaments \u2013 free of charge.</p> <p>Not even the coronavirus pandemic has hampered the community\u2019s effort to bring waste generation down to nought (there are no orders to self-isolate in that part of Japan) but it was a quest with rather difficult beginnings.</p> <p>In 2000, the village was forced to change the way it managed its waste when a strict new law on dioxin emissions forced it to shut down its two small incinerators.</p> <p>The ageing, shrinking community did not have the money to build new incinerators or transport its waste to out-of-town facilities. The only option was to create less rubbish and to recycle as many items as possible.</p> <p>Three years later, Kamikatsu became the first place in Japan to pass a zero <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/waste\">waste</a> declaration \u2013 a statement of intent that met with initial opposition but which in the years since has created an unlikely community of ecowarriors.</p> <p>There were complaints that the regular cycle of sorting, washing and disposing of rubbish would prove too much for the village\u2019s 1,500 residents, who found themselves having to sort rubbish into myriad types, to compost food waste and to wash plastic bags and bottles so they could be recycled.</p> <p>\u201cYou are always going to get people who are uncooperative in any community-level project,\u201d said Akira Sakano, the head of Kamikatsu\u2019s nonprofit Zero Waste Academy, formed in 2005.</p> <p>Instead, she added, the academy focused its energies on the 80% of residents who supported the venture and who would, in time, persuade sceptics to follow suit.</p> <p>She said the village had struggled to find a way to recycle certain items that didn\u2019t fit into its waste categories, because manufacturers continued to use non-recyclable materials that inevitably found their way into Kamikatsu households.</p> <p>\u201cOur goal was to achieve zero waste by 2020, but we have encountered obstacles that involve stakeholders and regulations outside of our scope,\u201d said Sakano . \u201cAnd certain products are designed for single use, such as sanitary products, which are difficult to segregate because of the nature of the waste product.\u201d</p> <p>While reducing consumption has proved difficult, most villagers have embraced the recycling regime. As a result, the village has been able to keep the vast majority of its waste out of incinerators and landfill.</p> <p>Products that contain parts that fit into two or more categories have to be taken apart and their components placed in the correct bin. Milk cartons, cans, and even plastic food wrappers and shopping bags must be washed before being thrown out, and newspapers placed in neat bundles, secured with twine made from recycled milk cartons.</p> <p>Glass bottles are relieved of their caps and sorted by colour. Plastic bottles that once contained soy sauce or cooking oil are kept in a separate bin space with PET bottles used for drinks.</p> <p>In fiscal 2016, Kamikatsu recycled 81% of the waste it produced, compared to a national average of just 20%. The small number of items that have proved impossible to recycle, including leather shoes, nappies and other sanitary products, are sent to an incinerator outside the village.</p> <p>And it began addressing the growing problem of plastic, which makes up the majority of the residents\u2019 waste, well before the rest of the country.</p> <p>Japan is the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/27/japans-plastic-problem-tokyo-spearheads-push-at-g20-to-tackle-waste\">second-biggest producer of plastic waste</a> per capita after the US. Its consumers get through about 30bn plastic shopping bags a year, and it once shipped 1.5m tonnes of plastic waste to China every year until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/07/chinese-ban-on-plastic-waste-imports-could-see-uk-pollution-rise\">Beijing banned the imports in 2017</a>.</p> <p>As word of its campaign spread, the village has hosted officials and campaigners from overseas and other parts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> hoping to emulate the scheme in their own communities.</p> <p>Not all residents are convinced that the project can be easily replicated elsewhere, however. \u201cIt works because we\u2019re only 1,500 people here,\u201d said Naoko Yokoyama, who moved to Kamikatsu from Kyoto about two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be difficult in a big town with a larger population,\u201d because authorities would struggle to enforce it, Yokoyama told Agence France-Presse as the zero-waste deadline approached last year.</p> <p>To give the village a fighting chance of reaching its target at a later date, residents are encouraged not to buy or use products that may end up as waste, through a scheme that rewards them with points whenever they refuse single-use plastics. The points can then be used to buy other items.</p> <p>Sakano said the future of the zero-waste project would depend on businesses and local governments collaborating to make it easier for households to recycle, but added that individuals still had a duty to reuse and reduce. \u201cAs you can imagine, it\u2019s a lot easier to simply refuse plastic bags than to have to build somewhere to recycle them.\u201d</p> <p><em>Agencies contributed to this report</em></p>",
  "<p>A feeding frenzy is under way by lobbyists representing airlines, hotels, cruise lines, casinos and other powerful interests as Congress and the Trump administration craft a $1tn stimulus bill to provide hundreds of billions each for big industries, small businesses and individuals hurt by the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-us-donald-trump-response-republicans-stock-scandal-live-updates\">US coronavirus news live: Trump invokes act to speed up medical supply production as New York extends lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Washington lobbyists and watchdog groups say that in their lobbying blitzes industries have been vying aggressively with each other in a compressed timeframe to grab multibillion-dollar bailout loans and other assistance.</p> \n<p>Lobbying yielded huge dividends on Thursday when a giant stimulus plan authored by Senate Republicans and the Treasury was released. The Republican measure, which Democrats were shut out of, calls for $500bn in direct payments to individuals; $300bn in small business assistance; and $200bn, mainly in loans, for big industries such as airlines, cruise companies and hotels hurt financially by the pandemic.</p> \n<p>The package also contains support for healthcare professionals and patients and corporate tax cuts.</p> \n<p>However, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, quickly criticized key parts of this Republican package, and are presenting alternative measures in a newly released $750bn Democratic Senate plan while a House one is being crafted. The two Democrats issued a statement backing plans that \u201cput workers first\u201d, with stronger provisions to prevent companies using bailout loans for stock buybacks and executive pay hikes.</p> \n<p>But industry lobbyists scored big in the Republican stimulus plan and are expected to keep the pressure on as Congress works to forge a compromise.</p> \n<p>The Republican bill provides passenger airlines and air cargo carriers up to $58bn in loans, while a mix of hotels, cruise ships, shopping malls and other sectors were given $150bn to help weather the economic downturn.</p> \n<p>Hours before the Republican measure was released, Trump said he expected the package would provide help for the airlines, cruise lines and \u201cprobably hotels\u201d. On Tuesday, Trump met with hotel industry executives who reportedly asked for $150bn in help and another $100bn for their suppliers.</p> \n<p>Watchdog groups are raising red flags about the $50bn loan package for America\u2019s big passenger airlines which in recent years have drawn growing consumer complaints, while spending tens of billions on stock buybacks. And the $150bn in the Republican bill for the well-connected hotel industry \u2013 which Trump\u2019s family business is heavily engaged in \u2013 and other industries have also generated criticism.</p> \n<p>\u201cAn emergency like this highlights the inequities of a system where well-connected industries can lobby directly for specific carve-outs and potentially cushion wealthy executives,\u201d said Robert Maguire, research director at the watchdog Crew.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the Trump era, however, that imbalance comes with the unprecedented conflicts of interest that arise from the fact that the president still owns and profits from businesses in industries that are calling for billions in taxpayer assistance \u2013 which, if approved, would benefit him personally.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other tensions have been sparked by heavy lobbying by financially battered and scandal tarred aircraft maker Boeing which has sought billions in help</p> \n<p>Trump said on Wednesday: \u201cWe have to protect Boeing.\u201d But one airline industry lobbyist said he sees \u201cno sympathy for Boeing during the coronavirus crisis\u201d. It\u2019s not clear if the Republican bill gives them a shot at financial help.</p> \n<p>Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on his chamber\u2019s finance panel, in a statement told the Guardian he will not back a \u201cno-strings attached bailout laden with corporate tax goodies that primarily benefits CEOs. These industries got massive tax breaks just two years ago, spending billions on stock buybacks for wealthy shareholders, so there would need to be significant guardrails on any assistance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some lobbyists warn of a public backlash if the stimulus package turns into a big honeypot where money is disbursed to big business with too few controls. \u201cI think the public is going to look very skeptically at special industry bailouts that don\u2019t address critical needs in the midst of the crisis,\u201d said John Jonas, a veteran healthcare lobbyist with Akin Gump, a giant law and lobbying firm.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis kind of economic package is going to create a lot of mischief,\u201d said Don Duncan, who used to run the DC office of oil giant ConocoPhillips. \u201cCongress and the administration need to clearly define where such economic help is justified and needed most to avoid misuse of tax dollars.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f167207d-f90d-4942-bade-b0e653061cd6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wDdyn4Kbffs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Unlike many big lobbying skirmishes, this one has been moving at warp speed. Other veteran influence peddlers say the lobbying frenzy has been spurred by the huge sums of money up for grabs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a $1tn package, many industries will put their hats in the ring,\u201d quipped one lobbyist.</p> \n<p>Cruise lines, for instance, have pushed hard for financial help to offset lost business, and may get some special sympathy in an election year since they are a big player in the key battleground state of Florida.</p> \n<p>\u201cFlorida is the center of the industry, and important in 2020,\u201d said a lobbyist who seemed confident they would get help.</p> \n<p>To move the Republican bill out of the Senate quickly, lobbyists and their Republican allies are trying to line up seven moderate Democrats to make it filibuster-proof, and McConnell on Friday said he hoped the Senate would be ready to vote on Monday. But there\u2019s considerable uncertainty if that will happen without making some major concessions to Democrats, as well as some Republican senators who have various concerns.</p> \n<p>Schumer and Pelosi seem committed to more worker protection measures and provisions to ensure that industry loans will not lead to corporate boondoggles. Pelosi and Schumer fired off an early salvo in a joint statement.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are beginning to review Senator McConnell\u2019s proposal and on first reading, it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The two top Democrats are expected to have significant input into the final bill which could be approved before month\u2019s end by both chambers after significant compromises are hashed out \u2013 as lobbyists for airlines, hotels and other industries keep the heat on to get as much as possible.</p>",

  "<p>Night sweats, mood swings \u2013 language around the menopause is all rather negative and even, some might say, derogatory. It implies it\u2019s a time of things \u201cwinding down\u201d, \u201cending\u201d, \u201cdrying up\u201d.</p> <p>Well, <em>most</em> things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly <em>less</em> dry.</p> <p>Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman\u2019s periods begin to <em>end</em>, it\u2019s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems \u2013 especially bladder weakness.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh, I\u2019ll wet myself!\u201d might seem like an age-old joke, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it\u2019s no laughing matter. There\u2019s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c8ccac840282301e4ec18380a88ed8912301b5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c8ccac840282301e4ec18380a88ed8912301b5d/0_0_592_2/500.png\" alt=\"spacer\" width=\"500\" height=\"2\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71b5e03897b0967215ad5956ff47cec015403ca4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71b5e03897b0967215ad5956ff47cec015403ca4/38_0_1507_1372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'Women are worried they'll spoil the intimacy'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"910\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c8ccac840282301e4ec18380a88ed8912301b5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c8ccac840282301e4ec18380a88ed8912301b5d/0_0_592_2/500.png\" alt=\"spacer\" width=\"500\" height=\"2\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After all, when do you slip \u201cI\u2019d love to have an early night but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll wet the bed!\u201d into the conversation, whether you\u2019re with a long-term partner or someone new?</p> <p>The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness.

Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: \u201cI think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.\u201d Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she\u2019s not cold on the red carpet.</p> <p>OK, so the conversation is shifting \u2013 just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England\u2019s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary \u2013 bladder weakness.</p> <p>We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings \u2013 all with increasing honesty. But then there\u2019s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.</p> <p>Why is it the one part of menopause women can\u2019t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing \u2013 the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example \u2013 but when it comes to sex, it\u2019s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they\u2019ll spoil the intimacy that they don\u2019t have sex and even make up excuses, or \u201cblame\u201d menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.</p> <p>After all, when you\u2019re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn\u2019t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look \u2013 to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don\u2019t mention the bladder weakness, right?!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d979ae63f0fc9845f8009987ee040a6e688c1bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d979ae63f0fc9845f8009987ee040a6e688c1bc/0_0_1612_1372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'As periods end and change, we have to adjust'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"851\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As periods end and change, we have to adjust.

Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she\u2019s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life.

The punishment for the Fort Worth woman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/27/crime-of-voting-texas-woman-crystal-mason-five-years-prison\">Crystal Mason</a>, stirred national outrage because of its severity, prompting accusations that prosecutors were trying to intimidate Texans from voting.</p> <p>Four years ago, Mason was on supervised release, similar to probation, for a federal felony conviction related to tax fraud. She didn\u2019t know that Texas prohibits felons from voting until they finish their sentence entirely. Mason voted in the last presidential election at the urging of her mother and cast a provisional ballot when poll workers couldn\u2019t find her name on the voter registration rolls. The ballot was never counted because Mason was not an eligible voter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-vote-by-mail-restrictions-us\">Coronavirus exposes absurdity of vote by mail restrictions in US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During her <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6219544/Crystal-Mason-Trial-Transcript.pdf\">2018 trial</a> probation officials testified that they never told Mason she could not vote, but the appeals court said that didn\u2019t matter. Mason was guilty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/28/crystal-mason-begins-prison-sentence-in-texas-for-of-voting\">the court said</a>, because she knew she was on supervised release. \u201cContrary to Mason\u2019s assertion, the fact that she did not know she was legally ineligible to vote was irrelevant to her prosecution,\u201d Justice Wade Birdwell wrote for a three-judge panel on Texas\u2019 second court of appeals.</p> <p>\u201cThese are difficult times for me, but I have faith that with the help of my family and God, right will prevail,\u201d Mason said in a statement on Friday. \u201cA punishment of five years in jail for doing what I thought was my civic duty, and just as I was getting my family\u2019s life together, is not simply unfair, it\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>The case has already taken a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crystal-mason-prison-sentence_n_5d3b04e8e4b0c31569e9fb94\">significant toll</a> on Mason, who turns 45 on Saturday. After she was arrested in 2017, the life she had been working to rebuild since getting out of federal prison in 2015 crumbled. She lost her job, which provided the main source of income for her family, which includes three children, four of her brother\u2019s children who she raised, and her grandchildren.</p> <p>Because she was convicted of illegal voting while on supervised release, a federal judge had also sent her back to federal prison in late 2018, where she served several months. Her teenage daughter Taylor put off going to college to come home and run the household. The family depended in part on donations from a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice4crystal\">GoFundMe account</a>. Since her conviction, Mason has become more politically active \u2013 she hosted a voter registration drive ahead of Texas\u2019s primary.</p> <p>Thomas Buser-Clancy, an attorney with the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union who helped represent Mason, said Mason\u2019s legal team will appeal. \u201cCrystal submitted a provisional ballot that was not counted, she did not vote illegally,\u201d he said. Mason will remain out of prison on bond while the appeal is pending.</p> <p>Texas is one of 48 states that strip people with felony convictions of the right to vote, but the rules on when people regain the right to vote vary widely from state to state and are often extremely confusing, <a href=\"https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-Crazy-Quilt-of-Tiny-Pieces-State-and-Local-Administration-of-American-Criminal-Disenfranchisement-Laws.pdf\">even to elections officials</a>. The appeals court\u2019s ruling was alarming because it confirmed that any voter in Texas who was unsure about their voter eligibility could be criminally prosecuted if they voted while ineligible, said Sasha Samberg-Champion, a former Department of Justice attorney who was not involved in the case.</p> <p>\u201cIt should be obvious that this is a profoundly dangerous vision of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the legal standard that is applied by any state or country that takes the right to vote seriously.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to prosecute Mason was unusual. Since 2014, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crystal-mason-provisional-ballot_n_5d5c5f88e4b0d1e113695972\">at least 12,668 people</a> have voted using a provisional ballot in Tarrant county and 88% of them have been rejected because the voter was not eligible. Mason is the only voter who used a provisional ballot who was prosecuted for illegal voting.</p> <p>The court\u2019s opinion on Thursday goes further than what prosecutors argued during Mason\u2019s trial. There, they argued that Mason read <a href=\"https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2019/07/26/5d3b706ce4b0c31569eada09.pdf\">tiny print on an affidavit</a> she signed before casting a provisional ballot and therefore knew she was ineligible. Mason said she never read the language and that the head election judge, who was also her neighbor, never alerted her to it. This week, the court said none of that mattered.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough Mason may not have known with certainty that being on supervised release as part of her federal conviction made her ineligible to vote under Texas law or that so voting is a crime \u2026 she voted anyway, signing a form affirming her eligibility in the process despite the fact that she was not certain,\u201d Birdwell wrote.</p> <p>Mason\u2019s lawyers will ask the full appeals court to rehear the case, and then could appeal to the Texas court of criminal appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. If Mason loses at that high court, her lawyers could ask the US supreme court to take the case.</p> <p>\u201cThis ruling is a severe misinterpretation of the law,\u201d said Alison Grinter, an attorney representing Mason. \u201cIt undercuts efforts to encourage voter turnout through the Help America Vote Act and punishes ordinary voters for attempting to fulfil their civic duty in a way that is at complete odds with our democratic principles.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Detroit automakers shut down their North American plants this week amid growing fears over coronavirus spreading among blue-collar employees working in tight quarters.</p> <p>Soon they could be back \u2013 building ventilators as a shortage presents the US with a potential health crisis.</p> <p>Relations between the Big Three \u2013 General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler \u2013 have been tense of late after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/20/general-motors-strike-auto-workers-hope-a-deal-will-change-the-industry\">GM workers walked</a> out in their first strike in a decade.</p> <p>But most workers are probably open to returning to the line, said D\u2019Andre Jackson, a United Auto Workers (UAW) committee representative at GM\u2019s Flint Assembly Plant. He added that he would \u201cgo back if it would help the country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think the majority of the UAW members wouldn\u2019t mind doing what it takes to get America back running,\u201d Jackson said. Though workers just demanded to leave the plant over coronavirus fears, Jackson said the cause has changed.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of working for profit, you\u2019re working to help save some lives, and I think a lot of people would join in on that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what they did during wartime, and that\u2019s what they say we\u2019re in now. I think that if it was on a voluntary basis they could get people to go back in.\u201d</p> <p>Both automakers have confirmed that they are in discussions with the US government, which this week invoked the Defense Production Act, legislation that goes back to the second world war and grants the president broad powers to direct industrial production.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, we are doing an internal study to evaluate this as an option, and we are looking at ways we could help during this crisis including potentially supporting production of medical equipment such as ventilators,\u201d a GM spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, told the Guardian.</p> <p>However, a United Auto Workers spokesman, Brian Rothenberg, said the proposal had not been run by the union. Its leadership was busy working to shut down the plants and did not immediately have a comment, he added.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear how retooling the factories or sending workers back into them during a pandemic might work. The Trump administration economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told Fox News this week that an executive said she \u201cmight even ask them to do it on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons. That\u2019s the kind of can-do spirit that we\u2019re hearing and seeing\u201d.</p> <p>Ford, which will suspend production following Thursday evening shifts through 30 March, said in a statement that it \u201cstands ready to help the administration in any way we can, including the possibility of producing ventilators and other equipment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had preliminary discussions with the US governments and are looking into the feasibility. It\u2019s vital that we all pull together to help the country weather this crisis and come out the other side stronger than ever,\u201d it said.</p> <p>In the meantime some 150,000 UAW workers will be put on a temporary layoff. A GM spokesman, David Barnas, said employees \u201cwill be compensated\u201d, though specifics were still being hammered out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, but they should\u2019ve done it a couple days ago,\u201d said a worker from Ford\u2019s Dearborn Truck Plant who declined to provide his name.</p> <p>The UAW has been pushing for temporary closures for several days. Automakers initially resisted those calls, prompting threats of a walkout among an increasingly frustrated workforce. On Monday, UAW Local 600 filed a grievance at the Dearborn Truck Plant in which it demanded a two-week suspension and coronavirus testing for all employees.</p> <p>Any return to work will have to come with better safety protections for workers during the pandemic.</p> <p>The UAW president, Rory Gamble, said temporary closures were \u201cthe prudent thing to do\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese companies will be put on notice that the UAW will use any and all measures to protect our brothers and sisters who are working in their facilities,\u201d Gamble said. \u201cAnd make no mistake, we have powerful allies who have stepped up to help us.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Tiger King, a new Netflix docuseries resulting from a five-year odyssey that fully earns the term wild, started, perhaps surprisingly, in the reptile world. In 2014, Eric Goode, a film-maker and longtime conservationist, was looking into a notorious snake dealer in south Florida when a stranger mentioned, off-hand, \u201ccheck out what I just bought\u201d. There\u2019s a collective \u201coh shit\u201d when he slides open his van to reveal a snow leopard resting in a cage, in 100F heat. \u201cIt just blew my mind: what is a snow leopard doing in the back of this guy\u2019s van?\u201d Goode says early in episode one. \u201cThat set me on this journey to really understand what is going on with people keeping big cats in this country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/19/after-truth-hbo-fake-news-pizzagate-documentary\">After Truth: how ordinary people are 'radicalized' by fake news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If only it stayed that simple. Over the next five years (and seven 45-minute episodes), Goode and co-director Rebecca Chaiklin followed the thread of private big cat ownership in the US \u2013 a disturbing if fascinating topic in and of itself \u2013 down a rabbit hole including, in no particular order: a murder-for-hire plot of a rival big cat owner, a theory that said owner fed her millionaire husband to tigers (there\u2019s no evidence to support this, though the husband\u2019s children from a previous marriage have aired the claim in local media), a guru-led harem based around an exotic animal park in Myrtle Beach, an accidental gun death and a federal sentence for animal abuse. That\u2019s aside from the astounding fact that there are more privately owned tigers in the US (somewhere between 5,000 to 10,000) than in the wild (fewer than 4,000), kept as pets or in side-of-the-highway wildlife menageries.</p> <p>But all that comes later, as Goode and Chaiklin follow the descent of one of the most notorious tiger owners in the US: Joe Maldonado-Passage, professionally known as <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/joe-exotic-a-dark-journey-into-the-world-of-a-man-gone-wild/\">Joe Exotic</a>, who ran a 16-acre private zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, with dozens of tigers, plus lions, bears and alligators. The film-makers first learned of Joe, an attention-loving eccentric with a bleached mullet, piercings and a penchant for leopard-print outfits, through Carole Baskin, operator of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Florida, and Joe\u2019s philosophical opposite. She had \u201ca hitlist of \u2018bad guys\u2019\u201d, recalled Chaiklin via email. \u201cAnd Joe was her No 1 bad guy\u201d as a prominent breeder of tigers for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/11/tigers-in-the-united-states-outnumber-those-in-the-wild-feature/\">cub petting</a>\u201d, a cottage industry in which people pay for photos with baby tigers, which grow to be unmanageable after about 12 weeks and are then frequently discarded, mistreated or euthanized. \u201cCarole was completely obsessed with Joe, which naturally made us quite curious about him,\u201d said Chaiklin. They reached out, and soon were filming in Wynnewood, about an hour north of the Texas border.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acTdxsoa428\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/acTdxsoa428?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Joe loved the publicity (\u201cJoe loved being on camera more than just about anything,\u201d said Chaiklin), his husbands (of which there have been several, sometimes overlapping, throughout the series\u2019s five-year timeline), and his YouTube and TV channels. But he hated Baskin, who he accused of feeding her husband to tigers in the late 1990s and who had successfully petitioned malls across the country from hosting his cub petting shows. \u201cThe feud between Carole and Joe and their obsession with each other was quite comedic at first \u2013 it had a very best in show feeling to it,\u201d said Chaiklin. But there was no end to the escalation \u2013 as documented in the show\u2019s early episodes, Joe frequently and crudely mocked Baskin in his broadcasts, threatening to set venomous snakes on her and even shooting a dummy of her in the head.</p> <p>And then, in September 2018, in the middle of the Tiger King project, he was arrested on charges of hiring two hitmen to kill Baskin. \u201cThis story is a film-maker\u2019s dream in how it evolved narratively,\u201d said Chaiklin. \u201cHowever, when you spend a lot of time filming with people, you get to know them quite well. So on a human level it was quite difficult to process some of the unexpected twists it took.\u201d Some of Joe\u2019s commentary in the series is taped from jail phone calls; in January 2020, he was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/animal-news/wildlife-park-owner-joe-exotic-sentenced-22-years-plot-kill-n1120566\">sentenced to 22 years in federal prison</a> for the Baskin plot and various wildlife violations.</p> <p>Still, Joe Exotic\u2019s fall from self-proclaimed Tiger King to prison is but one of several absurd threads in the series, in part because the world of big cat ownership in the US is isolated, unregulated and propagated by cults of personality. \u201cAll of these characters check out of mainstream life,\u201d said Goode via email. \u201cThey have created their own individual universes \u2013 little \u2018utopias\u2019 \u2013 along with their own set of rules, which ultimately was Joe\u2019s greatest downfall.\u201d For example, Goode and Chaiklin interview Bhagavan \u201cDoc\u201d Antle, a polygamous, guru-styled owner of Myrtle Beach Safari who has <a href=\"http://iowainformer.com/commentary/2017/03/bhagavan-doc-antle-rolling-stone-tigers/?fbclid=IwAR2Z5L_Xyl6rhDRBhZn_BxMzzre7Zp9GFTtJUS6HJnRZVjoaq_Qg4MPKDwQ\">been accused by a former long</a><a href=\"http://iowainformer.com/commentary/2017/03/bhagavan-doc-antle-rolling-stone-tigers/?fbclid=IwAR2Z5L_Xyl6rhDRBhZn_BxMzzre7Zp9GFTtJUS6HJnRZVjoaq_Qg4MPKDwQ\">time employee</a> of running a cult, and by Joe Exotic of euthanizing tiger cubs once they outgrow petting (he has denied these accusations; his compound was raided by federal agents in December 2019); Jeff Lowe, a former Joe Exotic business partner and con artist who took over and dismantled the Wynnewood zoo; and Tim Stark, a former Lowe partner and private zoo owner in southern Indiana who is <a href=\"https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/state-moves-to-restrict-access-to-big-cats-in-charlestown-zoo\">also under investigation</a> for animal cruelty. And that\u2019s not even getting into the staff and associates of each.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c046df2d367b7fd1bb33d21d364dc61d86300f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29c046df2d367b7fd1bb33d21d364dc61d86300f/0_0_2048_1568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netfilx</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to see how Goode and Chaiklin obtained too much material over five years on this story \u2013 there\u2019s a miniseries on Antle\u2019s compound alone \u2013 but the most gutting and dramatic thread remains the shadow trade of wild animals in the US. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this exotic animal world for a long time, and I wanted to expose the exploitation and the suffering of these cats,\u201d said Goode. In typical American fashion, regulation of the ownership of big cats such as tigers and lions is scant and confusing, varying state by state or even county by county. States such as Oklahoma have almost no regulations. \u201cIn some places there are more regulations on keeping a pet dog than a pet tiger,\u201d said Chaiklin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dissimilar to guns \u2013 you can buy an AR-15 in Oklahoma and you can buy a tiger in Oklahoma easily,\u201d said Goode of an unwillingness of state and federal governments to wade into private wildlife regulations. A federal bill to impose much stricter rules on private ownership of big cats, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1380\">Big Cat Public Safety Act</a>, has not passed Congress.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear, even after just an hour of Tiger King, that there\u2019s an intoxicating allure to big cats \u2013 a force that draws visitors to lucrative private zoos, turns keepers into fanatics and beckons viewers deeper and deeper into what can seem like an alternate reality.

Under the current framework some people we consider vulnerable will present but the council won\u2019t be able to house them. That is why we have to change the current framework in these extraordinary times and we want to work the council and other city partners to find a solution.\u201d</p> <p>He said the charity had been given assurances by Glasgow\u2019s health and social care partnership that all homeless people would be housed, and was bitterly disappointed that this appeared not to be the case.</p> <p>The centre, which is usually open between December and March and can accommodate up to 40 people, had to shut in light of social distancing guidance because guests slept in one room.</p> <p>Thursday was to be its last night open, but after consulting with the Scottish government it closed during the day. In a statement on Thursday, the charity said: \u201cThere are a significant number of highly vulnerable persons in our city whose status provides no recourse to public funds who will also require immediate attention and accommodation. To wilfully continue to house people in shelter-style environments is, for us, to demonstrate contempt not compassion.</p> <p>\u201cTo continue to allow mass sleeping in the face of advice to the contrary is to put vulnerable people at significant intentional risk, while on the face of it keeps many onlookers satisfied that \u2018at least they are not out in the cold\u2019. It is, in our mind, a case of out of sight is out of mind. We cannot do that in good conscience.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Wray, the head of projects at Glasgow City Mission, said people with no recourse to public funds were highly vulnerable. \u201cWe believe that it is a matter of public health that all individuals who are homeless, whether they have access to public funds or not, should be accommodated by the local authority. Last night this did not happen. We will continue to urge our partners in the HSCP to provide accommodation for all who are forced to sleep rough,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Peter Krykant, until recently a street outreach worker who plans to launch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/glasgow-activist-risks-arrest-to-set-up-drug-consumption-room-in-a-van\">a safer injecting van</a>, said: \u201cI hope the government or the city council will step up today to house these people and give them the support that they need and a fighting chance against this virus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this virus hits this community, it will devastate it.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Glasgow\u2019s health and social care partnership said: \u201cGlasgow city health and social care partnership has put in place contingency plans to reduce risk to vulnerable homeless people, many of whom have underlying health conditions.\u201d</p> <p>She added that it was working with key people in police, housing and health as well as third sector partners such as the Simon Community. \u201cWe\u2019ve secured an array of temporary accommodation that will also people to self-isolate if necessary,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Variations on the adage that celebrities are just like us but with better hair, teeth and diets have been put to the test this week as a number of actors, singers and reality stars have made their way onto social media with content inspired by their time in quarantine. They have ranged from public-broadcast-style announcements <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1240418674491543552/video/1\">from Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> to unusual beauty tips from January Jones and digital singalongs with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/mar/19/gal-gadot-celeb-friends-singing-self-isolation-jared-leto\">Gal Gadot and friends</a>.</p> <p>Some celebrities\u2019 content has been altruistic and, from a public health perspective at least, helpful, focusing on practical guidelines. Gloria Gaynor, for instance, posted to TikTok a video of herself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqP5NRXf8g\">lip-synching to I Will Survive while lathering up</a> .</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing what\u2019s best for my fellow man</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all in this crisis together,\u201d Gaynor told the Guardian. \u201cI for one want to do what\u2019s best for myself, my family and my fellow man. I want to make sure I\u2019m doing what I can to encourage other people to do the same and that is the reason for my TikTok video. I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing that.</p> <p>\u201cFor generations, I Will Survive has become the anthem of the world, to give hope, encouragement and inspiration, and I will continue to make sure that happens.\u201d</p> <p>Mariah Carey also washed her hands to a song from her back catalogue: she and her children posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9rcuGFpbz2/\">video to TikTok</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9rcuGFpbz2/\"> of themselves washing their hands</a> to a remix of her 1995 number 1 Fantasy.</p> <p>On Thursday, the American singer JoJo posted a reworked version of her song Leave (Get Out), changing lyrics to give an instructional message the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US would be proud of. Foregrounded by a bowl piled high with shiny lemons, she chides younger viewers who may not be taking isolation warnings seriously: \u201cTell me why you\u2019re acting so confused when the CDC laid it out for you.

  "<p>At 44KW, a nightclub in Shanghai, life almost feels normal again. Bartenders mix cocktails for patrons leaning against the bar. Groups sit close together without face masks on, talking and sipping their drinks. A young woman pulls down her mask and speaks into her phone as she livestreams to her followers.

It\u2019s much better than before,\u201d she said.</p> <p>More than 80,000 people have been infected by the virus that first appeared in the city of Wuhan, killing more than 3,000, but the daily number of new infections has dropped dramatically.</p> <p>For several days in a row, China has reported no new locally transmitted infections. Authorities are loosening restrictions and trying to crank back up the stalled economy, urging factories and businesses to resume operation.</p> <p>Some experts doubt the numbers officials have been reporting, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vshih2/status/1240824036956889089\">noting inconsistencies in reports</a> of what areas are deemed \u201clow risk\u201d. Others worry cases could spread again once normal life has resumed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is likely that cases will rise once China eases its control measures. This means they will have to maintain vigilance for a surge of new cases and decide how to respond,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, ordered officials at all levels of the government and Communist party to move with \u201curgency\u201d in restoring economic and social order. In low-risk areas, production and normal life \u201cmust be fully restored,\u201d he said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p> <p>On Thursday, Wuhan reported no new infections for the first time. Local authorities in the surrounding Hubei province, outside Wuhan, loosened travel restrictions, allowing residents deemed healthy to begin moving around. Companies are able to arrange for their workers to come back to Wuhan and most car checkpoints have been removed.</p> <p>Hospitals have resumed normal operations, opening to patients with conditions that are not virus-related. On Friday morning, the city of Honghu, south of Wuhan, officially ended its lockdown.</p> <p>For those in Wuhan, however, life has not yet returned to normal. Residents are still barred from going outside of their residential compounds. The streets remain mostly empty. Food supplies are still difficult to source and the prices are three to four times higher than normal, according to Iris Yao, 40, who has been at home with her parents for most of the last two months. She is still rationing their supplies, making one cabbage last a week and pooling with others in order to buy groceries at cheaper bulk prices.</p> <p>While Yao says the situation has improved dramatically, she disagrees with the characterisation from Chinese officials and state media that the government\u2019s methods have been a success.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of controlling the epidemic and requiring everyone to stay at home, that worked,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the beginning was a failure. The virus was able to spread because of what was not done. The sacrifices Wuhanese people have had to make are huge.\u201d</p> <p>The outbreak prompted a level of public anger and criticism directed at the ruling party not seen in decades. But as the epidemic lessens within China and the crisis worsens in other countries, relief has begun to displace outrage and anxiety.</p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning, I wanted to yell at the local government. Everyone was getting sick and unable to get help,\u201d Yao said. That anger turned to a sense of dissent, Yao said, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">the death of a doctor who tried to warn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\"> colleagues</a> about the virus.</p> <p>\u201cNow I feel like my emotions are going back to normal some. There is a little more light,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we are not in a state of fear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e2c1b321ad69faf8ed18e1c29f5e46c6dc50b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e2c1b321ad69faf8ed18e1c29f5e46c6dc50b1/0_26_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singer and blogger Yuan Qinggai livestreams from the bar at 44KW nightclub in Shanghai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singer and blogger Yuan Qinggai livestreams from the bar at 44KW nightclub in Shanghai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Tacon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are many ways that life has not returned to normal. Economists say the Chinese economy will take a large hit, which could pose an even larger threat to social stability in the wake of the outbreak. Analysts believe the economy is on track to experience its <a href=\"https://qz.com/1818960/china-economy-set-to-see-first-contraction-since-1989/\">first quarterly contraction since 1989</a>.</p> <p>Day-to-day life for people across China will remain stilted for some time. Office buildings, shopping malls and other public places still require people to be registered and their temperatures recorded. Several areas require people to show a \u201cgreen\u201d reading though a smartphone app called Health Code, through WeChat or Alipay.</p> <p>At Tianzifang, a recently reopened shopping district and tourist site in Shanghai\u2019s French Concession, the measures have created a bottleneck. A small crowd is gathered at the entrance where two guards try to guide confused patrons through the Health Code app, as well as an additional ticket to enter.</p> <p>For others, the added measures are perfunctory. At the gate to one neighbourhood of Shanghai\u2019s iconic lane houses, a guard sat next to a folding table with a clipboard to register those coming in and out. Residents quickly stuck their arms out for their temperature to be taken. One walked away before his reading came up while others noted with surprise changes in their temperature.</p> <p>\u201cThe last place said I was 33 degrees. How can I now be 36?\u201d one asked, complaining about inaccurate thermometers being used in the city.</p> <p>While China has reported no new locally transmitted cases, the country has still seen daily increases in those coming from abroad, prompting worries of a rebound. Imported cases reached 228 as of Friday, as infected travellers were confirmed not only at major hubs like Beijing and Shanghai but in provinces including Liaoning, Gansu, Heilongjiang in the north and Zhejiang, Fujian, and Sichuan in the south and west.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of imported cases in China has further increased. So the pressure to be on guard has also increased,\u201d said Wang Bin, an official of the national health commission at a news conference on Friday.</p> <p>Xi has ordered officials to be vigilant at the borders, and international flights to Beijing have been diverted to other cities. Wariness of foreigners has increased. As one US citizen struggled to check into a hotel in Shanghai, a woman waiting in line murmured: \u201cBefore, everyone was afraid of Chinese people. Now it\u2019s the reverse.\u201d</p> <p>At 44KW, patrons must show their Health Code reading and foreigners have to bring their passports to show they have not been in virus-stricken areas recently. For now, the club cannot host DJs coming from overseas. Yuan Qingai, 26, a singer, is livestreaming from the club and speaking to more than 100 fans online.</p> <p>She tells them that she is speaking to foreign media about the epidemic. They quickly advise: \u201cYou should wear a mask.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Dave Tacon and Lillian Yang</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>As I mentioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/13/theres-more-to-new-zealand-white-wine-than-sauvignon-blanc\" title=\"\">last week</a>, so overwhelming is the dominance of sauvignon blanc in New Zealand, it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that the country also produces some cracking reds. And if you\u2019re a pinot noir lover, that would be a real shame. The main regions to look out for are Central Otago, Martinborough, Marlborough and its smaller neighbour to the west, Nelson.</p> <p>Central, as the locals call it \u2013 and which makes it sound more like a railway terminus than a premium wine-producing area \u2013 is the centre; it even holds an <a href=\"http://www.pinotcelebration.co.nz/\" title=\"\">annual pinot celebration</a> that attracts pinot lovers from all over the world. The pioneers in the region \u2013 wineries such as <a href=\"https://feltonroad.com/\" title=\"\">Felton Road</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rippon.co.nz/\" title=\"\">Rippon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gibbstonvalley.com/\" title=\"\">Gibbston Valley</a> \u2013 were pinot-philes themselves, and modelled their products on the red burgundies they loved.</p> <p>To begin with, the wines were very different \u2013 exuberant flavour bombs bursting with vivid, red berry fruit \u2013 but as the vines have got older, there\u2019s been less need to extract flavour. \u201cI want people to taste our vineyards, not what I did to them,\u201d explains Paul Pujol of <a href=\"https://www.prophetsrock.co.nz/\" title=\"\">Prophet\u2019s Rock</a>.</p> <p>Marlborough, too, has changed over time. Its pinots used to be pale and a bit weedy, but they have improved hugely in quality since wineries such as <a href=\"https://www.dogpoint.co.nz/\" title=\"\">Dog Point</a> started planting on the cooler slopes of the Southern Valleys, rather than on the flat. Their wines repay ageing, too.</p> <p>In terms of fuller-bodied reds, the Kiwis are finally turning their backs on cabernet sauvignon in favour of syrah, which comes in the spicy, peppery style more typical of the Rh\u00f4ne, rather than the blockbuster style of Barossa shiraz. Hawkes Bay on the east coast of North Island is the most affordable source, but you\u2019ll also find some great examples in Marlborough, <a href=\"https://frommwinery.co.nz/\" title=\"\">Fromm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.twrwines.co.nz/\" title=\"\">Te Whare Ra</a> being just two.</p> <p>It won\u2019t escape your notice, I\u2019m sure, that these reds tend to be on the expensive side. Then again, apart from sauvignon blanc, New Zealand doesn\u2019t really do cheap \u2013 and why should it? And, yes, Aldi has a <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/exquisite-new-zealand-pinot-noir/p/060493068255700\" title=\"\">New Zealand Pinot Noir in its \u201cExquisite\u201d</a> range for \u00a35.99, but it doesn\u2019t really live up to its moniker (though if you\u2019re tempted by that price, 20 minutes in the fridge will take the boiled-sweet jamminess off it). If you\u2019ve succumbed to the pinot bug, the best you can do is to keep your eyes open for bin ends and special offers. Many are under screw cap, too, so have a bit more longevity than wines bottled under cork.</p> <h2>Four New Zealand reds to splash out on</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"sdgdsth\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8e4a6c8e36ef365ac70b57555368f17cce1e3bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8e4a6c8e36ef365ac70b57555368f17cce1e3bc/0_0_2365_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prophet\u2019s Rock Central Otago Pinot Noir 2015/16\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Prophet\u2019s Rock Central Otago Pinot Noir 2015/16</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/shop/productdetail.aspx?section=pd&amp;pl=ZBX&amp;pd=NZ11291&amp;pc=&amp;prl=\" title=\"\">\u00a326 The Wine Society</a>, Vinum has the 2015 for \u00a329.75, 14%.</p> <p>A total treat; one of my fave Central pinots, and much better than the Society\u2019s own-label \u2018Exhibition\u2019 bottling made by the same winery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"fyjujh\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9b2941b92a7bb3e2cc8cd33f6ad49ae731807ce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2941b92a7bb3e2cc8cd33f6ad49ae731807ce3/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Villa Maria Cellar Selection Pinot Noir 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Villa Maria Cellar Selection Pinot Noir 2017</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.costco.co.uk/Wines-Spirits-Beer/Wines/Red-Wine/Villa-Maria-Cellar-Selection-Pinot-Noir-2017-6-x-75cl/p/219198\" title=\"\">\u00a312.67 Costco</a> (or \u00a375.99 a case of 6), <a href=\"https://www.waitrosecellar.com/wine-and-fish/villa-maria-cellar-selection-pinot-710319\" title=\"\">\u00a315.99 Waitrose</a>, 13.5%.</p> <p>A big brand, but an impressively elegant pinot for the money, especially if you\u2019ve got a Costco card.

  "<p>Britain. A nation of shopfighters, presided over at a time of mortal peril by a newspaper columnist, who has for three decades moonlighted as his generation\u2019s leading liar. Still, as the words clawed into the side of the plague pit probably once read, \u201cWe are where we are.\u201d</p> \n<p>But where, currently, is that? It is a place where, at 5pm every day, the disease-threatened populace is expected to take prophylactic advice from Boris Johnson. From Monday, most British parents will be home-schooling their children. Not Johnson, of course \u2013 I imagine he doesn\u2019t want to break his own pledge on class sizes. The prime minister keeps saying that the forthcoming test to determine whether you have coronavirus will be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">as simple as a pregnancy test</a>\u201d, spaffing his sole area of expertise rather early in what is likely to be a long campaign.</p> \n<p>Actually, that\u2019s unfair. His other area of expertise is disguising rather basic points with needlessly obscure language. Once this made him a highly overrated prose stylist; now it could make him accomplice to the death of your relatives and friends. \u201cThe key message,\u201d Johnson key-messaged on Tuesday, is that people follow the advice \u201csedulously\u201d. Ah, <em>sedulously</em>. Sedulously. The signal for 10 million hardworking families to draw down the leather-bound thesaurus from their shelves and browse synonyms for the word \u201ctwat\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It has been quite something to watch Johnson\u2019s smirk kick back in, live on air, even while people are asking him about the soon-to-break ventilator crisis</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The government\u2019s crisis communications strategy could not be going worse if it was being led by the last speaker of a dead language, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/10/typhoid-mary-super-spreader-history\">Typhoid Mary</a> on bass. People are still clearly extremely confused by what the advice is. Never have bullet points been more called for, and you\u2019d think someone as obsessed with the second world war as Johnson is would know that an effective Ministry of Information was inextricably linked to the success of the war effort. Unfortunately, as indicated, Johnson is basically just a columnist. I don\u2019t want to spaff what we might euphemise as my own area of expertise too early, but trust me on this: he is hardwired to spin that shit out for 1150 words. How to put this in terms that even a wildly overeducated prime minister can understand? JUST TELL US THE INFORMATION. It\u2019s a public safety briefing, not a fricking ring quest.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s inability to clearly define essential terms means we are in a situation where \u201cself-isolating\u201d demonstrably means a range of things to different people. Same with \u201csocial distancing\u201d. These urgently need simple and precise definition, and a comms blitz everywhere from social media to news bulletins to short TV ads.</p> \n<p>Instead, Johnson prefers to chuck new soundbites on the pile. The current one is the pledge that \u201cwe can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks\u201d. If you missed this clip, don\u2019t worry. My suspicion is that you\u2019ll be seeing it hundreds of times more this year. It has a strong \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theworldwar.org/explore/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/over-christmas\">Over by Christmas</a>\u201d vibe to it, and is the sort of thing you could imagine on the side of a bus.</p> \n<p>There is something deeply unsettling to watching Johnson and Dominic Cummings\u2019 Brexit media strategy be lightly repurposed for a deadly contagion. The prime minister is already crossing the streams, declaring repeatedly on Thursday: \u201cI\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll get this thing done.\u201d Mate \u2026 that\u2019s your slogan for the other one? We\u2019re about three days off him telling us we can take back control.</p> \n<p>Yet control is once again looking somewhat tenuous. Huge amounts of this week have been dedicated to gaslighting the nation that, last week, no one in a position of power said \u201cherd immunity\u201d out loud. And yet, they did. Meanwhile, Dominic Cummings, high priest of the 20,000-word blog, can tell you everything about what the Manhattan Project taught us, but he seemingly can\u2019t work out that if you let a \u201cLondon will be imminently locked down\u201d story go viral for 18 hours before you deny it, then people WILL physically fight over bogroll. Nurses coming off 48-hour shifts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/20/nurse-in-tears-coronavirus-panic-buying-leaves-shelves-empty-food-video\">WILL cry in videos</a> because they can\u2019t buy anything in the shops. I guess Cummings is interested in behavioural science in the way I\u2019m interested in Olympic figure skating. Which is to say, I like it, but I\u2019m unbelievably, lethally shit at it.</p> \n<p>Physically, meanwhile, Johnson is ageing slightly quicker than the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade who drinks from the wrong grail and goes from middle-aged to ancient to exploding skeleton in around six seconds. There seems to be some unholy symbiosis between him and Rishi Sunak, who appears to be growing younger with every appearance. Perhaps for every year that the prime minister gains, the chancellor loses one. In a fortnight, Sunak will require home-schooling, while Johnson will be over 70 and consequently allowed to self-shield from having to do his job.</p> \n<p>Of course, we are not the only nation to be conducting an interesting social experiment to determine what happens if you elect a clinical narcissist to run a country which later turns out to be facing grave danger. At this stage, the US\u2019s experiment appears to be going rather worse, and you certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out Donald Trump judging November\u2019s elections to be something that had better be suspended under the circumstances.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/20/uk-coronavirus-live-confusion-over-key-workers-list-as-schools-close\">UK coronavirus live: man is first to be arrested for alleged failure to self-isolate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even so, it has been quite something to watch <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/boris-johnson-12-weeks-coronavirus-analysis_uk_5e740093c5b6f5b7c54148b2?guf&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvL3NFUVZuNGxuOTY_YW1wPTE&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFBPJvPWS9ZI2vTZW3mt5RYXdlzQ3Tf1dtI3aFQsuDF1XxnSqDZnDj77WRwaSRzJQZ5eMlHbCO_oyWiS_rqyxdCtBlxHKuNq9pIvHxNhosXFbtMIG8Awy56nmm3sDpoXm3hI7d7xR2MUgbDvDhjghiGulREKiMj57EGOsnNV8y8g\">Johnson\u2019s boredom</a> and terminal ironist\u2019s smirk kick back in, live on air, as the week has progressed, even while people are asking him about the soon-to-break ventilator crisis in intensive care. \u201cOperation Last Gasp\u201d as Johnson reportedly called the need to address the equipment deficit in a conference call to manufacturers this week.</p> \n<p>What can you say?

  "<p> Republican senator Richard Burr faced demands to resign on Friday after it was reported that he sold off millions of dollars\u2019 worth of stocks just before the market dropped amid fears of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Burr, of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, denied he had kept the public in the dark about the scale of the threat as three other senators also came under scrutiny for selling major holdings in the same period.</p> \n<p>Burr and his wife sold between around $628,000 and $1.7m in more than 30 separate transactions in late January and mid-February, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-dumped-up-to-1-6-million-of-stock-after-reassuring-public-about-coronavirus-preparedness\">ProPublica and the Center for Responsive Politics reported.</a> Several of the stocks were in companies that own hotels.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Burr asked congressional investigators to probe whether his actions amounted to insider trading. \u201cI relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision on the sale of stocks February 13,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/coronavirus-dashboard-blog-size\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Two weeks after the sales, on 27 February, Burr made a speech in Washington in which he predicted dire consequences from the coronavirus, including school closures and cutbacks in company travel.</p> \n<p>Burr told a small audience that the respiratory infection was \u201cmuch more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history\u201d and \u201cprobably more akin to the 1918 pandemic\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818192535/burr-recording-sparks-questions-about-private-comments-on-covid-19\">an audio recording obtained by National Public Radio</a> revealed.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorBurr/status/1240766943449276424?s=20\">Burr responded on Twitter</a>, accusing NPR of \u201ca tabloid-style hit piece\u201d that misrepresented his speech and claiming that Americans were already being warned about the effects of the virus at the time. \u201cThe message I shared with my constituents is the one public health officials urged all of us to heed as coronavirus spread increased,\u201d Burr wrote. \u201cBe prepared.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is no evidence that Burr had any inside information as he sold the stocks or spoke to the audience in North Carolina.

One of Norfolk\u2019s biggest populations is close to both the NDR and its proposed extension, the Western Link. All bats and their roosts are protected by law.</p> <p>In the original report, Packman warned that the Western Link \u201chas significant potential to negatively impact\u201d the barbastelle colony in the Wensum valley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/04/greater-horseshoe-bats-living-in-kent-after-absence-of-115-years\">Greater horseshoe bats living in Kent after absence of 115 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the rewritten version of the report, which was revised by environmental consultants Mott Macdonald, all discussion of the Western Link road was removed. Despite protests by Packman, Mott Macdonald submitted the revised version of the report to Norfolk county council, which <a href=\"https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/major-projects-and-improvement-plans/norwich/broadland-northway/environmental-monitoring\">later published it online</a>.</p> <p>Packman later conducted an independent survey of woods through which the Western Link will pass. She said there was a large maternity roost of barbastelle bats in a wood that would be bisected by the new road, which council surveys had not revealed.</p> <p>A further report found that mitigation carried out by the council to sustain bat populations close to the NDR, including seven bat gantries \u2013 bridge-like structures supposed to guide bats safely over new highways \u2013 costing \u00a31m, and a \u00a31.2m green bridge, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-51193389\">was largely ineffective</a>.</p> <p>According to national guidelines, at least 90% of bats should be flying at a safe height within five metres of the bat bridge, and population levels should be similar to those recorded before construction. But more than 40% of bats were crossing at unsafe heights, the green bridge was used by just 13 bats and no bats used a bat underpass because it was flooded.</p> <p>In a statement, Mott Macdonald said: \u201cThe original report provided by our subconsultant contained information that was outside of the scope of the original commission, in that it referenced the Norwich Western Link (NWL), rather than the operational Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NDR).</p> <p>\u201cA revised report relating to NDR was prepared that removed the out-of-scope information so that it met the original client brief. However, recognising the usefulness of the out-of-scope information to the client\u2019s future NWL scheme, we provided this to the council.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Norfolk county council confirmed it was fully aware of \u201cthe relevant survey details\u201d relating to threats to barbastelle bat colonies posed by the Western Link. Mott Macdonald is not undertaking environmental surveys for the new road.</p> <p>Of the barbastelle bat colony discovered on the proposed route of the Western Link, the council said it would \u201cwelcome sight of this data\u201d and added: \u201cBats and barbastelle bats in particular are known to switch roosts on a very frequent basis, and we will continue to conduct surveys to further inform our work and provide up-to-date information ahead of submitting the planning application.\u201d</p> <p>The council confirmed it would not be building any bat gantries for the new road but it planned to install green bridges and bat underpasses.</p> <p>Packman has launched a crowdfunder for <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/save-bats-habitats-norwich-western-link\">a comprehensive independent bat survey</a> of the area affected by the Western Link.</p> <p>Fiona Matthews, professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, said bat gantries were now seen as greenwashing, with scientific evidence repeatedly showing that expensive bat mitigation for new roads did not work.</p> <p>She said: \u201cOver and over again we\u2019re getting these sorts of reports. We need some really serious effort to make these bat crossings more effective, or just decide that this is not an effective use of money for conservation. We need to think about other measures to stop these developments having a negative impact on the bat population \u2013 there are lots of other ways you could spend money on bat conservation effectively.\u201d</p> <p>David Pett of the <a href=\"https://www.stopthewensumlink.co.uk/\">Stop the Wensum Link</a> campaign said the new road failed to meet Britain\u2019s legal obligations to prevent habitat loss and climate change. \u201cThe habitat regulations assessment of the plan says the road must not adversely affect the integrity of the River Wensum special area of conservation. Even before the discovery of the barbastelle roosts this set a high bar, unlikely to be met. Also, the road would add to carbon emissions and it has not been assessed against the Paris agreement. We expect this to be a showstopper in the future for such high-carbon transport schemes after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-change\">the recent Heathrow judgment</a>.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A 26-year-old on the Isle of Man has been arrested for allegedly failing to self-isolate against coronavirus.</p> <p>The man was held by police on the island on Thursday, two days after the self-governing British crown dependency announced strict measures to prevent the illness spreading.</p> <p>Since Tuesday night, anyone arriving on the island is subject to 14 days of self-isolation even if they do not have symptoms of the virus. It is thought the man had just arrived on the island on a ferry.</p> <p>The man, who has not been named, will appear in court in Douglas, the island\u2019s capital, on Friday. He faces a fine of up to \u00a310,000 and a possible three-month jail sentence.</p> <p>Earlier on Friday, the Manx government confirmed the island\u2019s first case of coronavirus. A spokesperson for the island\u2019s public health team confirmed that the person had recently returned from a trip to Spain.</p> <p>So far, 52 people have been tested for the virus on the Isle of Man, which has a population of 85,000. The island\u2019s population has an average age of 44.4, compared with <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/\">40.5 in the UK</a>.</p> <p>Implementing its tight quarantine rules on Monday, the Isle of Man\u2019s chief minister, Howard Quayle, said: \u201cWe are taking action to protect our residents and to ensure life can continue as normal as possible during this unpredictable time.</p> <p>\u201cWe are advising against all non-essential travel off the island, and the measures being introduced from tomorrow are aimed at minimising the risk of those arriving in the island infecting our population.\u201d</p> <p>For those already on the island, anyone displaying symptoms including a persistent cough or fever, or anyone living with someone who has symptoms of the virus, must also self-isolate for two weeks.</p> <p>The island\u2019s schools and businesses are still open, and there are no restrictions on public gatherings, but the government has urged people to take extra precautions if they are in an at-risk category.</p> <p>In the UK, there are no active measures at present to enforce self-isolation, and guidance on self-isolation is less trenchant.</p> <p>Anyone displaying symptoms has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/18/what-is-uk-government-advice-on-social-distancing-and-isolation-coronavirus\">advised to stay at home for at least seven days</a> from when they started. Those in households with multiple people must self-isolate for 14 days.</p> <p>The guidance for travellers is that only those who have returned from affected areas should self-isolate; they must do this even if they do not have symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>However, on Thursday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced new legislation which would give powers to law enforcement agencies to curb the spread of the virus. Under the bill, police and immigration officials would be able to place people in \u201cappropriate isolation facilities\u201d.</p> <p>The Manx health service has an agreement with the UK whereby patients are flown over for treatment they cannot get on the island, but this could be made difficult if the NHS becomes overwhelmed.</p> <p>The island\u2019s economy, which relies heavily on tourism, has already been hit by the pandemic, with people working in the hospitality sector losing their jobs because of holiday cancellations.</p> <p>The 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-sport-a-list-of-the-major-cancellations\">Isle of Man TT </a>\u2013 which attracted 46,000 people to the island <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-49774231\">last year</a> \u2013 has been cancelled because of concerns about the spread of coronavirus. </p>",
  "<p>While \u201cstay well\u201d has become the default sign off in the age of coronavirus, \u201cit is really important to say \u2018stay sane\u2019, too\u201d, says <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/604550/anxiety-attacks-by-lucy-atcheson/\">Lucy Atcheson</a>, the psychologist and author of Anxiety Attacks. As situations change faster than we can process, and we try to muddle through, here are some anxiety-busting coping strategies, whether you have one minute to spare or a yawning, self-isolating fortnight.</p> <h2>One minute</h2> <p>\u201cBreathe yourself calm,\u201d says the psychologist Linda Blair. \u201cInhale slowly through your nose, counting to three, hold your breath, and then breathe out for six counts.\u201d Ten of those, she says, will reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and boost feelings of wellbeing. Atcheson recommends sitting or standing with your feet hip width apart and inhaling, holding and exhaling for four counts each, breathing through your nose, especially if you\u2019re feeling panicky, because \u201cyou cannot hyperventilate if you\u2019re breathing through your nose\u201d.</p> <h2>Five minutes</h2> <p>\u201cLearn a new word and use it,\u201d says Blair. \u201cLook at the word of the day on the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day\">Merriam-Webster website</a>.\u201d This simple act of self-improvement, she says, will make you feel more in control and confident about your ability to cope, \u201cwith a sense of, \u2018Yes, I am moving forward,\u2019\u201d even though it\u2019s not consciously tied to the current health crisis. Equally, five minutes is plenty of time to try a mindfulness meditation.</p> <p>In fact starting small is best, says Karen Atkinson, the cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.mindfulnessuk.com/\">MindfulnessUK</a> and the chair of the British Association of Mindfulness-based Approaches. \u201cIt is like building your physical muscles; you start with low weight and reps, and then you build up.\u201d Go outside, she suggests, and try a practice called taking in the good, \u201cwhich really helps your psychological, emotional wellbeing. It\u2019s springtime, so if you notice a beautiful flower coming up, savour the moment, and let everything else drop away. Just be with the physical and emotional experience of looking at the flower, or a bird perhaps. It takes 20 seconds for a positive experience to be registered in your brain, so stopping and feeling the air on your skin, and using your senses to be present helps to calm down any anxiety.\u201d</p> <h2>10 minutes</h2> <p>\u201cWrite a letter to yourself about all the good things you\u2019re doing and how well you\u2019re doing,\u201d says Atcheson. The way to frame it, she says, is: \u201cI\u2019m going to write this letter to my best friend, who happens to be me, and I need to cheer them up. That really challenges the critical voice in your head and a lot of anxiety comes from not having sufficient faith in our own abilities.\u201d If letter-writing isn\u2019t your thing, try a gratitude journal, as Blair describes: \u201cWrite down three things that you\u2019re grateful for. You may think at the beginning: \u2018I haven\u2019t got anything.\u2019 Oh, yes you do. Spend 10 minutes finding three things. It makes you feel safe.\u201d</p> <h2>20 minutes</h2> <p>Two words: power nap. \u201cWhen we get anxious, we start thinking emotionally, and we don\u2019t use our logic any more,\u201d says Blair. \u201cThe best way to regain perspective, and put logic back in the driving seat is to take a little break away from everything.\u201d Lie down on the floor, on your back. Bend your knees and drop your hands to your side. Set your clock for 20 minutes or ask someone to tell you when the time is up. Close your eyes, says Blair, \u201cand start the breathing that you did at one minute. And that is all you do.\u201d You do not have to fall asleep, \u201cbut what happens is the thoughts that are running through your head neutralise. They are there, but they don\u2019t have power.\u201d At the end of 20 minutes, roll slowly on to your side, sit up and then go back to whatever you were doing.</p> <h2>14 days</h2> <p>To avert the risk of being overcome with worry, it is important to structure this time so life still has purpose, meaning and joy, says Atcheson. \u201cIt\u2019s possible with books, box sets, online exercise, trying a new recipe, talking to people who we don\u2019t normally have time to talk to.\u201d Build in healthy routines, starting each day with deep breathing, then exercise, and ending the day similarly \u2013 \u201cnot with high-adrenaline exercise but yoga.\u201d</p> <p>Martin D Clark, the editor of <a href=\"https://www.ommagazine.com/\">O</a><a href=\"https://www.ommagazine.com/\">m magazine</a>, recommends <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene\">Yoga with Adriene on YouTube</a>, and many teachers and studios are temporarily moving their classes live online, from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TilleyYoga/\">Emma Tilley in Gloucestershire</a> to <a href=\"https://www.yogaatthemill.co.uk/\">Yoga at the Mill in Chelmsford</a>. And remember the importance of microlifts \u2013 \u201csmall, almost imperceptible lifts throughout the day\u201d, says Atcheson. \u201cYou may usually get one from grabbing coffee in your favourite cafe. Do something that makes you feel good for a moment.\u201d</p> <p>Numbing the brain with mindless social media scrolling, she says, can allow depression and despair to slip in. Blair advises getting a pot for your windowsill and planting some seeds. \u201cThings such as mustard and cress are good,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause you\u2019ll see things coming up in a couple of days. And at the end of 15 days, you can eat them.\u201d</p>",

In some cases students and staff are being asked to notify the university through a dedicated route if they\u2019re self-isolating; there are then regular telephone check-ins with these students. Visit your university website and check your emails as many vice-chancellors and heads of departments are sending updates.</p> <p>Be patient: it can take time for staff to respond as measures may need to be cleared with management first. \u201cWe are concerned about students and most of us are happy to take phone calls and be contacted on Skype or email, even though most won\u2019t be in our office over the next few weeks or months,\u201d says Steven Jones, a professor at the Manchester Institute of Education.</p> <h2>Should I go home?</h2> <p>As it stands, nearly all on-campus activity has been cancelled or paused. However, not all universities are telling students to leave. \u201cIt is important to note that universities and campuses are not closing. With teaching moving online students can remain on campus if they prefer to and some university facilities are still available,\u201d said a spokesperson from Universities UK.</p> <p>The University of Buckingham says although it has not asked any students to return home at the moment, their term ends today, so they are expecting many to leave anyway. Professor Manuel Souto-Otero from Cardiff University\u2019s School of Social Sciences says they have not asked any students to return home. \u201cWithout face-to-face contact many will decide to go anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an individual decision based on academic and personal factors.\u201d</p> <p>Students say they are picking a place to stay put. \u201cI decided to stay at uni,\u201d says Paton. \u201cThere\u2019s a handful of people still here but they\u2019ve closed everything down.\u201d<br><br>For international students the issue is more pressing and many countries are closing borders and putting restrictions in place. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave uni whenever we want,\u201d says Vikesh Mistry (not his real name), who studies politics and international studies at Warwick University and got a flight home earlier this week. \u201cIndia is closing its borders and a lot of students are stuck.\u201d<br><br>If you do decide to stay on campus, measures are being taken to support students during self-isolation. According to <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/education/universities\">Universities</a> UK, if the number of students self-isolating continues to increase, some universities are planning to differentiate between accommodation. \u201cThose with en-suites may be supported in their existing rooms and those without moved to designated accommodation. As campus gets quieter over the Easter break some have suggested being able to allocate one student per flat,\u201d a spokesperson said.<br><br>Most have additional support for those who cannot or do not want to go home. Becca Bland, chief executive of Stand Alone, a charity that supports adults who are estranged from their family, advises those students to stay put, make contact with student services and reach out to people in their community.</p> <h2>How can I still study?</h2> <p>It will feel difficult to sit down and study while this is going on. But universities are talking to exam boards to ensure students do not lose out on learning. The education secretary has now announced a pause on face-to-face provision in an educational setting, and measures being explored include recorded lectures, amendments to exam questions if sections of a syllabus have been missed, and moving assessments online.</p> <p>In the meantime, Souto-Otero says there are resources available. \u201cStaff are preparing videos or using ones from previous years. Use this time to make progress and get on,\u201d he advises. For those planning on doing placements next year or studying abroad, consider whether programmes might be suspended and make arrangements for accommodation next year just in case.</p> <h2>How can I cope with anxiety?</h2> <p>Maintaining your mental health and wellbeing is important. There are going to be incredible uncertainties in the next two months and students need to look out for each other.<br><br>Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor at the University of Buckingham, says students should reach out for support. \u201cOur students can talk to our specialist mental health advisors, mentors and personal tutors should they be feeling anxious or need extra support during this time of minimised social contact.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/going-home-puts-my-parents-at-risk-students-hit-by-coronavirus-upheaval\">'Going home puts my parents at risk': UK students hit by coronavirus upheaval</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>When will classes start again?</h2> <p>In many cases not until at least September.

There will be an online structure in place and that will change the way things are going forward,\u201d says Heneghan. <br><br>For some students, the situation has been compounded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/20/university-staff-jobs-strike-pay-workload-equality\">recent strikes</a> and they haven\u2019t felt they\u2019ve had a normal education at all this year. \u201cFive out of 20 weeks were already disrupted, and now everything is going online,\u201d says Mistry.</p> <p>Jones insists universities are doing their best.

Let us know your favourites to binge in the comments.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>1</h2> <h2><strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</strong></h2> <p><em>Amazon</em></p> <p>High school is hell. US teen dramas have been telling us that ever since new-girl Brenda first nervously clutched a textbook to her chest in Beverly Hills, 90210. It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1v_q6TWAL4\">Buffy Summers</a>, though, who made it thrillingly literal. Played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, she looked like an ordinary, perky teen, which is exactly what she wanted to be. Sadly, when your hometown is located directly over a hellmouth, maintaining some semblance of normality is a challenge.</p> <p>Buffy was the Slayer, chosen by fate to battle each season\u2019s Big Bad and, at least once a semester, save the world. Yet, in one of her many rebellions against ancient lore, she refused to work alone. She had guidance from her Watcher, the school librarian Rupert Giles (Anthony Head), and backup from the Scooby gang \u2013 the core duo of Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicholas Brendon), plus a rotating cast of stoner werewolves, ex-vengeance demons and sarcastic cheerleaders \u2014 who are a kind of demon, really, aren\u2019t they?</p> <p>It might have been standard tweenage fare, if not for the deft, witty writing of Joss Whedon, who could make even the cliched doomed romance between Buffy and vampire-with-a-soul Angel (David Boreanaz) feel fresh, and relevant. His worrying post-coitus habit of turning into an evil mass murderer was a beautiful metaphor for the regret so many feel after their first time. Still, he was always \u201cthe one\u201d, even after he moved to Los Angeles for his own spin-off show, but seven seasons was also enough time to cycle through various alternative romantic pairings, and Buffy did so with more plausibility than most long-running shows. Friends\u2019 final season gave us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/22/friends-without-benefits-how-joey-and-rachel-fling-killed-off-the-sitcom\">the plain wrong Rachel and Joey</a>, but Buffy\u2019s slow-build, abusive situationship with vampire-very-much-without-a-soul Spike hit the so-wrong-it\u2019s-right sweet spot. Or, to translate that into the cutely inarticulate jumble now known as Buffy-speak: \u201cLove makes you do the wacky.\u201d</p> <p>The best episodes, such as the musical <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmLSjwam26E\">Once More With Feeling and Innocence</a> (where Buffy and Angel finally do the deed with devastating consequences) found human truths in hoary genre cliche. Such as: how come Sunnydale\u2019s residents could go about their business so oblivious to all the paranormal activity? How many times can a hero successfully save the universe before she suffers energy-zapping ennui? And how did we never notice this apparently central character before now? This was the high-school soap that turned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/10/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-at-20-the-thrilling-brilliant-birth-of-tv-as-art\">a generation of teens into TV connoisseurs</a>, which may yet turn out to be a mixed blessing.

Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith in Inside No 9. Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Sophie Mutevelian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s put it starkly: this is one of the greatest television series ever made. A horror-comedy anthology where each half-hour introduces fresh characters in a new confined, accursed space (a house, a room, a car, a cabin) \u2013 the eponymous No 9. It\u2019s an immensely rare example of imagination and craft interacting at the highest level.</p> <p>In a feat that would be impressive for a show with a large roster of writers and actors, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton \u2013 two of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG_QtF2zCz8\">The League of Gentlemen</a> \u2013 have come up with 31 diabolical ideas for episodes on their own, written and starred in every instalment, and shown the skill to execute their schemes, with hardly a dud among them. Fans expect the impossible: an arresting set-up with quickly established characters, into which bursts something awful that, in the last moments, is revealed not to be as it first appeared. Thus the last two minutes of an Inside No 9 episode has become the giddiest thrill on TV, with the best twists echoing in the mind for hours after the end credits have rolled and Newsnight has come on instead. For the first-time binger, it\u2019s a potentially overwhelming assault. Repeat viewers can marvel at how obvious the clues that were missed seem in retrospect.</p> <p>Not that Inside No 9 is merely a game, a trick, a cold technical exercise. Its most horrific moments are viscerally nasty, and the fact that Shearsmith and Pemberton are only ever a cocked hip away from characters in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBcQ2vV1eX8\">Victoria Wood sketch</a> means its laughs are earthy, often filthy and always unmistakably (northern) English. It has a deep soul, too: at its very best it is hauntingly sad \u2013 as with the superlative 12 Days of Christine \u2013 with all that macabre strangeness and bleak humour used to unlock a protagonist\u2019s pain, shame or turmoil.</p> <p>Shearsmith and Pemberton aren\u2019t just masters of the television craft, either \u2013 some of Inside No 9\u2019s standout tales show a profound love for the history of the medium and a desire to go much further than just very good storytelling. There\u2019s a special joy in episodes such as The Devil of Christmas, a mocked-up 70s TV show shot with 70s equipment, or A Quiet Night In and its silent comedy, or Dead Line, an episode recorded live that \u2026 well, best to go in knowing nothing, but just imagine if you had been there on the night.</p> <p>Inside No 9 is also one of the most Top 5-able shows ever. I\u2019ll start: 1 The 12 Days of Christine; 2 Diddle Diddle Dumpling; 3 Bernie Clifton\u2019s Dressing Room; 4 Love\u2019s Great Adventure; 5 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/feb/28/riddle-of-the-sphinx-guardian-cryptic-crossword-inside-no-9\">The Riddle of the Sphinx</a>.

We\u2019ve moved through several eras of dating \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI51-B3kUBo\">Blind</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_3uyqgipU\">Dinner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/first-dates\">First</a> \u2013 into high-concept series involving activities and/or a fuse for drama that is just waiting to be lit. Viewers who like to go deep into this subject will remember <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqRTf_tXJ5U\">Married at First Sight</a>, the Channel 4 series that introduced couples to each other at the altar, just before they took their vows and then followed them \u2013 complete strangers who made a lifelong commitment to each other based on not much more than a questionnaire and somehow ended up not getting along very well.</p> <p>Netflix saw this and thought: hold my beer. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2eBAFt3L_0\">Love Is Blind</a> still marries two relative strangers to each other (if they choose to go through with it), but it maintains its sense of romance by insisting that they get to know each other first. And how! It goes through several stages, but in the first, participants (contestants?) live together in a house that is what the Love Island villa might look like, if it existed in the film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGzRB4Pnq8\">Ex Machina</a>. They go on a series of dates. In an attempt to prove the notion that looks don\u2019t matter, all of these ostensibly very attractive people have to talk through a door. If they fall in love, then it is based on conversation alone. It is an astonishing lesson in the very different lengths to which men and women have to go to be considered impressive.</p> <p>Those who find a mate go to a hotel for a weird post-seeing-each-other honeymoon-holiday, then they live together, then, because they are doing everything else arse-backwards, they have a wedding ceremony, during which there is absolutely no guarantee that the other person will say yes. It is jaw-dropping, is-this-really-happening television from start to finish. It makes you feel bad about watching it, while also making it impossible to stop. Naturally, it has been a huge hit, spawning countless thinkpieces on what it says about modern love and connection. On the plus side, if social distancing really starts to bite, it does leave you with the hope that love can happen for anyone, even through a wall. <strong>Rebecca Nicholson</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>4</h2> <h2><strong>Nighty Night</strong></h2> <p><em>BBC iPlayer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77e77a530bfa3f59d5c2d70e8dd3adea2c45b0af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e77a530bfa3f59d5c2d70e8dd3adea2c45b0af/311_149_1163_1416/821.jpg\" alt=\"Grotesque genius ...

Well, who deserves to find lust again more than this \u201cslim, vibrant lady in her mid-20s with a lust for life and a flexible spine\u201d?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/13/nighty-night-box-set-review-julia-davis\">Nighty Night\u2019s brilliance</a> is driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/20/comedy\">Davis\u2019s determination to push the horrific comedy</a> to any length. Nothing is off limits, whether that\u2019s terminal illness, the seduction of a minor or smashed prawns in a milky basket. The mistress of mind games, Tyrell wears crotchless pants to \u201cfeel the wind beneath her wings\u201d and plies her neighbour Don (Angus Deayton) with her meaty cushions while his multiple-sclerosis-stricken wife, Cath (Rebecca Front), is stranded outside in her wheelchair. By mistake, of course, because Tyrell is the ultimate gaslighter. She\u2019s the kind of woman who is not afraid to bribe the health and safety inspector with a bold promise: \u201cJoy will do anything for this salon, and bear in mind she can remove her dentures.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s not comedy for the faint-hearted, but it dates back to 2004, a time when Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys were just a twinkle in her eye and TV was free to be a bit more, well, cruel. Tyrell has no moral compass, so is comfortable riding into her <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/37053371\">husband\u2019s faux funeral on a horse</a> to a soundtrack of Heart\u2019s Alone or seducing Don and Cath\u2019s 12-year-old son.</p> <p>Although Davis\u2019s is the most outstanding (and astounding) character here, she\u2019s joined by so many greats: Ruth Jones as Lin-der the goth beautician; Felicity \u201cLynn from Alan Partridge\u201d Montagu as the proud-nippled vicar\u2019s wife; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVLekTm9io0\">Mark Gatiss as Jill\u2019s twitchy lover Glenn Bulb</a>. Davis goes to places so dark only she could imagine them and if you can stop hiding behind the cushion for long enough to join in the bleak hilarity, she will take you there too.

How many of those small-screen epics are truly worth revisiting? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qK-VGjMr8g\">The Wire</a> demands it. Not just because of its dimensions, the brilliantly crafted and realised characters or the resonance of its stories. But because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/06/the-wire-10-years-on-we-tore-the-cover-off-a-city-and-showed-the-american-dream-was-dead\">The Wire helps explain modern America</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/19/television.wire\">Barack Obama loved The Wire</a>. He even had a very unpresidential favourite character: stick-up merchant Omar Little (Michael K Williams). But think of the betrayed stevedores in season two. Would that impotent outrage have helped Hillary Clinton follow Obama into the White House? Or would those furious votes have gone the way of Donald Trump? In season two of The Wire, it\u2019s possible to see a shift beginning to take place as traditional modes of working-class political expression falter.</p> <p>Think of the \u201cfake news\u201d storyline of season five. How normalised the behaviour of the unscrupulous hack Scott Templeton seems now. Think of the press conferences in which cops posed proudly in front of tables piled high with drugs and guns. This was a drama about a world in which presenting narratives of success was more important than success itself. Remember the corner kids, battered by the Baltimore cops. This show dramatised the violence and dysfunction that led to the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement. In each of these examples, The Wire is a roadmap. This is how we got here.</p> <p>But if The Wire is a history lesson, it remains a ferociously entertaining and emotionally involving one. For all the analytical weight the show can bear, it always remained startlingly human. On all sides of the endless war of attrition at the heart of the show, David Simon and Ed Burns created characters who, for all of their often unforgivable flaws, remained deeply likable. They showed us that the drug kingpins, the murder detectives, the dope fiends and the hoppers on the corners shared one thing. They were all meat for the grinder; victims of the rigged game.</p> <p>This, in the end, is the true genius of The Wire. It\u2019s an achievement that, for all the considerable worth of Simon\u2019s later projects, he has never quite repeated. And actually, the lesser success of his subsequent shows serves to illuminate The Wire\u2019s uncanny brilliance. Its combination of narrative complexity, sociopolitical heft and thrilling, moving and occasionally hilarious human drama was a once-in-a-lifetime achievement.<strong> </strong>All the pieces really did matter. And they still do. <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>6<br><strong>You</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c8090b10f9c38fc17f48023793f7afceca21e00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c8090b10f9c38fc17f48023793f7afceca21e00/0_179_5366_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"He stares a little too long ...

Picture the scene: Joe, a boyband-hot bookshop employee, seems like the perfect man, but hides a whole load of secrets under his foppish fringe. In a genius casting move, he\u2019s played by Penn Badgley, the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/penn-badgley-gossip-girl-ending-makes-no-sense\">most lovable of Gossip Girl\u2019s ensemble cast</a>. What\u2019s not to trust about Badgley\u2019s face? Apart from the fact that he stares for a little too long and would imprison you in a glass cage as soon as look at you.</p> <p>Joe\u2019s chosen victim in the superior first season is the perma-annoying Guinevere Beck. She\u2019s all tight vests, downward dogs and impossibly perfect beachy hair, but you could guess her Instagram password in three tries. OK, she\u2019s not the first woman to fall under Joe\u2019s spell, but she plays right into the hands of her stalker, and not just with her ridiculous refusal to shut the aforementioned blinds. Really, Joe could shut that bookshop and make a living out of standing outside her window and staring while she showers/shags/shifts her furniture around.</p> <p>You was born out of the golden era of Netflix gloss (see also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFnI887xhBE\">What/If</a>, in which Ren\u00e9e Zellweger took her performance right down to cougar town, with beautifully trashy results). \u201cSoapy\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. Season one is the escapist jewel in the crown. New York is a softly lit theme park with loft apartments, bookshops where lovers\u2019 eyes meet over first editions, and vegan snacks. There are moments when Joe and Beck (yes, she goes by her surname) have the perfect romance. The kind that\u2019s always teetering on the brink of being blown apart by some terrible event. Oh, and there\u2019s murder too. If there\u2019s one life lesson here, it\u2019s never date anyone more intelligent or pretentious than yourself.</p> <p>Season two has Joe reborn in LA with a massive twist. Even if you nap through it, you\u2019ll still have received high drama and an improbable storyline by osmosis.

But in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvv97sCcruY\">The Staircase</a>, the answer to whether Michael Peterson killed his wife, Kathleen, in Durham, North Carolina, in December 2001 stays forever out of reach. The truth hovers above a mass of twists and fine details that are, as is common now but wasn\u2019t when French director <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/tv/2018/6/9/17442606/jean-xavier-de-lestrade-staircase-2018\">Jean-Xavier de Lestrade </a>embarked on the project, doled out according to the rhythms and structure of a fictional thriller. Even the question of Peterson\u2019s culpability ends up receding a little, obscured by something else that would become a trope of true crime: an expos\u00e9 of the flaws and quirks of a legal system that makes an announcement as to the defendant\u2019s guilt without really determining it to anyone\u2019s satisfaction.</p> <p>Another now-familiar theme is how this never-ending hunt for closure means the impact of a serious crime, rippling as a murder does through the lives of those left behind, is extended and worsened. But the boldest move The Staircase makes is in recognising how farcical the process is and allowing itself to be funny. Scenes filmed in offices and courtrooms filled with Peterson\u2019s expensive but somehow schmucky legal team are persistently chock full of inappropriate gags and hilariously bad early-noughties clothes. Who took this woman\u2019s life? America\u2019s best effort at finding out is a game, a joke.</p> <p>The later episodes in particular, though, focus back on the question of exactly what sort of man Peterson is. Certainly he\u2019s not fazed, and perhaps even actively delighted, at appearing on camera. Every true-crime documentary hopes it will find a protagonist as intriguing as the case itself, and there\u2019s never been a more sinfully alluring leading man than Michael Peterson. Did he do it? You\u2019ll feel guilty for enjoying the not knowing as much as you do. <strong>Jack Seale</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>8</h2> <h2><strong>Succession</strong></h2> <p><em>Purchase on iTunes/Amazon</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06034c330357313f73a340dd3a323da5138bf97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06034c330357313f73a340dd3a323da5138bf97d/0_272_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession\u2019s King Lear ...

Or the Maxwells? Or perhaps the Waltons (as in Walmart not as in John-Boy)? Time spent speculating on the real-life models for this family of media moguls is time wasted, when we could be appreciating the show\u2019s many on-screen pleasures instead.</p> <p>Jesse Armstrong\u2019s exploration of the neuroses of the super-rich could hardly be more relevant in 2020, but there\u2019s also something timelessly Shakespearean about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzYxJV_rmE8\">the Roy family dynamic</a>. Logan Roy (Brian Cox) is Succession\u2019s King Lear, an octogenarian with a leonine growl whose failing health only seems to tighten his grip on family business, Waystar Royco. From the very first episode of season one, he\u2019s teetering on the bring of retirement \u2013 or oblivion, as he would see it \u2013 but who will take his place? Each of his four children feels they have a claim, and they\u2019re compelled by emotional forces they barely understand to compete for his approval.</p> <p>This sibling rivalry between Con (Alan Ruck), Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Roman (Kieran Culkin) and Shiv (Sarah Snook) usually takes the form in boardroom backstabbing or venomous volleys of creative insults (remember, Armstrong sharpened his dialogue skills on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/oct/15/thick-of-it-malcolm-tucker\">The Thick of It</a>) but there\u2019s real human pathos here too. Kendall, in particular, is always excruciating to watch. At first, it\u2019s because he\u2019s so repugnant \u2013 the way he raps along to the stereo in his chauffeur-driven car en route to a big-money business meeting, for instance. Then, later in the series, it\u2019s because he\u2019s so pathetic. Logan Roy breaks his children\u2019s spirits with all the ruthlessness of a gulag guard.</p> <p>Then we get to the Roy family\u2019s outer circle, which includes Logan\u2019s dark-horse third wife Marcia (Hiam Abbass) and son-in-law Tom Wamsgans (a career-best performance from the ever-excellent Matthew Macfadyen). Tom\u2019s workplace bullying of gangly interloper Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) is often a source of comic relief but, as with any Succession scene, the tone can shift in an instant.</p> <p>Any single episode is enough to appraise you of the noteworthy locations, elegant costume design, great dialogue or that incredible theme music by the Academy Award-nominated composer Nicholas Britell. To appreciate Succession\u2019s greatest triumph, however, the way it makes you care about the most unlikable characters, you really have to see the whole thing from beginning to end. It\u2019s a kind of sorcery. <strong>Ellen E Jones</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>9</h2> <h2><strong>Louis Theroux\u2019s Weird Weekends</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc4beb50e86565ad2d54ec72e3cfa56ea7ff07d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc4beb50e86565ad2d54ec72e3cfa56ea7ff07d4/0_94_1406_1671/841.jpg\" alt=\"Humane interrogations ...

Louis Theroux\u2019s Weird Weekends. Photograph: Brian Ritchie/BBC Two</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Ritchie/BBC TWO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nowadays, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/mar/26/louis-theroux-my-secret-fear-is-that-im-not-helping\">Louis Theroux</a> is part-man, part-meme: the documentarian\u2019s awkward charm and distinctively gawky silhouette has birthed ironic T-shirts, reaction gifs, a popular \u201cno-context\u201d Twitter account and a slew of other internet jokes. Yet Theroux began making his trademark fish-out-of-water films before many of his Gen Z stans had even been born. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/group/b006w7gn\">Weird Weekends</a>, which aired on BBC2 between 1998 to 2000, saw Theroux get to grips with some of the US\u2019s most unusual residents, from swingers and wrestlers to infomercial hosts and survivalist preppers (who don\u2019t look quite so kooky now).</p> <p>In the late 90s, Theroux was living in the US, presenting segments on Michael Moore\u2019s comedy-news show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX11EmxnPxE\">TV Nation</a>. Weird Weekends expanded on the latter\u2019s portrayal of him as the quintessential British geek marooned in a society so unfamiliar he might as well have been from a different planet. As the title suggests, these are neither righteous nor intellectually rigorous documentaries \u2013 but Weird Weekends isn\u2019t point-and-laugh-grade telly either. Instead, it most closely resembles a slightly surreal sitcom, with Theroux the only recurring cast member. And it was one that established its star as a beloved British TV character: archetypically reserved, thoughtful and droll, but never stuck up.</p> <p>Theroux\u2019s always game enough to get stuck in, whether the task is performing a rap song on the radio or playing a park ranger in a porn movie. Cringily comedic, Weird Weekends has more in common with The Office than Panorama, but as with all Theroux\u2019s documentaries, there\u2019s a layer of compassion that gives these shows emotional depth. The laughs are always split democratically between our slightly odd guide and his marginally odder hosts.</p> <p>In recent years, Theroux documentaries are more likely to have you in cold sweats than fits of giggles. Once Weird Weekends had run its course, the filmmaker embarked on a series of celebrity interviews titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9Nfd6LjoI4\">When Louis Met \u2026</a>, now infamous for an episode that naively chronicled the life of Jimmy Savile. His BBC Two specials followed, seeing Theroux pivot from dispatches from the outer corners of normality to disturbing subjects that mainly related to crime and mental illness \u2013 even revisiting his time with Savile, and the guilt he feels for not challenging him more. Weird Weekends may be far fluffier than Theroux\u2019s later work, but the show is still essentially a thoughtful and humane interrogation of why people do the things they do \u2013 a subject that, unlike a cheesy Theroux-themed sweatshirt, will never go out of fashion. <strong>Rachel Aroesti</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>10</h2> <h2><strong>Line of Duty</strong></h2> <p><em>BBC iPlayer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4ba0f029adbd730ec679875039445cf2424edf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ba0f029adbd730ec679875039445cf2424edf9/0_143_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Compston, Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure in Line of Duty.

A Hollywood-grade lead (in the form of Thandie Newton) and a shift from BBC Two to One doubled the show\u2019s viewership, and AC-12\u2019s mysterious and (presumably) righteous shenanigans began dominating the national conversation like few shows before or since. Yet if you only jumped on the Line of Duty bandwagon in 2017, you are in for a treat: the first three lesser-watched series of the cop thriller comprise some of the cleverest and most compelling television this country has produced.</p> <p>Centring on the increasingly unsavoury actions of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ98VaOoz94\">DCI Tony Gates</a> (Lennie James), series one began building the complex foundations of the Line of Duty universe, introducing the three pillars of anti-corruption unit 12: undercover officer DC Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), Martin Compston\u2019s DS Steve Arnott and, of course, big boss <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i35TeNu1gp4\">DCI Ted Hastings</a> (AKA unlikely heartthrob Adrian Dunbar). Dark, disturbing and, eventually, devastating, the first series suggested this was no run-of-the-mill crime drama. But it was with its second outing, featuring Keeley Hawes in the performance of her career as the dowdy and progressively mind-bending <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz4lizAJJ_U\">DI Lindsay Denton</a>, that the show really found its feet. Over a spine-tingling two-season arc, the trio investigate exactly what Denton did and, more to the point, why; the narrative rolls along at pace, while remaining absolutely impossible to second-guess. It\u2019s also the juncture where the loyalty and integrity of the unit starts coming into question \u2013 a conundrum that would soon help power the series into ubiquity.</p> <p>Which brings us to the show\u2019s latter two seasons. Newton\u2019s DCI Roz Huntley and her nightmarish hand wound helped amp up the drama while codifying the show\u2019s tropes. They included Mercurio\u2019s fondness for killing off big-name actors early on, Hasting\u2019s array of beguiling catchphrases (personal favourite: \u201cI didn\u2019t float up the Lagan in a bubble!\u201d), and the recurring insistence that, where police corruption was concerned, the rot went all the way to the top. The hair-raising finale set up the subsequent, and most recent, series as must-see TV, with questions about the motives of Hastings in particular forcing obsessives to dig deep into the show\u2019s archives to look for clues. The truth, of course, is that nobody knows where Line Of Duty is going (perhaps not even Mercurio himself), but if you put the hours in, this murky, adrenaline-fuelled drama will keep you glued to your sofa. <strong>Rachel Aroesti</strong></p> <h2><strong><br></strong>* * *</h2> <h2>11</h2> <h2><strong>Lost</strong></h2> <p><em>Amazon</em><em>Prime Video<br></em>Whenever I talk to people about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTu8iDynwNc\">Lost</a>, which is all the time, people tell me that they never got around to finishing the series.

Watch the middle bit, where the show treaded water with episodes that had no larger bearing on the overall series. Watch the end, where the wheels came off and it turned into a genuinely absurd sci-fi about time travel and nuclear explosions. Then watch the finale, and tell me that you didn\u2019t enjoy it. <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>12</h2> <h2><strong>Our Friends in the North</strong></h2> <p><em>Britbox</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73a086bb9db4f0e3904cab41a382d1b0cb0c48e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73a086bb9db4f0e3904cab41a382d1b0cb0c48e8/0_143_1920_1581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Eccleston and Daniel Craig in Our Friends in the North.

But while their personal dramas are punctuated by the economic crises of the 70s, the dawning of Thatcher in 1979 and the miners\u2019 strike of the mid-80s, the political elements never feel heavy-handed. Instead, they feel like functions of the individual personalities, part of the accumulation of their lived experiences, their hopes and dreams. The politics matter. But not as much as the people. <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>13<br><strong>The Keepers</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68d241634c4207191d585ea6a69cbd87123e2dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d241634c4207191d585ea6a69cbd87123e2dab/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moving and troubling ...

This slice of mid-century nostalgia set in the advertising industry perhaps has not retained the same sense of awe as other TV greats of that era \u2013 but it is littered with acting talent (Elisabeth Moss!

If you were to watch it for the first time now, you might not get a sense of how revolutionary it was at the time, but that is because every other comedy made in the past two decades has absorbed its sensibility. Even if you have not seen it, you talk the way you talk because of Seinfeld. In one sense, bingeing Seinfeld in 2020 is an act of historical exploration. Then again, it remains one of the funniest shows ever made. Watch the shaky beginning, before it perfected its tone. Watch the locomotive years, when nothing else on television could touch it. It is just a shame about the finale. <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>17</h2> <h2><strong>The Office</strong> (UK)</h2> <p><em>Netflix<br></em>Sure, Ricky Gervais now spends his days making sub-par jokes about how the world has gone PC mad and only he \u2013 a very wealthy, successful comedian \u2013 can see the light, but the world has much to thank him for. Not least <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PHpkdvNOs\">The Office</a>, a titan of a mockumentary, which plumbed new depths of cringe. As David Brent, Gervais was a trailblazer of the self-obsessed, megalomaniacal boss before such people ended up on reality TV (see: The Apprentice) and even running the world. As a progenitor of the sadcom that has, from Fleabag to Transparent, dominated TV ever since, in many ways The Office is one of the saddest shows you can watch. But it is also a total joy to behold \u2013 especially those Christmas specials. <strong>Hannah J Davies</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>18</h2> <h2><strong>Call My Agent</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix<br></em>Buckle in for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmbD3DwItZo\">a riot of showbiz ego</a> in this French comedy about the disastrous personal lives and glittering careers of the staff of one of Paris\u2019s leading talent agencies. As they struggle to keep afloat amid various financial and creative crises, the agents veer through personal melodramas from ill-advised trysts to infidelities, paternity tests and even \u2013 if you stick with it \u2013 a birth on the office floor. Such is the show\u2019s genius, and genuine adoration for the art of film, that many stars \u2013 even Juliette Binoche \u2013 play themselves in it.

Copenhagen-based detective inspector Sarah Lund (Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l) is finishing her final days on the job before joining her fiance in Sweden, when a 19-year-old woman is found raped and murdered. Lund delays her transfer and gets to work, eventually teaming up with her replacement, Jan Meyer (S\u00f8ren Malling), for an investigation that moves slowly by comparison with traditional case-of-the-week crime dramas. Each episode represents 24 hours of police work, but the series also explores a family\u2019s grief and political corruption to gripping effect.

Although at first it looks quite different from the precarious lives of today\u2019s twentysomethings, themes of entering the world of work, figuring out who you are and getting trashed still resonate. As do the lovably flawed characters, particularly Anna (Daniela Nardini) and Miles (Jack Davenport). The sexual tension is so electrifying it is amazing that the house did not burn down. A backdrop of 90s club culture (most memorably when Anna takes Egg\u2019s dad clubbing) and a soundtrack deeply ingrained in the era only adds to the nostalgia. <strong>Sarah Phillips</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>23</h2> <h2><strong>End of the F**king World</strong></h2> <p><em>All4; Netflix</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a99a59bd5345c0921d9064f4a97adb5caf1c5287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a99a59bd5345c0921d9064f4a97adb5caf1c5287/63_0_1873_1124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A youthful take on Bonnie and Clyde ...

Student and social outcast James (Alex Lawther) is convinced that he is a psychopath with a hunger to kill, setting his sights on fellow oddball Alyssa (Jessica Barden). It may not seem like the ideal start point for a touching romance, but the road trip that ensues offers a tender and thought-provoking exploration of adolescence, a rallying cry for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. Its minimalist style and stark, western-inspired visuals are immediately striking \u2013 but the sparkling dialogue is what will keep you coming back. The response of Alyssa to a shopkeeper who is dissatisfied with his life stays with me to this day: \u201cThen do something.\u201d <strong>Scott Bryan</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>24</h2> <h2><strong>Search Party</strong></h2> <p><em>All4</em><br>Best known as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvvHPE8VjcA\">Arrested Development\u2019s plucky Maeby</a>, Alia Shawkat came into her own in this full-throttle black comedy about a young woman who goes missing and the egotistical Brooklynites who have to find her (among them, the dangerously narcissistic Elliott (John Early) and Portia (Meredith Hagner), who is entirely devoid of self-awareness. While the first run is a perfect, self-contained whodunnit, a couple of huge twists allowed it to stretch into a second series, with another on the way. A show that is as scary as it is entirely ludicrous (watch out for the cult operating from under a luxe jewellery store), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=search+party+trailer\">Search Party</a> has a way of hooking you in, even if, invariably, you will end up in a love/hate relationship with its central clique and Shawkat\u2019s backbone-free Dory. <strong>Hannah J Davies</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>25</h2> <h2><strong>The L Word</strong></h2> <p><em>Available to buy on Amazon<br></em>Once upon a time, a same-sex storyline on a TV show was such a rarity that even a hint of gayish subtext was enough to guarantee a queer audience. These days, it does not feel like the unicorn rarity it once did. In part, that is thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWcaOs8dgF0\">The L Word</a>, which arrived in 2004 (and was recently rebooted). Elements of this brilliantly soapy saga have aged about as well as you would expect of a show that asked questions about gender and sexuality more than 15 years ago, but it remains a total hoot, offering high-stakes drama with a campy flair that becomes more pronounced as it progresses. You can have a ball just wondering exactly how any key character\u2019s personality is going to be dramatically overhauled from one season to the next. <strong>Rebecca Nicholson</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>26</h2> <h2><strong>The Royle Family</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix<br></em>What you need now, more than anything, is warmth.

This is a show so warm that, in one episode, two adults sing No Surprises by Radiohead to a sleeping baby and it seems like the most tender act in all of history. Let The Royle Family act as your surrogate family in the coming weeks. A bunch of familiar faces, sitting on well-worn sofas, aimlessly trading affectionate insults for half an hour at a time sounds like an absolute balm at the minute. This is comfort TV at its most comfortable. <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>27</h2> <h2><strong>Catastrophe</strong></h2> <p><em>All4</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad1445d1f3a1f6d4f6d10eb951c586b111a6ce58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1445d1f3a1f6d4f6d10eb951c586b111a6ce58/0_159_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brilliantly filthy ...

Over four snappy seasons, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney depict how messy relationships can be with unflinching honesty. The show follows the romance between a middle-aged couple played by the co-creators. What starts as a holiday fling moves into a long-term relationship when Horgan gets pregnant. What follows is a poignant, hilarious look at the difficulties facing all couples. Each episode is crammed with brilliantly filthy and at times downright savage one-liners that get to the heart of sex, marriage, parenthood and the sheer hard work it takes to stay in love, especially when life and all its troubles get in the way. This is a believable love story between two very likable but flawed individuals portrayed with warmth and acidic charm.<strong> Ann Lee</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>28</h2> <h2><strong>Better Things</strong></h2> <p><em>BBC iPlayer<br></em>Although she has been in showbiz since childhood, Pamela Adlon was once best known for her Louis CK collaborations (she played a love interest on his sitcom, Louie, and he co-wrote Better Things\u2019 first season). But while Louis CK\u2019s reputation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/10/louis-ck-sexual-misconduct-allegations-comedy\">took a #MeToo-related dive</a> (Adlon described his behaviour as \u201cabhorrent\u201d), her star has continued her rise. She stars here as Sam Fox, a working actress and single mother to three teenage daughters, living in a languid, sometimes dreamlike Los Angeles. Sure, everyone has their own semi-autobiographical comedy-drama these days, but Better Things has undersold itself. This is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/28/better-things-gets-better-pamela-adlon-triumphs-without-louis-ck\">the best of all possible things</a>: a feminist Curb Your Enthusiasm with more heart \u2013 and more womb \u2013 than all the other pretenders put together. <strong>Ellen E Jones</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>29</h2> <h2><strong>Queer as Folk</strong></h2> <p><em>All4<br></em>The word \u201ciconic\u201d is too often thrown around, but never has it felt more apt than to describe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIavR_pk__E\">Queer as Folk</a>. The series did not just introduce the British public to queerness; it confidently bludgeoned them with it \u2013 with the opening episode alone featuring underage sex, threesomes and rimming. Try explaining that to your mum. As well as being unapologetic, it was joyful, explicit \u2013 euphoric, even \u2013 in its depiction of queer (male) life. Written and created by Russell T Davies, it follows three gay men living and loving on Manchester\u2019s gay scene. It launched the careers of Charlie Hunnam (now of sub-par Hollywood fare) and Aidan Gillen from The Wire and Game of Thrones, but more importantly it put gay sex on terrestrial TV \u2013 and for that a whole generation of teenage boys will be for ever grateful. <strong>Dylan B Jones</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>30</h2> <h2><strong>Friday Night Lights</strong></h2> <p><em>Amazon</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f75d8bea94e8f9aeb992a136b78fc563c452ac2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f75d8bea94e8f9aeb992a136b78fc563c452ac2/0_147_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agonising twists and turns ...

It is left to eager new coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) and his wife, Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), a guidance counsellor, to pick up the pieces, while handling other crises \u2013 from absent parents to addiction \u2013 that afflict the town\u2019s teenagers. You need not like (or even understand) American football to enjoy the show; in no time at all, the wonderfully captured drama on the field will captivate you just as much as the drama off it. Through five seasons of agonising twists and turns \u2013 perhaps most dramatically with Tyra and Landry\u2019s devastating storyline in the second (even if the ramifications were quickly brushed under the carpet) \u2013 the team\u2019s motto burns brightly: \u201cClear eyes, full hearts, can\u2019t lose.\u201d <strong>Sarah Phillips</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>31<strong> <br>The Thick of It</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix/BBC iPlayer</em><strong><br></strong>You shouldn\u2019t need an opportunity to rewatch The Thick of It.

If you haven\u2019t seen it since the altogether more slick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\">Veep</a>, you might be taken aback by how joyously ramshackle this cheap little no-risk BBC Four sitcom feels. But that is part of its charm. When Malcolm Tucker bares his teeth for the first time in the first scene of the first episode, it is like stumbling across a found-footage horror film. It\u2019s nightmarish. You might not think now is a good time to watch a show about the incompetent failings of national government.

A girl died. A good-hearted stranger comes to town to investigate. Then weirdness ensues. But, at least to my mind, the 2017 sequel has now become the definitive Twin Peaks. Aggressively avant garde in places, and truly terrifying in others, it is like nothing else that has ever been on television. It is not an easy watch by any means. In fact, sometimes it is downright maddening.

If you are not hooked after the first four episodes, culminating in the depiction of the real-life murder of Wild Bill Hickok (an all-too-brief turn from Keith Carradine), there is something wrong with you.

Stuffed to the gills with callbacks and inter-show references, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TntmMY7N8ag\">Arrested Development</a> benefits hugely from back-to-back (and repeat) viewing \u2013 and the impressive gag-rate and endlessly ridiculous narrative accelerations mean the episodes simply fly by. Masterminded by The Ellen Show co-creator Mitchell Hurwitz, Arrested Development began airing in 2003, with three near-peerless seasons before it was cancelled, only to be resurrected for two more disappointing outings on Netflix. Nonetheless, we will always have those early years tracing the many trials (sometimes literally) of the extremely rich, extremely entitled and extremely eccentric Newport Beach crew. Cue layers of cartoonish plotlines, catchphrases galore and a veritable labyrinth of addictively quotable in-jokes; not to mention some of greatest slapstick that television comedy has ever seen. <strong>Rachel Aroesti</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>36 <br><strong>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix</em> <br>A true millennial phenomenon. The idea of a feminist musical sitcom that majors on mental health issues might cause eyes to roll. But don\u2019t switch over to Friends just yet. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is hilarious, pioneering and eminently watchable. It has caused controversy since first being aired in 2015, chronicling the life struggles of its main character Rebecca (played wonderfully by its writer-creator Rachel Bloom) \u2013 from her obsessive fixations and borderline personality disorder, to suicide attempts and abortions \u2013 all with a sunny musical theatre soundtrack. What could be heavy, dramatic fare, is dealt with confidently, accompanied by a righteous wink; the <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/01/crazy-ex-girlfriend-cats-itchy-hungry-funky-nostalgia.html\">Cats special</a> is a thing to behold, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uab2BlDpPxQ\">Period Sex</a> will be stuck in your head for weeks. Bloom has been nominated for multiple Emmies, Glaad awards and Golden Globes for her performance, and rightly so \u2013 she shines.

So much good came from the Gallaghers: Fiona\u2019s unutterably sweet on-screen romance with Steve led to the real-life marriage of Duff and co-star James McAvoy; Maxine Peake built her reputation as fearsome neighbour Veronica, and stories were told about British working-class life without condescension or judgment.

The sheer beauty of all that it uncovered is wonderfully escapist in itself (episode two, The Deep, is a psychedelic wonder), and at a pinch, it may also provide just a little of what\u2019s needed in times like these: travel without travelling, education without crowds, and a reminder of the respect we must have for the unforgiving power of nature. <strong>Rebecca Nicholson</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>42<br><strong>Noughts + Crosses</strong></h2> <p><em>BBC iPlayer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d64bc78a89468815820a89d7bfe33f07e3a43b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d64bc78a89468815820a89d7bfe33f07e3a43b67/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romeo and Juliet in a race-reversed society ...

Those 200-plus episodes, along with the ongoing 11th and final series, make the story of various factions of the Pritchett clan \u2013 including a gay couple with a daughter, introduced to a mainstream American audience as part of the happy warp and weft of normal suburban life \u2013 one of the longest running sitcoms in television history. Of course there have been peaks and troughs in that time, but it has always been of standout quality, with laugh-a-line scenes, some of which are so light and fleet that you barely catch them skimming past you, making every episode ripe for rewatching. <strong>Lucy Mangan</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>44 <br><strong>Dirty John</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6769934f5225160280c190303bb8e39a807bcbbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6769934f5225160280c190303bb8e39a807bcbbe/0_327_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Particularly shocking ...

Chief among them is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG70KroYlik\">Dirty John</a>, adapted from the hit Wondery show about a devious, bedraggled conman who wormed his way into the life of a moneyed businesswoman, Debra Newell, by posing as a successful anaesthesiologist (he was in fact a former nurse anaesthetist who had spent time in prison for fraud). The total gall displayed by John Meehan \u2013 as he attempted a Parasite-esque takeover of Newell\u2019s life \u2013 would be enough to stun most people. But, combined with a helping of Netflix melodrama, it makes for a particularly shocking, if knowingly cheesy, watch. <strong>Hannah J Davies</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>45<br><strong>New Girl</strong></h2> <p><em>Amazon Prime Video</em><br>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/25/zooey-deschanel-interview\">Zooey Deschanel</a> vehicle has two main things going for it. First, it is funny. Second, there are a lot of episodes. I adopted New Girl as my back-up binge show a couple of years ago, dropping in and out when there wasn\u2019t anything exciting on, and I still haven\u2019t made it to the finale. The best thing about an ensemble sitcom such as New Girl is that \u2013 if you hang in there for long enough \u2013 all the characters have their time to shine. Schmidt is the breakout character, but then he is eclipsed by the ornery Nick. And then, out of nowhere, Winston becomes the absurdist one who holds the whole show together. This is a series so egalitarian that even Megan Fox is able to become its funniest thing for a decent stretch of episodes. <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>46 <br><strong>Years and Years</strong></h2> <p><em>BBC iPlayer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32d287071cde97933f05489825538900bc81efdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d287071cde97933f05489825538900bc81efdf/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Horrifying and plausible ...

With its grim projections about rampant populism, accelerating climate crisis, the madness of crowds and the bewildering pace of technological change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/years-and-years-review-a-glorious-near-future-drama-from-russell-t-davies\">Years and Years</a> felt worryingly on the nose when it aired last year. Suffice to say, its vision hasn\u2019t got much more comforting in the meantime. But as horrifying \u2013 and frequently plausible \u2013 as the travails of the Lyons family were, the show does, eventually, speak to resilience and continuity. By the skin of their teeth, and not without a couple of casualties, the family keeps it together. And so, just about, does the country. <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>47<br><strong>Lovesick</strong></h2> <p><em>Netflix</em><br>The sitcom previously known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/16/c4-comedy-scotal-recall-returns-as-netflix-series-lovesick\">Scrotal Recall </a>was always far better than a show with that painful pun as a name had any right to be. But with a new moniker, and a shift to Netflix, fresh life was breathed into the tale of four twentysomethings navigating friendship, relationships and STIs post university. The laughs may be gentle, but the writing by Tom Edge is subtle and the characters well drawn, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/15/johnny-flynn-renaissance-man-to-regency-hero-emma-film\">Johnny Flynn</a> (brother of Jerome) leading the cast as the chlamydia-infected Dylan tracking down his previous conquests to break the news. It\u2019s a neat conceit, and the will they/won\u2019t they romance with Antonia Thomas\u2019s Evie is in the greatest of sitcom traditions \u2013 and far less frustrating when watched in one go. <strong>Toby Moses</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>48 <br><strong>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</strong></h2> <p><em>All4</em><br>The cop comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEOuJ4z5aTc\">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a> is a feelgood proposition on every level. It is a properly funny comedy. It is undemanding moreish fare. It has charm, it has warmth, it has heart. Its characters are fundamentally united, chafing and rubbing together enough to strike comic sparks but essentially hanging together in the fight against the villainry. True antipathy or hostility has no place here. But best of all, and most valuably perhaps in our current times, it also shows every sign of the ensemble cast being free of it, too. It is impossible to know for sure, of course \u2013 the set may be a hotbed of hatred and warring egos \u2013 but one feels that the easy camaraderie on display is impossible to fake entirely. Add to that the joy of seeing Andre Braugher \u2013 Frank freaking Pembleton from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/27/homicide-life-street-david-simon\"> Homicide: Life on the Streets</a>, people! \u2013 in a light comic role and all that it left to say is, of course, NOICE! <strong>Lucy Mangan</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>49<br><strong>Brideshead Revisited</strong></h2> <p><em>Amazon Prime Video/BritBox</em><br>They don\u2019t, in so many senses, make them like this any more. ITV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNOG8vxxmvQ\">1981 version</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/evelynwaugh\">Evelyn Waugh</a>\u2019s 1945 novel was, with its 11-hour running time, not far off granting the wish of those viewers who like dramatisations to include every word of the book. That meant the world Waugh conjured \u2013 fading nobility, eccentric inter-war hedonism and grassy afternoons at a perfectly proper Oxford University \u2013 could be allowed to completely envelop the viewer. In the days before the big US box-set beasts, Brideshead Revisited was routinely cited as the best TV show of all time. In part, that was due to the exquisite score, the sky-high production values and the brilliant cast. But its appeal has always been mainly as a door to a fantasy of a bygone world. That\u2019s now perhaps more valuable than ever. <strong>Jack Seale</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>50 <br><strong>Fresh Meat</strong></h2> <p><em>All4</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d14177d67b6c616ed87b6912f9e14a2274fb88d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d14177d67b6c616ed87b6912f9e14a2274fb88d/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not quite drama, not quite comedy ...

But this is not a sitcom \u2013 it sits in that weird half-space, not quite a drama, not quite a comedy \u2013 where so many TV shows flounder. Yet Fresh Meat pulls through with a hugely talented young cast bringing to life a collection of university misfits adjusting to house-sharing \u2013 and hinted at the drama chops of Armstrong, who would go on to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/succession\">Succession</a> without his long-time collaborator. Jack Whitehall impresses as the posh dimwit best avoided in the uni bar, while Zawe Ashton\u2019s beautifully surreal turn as Vod never fails to entertain, even if the thrill is somewhat diminished in the latter series when the character is pushed to the emotional forefront. Across four series, we see the characters mature, regress and mature again \u2013 before it reaches its natural endpoint with graduation. <strong>Toby Moses</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 and 20 March 2020.

It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/apr/30/sinking-city-how-venice-is-managing-europes-worst-tourism-crisis\">protests against overtourism</a> under the No Grande Navi (\u201cNo more cruise ships\u201d) slogan.</p> <p>At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between.

  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way to bring money in,\u201d says the Metronomy bassist, Olugbenga Adelekan, who is preparing to give an online lesson from his home studio. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be loads of money because I\u2019ve said to people it\u2019s pay what you can afford, but at least it\u2019s a way to combat the looming spectre of full isolation.\u201d</p> <p>The Brighton band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/may/06/eat-your-wet-wipes-metronomys-joe-mount-on-how-to-survive-festivals\">Metronomy</a> were supposed to be playing sold-out dates in Portugal, Spain and France at the start of their European tour when the Covid-19 outbreak meant all their shows were cancelled. This week, instead of taking to the stage in Madrid, Adelekan has started giving <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B96UMKoHnGs/\">online tutorials</a> in bass and music production.</p> <p>After announcing the lessons on Instagram, Adelekan has got more than a dozen confirmed bookings and he is joining a growing number of acts who are using social media to continue their careers now coronavirus has put their plans on pause.</p> <p>This week, Neil Young, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Keith Urban and pop-punk act Yungblud have all put on or promised impromptu online performances as most major concerts, festivals and gigs are cancelled until at least after the summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B90Ft_knpuT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>An under-reported element of the government\u2019s current health policy is that they want us to acquire herd immunity not to coronavirus but to Julian Fellowes. This is the most likely explanation I can think of for exposing us to a second series created and written \u2013 to stretch the meaning of the word to the very furthest reaches of and possibly slightly beyond its natural elastic limits \u2013 by him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/15/belgravia-review-julian-fellowes-is-caught-in-an-uptown-funk\">mere days after his </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/15/belgravia-review-julian-fellowes-is-caught-in-an-uptown-funk\">last one, Belgravia</a>, was allowed on to our screens. Let\u2019s all look out for each other, check on the neighbours and try to stay safe.</p> <p>The latest infection site is The English Game (Netflix). It is about football. It is about the inflection point in the game when it went from being one codified and played by poshos to one that was dominated by and united the common man. It is Downton Abbey for boys. It is terrible.</p> <p>It is mostly terrible because Fellowes has discovered The North. We\u2019ll get to that. I just wanted to prepare you.</p> <p>We set our scene in England, 1879. Captions explain that, until now, no working-class team has ever reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. The Old Etonians have a stranglehold over it and Top Player is a man called Arthur Kinnaird, played by Edward Holcroft because somebody\u2019s got to. He\u2019s awfully good at the kickyball, but if players had sponsors yet his would be Hubris. Because over in Darwen, Lancashire, practising in the looming shadow of the dark, satanic mill in which they work 26 hours a day is Team Nemesis.</p> <p>Despite t\u2019rickets, t\u2019TB and t\u2019whippet fever that the sub-How We Used to Live costumes and set dressing implicitly assure us are rampant throughout the village, Team Nemesis have made it through to t\u2019quarter-finals. To ensure their progress to the semis, however, mill owner James t\u2019Walsh (Craig Parkinson) has imported two fine players from Partick, Scot\u2019land \u2013 Fergus Suter (Kevin Guthrie) and Jimmy Love (James Harkness) as ringers and is secretly paying them for their participation in a strictly amateur game. Gasp, if you care. It is unlikely you do because nothing has been written, shown or scored in a way to elicit any degree of human emotion.</p> <p>T\u2019mill workers play t\u2019toffs. They t\u2019beat them to a draw after a bad start because Suter tells them: \u201cYou don\u2019t always have to run the ball forwards!\u201d at half-time and, like Neo being plugged into a dataset and two minutes later knowing kung fu, they transform into 11 David Beckhams circa 2001. But t\u2019toffs turn out to be cads and bounders, and use a loophole \u2013 in the rules they made, what-what! \u2013 to refuse them extra time.

  "<p>Precarious employment, low pay, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/03/women-not-entitled-to-pension-age-change-compensation-rules-high-court\">increased pension age</a> and real-term reductions in welfare benefits are causing increasing numbers of mothers to fall into long-term debt, according to research based on figures from the Office for National Statistics and in-depth interviews.</p> <p>The research, titled <a href=\"https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/its-hard-im-drowning/\">Mothers in Debt </a><a href=\"https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/its-hard-im-drowning/\">\u2013 Shame, Abuse and Resilience</a>, by researchers at the University of Manchester, found that separated or divorced mothers aged 55 and over were more likely to have significantly worse financial problems than fathers of the same age.</p> <p>\u201cWhile older mothers are not a homogenous group, many have spent their lives in low-paid jobs and juggling debts, usually as a result of trying to provide for their families,\u201d said Dr Kingsley Purdam, the co-author of the paper, which will appear in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ageing-and-society\">Ageing and Society</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/older-people-widely-demonised-uk-ageism-report\">Older people widely demonised in UK, ageism report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Purdam and his co-author, Dr Jennifer Prattley, found that 44% of older, divorced mothers reported having difficulties keeping up with bills and credit commitments, compared with 19% of married mothers. Older mothers were also more likely than older fathers to report that their finances were getting worse.</p> <p>\u201cAll of the mothers had made financial sacrifices to support their children and maintain their home but were now facing financial penalties for this,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cThe debts had taken over their lives. Some of the women were being threatened with eviction and some were relying on food banks.\u201d</p> <p>Mary, who has two children and debts of about \u00a33,400, told the researchers: \u201cIt\u2019s hard, I\u2019m drowning. They won\u2019t give me any more hours at work. I\u2019m just chasing myself all the time. Someone told me to sell myself on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth said her debts, of \u00a36,000, had made her consider killing herself. The mother of two said: \u201cI was that far from doing you know what. I don\u2019t want to see the evening. I don\u2019t want to wake up any more. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p> <p>Lydia, a widowed mother of three with debts of about \u00a35,800, said she had no idea how to manage her own finances. \u201cI think I have got an invisible fairy around me and things will get paid,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never dealt with a bill in my life. My husband did it.\u201d</p> <p>Following the breakdown of relationships, the research found, many older mothers were at increased risk of accumulating debt and of bankruptcy, particularly those aged 55 and over.</p> <p>\u201cMany women had kept their financial problems hidden due to fear and shame whilst bringing up their children,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cSome had been subject to coercive control and economic abuse by their former husbands or partners.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/tackling-problem-debt/\">Recent evidence</a> in the UK suggests personal debt levels are at a record high, including debts that can lead to eviction and a prison sentence. <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/corporate/our-annual-report-and-accounts-2017-18\">Other evidence</a> suggests 8.3 million people in the UK have problem debts.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45179019_When_marriage_ends_Economic_and_Social_Consequences_of_Partnership_Dissolution\">Further research</a> has shown that many older married and divorced women have experienced a lifetime of their husbands controlling the money in the home and continue to do so. After divorce, women can have more difficulties paying off their debts compared with divorced men.</p> <p>Some women <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/14717794200600011/full/html\">have been found</a> to be trying to overcome control by their husbands and partners by secretly giving money to their children from savings they have made by sacrificing their own needs.</p> <p>Kingsley said that as the size of the older population continued to grow, and given the longer life expectancy of women, it was \u201cimportant that any pension reforms, changes to minimum wage rates, and new divorce and domestic abuse legislation and welfare policies take account of the circumstances of separated, divorced and widowed older women\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMore financial support and advice needs to be provided to older women facing financial difficulties,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>I started ice skating when I was four. Initially, I was just tagging along with my sister, but soon enough the sport became my entire life. In 2004, when I was 10, I won the Moscow Championships and I was a candidate to become a \u201cmaster of sport\u201d \u2013 a Russian title for international champions who have made valuable contributions to sport. I was told that I had what it took to become a professional and even take part in the Olympics. I didn\u2019t go to school, because I had to train for up to six hours a day. All of my friends were ice skaters; it was the only thing I knew.</p> <p>When I was 12, puberty kicked in. I started menstruating and my body changed rapidly. Even though I was just an average teenager, I knew right away that there would be a chance my body would prevent me from being the best skater I could be. With a bigger body, I would no longer be able to do some of the complicated jumps that are necessary for competitions. Besides, in ice skating, a slim, childish body is the beauty standard. A curvy body is not.</p> <p>Training was tough: I had to follow a strict diet. For every kilo I gained, I had to run extra kilometres on top of my usual 15km. My body was being pushed to extremes. I ruined my knees trying to lose weight, but my body never went back to its prepubescent state, despite all the effort.</p> <p>At this point, I was advised to take medication that would block the production of hormones: I would stop menstruating, my breasts would stop growing \u2013 and I would keep my young, slim body. I never questioned it. In Russia, it is widely known that young ice skaters use hormone blockers to keep their bodies from changing. In most cases, taking the hormone blockers works \u2013 although there are always side-effects, such as problems with your nervous system and your heart, that no one really talks about.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that the professional ice skating judges are explicitly sexist for not liking a voluptuous female body: the weight of your breasts really does affect your jumps. But many young girls are pushed to a point at which they have to quit the sport entirely; they literally break their bodies. All the older professional skaters have metal screws and plates in their bodies, because they have been ruined by competing. My sister is 25 years old and has fake knees.</p> <p>In my case, the drugs backfired \u2013 they had the opposite effect to the one intended. I took them for only three months, but my breasts grew rapidly and I gained 36kg (5st 9lb) in six months. I never got back to my normal body. There was no longer any chance of me competing at the highest level, so I quit ice skating altogether.</p> <p>Losing everything I had fought for caused me to sink into a deep depression for most of my teenage years. It also meant that, aged 14, I had to go to school for the first time. It was harsh. I was bullied a lot and people called me fat all the time. It wasn\u2019t even something I was mad about: in Russia, it is normal to scold someone for being overweight.</p> <p>Eventually, I realised I could get out of my depression only by redefining who I was and no longer focusing on my weight. I decided to start educating myself; I learned Spanish and went to law school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/06/experience-ive-been-protesting-for-seven-decades\">Experience: I\u2019ve been protesting for seven decades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Russia, there is no system in place to create a healthy sports environment for children. Some figures within ice skating have started publicly criticising these medications, but there was nothing in place to protect me.</p> <p>I am now a coach myself. I teach only children who skate to improve their health, not those who do so with the intention of becoming professionals. Also, ice skating is an expensive sport: if you want to train with a renowned coach, you have to pay thousands of pounds a month. But the kids who need these classes for their health usually don\u2019t have a lot of money, so my lessons are very cheap.</p> <p>I am thankful that this happened to me, and that I was young enough to turn my focus to something other than sport, so I could become the best version of myself.</p> <p><strong>\u2022</strong>As told to Djanlissa Pringels</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>Several local newspapers on the west coast announced this week that the coronavirus crisis is forcing them to suspend publication, perhaps indefinitely.</p> <p>Jeff vonKanael, the president of the Sacramento, Chico and Reno News &amp; Reviews, three small alternative weekly newspapers in California and Nevada, on Tuesday announced the economic impact of the corona pandemic \u201c<a href=\"https://sacblog.newsreview.com/2020/03/17/from-snrs-president-it-could-be-the-end/\">could be the end</a>\u201d for the organizations. Almost all of the staff will be temporarily laid off, and the print editions will cease to be published for now.</p> <p>VonKanael said in a statement that the drastic move came because of a steep drop in ad revenue from local events and businesses, after many California cities closed \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses including movie theaters, concert venues and art galleries to curb the spread of the coronavirus<strong>. </strong>The Chico News &amp; Review reported losing <a href=\"https://www.newsreview.com/chico/donate\">50% of its ad revenue</a> in less than a week.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m a pretty good salesperson, but to try and place ads for events that aren\u2019t happening is beyond my abilities</p> <footer> <cite>Jeff vonKanael</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all events with more that 50 people are shut down, I thought to myself, \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d VonKanael said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty good salesperson, but to try and place ads for events that aren\u2019t happening and businesses that are closing is beyond my abilities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt came as sad news but not as a surprise,\u201d echoed the Reno News &amp; Review editor, Brad Bynum. \u201cWe felt like we were on borrowed time for a while.</p> <p>\u201cWe wrote about the local bands, businesses and breweries, and that\u2019s who we depended on for revenue,\u201d Bynum continued.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/03/total-annihilation-coronavirus-may-just-be-the-end-for-many-alt-weeklies/\">News of</a> the recent closures and layoffs are a stark reminder of the precarious financial positioning of some local news organizations, and it comes exactly at a time when local outlets are a potentially lifesaving, trusted source of information for readers in communities across the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe possibility of newspapers closing is incredibly worrisome right now, especially because the information we need around the coronavirus are things at the local and municipal level,\u201d said Mike Rispoli, director of News Voices, a not-for-profit local news advocacy group.</p> <p>Rispoli<strong> </strong>said the closure of local newspapers would leave many readers to seek information from major national news sources. Those sources have larger and more diverse revenue streams, wider circulations and bigger audiences, but they often lack the specific local information that people need to navigate their daily lives, he noted.</p> <p>\u201cJust like the coronavirus has laid bare fundamental problems in our healthcare and education systems, it\u2019s also exposing inequities in our media system, especially when it comes to local news,\u201d Rispoli said.</p> <p>Local newspapers that still<strong> </strong>produce print editions have come under growing pressure since the shift to digital subscriptions and online ad revenue have become more widespread.</p> <p>Before that transition, advertisement revenue typically<strong> </strong>accounted for 60% to 80% of print papers\u2019 total revenue. But amid the changes, both readership of print papers and advertising dollars began to decline. In California, nearly a quarter of the state\u2019s local newspapers <a href=\"https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/states/california/#1536357280470-403f9cb7-ca48\">shut down between 2004 and 2019</a>, as readership and revenue moved online. According to a 2018 analysis from UNC\u2019s Hussman School of Journalism and Media, many of the remaining papers came to rely on local ads for much of their revenue<strong>. </strong>With local businesses closed amid the coronavirus pandemic, the sudden plummet in ad sales has left many small local print newspapers even more vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cNewspapers will have that much more vanishing revenue to make up,\u201d said Rick Edmonds, the business and media analyst for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. \u201cThey\u2019re losing money and may be unprofitable and heavily extended in terms of credit.</p> <p>\u201cThey may even have difficulty paying loans, as many businesses will in the months ahead.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/i-could-be-on-the-street-100000-jobs-at-risk-as-coronavirus-pummels-california-restaurants\">'I could be on the street': 100,000 jobs at risk as coronavirus pummels California restaurants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In addition, local newspapers are under additional financial pressure because many large regional and national papers have dropped their paywalls for coronavirus coverage, allowing readers unlimited access to those stories. Local news organizations may feel they have to follow the trend, even though many cannot afford to lose revenue from clicks and digital subscriptions.</p> <p>Since orders to close local businesses are still new, and reports of recent layoffs in the retail and food industries are being released and updated daily, questions about the pandemic\u2019s ultimate economic impact will remain unanswered for months. There is no way to know how many local papers will be affected yet, and how long these organizations will have to suspend publication.</p> <p>VonKanael predicted, however, that the effects would be felt far and wide. \u201cThis is like a tidal wave,\u201d he said of the many layoffs and business closures. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the same boat economically, so I feel very un-special.\u201d</p> <p>Since VonKanael announced the suspension, he said, the organization has received $17,000 in donations. And while he hopes that the News &amp; Review can eventually restart its operation, he and Bynum worry that the economic impact of the coronavirus could exacerbate existing issues that are consequences of the decline in local news sources.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline\u2019s been a gradual one,\u201d VonKanael said of the shuttering of local publications. \u201cIt\u2019s like global warming, the impacts are there, but people are not noticing as much as they should.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople will either get their news from others who are just posting things on social media without doing research,\u201d echoed Bynum, \u201cOr they\u2019re gonna get it from distant, uninvolved corporate sources.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The first episode of the new <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2020/12/the-nest\">BBC drama The Nest</a> makes for fascinating viewing. Dan and Emily are having a baby. They are in love, rich, and live in a massive house in Glasgow. The first episode opens with them debating baby names \u2026 but it is not Emily who\u2019s pregnant. After years of trying for a baby they have turned to surrogacy.</p> <p>They bump into 18-year-old Kaya. She is poor and disenfranchised; the couple are rich and secure. She offers to carry their baby and Emily readily agrees, but Dan worries about the ethics of such an arrangement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Surrogacy raises the the issue of conflicting rights. Does anyone have the right to their own child?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Surrogacy has a high profile right now. A <a href=\"https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/surrogacy/\">UK government consultation</a> is reviewing the current laws, with some campaigners arguing that commercial surrogacy, which is currently illegal, should be allowed in this country. Big Fertility, which is what it really is, pulls in big money: as far back as 2012 the industry was worth an estimated \u00a34.7 bn a year.</p> <p>Altruistic surrogacy is legal in the UK, with the surrogate being allowed to claim up to \u00a315,000 in expenses. But a surrogacy agreement cannot be backed up by the law. This means that the child\u2019s legal parent is the birth mother, therefore she can subsequently refuse to hand over the baby. Legal parenthood can only be transferred by parental order or adoption after a child is born.</p> <p>I have investigated the surrogacy trade for a number of years, travelling to California, Ukraine and India, all notorious for providing legal commercial surrogacy services. In India, I posed as a woman desperate to pay a younger woman to have a baby for me. The clinics I visited could source eggs from eastern Europe and rent a womb in Gujarat. No questions were asked about why a woman in her 50s would go to such lengths to have a baby. When I asked how the surrogate mothers were treated, I was reassured not about their rights, but that the women \u201cobey all the rules\u201d and are required to sign a contract that ties them into the arrangement, even if they change their mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/01/outsourcing-pregnancy-india-surrogacy-clinics-julie-bindel\">Outsourcing pregnancy: a visit to India's surrogacy clinics | Julie Bindel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I spoke with Nicole Taylor, the writer of The Nest, who told me that she decided to tackle surrogacy in order to explore her own sense of conflict around the commercial market. \u201cObviously there can be issues with altruistic surrogacy, too,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cBut the drama is specifically about a pact between two women that bundles together hopes of healing and helping with a cash payment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I liked about the idea is the plausibility of it [to me] \u2013 that two desperate people could be drawn to each other in this way and, because of their trauma and the magical thinking it engenders, decide that something as ill-conceived and risky as this is in fact \u2018meant to be\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The poster girl for altruistic surrogacy is the big-hearted, well-balanced maternal woman who wants to help infertile couples have a family. She has children of her own and loves being pregnant. But what is interesting about The Nest is that Kaya is nothing like the stereotype. Does this mean disaster and with it a warning about commercial surrogacy, or is it merely a reminder that some women are unsuitable for such an arrangement?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b7406bf99c400ed95b343497d8c1ce0c86722e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7406bf99c400ed95b343497d8c1ce0c86722e3/0_0_4285_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily (Sophie Rundle), Kaya (Mirren Mack) and Dan (Martin Compston) in a scene from The Nest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily (Sophie Rundle), Kaya (Mirren Mack) and Dan (Martin Compston) in a scene from The Nest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Mainz/BBC/Studio Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarah Jones is a founder of <a href=\"https://surrogacyuk.org/\">Surrogacy UK</a>, which was set up to promote altruistic surrogacy. She tells me she is concerned about the representation of surrogacy in The Nest. \u201cIn reality, surrogacy in the UK is unlike surrogacy elsewhere,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt is an altruistic act based on a solid foundation of mutual respect and trust, with the expectation that the relationship between the surrogate\u2019s family and the intended parent\u2019s family last a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>But even non-commercial surrogacy can be damaging to the birth mother. On paper, Annie, a feminist campaigner I know, was a perfect candidate to have a baby for an infertile couple. She was healthy, happy, in a stable relationship and had her own children. As a surrogate, Annie became pregnant with twins and suffered complications during both the pregnancy and birth. But once she was pregnant, the couple did not care about her wellbeing any more, only about that of the babies she was carrying.</p> <p>\u201cAltruistic surrogacy can be deeply exploitative and abusive, as I learned to my cost,\u201d says Annie. \u201cWe never hear about the dark underside of surrogacy, only the romanticised version in the media, and well-meaning women like me sign up not knowing the real risks and costs, then get used up and spat out.\u201d</p> <p>Surrogacy raises the the issue of conflicting rights. Does anyone have the right to their own child? Is it really \u201chomophobia\u201d if we outlaw surrogacy and, consequently, close down one of the routes for gay men to have babies? I spoke to Ben and Adam, a couple in the UK who have had a child via surrogacy. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, the surrogate is part of our family and can visit our child whenever she wishes,\u201d says Ben. \u201cIt is a beautiful arrangement and, so long as there is no exploitation involved, where is the harm?\u201d</p> <p>What about the rights of the surrogates? There have been a number of reported deaths and serious health complications during the surrogacy process, and a number of women have told me they have been traumatised by having to hand over the baby to the commissioning parents.</p> <p>The Nest will hopefully inform as well as entertain, but as a feminist concerned by the normalisation of surrogacy, I hope is that it will at the very least lead viewers to ask themselves some pertinent questions about pregnancy for profit.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gpqj\">The Nest starts on Sunday 22 March on BBC</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gpqj\"> One, 9pm</a></em></p>",

  "<p>Coronavirus is currently having a serious impact on the ambulance service. Call numbers are soaring, interactions with patients are changing, and staff on the road and in the control centres are under acute pressure. At a time when most people are distancing themselves from others, ambulance crews are doing what they always do: going into the homes of sick and vulnerable strangers to offer help.</p> <p>As a frontline paramedic, I can only speak from my experiences, but I believe they\u2019re fairly representative of the pressures on a service that, even at the best of times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/29/paramedic-ambulance-service-call-triage\">operates near to the limits of capacity</a>. The ambulance service where I work is busier than I\u2019ve seen it in 10 years of service. Although patients are rightly concerned about attending hospital, that same reticence is not being extended to calling 999.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/were-clearing-the-decks-a-gp-on-watching-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfold\">'We're clearing the decks': a GP on watching the coronavirus pandemic unfold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ambulance services have reiterated instructions to seek advice via the internet if you possibly can, and leave 111 and 999 open for the vulnerable and seriously ill. Yet crews are still going to patients with mild symptoms \u2013 the same people who are being told to self-isolate. Many of them are anxious. Some want reassurance, some want to know if they\u2019ve \u201cgot corona\u201d. But of course we can\u2019t tell them, and in treatment terms, it doesn\u2019t really matter. As long as their bodies are coping, the advice is the same: isolation, rest, fluids, paracetamol.</p> <p>Worryingly, the biggest challenges of the crisis, such as large numbers of calls to seriously ill Covid-19 patients and widespread staff absences, haven\u2019t yet taken effect. As more possible coronavirus patients present, equipment supplies are being stretched, ambulances are going off the road for cleaning, and job cycle times are growing. There\u2019s a sense of stoic acceptance among staff that things are likely to get much worse.</p> <p>Friends ask about morale. Ambulance crews tend to be fairly pragmatic, but I sense an underlying concern about what the future holds. We\u2019re facing a decent chance of exposure ourselves. In terms of proximity and duration, the pre-hospital encounter with a patient is well suited to transmission, especially when we\u2019re still having to tell some patients to cover their mouths (or keep their masks on) when they cough.</p> <p>Without more testing, nobody has a sense of the likelihood of transmission in either direction. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/everyone-is-scared-to-speak-up-nhs-staff-need-covid-19-tests\">increase in testing</a> would not prevent all exposures, but it would give health workers a more dynamic understanding of how the disease spreads, and instil trust that the measures we\u2019re taking \u2013 such as which mask is suitable for which patient encounter \u2013 are effective in protecting us and our patients.</p> <p>You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that Covid-19 is the only illness around at the moment. But people are still collapsing, still having asthma attacks, still suffering strokes and heart attacks and cardiac arrests. On our recent night shifts, my crewmate and I also went to patients suffering with anxiety, patients who\u2019d fallen and hit their heads, frequent callers, and patients who\u2019d had too much to drink and then urinated in the back of the ambulance. Some things never change.</p> <p>Many of our patients waited longer than they should for us to arrive. Thankfully, family members, carers and bystanders stepped in to provide calm and sensible care in the meantime. Such helpful attitudes will be invaluable in the coming weeks \u2013 but there\u2019s a limit to what people can do in a genuine emergency.</p> <p>As well as the obvious pressures of Covid-19, I believe there will be other, less foreseeable impacts from the virus. Ambulance crews often deal with vulnerable patients who lack proper support networks: the elderly, the lonely, those with addictions, those with mental health conditions. We can only anticipate that as people\u2019s routines are disrupted and their worlds shrink, the effects of loneliness and isolation, on both physical and mental health, will manifest more widely in the kinds of crises that require the attention of the emergency services.</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s one way in which the current situation is similar to \u201cnormal\u201d times. Only a small proportion of ambulance calls are for genuine emergencies. Even in extraordinary times, those non-emergency calls are still coming in. Whether it\u2019s from Covid-19 or some other medical condition, we\u2019re primarily here for people who require urgent interventions and transport to definitive care.</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t discourage people with emergency symptoms from calling for help: these patients must be our focus. But like the rest of the health service, the vital resource of the emergency ambulance is under an unprecedented strain, and it\u2019s likely to get worse. So if ever there was a time to resist the urge to call for a non-emergency, then surely that time is now.</p> <p>\u2022 Jake Jones is the pseudonym of an NHS paramedic.

It means we can continue to support our artists, explore moving offstage projects into online forums, and ensure that during this time we can remain connected to our communities and do what we do best: think of creative ways to keep cultural activity alive.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Recognise the media that communicate\u2019</strong><br><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/02/peter-brook-tip-of-the-tongue-the-prisoner-battlefield-olivier-gielgud\">Peter Brook, director</a><br></strong></em>The stage and its audiences \u2013 our basic medium \u2013 has been taken away. So we have to recognise the media that communicate at the moment, such as television and the internet. Right now, they are the way anyone can express anything. Television is having to bear a huge load and is under a great strain. I send deep wishes to all. We are all in this together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07bcea14721ae9dd05eb49bc7b1c45abab7c0816\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07bcea14721ae9dd05eb49bc7b1c45abab7c0816/0_0_5349_3566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Brook \u2026 \u2018We are all in this together.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Brook \u2026 \u2018We are all in this together.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2018Protect our most marginalised voices\u2019</strong><br><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/23/artistic-directors-shaking-up-british-theatre-lynette-linton-suba-das-tarek-iskander\">Suba Das, artistic director, HighTide</a><br></strong></em>We must look at our responsibilities towards theatre\u2019s workforce \u2013 not just contractually but also morally. Zero-hour and freelance contracts are a norm in our sector \u2013 whether front of house, back of house or in the office. Some of these people are the first faces you see when you walk into a theatre but they don\u2019t have the protection of a salaried post. These were once permanent positions. During this crisis we run the risk of losing that workforce if they have to seek alternative employment. We\u2019ve always known our business is uncertain, but it is especially so if you\u2019re socio-economically deprived - which in the UK is shockingly more likely if you\u2019re a woman, a person of colour or have a disability. For these people, pursuing a career in theatre has required grit and resilience because our sector is still so very unequal and untransparent in access and opportunity. If we\u2019re not really proactive in thinking about the mental and physical wellbeing of our most marginalised voices in this period, we will lose them. And marginal voices are <em>always</em> our most exciting, innovative talent - our HighTide alumni from Vinay Patel to Sophie Ellerby prove that. Some of these artists and workers have grinned and borne their greater struggle for years for the love and magic of theatre, but this may be the tipping point. How we act now will dictate whether they wish to remain in our sector and it really will be our loss. Diversity is not charity, it\u2019s simply good business sense, and we must remember that right now.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Cherish theatre memories\u2019<br></strong><em><strong><a href=\"http://elliekeelproductions.co.uk/\">Ellie Keel, producer and founder of the Women\u2019s Prize for Playwriting<br></a></strong></em>I am focusing on morale. It is such a bland word, but vital in this context of uncertainty. Theatre-makers are asking themselves: \u201cWhat is the point of being an artist who makes work for live consumption, if live events are literally against the law?\u201d These are people who already, even without a pandemic, frequently question the practicality of their career choices. What artists need is encouragement and communication \u2013 from their peers but, crucially, from audiences. We need the public to delve into their memories, individual and collective, recent and distant, and recall examples of live entertainment that has changed their life. They need to think about the time a line was spoken and you swallowed hard because you thought you were the only person who had felt that thing. The stories, the characters, the music, the comedy, the performances that have changed our perspectives, lifted our spirits, boosted our confidence, made our days, inspired our minds and moved our hearts. Hearing about these moments will sustain artists through these dark days and remind us why we do it. This dialogue between consumers and creators of live art, cherishing the unforgettable specialness of what artists create, is the key to getting through this and onwards to great, joyful liveness once again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"355e5b3bdfc9e1ddaccecdd489f36781d669eccf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/355e5b3bdfc9e1ddaccecdd489f36781d669eccf/0_755_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red Ladder artistic director Rod Dixon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Dixon \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s important to share what we\u2019re doing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2018Build communities\u2019<br></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/leeds/2011/mar/18/opinion-a-new-form-of-protest-is-growing-in-the-arts\">Rod Dixon, artistic director, Red Ladder</a><br></strong></em>Theatre creates instant communities.

We could contact our heroes and ask what plays, films, books and music inspire them and explore those we don\u2019t already know; ask them to mentor and guide us as we reflect on the development of our own careers \u2013 successes, failures, the projects that have brought us the most pleasure and satisfaction (are these necessarily the ones that are deemed externally to be our most successful?).

Whether it\u2019s interactive Facebook lives, where punters can tip via PayPal and ask for certain numbers, makeup tutorials or at-home cabaret lessons, the drag community is adapting swiftly.

If we are an essential help to the nation now, our audience will see the point when we open our doors again.</p>",
  "<p>Since it came out five months ago, a debut work by an 87-year-old has become a publishing phenomenon. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/24/lady-in-waiting-anne-glenconner-review\" title=\"\">Lady in Waiting: My Extraordinary Life in the Shadow of the Crown</a></em> by Anne Glenconner has sold more than 200,000 copies in the UK and retains a tenacious hold on the bestseller lists. Written by the former lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret, its broad appeal might seem surprising, not least because Margaret was hardly the most popular royal. But Lady Glenconner\u2019s book has two things going for it: the first is that it is not what it seems; it is definitely not \u201ca lavender sort of scented memoir\u201d, as Glenconner put it when she appeared on <em>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/26/graham-norton-getting-stabbed-gave-me-real-perspective-on-life\" title=\"\">Graham Norton</a> Show</em> last November. And its other great strength is Glenconner herself.</p> <p>\u201cAre you <em>really</em> tired after your journey? Did you find a taxi when you got <em>off</em> the train?\u201d she asks when I arrive at her home on the Norfolk coast. She has the accent of the Queen \u2013 \u201creally\u201d becomes \u201crill-eh\u201d, \u201coff\u201d is \u201corff\u201d \u2013 and is dressed like her too, in a blouse, cardigan, pleated knee length skirt, tights and loafers. It is easy to picture her striding around the world, making small talk with Imelda Marcos, which is what she used to do with Princess Margaret. I lean in to kiss her, but then ask if she\u2019s refraining because of the coronavirus. Glenconner looks at me as if I\u2019ve left my marbles on the train: \u201cI\u2019ve been through the second world war and lived with someone with Aids at the beginning [of the Aids crisis]. I\u2019m not scared of a little <em>virus</em>, you know,\u201d she says. She turns on her heel and marches down her long hallway, and I have to scoot to keep up with her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61d0580a7963454abe3e6cc37176d07295d2d33e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61d0580a7963454abe3e6cc37176d07295d2d33e/1057_253_1658_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glenconner, then Lady Anne Coke, at the Queen\u2019s coronation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glenconner, then Lady Anne Coke, at the Queen\u2019s coronation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Glenconner was born Anne Coke (pronounced Cook), the daughter of an earl. \u201cSo I married down somewhat,\u201d she says with a satisfied smile, as her husband, Colin Tennant, was merely the Baron Glenconner. In her book, Glenconner describes her current home as \u201ca cottage\u201d but these things are relative: compared to the nearby Holkham Hall where she grew up, and Glen, the enormous estate in Scotland belonging to her late husband\u2019s family, I guess it is a cottage. To me, it looks like a sizable house, with a warren of rooms filled with family portraits and vintage toys that are now kept for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She takes me to the pretty sitting room, where we sit on either side of the fire. \u201cWhen Princess Margaret would visit the two of us would sit just like this,\u201d she says. \u201cOne time she came with her kettle and said: \u2018I\u2019m going to be independent, Anne, all you need to do is give me some milk.\u2019 I was a bit doubtful and I was right because suddenly one morning it was \u2018Anne! Anne!\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, what is it?\u2019 \u2018I think the kettle\u2019s broken!\u2019 Of course, she hadn\u2019t turned it on. But she did want to help \u2026\u201d Prince Charles, another \u201cproper friend\u201d, stops by often: \u201cAnd people are really fond of him now, you know. All that talking to plants and his green things, it\u2019s all come true. People don\u2019t laugh at it.\u201d</p> <p>I tell her that even the most republican of my friends love the book.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never written anything in my life at all, and I thought: \u2018Well, people like me might buy it.\u2019 But it\u2019s gone way beyond that. I certainly didn\u2019t think the Guardian would be interested in my book. I know you\u2019re a very leftwing newspaper and somebody like me is not quite your cup of tea, so that\u2019s encouraging.\u201d On a table nearby, a Daily Telegraph is tucked discreetly under a cushion.</p> <p>Glenconner composed the book in this room, dictating her life story into a recorder. \u201cSomebody said: \u2018Do you get writer\u2019s block?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, writer\u2019s diarrhoea!\u2019 I just talked and talked,\u201d she says. Glenconner\u2019s distinctive voice has a no-nonsense briskness to it, undercut with a wry but warm sense of humour. She manages to laugh at things others might find less amusing: the patriarchal aristocratic system that meant she couldn\u2019t inherit her family home (\u201cI tried awfully hard to be a boy, even weighing 11lb at birth, but I was a girl and there was nothing to be done about it\u201d); her husband taking her to a \u201cperfectly disgusting\u201d live sex show during their honeymoon; even her son Henry\u2019s funeral when he died from Aids \u2013 \u201cI couldn\u2019t help a tiny smile because, as is Buddhist custom, his coffin was covered with pineapples and other tropical fruit, so it looked like a giant fruit salad as it came into the crematorium.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no fun for anyone if you\u2019re sitting around being a misery. I\u2019m no snowflake, probably a battle-axe. I was brought up by my mother to get on with things,\u201d she says. Her family crest is an ostrich swallowing a horseshoe, signifying the family\u2019s ability to digest anything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e3657005f793c35a4f2947f5f5f5db5e8d68880e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3657005f793c35a4f2947f5f5f5db5e8d68880e/391_324_2527_3236/781.jpg\" alt=\"With her husband Colin Tennant, Baron Glenconner, in Mustique, 1973.\" width=\"781\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her husband Colin Tennant, Baron Glenconner, in Mustique, 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Slim Aarons/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Glenconner\u2019s family has a long relationship with the royal family: her paternal grandmother was Edward VIII\u2019s mistress and her father was equerry to George VI. Glenconner was Princess Margaret\u2019s devoted lady-in-waiting for more than 30 years, and this is what spurred her into writing her book, as she was horrified by a recent biography about the princess, which she describes as \u201cthat horrible book, we won\u2019t mention the name of the somebody who wrote it. I don\u2019t know why people want to rot her like that.\u201d When I ask if she means Craig Brown\u2019s book, <em>Ma\u2019am Darling</em>, she gives a pained, terse nod.</p> <p>Determined to rectify the common perception of the princess as spoilt and spiteful, Glenconner writes about Margaret\u2019s various kindnesses to her. They were, she says, real friends, even if one called the other \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d and the other didn\u2019t. \u201cI would have felt quite uncomfortable calling her anything else. But she was so funny, that\u2019s what people don\u2019t get,\u201d she says. After the princess died, the Queen thanked Glenconner for providing her sister with many of the happiest moments in her life.</p> <p>I\u2019d been warned beforehand not to ask about Meghan Markle so I ask instead if, having spent so much time with Margaret, she has extra empathy for the other spares, Princes Andrew and Harry. But Glenconner knows what I\u2019m up to: \u201cYou\u2019re edging closer to asking me about Meghan Markle,\u201d she tuts. \u201cI\u2019m going to put another log on the fire before I answer that!\u201d</p> <p>Markle\u2019s mistake, she says, was to not understand that all the royals, even the spares, work hard: \u201cI think she thought she could drive around in a golden coach. But it\u2019s actually quite boring. Princess Margaret did so much charity work, and without any photographers, unlike the Princess of Wales.\u201d (Glenconner is a staunch royalist, but her sympathies are with the more traditional branches of the family; even Princes William and Harry, she says, \u201cgo on about their mother the whole time. I think it\u2019s a bit much.\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9bcbce2ca1de19b5d32fc4b06c70d9c8850b16d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9bcbce2ca1de19b5d32fc4b06c70d9c8850b16d/0_0_2747_3543/775.jpg\" alt=\"With Princess Margaret, in Mustique.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Princess Margaret, in Mustique.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hal Shinnie/Hodder &amp; Stoughton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coverage of Glenconner\u2019s book has focused on the royals, but it\u2019s the descriptions of her own life that gripped me. First, her marriage to Colin, who had frequent mental breakdowns and was a bully; when Glenconner asked him why he screamed at people so often, he replied: \u201cI like making them squirm.\u201d He insisted on telling her about his holidays with his many girlfriends (\u201cI said, \u2018Can we talk about something else?\u2019\u201d), but Glenconner got her own back, and makes one fleeting reference in her book to having a \u201cdear friend\u201d. This is the one subject she won\u2019t be drawn on: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you absolutely nothing at all, except that he made my life possible. We had lunch once a week and the occasional weekend for nearly 40 years, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201d</p> <p>Despite everything, Glenconner painstakingly emphasises her husband\u2019s good qualities in the book, such as his sense of fun and imagination \u2013 partly, she says, for the sake of their children, but also because it was true. He turned Mustique from unpromising scrubland into a celebrity pleasure island, where Mick Jagger would lead singalongs in a beach bar. Colin\u2019s parties were legendary for their loucheness, such as the Golden Ball, which was photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, when Bianca Jagger was carried in by a troupe of boys painted entirely in gold and wearing only \u201ca coconut strategically placed below\u201d. The celebrities revelled in the privacy from the media: on one holiday, Glenconner delicately pointed out to Princess Margaret that her bathing suit was transparent. \u201c\u2018Oh Anne,\u2019 she said, somewhat exasperated. \u2018I don\u2019t care. If [people] want to look, they can look.\u2019 And that was that.\u201d Colin died in 2010 but, Glenconner says, he would be \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d that Mustique is still causing scandals, with questions over who paid for Boris Johnson\u2019s recent holiday there.</p> <p>The couple had five children: Charlie, Henry, Christopher and twins May and Amy. Glenconner loved being a mother, but, despite not having been entirely happy with aspects of her childhood \u2013 absent parents, nannies, boarding school \u2013 she repeated it with her own children, leaving them behind as she helped her husband in Mustique. \u201cIt\u2019s just what you did, what all our friends did, the shooting parties all winter we went off to \u2013 we didn\u2019t think. I didn\u2019t even want them to go to boarding school \u2026\u201d she trails off.</p> <p>The three youngest children had the same nanny throughout their childhood, but the two eldest, Charlie and Henry, had many different ones, their father sacking their favourites on a whim. By the age of eight Charlie had severe OCD. As a teenager, he got into drugs. Henry married and had a son, but in the late 80s he came out as gay and within 18 months he had Aids, at a time when the diagnosis turned you into a pariah. \u201cI would take Henry to A&amp;E, and it was full when we arrived and within half an hour everybody had left and I was alone with him. He was so ill that we would sit on the floor, with his head in my lap. That was quite hard to write about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e7a1618803098bd61a299bb33e4ff77ff0c29a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e7a1618803098bd61a299bb33e4ff77ff0c29a4/0_0_2226_2489/894.jpg\" alt=\"At the Christening of her son Charles, 1957.\" width=\"894\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Christening of her son Charles, 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Bush/ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile her youngest son, Christopher, suffered a catastrophic head injury while on a gap year in Belize. He was in a coma and a doctor told Glenconner that she should forget about him. Instead, she nursed him and when he woke up four months later she took him home and cared for him for the next five years. He was left with life-changing injuries, but he has married twice and has two children.</p> <p>After Henry died and Christopher recovered, Charlie also seemed to be recovering from his addictions. But it was too late: he died from hepatitis, and Glenconner buried her second child. \u201cOften people don\u2019t talk to me about the children, maybe because they\u2019re interested in the other things. But I like talking about them, and perhaps the book has given me a way to do so,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her book\u2019s success has thrilled her: \u201cAren\u2019t I lucky?\u201d She is planning a trip to New York, where Tina Brown will throw a party for the US launch. She is also working on her first novel, <em>Murder in Mustique</em>: \u201cI\u2019m the new Miss Marple!\u201d she says delightedly.</p> <p>Glenconner talks me through the family photos that surround us: Charlie as a handsome teenager, Henry\u2019s son and his children, one of the twins getting married. A photo of Glenconner holding Charlie and Henry as babies is so bittersweet I can hardly look at it. \u201cOh I know,\u201d she says when she sees me wince. As I\u2019m about to leave, she touches my elbow gently. \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked me about the children, it was kind of you,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause the book really is about them, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Lady in Waiting </em>by Anne Glenconner is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (RRP \u00a320).

  "<p>I am scrolling idly through TikTok when I see her, drag queen Bijou Bentley <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bijoubentley/video/6797560219850263814\">performing her routine</a> to a remix of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj\">Nicki Minaj</a>\u2019s Anaconda. With her ponytail and green twin-set, I immediately recognise that she is not just giving the audience haute couture \u2013 this is cosplay.</p> <p>Isabelle, my personal assistant from my time as mayor of a town in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/jun/17/animal-crossing-new-leaf-video-game-review\">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a>. If you have played it, she was your assistant, too. She is the heart of the game, your adviser, your companion. She is a yellow dog in snappy office dress, and she is always so happy to see you. Benny Bijou Bentley sashays around the floor with her clip-board. The crowd goes wild, throwing dollars at her feet. I am thinking to myself, \u201cYes, Isabelle - work.\u201d</p> <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons marks the fifth game in the franchise, that began in 2001 on the Nintendo 64. In the games, you move into a village populated by a random selection of anthropomorphic animals. You are placed in a small home, and then you just live. You explore, you fish, you grow plants, you chat \u2013 there\u2019s no endgame, no goal. You saunter along at your own pace. There\u2019s no rush.</p> <p>There is also no conflict or tension \u2013 the game gives you a sandbox environment in which to pursue a gentler life. The environment shifts with the console\u2019s internal clock \u2013 in winter, plants shrivel and insects disappear, only to stir alive in green pixels again come spring.</p> <p>Central to much of your daily activity is one character: Tom Nook, an enterprising businessman who not only runs the village shop, but also, the local estate agents. You pay your mortgage to him in cash, in whatever instalments you please. Tom is a cute, wide-eyed raccoon, a disarming form that belies the fact that he is functionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-godfather\">the Godfather</a> of Animal Crossing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88214b1b657c2caa4dbaa5955c16e9a1c6e59f69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88214b1b657c2caa4dbaa5955c16e9a1c6e59f69/77_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No endgame ... Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m aware that these gameplay mechanics sound somewhere between eye-wateringly mundane and vaguely threatening. In reality, Animal Crossing is neither. It is charming beyond belief.</p> <p>My first step into this softer life came when I was commuting more than two hours a day to college. My Nintendo DS was a comforting escape from the juddering trains and slow buses, and the tender world of Animal Crossing was the opposite of the heightened drama of being a teenager. Breakups, betrayals, hangovers, balancing classes with jobs, working out who I wanted to be, none of that was in question here. Life in Animal Crossing was distilled into basic tasks, basic pleasures and basic connections.</p> <p>Relationships with my neighbours in the game were easy in that they were transactional. Friendship, if you could call it that, progresses around the exchange of gifts. When prompted, you can enter nicknames for your pals that the algorithmically generated dialogue will then integrate in to conversation. It is predictable, but for me it gradually escalated in a way that felt comforting. I fished and gathered fruit which I sold to Tom, for the game\u2019s currency \u2013 bells. I listened to the chippy, tuneless music and was soothed. And because there is no ending to Animal Crossing, no plot, I was never in any danger of heightened emotions of any kind. There was no chaos.</p> <p>Years later, my husband and I cohabited in a town in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, where I inherited the role of mayor from an elderly tortoise. On reflection, and I say this with my hands up, I was a bad civil servant. I always assumed my assistant Isabelle was, well, working. I was less occupied with town planning than digging up artefacts. Though if I were to sell them to Tom for bells, I would have made quicker work of paying off my mortgage. Instead, I dutifully donated them to the initially barren museum, operated by a solitary owl. He was a reliably friendly face, and always seemed so grateful for my contributions to the local cultural resources.</p> <p>This museum-filling lit up the synapses in my brain that respond to collecting: the same ones that are ripped apart by Pok\u00e9mon. Here, we have that same catch \u2019em all mechanic, albeit without any victory at the end. Or any end at all. Our prize is not legacy, heroism or a trophy, but a place in a small, fictional community \u2013 a sense of a job well done. I\u2019m part of a generation that is feeling our way in the dark: employment models have changed, security is gone, continuous email access and a growing gig economy have shifted the boundaries between work and home. It is so easy to feel as though there will always be something else to do and that every completed task simply makes way for another task. To build something that feels tangible and joyful is an antidote to this, even if it is a pixellated town, your contribution amounts to something: happier neighbours, a full museum, a house with many rooms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dc825cf1642740ce1f995855df856ee889b86a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dc825cf1642740ce1f995855df856ee889b86a0/87_0_1112_667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Basic pleasures and basic connections ...

It\u2019s meditative for me to pick my fruit, check in with my neighbours and do some fishing before bed. It also lets me live out my fantasy of abandoning the city to live on an island, while fully acknowledging that I would definitely not flourish if I did that in real life.\u201d</p> <p>There is so much to this fantasy \u2013 tasks are manageable, relationships steady, risk nonexistent. Tom Nook isn\u2019t going to send his boys to break your kneecaps if you\u2019re late with a payment. This is a place where progress and value isn\u2019t contingent on ambition. Our fellow villagers are sweet and quirky \u2013 there are gorillas, cats, hedgehogs, horses, there is a musical dog called KK Slider who plays guitar, there is even a bright red duck called Ketchup. Sure, they can occasionally be oppositional, but you can usually bring them around with the gift of fruit, or by delivering letters to their homes.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Animal Crossing community served me the way that Twitter serves me now,\u201d says Dearbh\u00e1il Clarke, 22, taking their final year in animation at IADT. \u201cIt\u2019s a pocket friendship, without any of the weirdness or commitment of real life. You just put in gifts and get out affirmation ... even when you run out of new dialogue prompts, the friendships don\u2019t feel hollow. They just take on the same rhythm of an old friend telling you the same banal story and you\u2019ll listen and smile because it\u2019s nice to hear and be heard.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke nails the essence of Animal Crossing: cosiness, predictability \u2013 the feeling of a home and community gradually rising to meet you. I distinctly remember dropping by the Able Sisters clothing shop every day in New Leaf: not necessarily to spend my hard-earned bells on clothing, but rather to say hello to the quiet hedgehog named Sable, sitting in the back behind a sewing machine. Initially, when I approach her she doesn\u2019t even greet me. But day after day, she grows to recognise me. Eventually she begins to offer information about herself. Technically, the prize for winning her friendship by talking to her for 10 days in a row is a QR feature that expands clothing options, but I know that what I am really gaining are the tiny secrets of her life. There is texture in this fiction. The progress from silence to warmth. The real reward for this mini-game, completed purely by interaction and persistence, is knowing Sable, without any risk of being truly known yourself.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie4WZCLbtVs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ie4WZCLbtVs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Animal Crossing offers the one thing in this strange landscape of 2020 that it feels a generation is sorely lacking: a sense of safety. As New Horizons is released, communities worldwide have begun social distancing or self-isolating due to the spread of Covid-19. But with this game fortuitously timed, these new islands will give us a place to escape to from the endless scroll of frightening news, when all we can do is stay indoors and hope for the best.</p> <p>These safe, fictional landscapes are a balm. There is no danger lurking beyond the trees, no urgency in your loan repayments, no betrayal from selfish neighbours. When I saw Bijou Bentley performing, it made me realise that Animal Crossing has a life beyond the beyond the DS or Switch. The quiet lives we have had inside this world have connected with our reality. The quiet lives we have had inside those screens have connected with our reality: scenes from these places become more than memes, they become modes of expression.</p> <p>Confined to our homes in real-life, we will compare the different fruits that grow on our trees (some will have pears, others peaches), we\u2019ll compare our neighbours, visit each other\u2019s islands. We will be together safe in the knowledge that every Saturday night when the internal console calendar hits the right time, a white dog named KK Slider will take his guitar and play a gig in all of our virtual towns. We will be united on the dancefloor as he sings in that strange, familiar digital voice. If I could, I would throw bells at his feet like rain.</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Maria Griffin is an author from Dublin, Ireland. Her most recent novel is Other Words For Smoke. She tweets @griffski.</p>",
  "<p>M<a href=\"https://www.meredithmonk.org/\">eredith Monk</a> might be one of America\u2019s most fascinating composers, but the additional roles that she has created for herself \u2013 that of singer, dancer, choreographer, film-maker and theatre director \u2013 have sometimes left her compositional skills overlooked. While her fellow New York loft-dwelling minimalists such as Philip Glass and Steve Reich often find their work being performed by modern ensembles, Monk\u2019s compositions seem tied to her own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/20/meredith-monk-behalf-nature-cd-review-ecm\">unique performances of them</a>. Specifically it\u2019s the way in which she embraces the weird irregularities of the human voice \u2013 the croaks, clicks, breaths, hiccups and howls that most singers try hard to suppress \u2013 and integrates them into her work, slipping in elements of comically absurd Dadaist sound poetry. In some ways it\u2019s her methodology that has survived as an influence (on Bj\u00f6rk, in particular) rather than her actual writing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9f6e03ecd2941f7d4a4998dc74d1e82077c7825d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6e03ecd2941f7d4a4998dc74d1e82077c7825d/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meredith Monk: Memory Game album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meredith Monk: Memory Game album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monk is now 77 and appears to be undergoing a gradual process of relinquishing control over her compositions. She sings a bit on her new album Memory Game, but her vocal idiosyncrasies are largely delegated to her trusted <a href=\"https://www.meredithmonk.org/about/vocal-ensemble/\">Vocal Ensemble</a> (Theo Bleckmann, Katie Geissinger and Allison Sniffin). The main draw, however, is hearing how New York chamber outfit <a href=\"https://bangonacan.org/bang_on_a_can_all_stars\">Bang </a><a href=\"https://bangonacan.org/bang_on_a_can_all_stars\">on </a><a href=\"https://bangonacan.org/bang_on_a_can_all_stars\">a Can All-Stars</a> have reorchestrated nine pieces from Monk\u2019s varied theatrical productions since the early 1980s. Gamemaster\u2019s Song, a stompy, propulsive duet for piano and vocals from 1983, is reworked into a compelling piece of spiky post-punk, using a percussive synth riff and a counterpoint bassline. Memory Song sees Monk and her vocalists chirruping a series of random memories in English and German until they resemble birdsong, accompanied by a glistening ostinato phrase played on a Casiotone and lushly orchestrated with strings, woodwind and guitar. But it\u2019s Waltz in 5s, from 1996, that best suggests how Monk\u2019s music might thrive without Monk. It\u2019s a haunting, wordless aria sung over a jerky 5/4 vamp, which simultaneously suggests a neolithic folk lament and a space-age psalm beamed in from another planet.</p> <p>\u2022 Released 27 March.</p> <h2>Also out this month</h2> <p>This mix of the prehistoric and the futuristic is also evident on Different Geographies, the latest LP by all-female London string-and-synth quartet <strong><a href=\"https://www.collectress.co.uk/\">Collectress</a></strong>.

  "<p>As a nipper, although frankly I mean until about the age of 18, I wasn\u2019t keen on baths. I was hyperactive, and staying more or less still for a period of five minutes or longer required effort. As a teenager, I found baths not conducive to my lifestyle, which mostly consisted of being late. Quicker bathing meant more sleep; more texting; more listening to indie bands with names unfathomably made up of punctuation.</p> <p>Then: a mid-20s baptism into the devoutness of baths. A love of soaking bubbled to the surface. This love smells of lavender and bergamot oil. It feels like the damp, crinkled edges of book and magazine pages. It sounds like nothing, aside from the quiet swish and gargle of water when rearranging limbs. It tastes of the mug of tea balanced precariously on the side (but not so precariously as to be anxiety-making). I have a friend, Greg, who enjoys nibbling at cheese while in the bath; he even creates a little foil boat for it. He is an icon.</p> <p>I cannot pinpoint the \u201cEureka!\u201d moment (Archimedes\u2019 famous bath pronouncement, of course) but it was probably around the time I swapped tagging pictures of nights out on social media for <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/\" title=\"\">browsing Mumsnet</a> for tips on moth control, AKA sinking into a premature middle age.

Or the water is too hot, and one is left sweating profusely and feeling faint; philtrum transforming into an oxbow lake, knees turning a football club red.

It is rare that I take my phone into the bathroom, because if I really can\u2019t last an hour without it then I might as well let the waves take me.

One swarm recently reported in Kenya covered an area the size of Luxembourg.</p> <p>The organisation has requested <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Desert%20Locust%20Crisis%20-%20Appeal%20for%20rapid%20response%20and%20anticipatory%20action%20in%20the%20Greater%20Horn%20of%20Africa%20January%20-%20December%202020%20.pdf\">$140m</a> (\u00a3120m) to help fight the ongoing breeding of the insects, predicting that a continuation through late March and April could see the existing number of locusts grow by 400 times by June.</p> <p>The current crisis is considered the worst in decades, and there are fears it could last longer than previous locust outbreaks.</p> <p>Alongside the climate emergency impact, the war in Yemen is a key factor.</p> <p>Cressman said Yemen is a \u201cfrontline\u201d country for locusts, with the insects typically present throughout the year. But its once effective locust programme no longer has the same impact in cities where control is now divided between the government and Houthi rebels.</p> <p>The head of the locust programme, Adel al-Shaibani, is based in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sana\u2019a.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the war we had a good ability to reach anywhere in Yemen,\u201d he said. \u201cIn current times we\u2019re just able to cover the Red Sea coastal areas \u2013 but not all \u2013 and some areas in the interior.\u201d</p> <p>He explained that there were two separate locust control centres in Yemen but neither was able to combat the outbreak effectively alone.</p> <p>The Sana\u2019a-based centre carried out control operations wherever they could in 2018, but they have been underfunded and have lost some of their vehicles.</p> <p>\u201cIn spite of all our hard efforts, some areas remained out of control due to security reasons near the border with Saudi Arabia. The desert locust outbreak occurred and some swarms formed and moved to other areas,\u201d said Shaibani.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68f99bbad4bb98b1baa0e3d6ae81f07961c9f36a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68f99bbad4bb98b1baa0e3d6ae81f07961c9f36a/0_55_4452_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young desert locust without wings is seen on a stalk near Geerisa town, in Somaliland\u2019s Lughaya District\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young desert locust without wings is seen on a stalk near Geerisa town, in Somaliland\u2019s Lughaya district.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By late 2019, the locusts had moved into the Horn of Africa, finding favourable conditions when an unseasonaal cyclone hit Somalia in December.

This allowed us to quarantine people before they showed signs of infection and stop the further spread of coronavirus. In this way, we eradicated coronavirus in under 14 days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/scientists-say-mass-tests-in-italian-town-have-halted-covid-19\">Scientists say mass tests in Italian town have halted Covid-19 there</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While we believe it is too late to enact this approach in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/its-extremely-empty-coronavirus-brings-milan-to-a-standstill\">city such as Milan</a>, where infections are out of control, there could still be time to do this in the UK before the crisis gets even worse<strong>: </strong>the government could identify and isolate clusters<strong>,</strong> quarantine everyone affected, trace their recent contacts, and quarantine and isolate them, too \u2013 whether they had symptoms or not.</p> <p>Our experiment came to be by chance. The Italian authorities had a strong emotional reaction to news of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/italians-struggle-with-surreal-lockdown-as-coronavirus-cases-rise\">the country\u2019s first death</a> \u2013 which was in V\u00f2. The whole town was put into quarantine and every inhabitant was tested. The tests were processed by us at the University of Padua. It became clear that this was a unique epidemiological setting \u2013 and an application was put in to keep the town in lockdown and run a second round of tests after nine days.</p> <p>In the first round of testing, 89 people tested positive. In the second round, the number had dropped to six, who remained in isolation. In this way, we managed to eradicate coronavirus from V\u00f2, achieving a 100% recovery rate for those previously infected while recording no further cases of transmission.</p> <p>We made an interesting finding: at the time the first symptomatic case was diagnosed, a significant proportion of the population, about 3%, had already been infected \u2013 yet most of them were completely asymptomatic. Our study established a valuable principle: testing of all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, provides a way to control this pandemic.</p> <p>The nature of this crisis means that establishing a structured response like this is key, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-testing-will-increase-to-25000-a-day-says-boris-johnson\">widespread testing is crucial</a> in telling an accurate story of how many people are affected, and what the mortality rate of the virus actually is. In Italy, we have struggled with a rampant rise of mortality (the number of casualties divided by the number of infected people), which has reached an apparent value of 8% \u2013 far higher than the mortality rate in China and grimly close to that during the 2002-2003 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/lessons-from-sars-outbreak-help-in-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">Sars outbreak</a>.</p> <p>This high rate is misleading, though. After the first few days of the initial outbreak, cases were classed as all of those found to be infected by the virus. Yet since then, only the obviously symptomatic subjects \u2013 those needing medical care \u2013 have been tested for the virus and thus counted as cases.</p> <p>The decision to only test those who presented for treatment with symptoms of the virus was taken by major Italian public health experts, apparently in line with World Health Organization (WHO) suggestions. The consequence has been that people who haven\u2019t asked for medical attention have only been tested very occasionally in Italy. Nonetheless, asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70% of all virus-infected people and, still worse, an unknown, yet impossible to ignore portion of them can transmit the virus to others. Full testing would give us a clearer picture of how many people actually have the virus, and how many pass it on.</p> <p>If the fact that only those presenting with the virus were being tested was accounted for, the mortality percentage would fall to more \u201cnormal\u201d levels. This is shown by the mortality in the Veneto region, which is steadily around 2.5-3%, still high but threefold less than the ones in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/italy-set-to\">Lombardy</a> and Emilia-Romagna.</p> <p>Why this marked difference? Veneto is comparable to the other two northern regions for education, general lifestyle, personal income and age of the population \u2013 all factors, particularly the last one, believed to influence Covid-19 mortality. Although a non-homogeneous data collection and other variables could explain the difference, there is one main factor that is likely playing a role. In Veneto, the virus was more actively sought out through testing, a programme that included part of the asymptomatic population. Official numbers speak of roughly eight in every 100 people tested in Veneto, against about half and one-third of that proportion in Lombardy and Emila-Romagna, respectively.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/italy-europe-covid-economy-ecb-coronavirus\">Italy will be Europe's canary in the coalmine for the post-Covid economy | Marchel Alexandrovich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, it would be near impossible to repeat this model in a large city, due to the number of people who would need to be tested. However, our findings warrant careful consideration by health policymakers in Italy and around the world. They invite researchers to eradicate the virus through extensive testing of both symptomatic individuals and all of their social contacts \u2013 including relatives, friends and neighbours. In this way, we catch out the disease before it has the chance to spread \u2013 and, most importantly, before the carrier has the chance to unwittingly pass it on to other people.</p> <p>In the absence of specific therapies or a vaccine, quarantine, distancing and identification of asymptomatic carriers remain the only real measures to control<strong> </strong>this epidemic. In the UK, authorities could still identify and isolate clusters, and test everyone who has come into contact with those infected. Wisely, though probably belatedly, WHO has just this week recommended what we have found in our research to be the best line of defence: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/16/test-test-test-who-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-video\">testing, testing, testing</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrea Crisanti is professor of microbiology at the University of Padua; Antonio Cassone is a former director of the department of infectious diseases at the Italian institute of health</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Agency said on Thursday the total number of infections had risen to 41,035 from 35,713 \u2013 a near 15% increase.</p>",
  "<p>On 13 January, a bulletin from Health Protection Scotland was sent to all GP practices in the country describing a \u201cnovel Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. I work in a small clinic in central Edinburgh with four doctors, two nurses and six admin staff. It was the first time I\u2019d heard of the virus. \u201cCurrent reports describe no evidence of significant human to human transmission, including no infections of healthcare workers,\u201d it said reassuringly.</p> <p>I cast my mind back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\" title=\"\">Sars</a> coronavirus of almost two decades ago, and briefly wondered how quickly the spread of this coronavirus would be stopped, as Sars was. A seafood market had been closed and sanitised. The bulletin said that although Wuhan was a city of 19 million people, there were only three flights per week from there to the UK, and the likely impact was \u201cvery low\u201d. I shrugged, and carried on with my work.</p> <p>Scientists had already discovered that the new virus was fundamentally different from Sars, though still within the family of coronaviruses. \u201cCorona\u201d refers to the spiky little packets of sugared protein stuck all over the surface of the spherical virus, like fleurs-de-lys sprouting from the band of a crown. Under an electron microscope they look like tiny planets, each one buzzing with angry satellites. They\u2019re a similar size to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/24/endless-hunt-for-the-perfect-influenza-vaccine-flu-jab\" title=\"\">flu viruses</a> \u2013 0.1 microns \u2013 and are widespread among many different mammals. Sars came to humans from the Asian civet; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) came via dromedary camels. It seems likely that the new virus has its origin in bats, but whether there was another mammalian intermediary between bats and humans is still uncertain.</p> <p>That evening I met up with a friend, a consultant physician who had recently come back to work after a period of time doing research. She had been stationed at a general hospital around 30 miles from Edinburgh, and was enjoying being back in the thick of clinical work, though startled at how stretched her medical colleagues were. \u201cIt\u2019s the same every year,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder when health boards will realise how many winter beds we actually need.\u201d</p> <p>A week later, Chinese infections stood at 550, and the death toll was 17. A new bulletin arrived reassuring me that the risk of infection was still low, but attaching a specific form to be completed should I suspect someone of having the virus \u2013 specifically anyone flying in from Wuhan. I was disgruntled but not alarmed when one university asked worried Chinese students to seek GP attention. \u201cBy phone!\u201d I wanted them to add, \u201ctell them to seek attention by phone!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\" title=\"\">announced</a> a global health emergency. The death toll in China reached 170, and the cases that had tested positive there reached almost 8,000. Further cases were reported in India and the Philippines.</p> <p>Coronavirus infects and irritates the lungs. Most cases are mild. In severe cases it leads to breathlessness as the lungs struggle to do their job of oxygenating the blood \u2013 something that can be relieved with oxygen delivered by mask. A proportion of those patients who require oxygen will go on to need ventilation in intensive treatment units. In these early days of the outbreak, I still thought of the virus as something that, like Mers and Sars, would be contained. As GPs we are accustomed to dealing with an annual spike in flu \u2013 the \u201cswine flu\u201d of 2009 turned out to be not much more dangerous than seasonal winter flu \u2013 though in its severity and prevalence, this new virus seemed worse.</p> <p>That same day, another message came in, this time from Lothian health board. It instructed me that masks \u201cand other personal protective equipment\u201d would be sent to the practice shortly, prompting the usual jokes among the staff that we would be sent a paper bag and some of those clingfilm gloves you get at petrol stations. Surgical masks did arrive later that week, along with a roll of tear-off plastic aprons.</p> <p>During the week, I work at my small Edinburgh practice, but at the weekend I sometimes work evening GP shifts at an \u201cout of hours\u201d (OOH) centre in the city, covering a much larger population, with a team of other doctors and nurses. I had an email from the clinical director of the centre advising me to tell any patients from mainland China that they would only need to self-isolate if they had symptoms, adding that those symptoms did <em>not</em> include a sore throat. Until then, I\u2019d been assuming that a dripping nose and a sore throat would be the herald of coronavirus infection, the way they are for most respiratory viruses. My practice started a WhatsApp group to keep one another updated. It proved as good for sharing joke videos as for the latest governmental advice.</p> <p>On 4 February, I flew to the US to give a talk at the New York Academy of Sciences about science, medicine and wonder. United Airlines warned me I would be turned back at the US border if I had been through China. There were a few face masks in use at the airport, but I still thought of this as a problem that the Chinese lockdown and the Wuhan flight ban would address.</p> <p>Radio New Zealand had also been in touch to ask if I would do an interview. The absurd levels to which we are all now interconnected came home to me as I sat down, cross-legged and jet-lagged, in a New York hotel room to talk, via Skype, to a presenter 17 hours into tomorrow. He asked me for predictions on how far this epidemic would spread. I remember saying that I had no crystal ball, but what I\u2019d seen of infection control measures in China seemed impressive \u2013 I hoped very much it would be contained as Sars had been contained, and that isolation measures would be effective. That day it was reported that 425 Chinese patients had died, and infection rates, for those who\u2019d been tested, stood at just over 20,000.</p> <p>Flying out of Newark, I found myself in a departure terminal where every table was festooned with tablet computers on stalks. They flashed like gambling machines, entertainment as well as shopping opportunities. To speak to a companion it was necessary to peer over these screens. All food and all payment was to be ordered by touching the tablets. Maybe they wipe them clean regularly, I thought, as I watched a kid pick his nose then start playing with the screen.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When I got home from New York, in early February, the threat began to feel real. That weekend the number of deaths in China <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51431087\" title=\"\">surpassed</a> those of the Sars epidemic of 2002-2003, at 811. Half-term holidays followed. Along with my wife and kids, I drove north to Orkney to see friends and take up a locum position as a GP on one of the islands for a week. At Kirkwall, on my way to the ferry, a message pinged from one of the NHS Orkney staff. Did I have time to drop by the hospital and be measured up for a \u201cface-fitting mask\u201d? These masks are effective at blocking the droplets of coughs or sneezes that carry viruses. It disturbed me that the request came in such haste \u2013 did they know something I didn\u2019t about the imminence of the outbreak? In Orkney? I had time if I dropped by the hospital right now, I replied, but had only an hour until my ferry was leaving. \u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d came the reply, and it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>By the time I got back to Edinburgh eight days later, things were changing fast. The OOH service asked if I could come by and be assessed for a face-fitting mask. But when I tried to set up an appointment, stocks had run out. New guidance appeared that, for the kind of examinations I perform as a GP, it would be enough to wear a \u201cfluid resistant\u201d mask and follow the usual infection control procedures \u2013 aprons, gloves, eye protection. The face-fitted masks were to be preserved for those performing the kind of procedures \u2013 such as intubations and endoscopies \u2013 during which you might be sprayed with saliva, or worse. Some were finding governmental advice infuriatingly inconsistent, but it was clear that tough decisions were having to be made with limited resources, and time was running out. As GPs we were being urged to avoid suspected cases in case we spread it inadvertently to others, though the virus was undoubtedly circulating among our patients at higher levels than were evident in official figures.</p> <p>On 21 February, Lombardy reported its first cases resulting from spread within Italy, rather than among people who had flown in with the virus. They still had only a handful of confirmed cases. My wife is from Lombardy, not far from Pavia, and her parents went into isolation. Italy reported its first deaths the following day, but several patients of mine were still relaxed enough about the virus to fly there for skiing.</p> <p>In the next four days, Italy\u2019s number of reported cases leapt from single figures to 229, and China\u2019s approached 80,000. But China\u2019s were slowing while Italy\u2019s appeared to be gathering momentum: on 25 February, a new bulletin from the public health specialists of NHS Lothian asked me to tell anyone who had been in Lombardy or Veneto within the last 14 days, and who had symptoms, to self-isolate. \u201cFirst of all, for reassurance,\u201d it stated, \u201cwith regards to Italy, the area of concern is only for northern Italy \u2013 north of Pisa, Florence or Rimini.\u201d I was not reassured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bfbe142eebc4a6e702621fddeaac601c2c730c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bfbe142eebc4a6e702621fddeaac601c2c730c6/0_59_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An electron microscope image from the US National Institutes of Health of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An electron microscope image from the US National Institutes of Health of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niaid Rml/NIH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I spoke that day with a patient who had returned from Milan, but who had no symptoms other than a slight sore throat, common enough for anyone just off a plane. According to the rules I\u2019d been given, he didn\u2019t have to isolate himself. \u201cHave you got a thermometer?\u201d I asked him, and toyed with the idea of dropping round to see if he had a fever, but then more calls and demands came through, and I didn\u2019t. (He subsequently recovered.)</p> <p>At the OOH centre in West Lothian, in the first week of March, it was evident just how thick the weekly traffic is between Italy and the UK. One among several calls: a man who had flown in a day earlier, from south of Pisa, and who had a cough with a fever. According to the guidance I\u2019d been given, he\u2019d been too far south to be considered as a potential case \u2013 I informed him there was no official need for self-isolation. But the advice made me uneasy, and I asked him, if he could, to stay at home and off work for at least a week.</p> <p>Another call was to a family just back from skiing; according to the location of their resort they <em>were</em> at risk, and they were referred to the public health board for testing. This is done by sending away an official form \u2013 we GPs don\u2019t get to hear who turns out positive and who doesn\u2019t.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In early March, the computer system with which GPs read all medical records, make notes on each consultation and refer patients for specialist care, had new coronavirus codes added. The idea is that anyone registered in the system with Covid-19 is tagged with a special code that will keep track of the spread of the disease, as well as our Covid-19 workload as GPs. At this point, \u201cAdvice given about 2019-nCoV\u201d was the only code that I had much opportunity to use.</p> <p>To carry on with \u201ccontainment\u201d of the virus, it felt like we would need hundreds of call-handlers to decide who should stay put and self-isolate, and who should be tested \u2013 and then hundreds more workers to trace every contact. Drive-through testing was happening now in Edinburgh, though there was only one mention of the virus today among the 30 or so patients I saw face to face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now, fear was spreading, with some justification, and the situation was beginning to feel extremely serious. One elderly lady requested a letter for her insurance company, to get her out of her package holiday; I explained that until the government changed its advice, my letter wouldn\u2019t make any difference, and she left, dejected.</p> <p>Watching the news, the measures Italy was taking seemed extraordinary, though necessary. Once, when I worked as an Antarctic expedition doctor, I studied with military medics for a diploma in the medical care of catastrophes. We learned about building makeshift hospitals, about dividing clinics into \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d zones, about planning urgent mass vaccination, about emergency medical supply chains. It felt surreal that those kinds of measures were now being discussed so close to home.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The gravity of the crisis was only just starting to be felt. It seems incredible now that I was so blase, but on Saturday 6 March, I was out with friends, jokes aplenty about nudging elbows instead of shaking hands. I stood in the corner of a pub packed with people watching the rugby. (England were victorious over Wales.) A GP friend in Fife told me that she was convinced the disease was already widespread among her own patients \u2013 she was seeing more viral breathlessness than usual, but none from people who had travelled to the \u201cat risk\u201d areas, and none who fulfilled the criteria for testing. We went together to a sold-out concert at Edinburgh\u2019s Usher Hall \u2013 capacity 2,200 \u2013 crowds singing, people hugging, everyone pretending to forget about Covid-19 for a night.</p> <p>Another friend, a hospital specialist, told me in a crowded pub that night that what we needed urgently was to slow its spread \u2013 allow the government to buy time, get in more ventilators and prepare the hospitals. But he wondered if we were doing too little too late. \u201cWe could run out of ventilators by May,\u201d he said. Evidence from China was showing that if you buy ventilators early and deploy them in new and cleared-out hospitals, you save lives.</p> <p>The following day, Italy went into lockdown, but Britons were still being allowed to fly home. The supermarkets there started offering free delivery to the over-65s. My parents-in-law at least have a garden; a neighbour is passing fresh bread over the fence. They have their chickens, their vegetable patch and a well-stocked garage. There are frightening stories from Lombardy hospitals of insufficient ventilators, and operating rooms used as intensive-care units.</p> <p>I woke up on 10 March to a WhatsApp message from a colleague \u2013 the first few Covid-19 cases from our patch of Edinburgh had been confirmed, all in people returning from Italy. They had a fever, a frontal headache and a dry cough. We were all expecting the news, but it still came like a cold slap. Everything about the way we work would have to change. Planes were still flying in from Italy and France. Websites were telling worried people to phone their GP, while each morning we GPs were picking through emails from local and national health boards for the latest advice. Protective suits were to be saved for hospital staff and paramedics at the bedsides of sick people shedding the virus.</p> <p>We decided to slash the number of appointments offered by 50%, filled the new space with phone appointments, and used a new code in the medical records: \u201cTelephone triage due to Covid-19 restrictions\u201d. All the same, a colleague and I still made five visits that day to frail, elderly, housebound patients \u2013 all of them over 85 (two over 90), and all asking anxiously about the virus, trying with their questions to gauge our own levels of concern. These are among the most lonely, isolated people in our communities. But when any GP might be asymptomatically carrying the virus, trying to assess their problems face-to-face feels like a luxury \u2013 we have to reduce home visiting to a minimum.</p> <p>There were plenty of nervous jokes among my patients that day about the coming \u201ccoronageddon\u201d, but only one who phoned in, drenched in sweat, with a dry cough and a fever of 39C. He hadn\u2019t been abroad for months, and I told him to stay home for at least a week. That evening, my GP colleagues and I had a meeting in the pub that felt like a boozy council of war. We shared stories we\u2019d heard of patients in hospital with the virus, and ideas for how to protect the practice, should we, one-by-one, end up catching it. I remembered planning meetings for the swine flu of 2009, but they were nothing like this, and the threat had felt nowhere near as real.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 11 March, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">declared</a> Covid-19 to be a pandemic. Events were moving at unprecedented speed. The UK budget was delivered and the NHS was told it would have whatever it needed. We\u2019ll see. Deaths in China continued to drop \u2013 just 19 new infections.</p> <p>A helpful message signed by all the government health departments, health boards, royal colleges and the General Medical Council also arrived on 11 March. It said that I\u2019ll be expected, in the coming weeks, to go beyond what I\u2019m accustomed to dealing with, but that I can be reassured that the GMC and health board will support me and my decisions through the crisis. \u201cClinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.\u201d It\u2019s good to feel the GMC is at my back, rather than on my back, for a change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7f25699f9a70e3271d0f06bf3828953ef920ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7f25699f9a70e3271d0f06bf3828953ef920ed8/0_190_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musselburgh primary care centre on the outskirts of Edinburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musselburgh primary care centre on the outskirts of Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among my worried patients were a grandmother with full parental responsibility for all her grandchildren. A mother of a seven-year-old daughter who has a fever and cough asked whether that means she should also be self-isolating. According to official guidance, the answer was still a disquieting \u201cno\u201d \u2013 we were still in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase \u2013 but I asked people to be pragmatic. If they felt at all unwell, stay in and minimise contact with others. The only unconcerned patient was a man with advanced cancer, spread to the liver, who thought we were all overreacting.</p> <p>By this point, we GPs were doing almost everything over the phone, even if it meant prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients, and making guesses about non-urgent diagnoses \u2013 shunting anything that wasn\u2019t an emergency into an imagined future of normality. Over morning coffee, my colleague joked about getting us beekeeper outfits, visiting only the most seriously ill in their homes while hermetically sealed in our own isolation suits. As jokes go, it wasn\u2019t very funny.</p> <p>I spent the afternoon doing a men\u2019s clinic for the city\u2019s rough sleepers and those with no fixed address, some of whom sleep in Bethany Trust dormitories. In my morning surgery, everyone had asked me about the virus; my homeless patients had, it seems, more pressing concerns. About half went to shake my hand, and thought me cowardly for bumping elbows instead.</p> <p>By the time I emerged from the clinic, Boris Johnson had told everyone with cough and cold symptoms to stay home for a week. \u201cAt last!\u201d I thought. Maybe people will take it seriously. We were again informed that more protective equipment was coming, but the droplet-resistant masks still won\u2019t be available. Everyone with a beard who works with Covid-19 patients has been asked to shave it off, as the masks don\u2019t work if there\u2019s hair between them and the skin. Anyone with religious or cultural objections was told to speak with their line manager.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Friday the 13th, and an atmosphere of dread in morning meeting at the news from Italy. There aren\u2019t enough ventilators to go round, or nurses, and people are being buried without funerals. The practice WhatsApp group has been renamed \u201cDream Team CoronaCombat\u201d in an attempt at levity. There was an air of quiet resignation at what\u2019s coming, but an edge of bunker humour, too. One of the clinic thermometers broke, and I went online to buy another \u2013 \u00a330 versions are changing hands for \u00a3125. But virologists are learning about Covid-19 all the time, and for all their horrors, the Chinese and Italian experiences mean that we\u2019re better prepared in the UK than we might have been.</p> <p>One of my patients that day, a man in his late 80s, told me that the virus is mother nature getting back at us. \u201cToo many people!\u201d he said, and chuckled. \u201cAll us oldies need clearing out!\u201d I didn\u2019t share his glee. Some who have had coughs for weeks, but that have worsened, asked me if they\u2019d got it \u2013 but there\u2019s no way of knowing, and I told them all to stay home for a further week. The lab had stopped accepting viral swabs from GPs, so unless someone is admitted to hospital, they aren\u2019t tested. And also on the 13th, the first death in Scotland, in Ediburgh, was announced.</p> <p>Spain followed Italy into lockdown, planes turning back halfway. The UK attitude of allowing schools to stay open came under attack. It was obvious we needed new ways to slow the spread, particularly among the over-65s \u2013 they\u2019re the ones most at risk from this disease. One of my colleagues has purchased us hazmat suits from eBay for home visiting, just in case. The medical students of Edinburgh University have set up a pet-and-babysitting service for NHS staff.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On Tuesday 17 March, the practice was oddly quiet \u2013 there was a hush on the streets, a sense of anxious anticipation, and my days now feel like a prelude to what is to come. People were stunned by the implications of the guidance delivered by the prime minister on Monday night \u2013 to avoid going out, to avoid restaurants and theatres, to self-isolate for 14 days if anyone in the family has symptoms. Unprecedented, necessary, belated advice. Of the 20 people I spoke to on the phone, a couple almost certainly had the virus \u2013 a new headache, fever, cough, malaise and exhaustion. I coded them \u201csuspected coronavirus infection\u201d and gave advice to stay in with their whole families, and call us if they get worsening breathlessness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\">Why we need worst-case thinking to prevent pandemics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As healthcare workers, we\u2019ve been told to follow the same advice as everyone else: stay off for 14 days if anyone in our homes has a cough or fever. Practices adjacent to my own are already losing staff, and we\u2019re clamouring for testing. If I develop a cough but test negative, I can go on working. Even better will be some future test that can show if I\u2019ve <em>had</em> the virus, and developed immunity \u2013 then I\u2019ll be able to work overtime through the coming weeks without fear. Hospital clinics are being cancelled wherever possible, all elective surgery postponed. We\u2019re clearing the decks for an onslaught. Yes, it would have been nice to have been better prepared for this pandemic, but though it\u2019s frightening, it could also be worse, and I don\u2019t feel the same anger as some of my colleagues towards the government for its prevarication over such immense and unprecedented decisions.</p> <p>On Wednesday I heard that schools are closing, and so my wife and I will be contending with the competing necessities of the kids, the virus and the NHS. My wife contacted her GP in Lombardy. The situation is, he said, very grave, and he wished us luck with what is to come. I messaged a medical contact in Beijing, the Chinese translator of my books, who said things are improving, with few new cases. \u201cAs you know, isolation is the only effective method to stop the virus,\u201d he added, and asked that I give thought to the mental health of my patients as much as to their physical needs. He ended on a sanguine note: \u201cPeople will have to change their habits for a while.

It was just so, so sad. Everyone worked like mad, and we were all set for a lovely big hit. The kind of press we had is like gold dust. And then: agony!</p> <p>Still, I don\u2019t regret anything. We didn\u2019t consider cancelling the release because it was an unfolding situation that changed hour by hour. And I\u2019ve no qualms if the film winds up getting fast-tracked online. These are extraordinary circumstances, and there\u2019s a real role for film in cheering people up now, so I\u2019m happy for any joy we can give.</p> <p>Plus, I\u2019m grateful we managed to do the premiere - lots of the real time characters in the film who hadn\u2019t seen each other in 50 years flew in, and it was the most moving experience. On the weekend, I did one Q&amp;A in Bristol to an audience of about 30. For one tiny moment, I allowed myself to feel really gutted. But then the next day another Q&amp;A was sold out \u2013 although the cinema had capped the number of people so that everyone could sit separately.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve never felt this hopeless and bleak in my life\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Blair Barnette, film art director</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m an art director on films; my partner is a producer and was recently diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease and made redundant. After Christmas, our minimal funds began to dry up. I lined up work to take us through until August and by last Friday I was down to the last \u00a3100 in my account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e72b5401970cb44a524c409dde3ba9220919959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e72b5401970cb44a524c409dde3ba9220919959/0_116_1544_926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blair Barnette and her husband at Sainsbury\u2019s in Whitechapel, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blair Barnette and her husband at Sainsbury\u2019s in Whitechapel, east London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Blair Barnette</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over one hour, everything was cancelled. That\u2019s \u00a328,000 gone in an instant. My head started spinning. I realised the knock-on effect this would have in the industry and felt sick. It will be months before it\u2019s gaining traction again, and once it does, it will be a feeding frenzy for us freelancers.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never felt this hopeless and bleak in my life. My partner can\u2019t risk going outside because of his health. But the local supermarket won\u2019t allow me to enter during the time slot dedicated to elderly and vulnerable people unless he comes too. So I\u2019m bundling him up in a chemical face mask and Tyvek suit that I use for spray painting. I\u2019m trying to keep him safe, but I can\u2019t even seem to do that.</p> <h2>\u2018People still want to come in on Mother\u2019s Day \u2013 I think they should stay home and rewatch The Sopranos\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Kevin Markwick, owner and manager of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.picturehouseuckfield.com/homepage\">Picture House, Uckfield</a>, East Sussex</strong></p> <p>We were a pretty successful independent cinema until about a week ago. Our usual audience number on a Sunday is 1,000 \u2013 last Sunday it was 178. On Monday, 65 people came in, most of them elderly, which I thought was insane. Then on Tuesday, it was down to nine. And Boris Johnson finally advised cinemas close, rather than having the nuts to say they had to. </p> <p>Luckily, we started the year with our best-ever takings, thanks to films like Little Women, 1917, Emma and Parasite. Our speciality is upmarket mainstream; if your mum wants to see it, we\u2019re going to make a fortune. Our biggest film of all time is The King\u2019s Speech.</p> <p>We\u2019re a restaurant too, which is currently closed, but when we rang people who had booked for Mothering Sunday, most of them said they still wanted to come. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Dunkirk spirit or lemming spirit. I think they should stay home and rewatch The Sopranos.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to try to keep the business afloat, but not at the cost of safety. I reckon we\u2019ll be shut for three months at least. My parents started this cinema in 1964, when I was two years old. It\u2019s the place I grew up in and in 1994 I took it over. It feels like a lifetime\u2019s work is in danger of being lost.</p> <h2>\u2018The film sector isn\u2019t an essential service\u2019</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639780/\">Rebecca O\u2019Brien</a>, who produce</strong><strong>s </strong><strong>Ken Loach\u2019s films</strong></p> <p>Coronavirus will change the content of any story we next tell. From an existential point of view there\u2019s a lot to grapple with, and what\u2019s going on outside at the moment is possibly far more interesting than what might be going on inside a writer\u2019s head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ec063c6f174fe296b3b917b273644d6ca2c65a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ec063c6f174fe296b3b917b273644d6ca2c65a9/333_0_2685_2686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca O\u2019Brien with Ken Loach, picking up his Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for I, Daniel Blake in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca O\u2019Brien with Ken Loach in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Right now, I\u2019m mostly concerned that people do follow the guidelines. But my heart goes out to all those on zero-hours contracts, of which there are so many in the industry. It\u2019s a gig economy with people usually working on week-long contracts, at best. I hope the government comes up with some clear support for these people quickly to allay their fears. I\u2019m in the privileged position of being able to work from home easily.</p> <p>The problem is that the film sector isn\u2019t an essential service and I just can\u2019t see how we\u2019re going to be able to get going again until everything is over. What\u2019s interesting is that the BBC has kicked into becoming a backbone, with things like their exercise regimes for older people and home school resources.</p> <p>My plea to the government would be to put some proper support into the independent sector once this is over. We were in trouble before this; only 49 non-studio films were made the UK last year, because of the rise of inward investment productions and high-end TV. Yet this is where people learn their craft before they bugger off to the big boys. If our sector perishes, so will the seed bed of all those skills and the main source of home-grown talent and stories.</p> <h2>\u2018Film-makers were flying in from all over the world \u2026 would we really cancel \u201cQueer Christmas\u201d?\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Tricia Tuttle, BFI </strong><strong>festivals </strong><strong>director</strong></p> <p>The London Book Fair, SXSW, Tribeca film festival \u2026 over the last few weeks, one by one, we watched them cancel, with a dawning sense of inevitability.

Many attendees call the festival \u201cqueer Christmas\u201d. Film-makers were flying in from all over the world. Festivals are one of the principal ways LGBTIQ+ film-makers connect with a queer audience. Our team - events, industry, hospitality and guest coordinators and the programmers who spend half of the year putting together the 200+ screenings and events \u2013 were going to be gutted.Plus, it would be a devastating financial blow for the BFI, a charity. </p> <p>But as the hours passed, continuing became untenable. We made the tough decision over countless war room calls last weekend, just ahead of the new official advice that prompted the closure of BFI Southbank for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Still, we will not go quietly. We\u2019re going to recreate a little virtual Flare on BFI Player, with every original booker getting a free month\u2019s subscription. It\u2019s not a queer Christmas, but hopefully it\u2019s a small concession present.</p> <h2><em>\u2018</em>Coronavirus is killing off the subjects of my film\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Tammy \u2018TS\u2019 Botkin, director of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10764868/\">Legacy of the Fighting Filipinos</a></strong></p> <p>For the past 18 months I\u2019ve been working on a documentary about second world war veterans from the Philippines, racing against the clock to wrap before they all die without appropriate recognition.</p> <p>Now, Covid-19 has taken aim at my subjects: elderly Filipino men and women who served in the US army but were denied benefits and citizenship by the US Congress in 1946. Some of the subjects of the film who are in lockdown have stopped responding.</p> <p>Coronavirus has also shut down the final two scheduled shoots for the film, and donors have withdrawn support as they watch their portfolios take massive hits. I\u2019m unable to pay myself or my producer, Amanda Upson, which threatens to put us both out of our homes.</p> <p>Freelance film-makers cannot access the stop-gap provided by unemployment benefits or the emergency funds provided by unions. We are many, and we are out of luck. Still, perhaps not so out of luck as the veterans in my film. I\u2019m worried for my livelihood; they for their lives.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>This will be a devastating blow for a sector already under stress\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Kevin Macdonald, Oscar-winning director</strong></p> <p>So far, I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. I\u2019m working on an edit for my new film [a drama set in Guant\u00e1namo with Jodie Foster, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tahar Rahim] in a suite five minutes walk from my house. We finished shooting two weeks ago when we flew back from Mauritania. Lots of people were reluctant to travel there because few people have shot a film in the country before; it\u2019s all desert with a tiny Bedouin population. But it all went really smoothly \u2013 no illnesses, no problems. Then we flew home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25f04dd56f5d7f4f6cd2f5af0adf2b53c8212e68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25f04dd56f5d7f4f6cd2f5af0adf2b53c8212e68/0_0_4332_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Kevin MacDonald\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Kevin MacDonald.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Deadline/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our problems will come when it comes to the film getting seen. It\u2019s the kind of movie that relies on exposure at the fall festivals like Toronto or Telluride; we\u2019d also hoped to release a trailer at Cannes. But perhaps none of those will happen this year.</p> <p>Who knows if cinemas will even be open in the autumn? Will coronavirus be the final nail in the coffin for the mass cinematic experience, or will people be desperate for it once this is over? Does the old model still work or will Netflix and the other streamers manage total domination over the next few months?</p> <p>It was striking that Universal announced they were moving to stream new releases, having fought for years to keep that theatrical window open. I suppose they felt they had to in order to survive. My fear is this will be a devastating blow for a sector already under a lot of stress. Still, thank goodness for streaming, otherwise the film industry wouldn\u2019t have any sort of fallback.</p> <p>I once made a film set in a sort of post-apocalyptic scenario [How I Live Now (2013)] and it seems people are now more drawn to watching movies that fictionalise this sort of situation. Perhaps they want to see their worst fears realised on screen \u2013 then they become less frightening.</p> <p>During the second world war, film-makers thought audiences would want escapism. In fact the most popular films of the period were war movies, which realistically reflected the drama happening every day.</p> <h2> \u2018Our income dipped 90% day-on-day\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Kelly Jeffs, CEO of the <a href=\"https://light-house.co.uk/LightHouseMediaCentre.dll/Home\">Light House cinema</a>, Wolverhampton</strong></p> <p>I run the only independent cinema in the black country, which also acts as a community hub. Our core business is our two screens, but we facilitate events like national conferences and vegan fairs, and host local health and wellbeing groups, including a singing group for lung health, a deaf group and a carers\u2019 group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve had people in tears on the phone, worried we might never reopen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The slowdown started on the weekend \u2013 our big film was Military Wives, which would usually have our demographic queueing out of the door. But the screen was only about 10% full. Then when the government advised people to socially isolate, our income dipped 90% day-on-day.</p> <p>We hung on as long as we could but we\u2019re shutting up shop on Thursday. We\u2019ve had people in tears on the phone, worried we might never reopen. I feel like I\u2019m drunk all the time. This place has been running for 30 years and I\u2019ve been here 21. We\u2019ve already dodged lots of bullets and refocused. But this is really serious.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>My hands were shaking from the stress and pressure\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m a woman in my late 20s who started working on set for a major studio in London in early January. The past few weeks have been a nightmare, from the stress of a two-hour commute on public transport to dealing with talent demanding I find them hand sanitiser <em>now</em>.</p> <p>I also got a cold, which didn\u2019t shift. I knew people were gossiping about me, and a lot of people ridiculed me for being at work (this was before government guidelines suggested self-isolation). I had to take breathers outside as my hands were shaking from the stress and pressure.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 10pm on Sunday that we were told we weren\u2019t now required and that we had had our last pay cheque. I am now left without a job, with bills and rent to pay. I could move in with a friend and share rent \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure how that will work if we are in lockdown.</p> <h2>\u2018I can\u2019t now qualify for statutory maternity pay\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Samantha Kent</strong></p> <p>My last job finished in November and I have spent the quieter winter months resting and enjoying early pregnancy, knowing that come March the industry should boom as usual and there will be work.</p> <p>Come the end of February I had five weeks booked. Rather than having a full-time contract, I\u2019m employed as a \u201cdaily\u201d, which is common for many of us in the costume department. All my work has been cancelled.</p> <p>Since Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference on Monday, I am now considered \u201ca high-risk group\u201d. So do I earn while I still can or follow government guidelines and self-isolate for three months? I have 14 weeks left until my due date.</p> <p>As I am self-employed I have to have worked 26 weeks to qualify for statutory maternity pay; I am currently two weeks short for this. This is my first baby and the usual fears are compounded by having no income and no prospect of the benefits I\u2019d anticipated.</p> <h2>\u2018Every month that passes costs my small business \u00a370,000\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Ben Rothwell, </strong><strong>managing </strong><strong>director, <a href=\"http://www.bapty.co.uk/\">Bapty</a></strong></p> <p>The government must take into consideration the billions contributed to the economy by the UK film industry when addressing the fallout from coronavirus. We have gone from feast to famine overnight. I run a small production business with 10 full-time employees working on features and TV shows all now either on hiatus or cancelled. I have no income stream at all, my business rates are huge, and every month that goes by is going to cost me about \u00a370,000.</p> <p>I have kept all my staff on full wages as statutory sick pay will not allow them to pay the bills. I can only sustain this for so long before the business goes under. Without help our industry will not survive to be able to pick up where we left off.</p> <h2>\u2018I have no work and I\u2019m owed payment on 12 jobs\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Michael Reynolds, treatment writer</strong></p> <p>I live in LA and I\u2019m a treatment writer for films, TV shows and commercials. Since last Friday, I\u2019ve seen an almost immediate shutdown of jobs. Directors at the top of the food chain who work regularly will be OK. But that\u2019s not the case for many.</p> <p>For me, this sudden shutdown brings up issues both around future earnings and money already earned but not yet paid. Not to mention larger issues around worker rights and, frankly, my role, even if small, in feeding a rapacious capitalist system that also keeps me in business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At present, I\u2019m owed payment on 12 jobs. And there is nothing legally I can do to induce companies to pay me.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are never contracts. So no legal protections and little recourse for non-payment. By and large, companies honour their commitments, but every now and again, one won\u2019t, and you have to accept that as part of the cost of doing business.</p> <p>At present, I\u2019m owed payment on 12 jobs. And there is nothing legally I can do to induce companies to pay me. If they have closed their offices and no one is at accounting, they aren\u2019t writing cheques. If they\u2019ve just seen future earnings dry up, I don\u2019t imagine many of them will be keen to send me (and others) money, even though it is for work I\u2019ve already done.

The worst thing is we still don\u2019t know when the wider crisis will end; I can see now military trucks transporting hundreds of bodies from the hospitals to be incinerated.</p> <p>These are terrible times, but I am trying to respond positively. Speaking to friends in Mexico, I realised the low levels of consciousness about coronavirus over there, and the minimal government efforts. So I made a collective video-diary of expats explaining the impact.</p> <h2>\u2018Watch Netflix while you self-isolate \u2013 but spare a thought for the people who made those shows\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jo Rae, owner of Kraken Films</strong></p> <p>I run a London film fixer company that organises film locations, production, crew and kit hire for overseas clients.

  "<p>Long before most of the US population, it seems the coronavirus was in my proverbial backyard.</p> <p>An urgent knock came on my office door in mid-February. I opened the door to find one of my students with tears pouring down her face. Just moments before, she had been told that her parents, who lived in China, had succumbed to Covid-19. She would not be able to return for their funerals. She\u2019s an only child.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/chinese-people-are-enduring-coronavirus-like-everyone-else-dont-traumatise-us-further\">Chinese people are enduring coronavirus like everyone else. Don\u2019t traumatise us further | Yang Tian</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I would soon learn, this was only the beginning of how this virus has impacted my students, most of whom are from east Asia. They now feel stuck in an environment where they often feel unwanted, with nowhere to go anytime soon.</p> <p>When our own president injects such blatant racism into the Covid-19 conversation by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise that my students are having to deal with xenophobia.</p> <p>I instruct and develop classes for international students at the Claremont Colleges in Los Angeles. Over eight weeks, we help them improve their American English skills and teach them how to manage pressure and survive graduate school in the US Most of the students are only here for this program while their families stay behind in China.</p> <p>Many of them are isolated here \u2013 they\u2019re in the US alone and they won\u2019t be able to return to their home countries anytime soon, they are worried about loved ones back home, and on top of all of that, they are experiencing renewed racism.</p> <p>It started before the school closed, with my students sharing stories in class about how some people on campus were giving them dirty looks, whispering, sitting as far away as possible from them. I wanted to believe these incidents were the result of college student immaturity, despite the reports that <a href=\"https://time.com/5775716/xenophobia-racism-stereotypes-coronavirus/\">had come out</a> about similar racist behavior. Clearly, I was in denial. Then suddenly, it was in my face.</p> <p>After our final face-to-face class before, 20 or so of my students and I decided to have one last hurrah at a local pizza parlor since we wouldn\u2019t be seeing each other again for a while. At the time, restaurants were still open and we were still allowed to gather in groups of 100 or less. I had taken students to this restaurant many times before without incident for end-of-the-term celebrations \u2013 parties for completing milestones in our program, and simply for them to get a sense of US dining culture.</p> <p>This time was different. The host asked us to wait, though only a couple tables were occupied. Then the manager \u2013 who is also the owner \u2013 came out, gave our group the once-over, and said that I (a Caucasian woman) could stay, but the others had to leave. I could not understand why, and asked over and over what the problem was; I thought maybe the restaurant\u2019s safety or sanitation had been compromised in some way. My students understood the true reason why before I did. It was one of those moments where my white privilege was obvious to everyone but me.</p> <p>I began to argue with the manager, so angry I could hardly get the words out, until one of my students gently pulled me back and said it wasn\u2019t worth it.</p> <p>Rather than making a scene, my students suggested we try another restaurant. Again, we were denied service even though there were only a few people in the place. This happened four times before we finally found a Chinese restaurant that would seat us. This place was actually quite full, with other east Asian diners. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the same injustice had happened to them at other restaurants in town, but regardless, I was glad these diners had a safe place to go.</p> <p>The owner, who\u2019s from Shanghai, stopped by the table to thank us for coming in. We thanked him in return and told him what had happened at the other restaurants.</p> <p>He shared that business started tanking back in January when people learned where Covid-19 originated. He was even being denied service at local grocery stores, gas stations, car washes, cafes and farmers\u2019 markets because workers either assumed he was a carrier or blamed him for the pandemic because of what he looks like.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My international students are even more isolated and vulnerable than the rest of us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To this day, I\u2019m still hearing stories from my students \u2013 we have been Skyping regularly \u2013 about how people walk in the other direction when they see them. Sometimes strangers get aggressive and say things to them like: \u201cThis is <em>your</em> people\u2019s fault.\u201d They\u2019re afraid to walk into places like Walmart or Target because of this. I fear for their safety beyond the coronavirus itself.</p> <p>One student, whose husband and kids are here in the US with her, just told me a story about going to a PTA meeting at her son\u2019s elementary school. She and her husband sat in the back corner of the room so as not to upset or alarm other parents \u2013 it has happened so often, they have come to expect it. She told me other parents approached the person running the meeting and asked for \u201cthat Chinese couple in the back\u201d to be asked to leave. Thankfully the request was not granted, but my student was still deeply upset by it, understandably.</p> <p>We are all having to go into isolation because of Covid-19, through no fault of our own. But many of us have family, friends, co-workers and other members of our community to lean on as we approach the unknown. Now, simple human interactions like visiting the grocery store or even driving down the street and seeing another human face are a treat.</p> <p>My international students are even more isolated and vulnerable than the rest of us. They are in a country that\u2019s becoming increasingly hostile toward them. Everyone in every part of the world is fearful of this infection and how far it will spread, of how many people it will affect. The one thing we have control over right now is how we behave and how we treat other people. Basic compassion, empathy and kindness for our fellow human beings \u2013 right now, this is what we can and should be spreading.</p>",
  "<p>Governments across Africa are rushing to reinforce measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, fearing that fragile health systems will be swiftly overwhelmed if the disease spreads beyond a small number of cases on the continent.</p> \n<p>World Health Organization (WHO) officials have called for a strong response to a \u201ctremendously fast rise in the number of countries with cases being confirmed\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to ratchet up what is being done,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is what is done at this point that will determine the numbers who will become very ill \u2026 I still think it is possible that we will prevent large numbers of people dying but it needs coordination, a huge effort and huge resources.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most infections involve people who have recently been in Europe or other disease hot spots, but the number of cases of internal transmission are rising every day.</p> \n<p>Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, has warned that official numbers may underestimate the extent of the spread of the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cProbably we have undetected cases or unreported cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point, so the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Health officials across Africa know that hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads through overcrowded cities, remote villages and among vulnerable populations such as refugees, the malnourished or those suffering from HIV and other chronic conditions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO is working to establish the exact numbers of ICU beds available across the continent. \u201cWe know [the number] is extremely limited \u2026 It is a huge challenge,\u201d said Moetse. \u201cIt is necessary not to give up on containment .\u201d</p> \n<p>South Africa, which has one of Africa\u2019s best public health systems, has fewer than 1,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 160 are in the private sector, for a population of 56m. In Malawi, there are about 25 ICU beds in public hospitals, serving 17 million people. The main infectious diseases hospital in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare, has none, Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said.</p> \n<p>Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous state, is scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur health system is not as strong as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control. \u201cIt is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak that we are focused so intensively on prevention and early detection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many states have suspended flights and other transport links with badly hit zones in Europe and Asia, or are strictly controlling entry. Restrictions have also been placed on public gatherings, schools and religious services, and mass events have been cancelled across the continent.</p> \n<p>Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda\u2019s minister of health, said the country was on \u201chigh alert\u201d as almost all its neighbours have registered cases of Covid-19. \u201cNo country can say they are 100% prepared,\u201d Aceng told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Uganda\u2019s new coronavirus tsar, Atel Kagirita, said the virus \u201cwill not be a big problem ... if we can effectively stop local transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe \u2026 don\u2019t envisage having many cases [needing critical care] because we are putting all our efforts on prevention. We are doing a lot of community awareness campaigns and public education,\u201d Kagirita said.</p> \n<p>Though Aceng said she was confident Uganda has \u201cenough capacity beds, some ICU units and ventilation to handle a possible outbreak\u201d, some fear this is too optimistic. Uganda \u2013 population 44m \u2013 is relying primarily on the 1,500-bed Mulago National Referral Hospital. Its ICU can currently accommodate 60 patients.</p> \n<p>There are also limited facilities for isolation. In South Sudan, devastated by a five-year civil war, the government has just 24 isolation beds, said Dr. Angok Gordon Kuol, incident manager for the outbreak at the ministry of health.</p> \n<p>In Somalia, health minister Dr Fawziya Abikar said the government has established a quarantine facility at Mogadishu airport and was equipping a hospital to deal with Covid-19 cases. \u201cWe are still waiting for more equipment for the hospital to arrive,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Dr Ali Yusuf, one of a team of health officials preventing and controlling the Coronavirus, told the Guardian that facilities were extremely limited. \u201cWe only have 15 tents, with one bed each for quarantine and isolation of suspected cases. Our hospital can accommodate only 100 beds,\u201d Dr Yusuf said.</p> \n<p>Many African countries have extensive experience in controlling highly infectious and potentially lethal diseases. Preparations for an outbreak of Ebola, which killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, mean that Uganda has already stockpiled protective equipment, drugs and tents, as well as developing a capacity of moving samples around the country to a central laboratory or using mobile testing laboratories.</p> \n<p>Also, the delayed arrival of the virus has allowed governments to work with the WHO to strengthen emergency coordination, improve surveillance, and begin equipping treatment centres.</p> \n<p>But few doubt that if the virus starts to take hold the consequences could be very serious, with health systems rapidly overwhelmed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Pauline Byakika, a specialist in infectious diseases at Uganda\u2019s Makerere University College of Health Sciences, said she was worried that \u201conce its gets here, [coronavirus] was going to spread very fast\u201d.

Before you know it the whole household is going to be sick,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>There are similar fears in South Africa, where president Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a state of national disaster and imposed stringent restrictions.

Covid-19 precautions have now closed the show, but Tabrah says Vermin has a waiting list of orders for \u201chandbags, man bags, wallets and stubby coolers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe310ec85dc9f700999e195ce485359505623f92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe310ec85dc9f700999e195ce485359505623f92/2433_1097_5265_3159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cane toad stubby holder at Toad Busting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cane toad stubby holder at Toad Busting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Fowler Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe got so many crazy emails from strangers all over,\u201d Tabrah says. \u201cThere was one where a woman\u2019s dog had died by toad, and now she wanted a purse. All of these people hate [toads] so much that they want a piece!\u201d</p> <p>Cane toads were introduced to Australia in 1935 in an attempt to control beetles that were decimating local sugar cane. It didn\u2019t work out as planned. The toads had little effect on the beetle population, instead causing havoc in the country\u2019s ecosystems. They poison and prey on native animals and insects, compete for food with local fauna, and breed at an alarming rate.</p> <p>Today there are an estimated 200 million cane toads in Australia \u2013 and they are on the move.</p> <p>The exhibition, Toad Busting, \u201cfights the war on cane toads by transforming these toxic invaders of Top End Australia into bespoke designs\u201d. Toad leather was sourced by Tabrah and Drummond from the Torres Strait Islands in January, and given to artists and designers including Kate Geck, Lisa Waup, the Huxleys and Jenny Bannister.</p> <p>Each creator produced wild and warty art and apparel as diverse a woven \u201chealing figure\u201d inspired by connection to country and inherited traumas (Waup); a \u201cplague bag\u201d with protruding pierced cones of leather and dangling toad legs (Bannister); and a gold gimp mask (the Huxleys).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62d40a14ff4c8a6244be1a30d0d12f342c1738bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62d40a14ff4c8a6244be1a30d0d12f342c1738bf/1186_706_6606_4798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mask made out of cane toad leather by the performance artist duo the Huxleys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mask made out of cane toad leather by the performance artist duo the Huxleys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Fowler Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEveryone has their own individual practice and aesthetic,\u201d Tabrah says.

(The device was not ultimately used in the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach, but Musk continued to court attention by calling one of the volunteers who assisted with the rescue effort a \u201cpedo guy\u201d. In late 2019, Musk was found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/06/elon-musk-vernon-unsworth-trial-verdict\">not liable</a> in a defamation suit brought by the cave explorer.</p> <p>Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/18/tech-execs-who-dont-agree-coronavirus-measures\">response to the coronavirus</a> pandemic has drawn substantial criticism in recent weeks.

He responded on Twitter to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westcoastbill/status/1240703534749769733\">post</a> by the venture capitalist Ben Lee that linked to a Daily Wire write-up of an <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/\">op-ed</a> by John PA Ioannidis, a Stanford University professor of medicine and epidemiology. The Daily Wire is the website of rightwing commentator Ben Shapiro. </p> <p>Ioannidis argued in his <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/\">op-ed</a> in the science publication Stat News on 17 March that decisions about Covid-19 were being made with insufficient and unreliable data. Ioannidis did not prescribe or denounce any policies, but did question how long social distancing could be maintained and whether school closures were the right course of action based on the evidence.</p> <p>\u201cImo [in my opinion], this professor is correct,\u201d Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240707187229380608\">tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Musk also cited statistics which he argued showed that the growth rate of new infections is slowing. The Ioannidis article argued that current data is incomplete and unreliable.</p> <p>Later in the day, Musk also asserted false information about the virus\u2019s effect on children. Children with confirmed cases of Covid-19 have generally experienced milder symptoms than adults, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fchildren-faq.html\">according</a> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The largest study to date of children with the virus, published online in the journal <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf\">Pediatrics</a>, found that a small percentage of children became severely or critically ill with the disease. The study found that young children and infants were especially vulnerable to infection.</p> <p>Musk tweeted that children are \u201cessentially immune\u201d, which is false.</p> <p>Twitter, which on Wednesday announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/twitter-to-remove-harmful-fake-news-about-coronavirus\">new rules banning harmful misinformation</a> about coronavirus, did not immediately respond to queries from the Guardian. Among the categories of misinformation that Twitter specifically said would be banned was: \u201cDenial of established scientific facts about transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance from global and local health authorities, such as \u2018COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven\u2019t seen any cases of children being sick.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, Musk drew criticism for keeping the Tesla factory in the San Francisco Bay Area open despite a \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d order from local officials designed to shutter \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses. (Tesla has reportedly agreed to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/tesla-tells-workers-it-awaits-final-word-on-u-s-plant-status\">reduce staffing levels</a> from 10,000 to 2,500 amid the health crisis; workers have expressed concern about their conditions to <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/tesla-fremont-factory-stays-open-coronavirus-sheriff\">BuzzFeed News</a>.)</p> <p>On Thursday evening, the company <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-operational-update\">announced</a> that it would cease manufacturing at the factory on 23 March.</p> <p>\u201cDespite taking all known health precautions, continued operations in certain locations has caused challenges for our employees, their families and our suppliers,\u201d the company wrote in a notice to investors. \u201cAs such, we have decided to temporarily suspend production at our factory in Fremont, from end of day March 23, which will allow an orderly shutdown.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Musk nor Tesla has responded to requests for comment on his or the company\u2019s approach to the pandemic.</p>",

Moscow is rushing to build a new hospital similar to the ones that were built in China at the height of the coronavirus outbreak there. The new hospital will have beds for 500 patients and will be ready in the next month, officials have said. </p> \n  <p>While the government has claimed that its success has stemmed from early border closures with China and quick isolation of suspected cases, there are also concerns that Russia may be underestimating the official numbers of those infected with coronavirus in order to avert public panic. </p> \n  <p>Last week, the Russian business daily RBC reported that registered pneumonia cases in Moscow had grown 37% between January 2019 and January 2020, speculating that a wave of new coronavirus infections could have been registered as cases of pneumonia or other pulmonary diseases. </p> \n  <p>The Kremlin has said that it is protecting Vladimir Putin, 67, from contracting the disease by testing members of his entourage. During a trip to Crimea, the peninsula annexed from Ukraine in March 2014, Putin said: \u201cThank God, we generally have everything under control so far. Hopefully, it will continue in the future.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Russia has closed its borders to most foreigners and has cancelled many flights to Europe and the US.

When the last one started in 2008 it took the Bank of England six months to spot it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/britain-faces-economic-emergency-warns-new-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-covid-19\">This time it is different</a>. Then it was a financial virus, this time it is the real thing. Commentators often say the economy is hitting the wall or is falling off a cliff on the weakest of evidence.

That is not a recession, it is a collapse surpassing anything in modern times, including the Great Depression.</p> \n  <p>When the banks were bailed out in 2008, it was because policymakers feared precisely what is now happening: a complete shutdown of the global economy. The rescue package worked, but only just. The early indications from China are that the impact of Covid-19 is markedly greater than that of the financial crisis, itself the most severe downturn of the postwar era.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\">Peacetime constraints ditched in the war for economic survival | Larry Elliott</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73138a8f085e564ad86e93\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T06:47:50.961Z\">6.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dozens of London underground stations are to be closed indefinitely</strong>.

And now, more than ever, we need each other. We need each other for truth, for support, and to feel less alone during a time that can honestly feel quite scary. There are so many around the world who need support right now, who are working tirelessly to respond to this crisis behind the scenes, on the frontline, or at home. Our willingness, as a people, to step up in the face of what we are all experiencing with COVID-19 is awe-inspiring. This moment is as true a testament there is to the human spirit. We often speak of compassion. All of our lives are in some way affected by this, uniting each of us globally. How we approach each other and our communities with empathy and kindness is indisputably important right now. Over the coming weeks, this will be our guiding principle. We will be sharing information and resources to help all of us navigate the uncertainty: from posting accurate information and facts from trusted experts, to learning about measures we can take to keep ourselves and our families healthy, to working with organisations that can support our mental and emotional well-being. In addition, we will focus on the inspiring stories of how so many of you around the world are connecting in ways big and small to lift all of us up. We are all in this together, and as a global community we can support each other through this process \u2013 and build a digital neighbourhood that feels safe for every one of us. We look forward to sharing more over the days and weeks to come...</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> The Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> (@sussexroyal) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-03-18T15:17:29+00:00&quot;>Mar 18, 2020 at 8:17am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72d7d48f085c6327bc2b31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T02:27:16.468Z\">2.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Between <strong>400 and 500 foreigners are stranded in Panama</strong> after a \u201ctribal\u201d festival and music event ended with many of them being quarantined at the concert site near the Caribbean beach of Playa Chiquita, an organiser said Wednesday. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>At the same time, Panama\u2019s government announced that the <strong>number of coronavirus cases in the country had risen to 109</strong> and that a nighttime curfew would be imposed beginning Wednesday night. <br><br>James Baker of Manchester, England, said those attending the Tribal Gathering included people from Spain, Canada, the United States, Denmark, France, Britain and Hungary as well as Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. <br><br>Baker said authorities in Panama had instituted a requirement that <strong>all those seeking to leave had to prove they had been in Panama for at least 14 days</strong>.

The US has less than 950,000 hospital beds which is the equivalent of 2.8 per 1,000 people - a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">lower rate than China, South Korea and Italy.</a> </p> \n  <p>Almost 20% of the US population - or 49million people - are aged over 65. But as this varies hugely by county, it\u2019s important to know where they are, and where the beds are.</p> \n  <p>New research by <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/equity/hospital-access-seniors/\">Headwaters Economics </a>and <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-crowded-cities-and-lonely-country-see-your-countys-hospital-bed-capacity?utm_source=wcn1&amp;utm_medium=email\">High Country News </a>has found that 1.8 million people 65 years and older - or 4% of all US seniors - live in a county without a hospital. In addition, 86% of counties with no hospital beds have a higher than national average senior population; most of those counties are rural.</p> \n  <p>This snapshot, which uses data from the Department of Homeland Security and Commerce Department, is important as 10 to 20% of those who get infected with Covid-19 could require hospitalization, according to what we\u2019ve seen in Asia and Europe. The vast majority of these are elderly people and/or those with preexisting medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes or respiratory problems.</p> \n  <p>The research identifies stark deficiencies in some regions: over 570,000 people in 11 Western states live in counties without hospitals. The majority are in Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico and Oregon. Whereas in California\u2019s Riverside County, home to the popular retirement community of Palm Springs, there are 10 beds for every 1000 seniors - well above the national average.</p> \n  <p>But, surprisingly perhaps, while many rural communities have no nearby hospital, rural areas in the West actually have more hospital beds on average per person than urban areas.</p> \n  <p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-crowded-cities-and-lonely-country-see-your-countys-hospital-bed-capacity?utm_source=wcn1&amp;utm_medium=email\">here.</a><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73c2678f088d7575596bc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T19:09:53.359Z\">7.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Senator Lindsey Graham is trying to convince Trump to oppose direct payments in response to the coronavirus crisis, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1240709683792318464\">according to a Politico reporter</a>.</p> \n  <p>However, the <strong>Trump administration </strong>has expressed openness to the idea, which would be included in the third coronavirus response bill.</p> \n  <p>Treasury secretary <strong>Steven Mnuchin </strong>said this morning that he expected American families to start receiving payments within three weeks of the stimulus bill being passed by Congress.</p> \n  <p>Mnuchin said the administration was looking at providing $1,000 to American adults and $500 to children, so a family of four would receive $3,000. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73befb8f088d7575596b8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-glenza\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T18:52:39.143Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A researcher who spurred the United States and United Kingdom to action with dire coronavirus modeling has been diagnosed with Covid-19 himself.</p> \n  <p>Professor Neil Ferguson heads modeling at Imperial College London\u2019s MRC centre for global infectious disease analysis.

Thirteen elderly people at the same nursing centre died earlier this month.</p> <h2>Netflix to reduce streaming quality to ease internet pressure</h2> <p>Movies, TV episodes and other videos for Netflix users across Europe will temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/19/netflix-to-slow-europe-transmissions-to-avoid-broadband-overload\">have their quality reduced</a> to ease pressure on internet service providers.
