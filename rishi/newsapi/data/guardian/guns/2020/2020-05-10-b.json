If Social Security and Medicare taxes aren\u2019t taken out of paychecks, workers and businesses would take home a little more money with each paycheck. The idea is that workers benefiting from the cut would spend more money, which could help curb a recession.

We have been working with them looking at some of their safety plans.

If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen[t] on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in [California].\u201d</p> <p>Musk also claimed \u201cTesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not messing around,\u201d the billionaire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259261146009178112\">insisted</a>. \u201cAbsurd [and] medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties, moreover by unelected county officials with no accountability, needs to stop.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eb7fc3c8f08c0a2409bb0dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T13:15:28.773Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fauci will still appear before Senate despite quarantine</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Paula Reid of CBS, a reporter who has challenged Donald Trump publicly recently and gained a certain amount of fame as a result:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulaReidCBS/status/1259465418705719296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FAUCI UPDATE: WH still plans for Dr. Fauci &amp; Adm Giroir to appear in person before Senate Committee Tuesday, Fauci tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CBSNews</a> he will wear a mask &amp; socially distance.

  "<p>I know our mental bandwidth is currently taken up with managing life under pandemic conditions without the help of anyone who seems to know what they\u2019re doing, so let us lay out the conceit of BBC Two\u2019s new US import Dave as clearly as possibly.</p> <p>Dave is a comedy about Dave, a neurotic white Jewish rapper who goes by the name Lil Dicky (the show\u2019s creator and star is, as it happens, the white Jewish comedian Dave Burd, who raps under the name Lil Dicky). Real Dave became a YouTube sensation in 2013 when one of his songs went viral. He has parlayed this into a legitimate sitcom for the US cable channel FXX which has now reached our shores. Similarly, fictional Dave becomes a YouTube sensation when one of his songs goes viral, and he tries to parlay his success into a legitimate rap career. A lot of Dave (the series) is about Dave\u2019s (the character) penis. The first episode\u2019s opening scene is set in a doctor\u2019s office. There, Dave is explaining during an STI check up that he was born with \u201ca tangled urethra\u201d and the operations performed used his scrotum skin (\u201cYou know how it\u2019s like chicken skin?\u201d) to repair the shaft (\u201cSo my theory is that my dick is made of balls\u201d) and left much scarring. It is a situation we return to a lot.</p> <p>Burd has said in interviews that everything about Dave\u2019s penis is true. This presumably includes the further information disclosed in episode three (entitled \u201chypospadias\u201d \u2013 and I will save you the time and trouble here too: it\u2019s when the pee hole is located on the underside rather than tip of your Lil Urine Drainer.) Dave/presumably Burd has a further complication in that another surgery resulted in a secondary pee hole, too, which he has to cover with his finger whenever he goes for a wee. It is not absolutely clear whether \u201cLil Dicky\u201d or Lil Dicky (ie \u201cDave\u201d or Dave) actually has a small penis. I have done some research. I am not doing any more.</p> <p>If you think this is too much about penises I would recommend that you don\u2019t watch Dave. It is very funny about penises every time they are mentioned, but I accept that it\u2019s a lot of mentions.</p> <p>In the sitcom, as well as a scarred and over-perforated penis, Dave also has a girlfriend called Ally (Taylor Misiak, in an admirably well-written and developed part that gives her attitude and personality as well as the patience and understanding to deal with a man who won\u2019t let her see his penis, talk dirty in bed or believe that he will not become the greatest entertainer in history). There\u2019s also scabrous room mate (Andrew Santino), a best friend (Elz, with whom he has been pals since junior summer camp and who already has a toehold in the business as a sound engineer, played by Travis \u2018Taco\u2019 Bennett) and \u2013 by the end of the first episode a hype man, GaTa (Burd\u2019s real-life hype man who has been gigging with real-life Lil Dicky since the 2013 video).</p> <p>It\u2019s an ecstatically painful cringe-comedy that follows Dave\u2019s attempts to ingratiate himself with the true talents of the rap world. In among the gags it also manages to make some cogent and cutting points about race (Dave\u2019s obliviousness to his literal and metaphorical intrusionson the scene is white privilege writ large), class (witness the moment Elz, who is black, tries to argue with the \u2013 definitely economically disadvantaged GaTa \u2013 that Elz, too, is poor because only his dentist parents have money. \u201cAs soon as I left home \u2013 pfft!\u201d he insists), and masculinity. The last is perhaps least tangibly demonstrated, but there\u2019s definitely something to be learned from the story of a man who gets away with doing nothing for his girlfriend in bed, who can exploit his fears and weaknesses (\u201cIt\u2019s actually a super-intellectual commentary on hypermasculinity\u201d) for gain without anyone being able truly to assail him or dislodge his underlying self-confidence, and what it tells us about how easily winning comes to some.</p> <p>For all that it does this, though \u2013 while remaining properly, deeply funny throughout - Dave does feel like we are past the peak of manbaby comedy. The foundations on which its success was built are crumbling \u2013 social tolerances are lower, consciousnesses raised. More voices are coming. Maybe even some without penises! We\u2019ll see.</p>",

Instead of a road map, Johnson gave the nation a \u201csketch of a roadmap\u201d. Instead of a way ahead, he provided only a \u201csense of a way ahead\u201d. Instead of strong government leadership, the onus was on individuals to do the right thing and experts to provide the necessary data and technology.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be changed by this experience, the prime minister told us, but he provided no vision of the future, merely a list of comparative adjectives \u2013 stronger, better, more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, more generous, more sharing.</p> \n  <p>Many of these ambitions could imply action on the longer-term problems facing the country and the world, such as the climate crisis. Or they could mean nothing at all. There were no details of anything new and positive that could emerge from the colossal suffering of the pandemic as the NHS and United Nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war. There was no mention either of a green new deal, which other nations plan to use as a vehicle for economic recovery. Nor were there details of how air quality improvements could be maintained, though many city mayors in the UK are already working on this.</p> \n  <p>Johnson encouraged more cycling, walking and a continuation of working from home, but when that was not possible, he urged people to drive rather than to use public transport. This is sensible given the need for physical distancing on trains and buses, but it added to the overall impression of a prime minister reacting to necessity rather than getting ahead of problems, pre-empting risks and forging a path illuminated by the \u201clight of science\u201d.</p> \n  <p>There should be more details about the future direction of the economy in the coming days, when Johnson addresses parliament, or when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveils stimulus plans. If the prime minister is serious about the nation returning to \u201crobust health\u201d, the science is clear that climate, nature and air quality must be part of the recovery.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:28:01.620Z\">at 9.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb860498f08c0a2409bb384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:17:02.565Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM's message telling workers to return to factories is 'recipe for chaos', says TUC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s speech as \u201ca recipe for chaos\u201d because safety measures for a return to work are not in place.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/1259551752443002880\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lots of working people will feel confused and anxious after listening to Boris Johnson.<br> <br>Govt still hasn\u2019t published guidance on how workers will be kept safe.

This is putting extreme pressure on my colleagues who are on the frontline trying to enforce legislation in these most challenging of times.</p> \n   <p>What we need from the prime minister and the government now is clear and unambiguous messaging and guidance, explaining what exactly is expected of the public, so that my colleagues can do their level best to police it.</p> \n   <p>Police officers will continue to do their best, but their work must be based on crystal clear guidance, not loose rules that are left open to interpretation - because that will be grossly unfair on officers whose job is already challenging. If the message of what is expected of the public is not clear then it will make the job of policing this legislation almost impossible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:22:31.838Z\">at 9.22pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb83b5a8f0858b1a81077a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T19:52:19.835Z\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson's speech - A five-point analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> seems to like the idea of making a Gaullist address to the nation on evening TV. This was the second time he\u2019s done it during this crisis. But tonight\u2019s event had an unhappy prequel, with No 10 having to damp down expectations created by newspaper headlines suggesting he would be promising lockdown \u201cfreedom\u201d, and he was further constrained tonight by the fact that much of the detail of what he is planning won\u2019t come until he presents his document to parliament tomorrow.</p> \n  <p>Still, it was a major speech. Here is a five-point analysis.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson offered a highly-conditional timetable for moving out of the most stringent aspects of lockdown while also stressing that most current restrictions need to remain in place</strong>. In terms of announcements that were genuinely new (in the sense that they had not been widely pre-briefed), what was most significant was what he said about what might happen in June and July. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.</p> \n   <p>Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n   <p>And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Johnson also stressed that these dates were \u201cdependent on a series of big ifs\u201d and, compared to other lockdown plans, this timetable was remarkably cursory. The Irish government, for example, has published a<a href=\"https://www.gov.ie/en/news/58bc8b-taoiseach-announces-roadmap-for-reopening-society-and-business-and-u/\"> \u201croadmap for reopening society and business\u201d</a> that proposes a five-phase easing of restrictions, with specific measures planned of five specific dates going up to 10 August. According to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-lockdown-to-last-three-more-weeks-62z2brv36\">a report in the Times last week (paywall)</a>, Johnson was under pressure from \u201cdatists\u201d in cabinet to give dates for when certain measures would be relaxed. On the basis of this speech, the \u201cdatists\u201d secured only to the bare minimum.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has actually toughened the lockdown much more than he has eased it.</strong> The most significant change to the status quo came when he confirmed reports that people arriving in the UK by air will be subject to quarantine. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5#block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5\"> 7.14pm.)</a> That is a remarkable shift, particularly for someone who gave a speech earlier this year saying he wanted to resist pressure for barriers to go up. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed#block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed\">6.30pm.) </a>Johnson also said that he would increase the fines for the small number of people who break social distancing rules. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4#block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4\">7.11pm.)</a> This will be an England-only measure, and it appears to go against the advice of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. As was revealed this afternoon (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3#block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3\">4.56pm)</a>, in response to a proposal in April for greater penalties on lockdown offenders, Sage said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The \u201ccareful\u201d steps to ease the lockdown this week announced as new measures in practice amounted to little more than saying that sunbathing is allowed, in England. </strong>Johnson said two things would be happening this week. First, people would be encouraged to go to work if they cannot work from home. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But for most of the last seven weeks the government\u2019s line has been that people should go to work if they can\u2019t work from home. When the government first announced the lockdown it put out guidance saying \u201call non-essential premises must now close\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-pmqs-boris-johnson-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-recess?page=with:block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24#block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24\">this line was swiftly removed from the document</a> because it was not the message the government wanted to give out. And ministers infuriated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, by refusing to back his call for all construction work to halt.</p> \n  <p>Second, Johnson said that from Wednesday people would be able to take more exercise. Referring to England, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.</p> \n   <p>You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, unlike in Scotland and Wales, in England the lockdown restrictions never said that people could only go out once a day for exercise (even though ministers sometimes said people should exercise just once a day). And<a href=\"https://www.college.police.uk/What-we-do/COVID-19/Documents/What-constitutes-a-reasonable-excuse.pdf\"> official police guidance (pdf)</a> said people could drive to another destination to exercise. All that really seems to be new is that people can sunbath (not something that previously seemed to count as a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be out under the regulations).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson announce a new five-step covid alert system that will be used to help decide when lockdown measures can be lifted.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf#block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf\">7.07pm.)</a> This seems very similar to an approach announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, <a href=\"https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/04/23/statement-by-president-cyril-ramaphosa-on-south-africas-response-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-union-buildings-tshwane/\">in a speech last month.</a> Here is the South African system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db/0_0_1498_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"821\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South African government</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But Johnson did not explain which lockdown measures will apply for which alert level. (Perhaps there will be more detail in the document being published tomorrow.) He also said changes to the alert level will be triggered primarily by changes to R, the reproduction number (which shows the coronavirus infectivity rate). But all he could say about R was that it was between 0.5 and 0.9.

Over the last three months (like most politicians, and even many scientists), he has had to drastically revise his assessment of the threat it poses and what needs to be done. </p> \n  <p>Here are nine quotes that show how much his stance has changed.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 Johnson says he won\u2019t let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</strong> One of his first public references to coronavirus came in a speech devoted to Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">at Greenwich on 3 February</a>, when he said he would not let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And in that context, we are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion, of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is somewhat hard to square with the news that Johnson is now planning to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK, although this is a public health policy, not a trade policy.</p> \n  <p><strong>2 Johnson avoids being alarmist as he publishes the government\u2019s first coronavirus action plan.</strong> The document was published on 3 March, when Johnson attended a press conference with Sir Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/03/labour-facing-one-of-worst-local-election-performances-in-recent-history-leaked-party-report-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b#block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b\">Johnson stressed that most people had no need to fear the illness.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>3 Johnson calls for a balanced approach.</strong> Two days later, on 5 March, Johnson told ITV\u2019s This Morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">at that point it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d.</a> He also said the government was going for a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance.</p> \n   <p>I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In fact no one in the UK was saying the government should just \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, but at that point government advisers were telling ministers that if they tried to suppress coronavirus completely, they would just risk a worse second peak later in the herd. A more balanced approach would allow \u201cherd immunity\u201d to develop, they argued.</p> \n  <p><strong>4 Johnson changes tone, and warns that \u201cmany more\u201d people will die.</strong><em> </em>At another Downing Street press conference, on 12 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630#block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630\">he said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was also the moment when Johnson said<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796#block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796\"> the government was no longer trying to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus</a> and had instead moved to the stage where it was focusing on \u201cdelay\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>5 Johnson tells people to stay at home if possible.</strong> With the crisis intensifying, at the first of what No 10 said would be daily press conferences, Johnson announced on 16 March what amounted to a soft lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/16/boris-johnson-press-conference-coronavirus-live-firms-could-soon-be-allowed-to-run-reduced-services-because-of-coronavirus-shapps-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1#block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1\">He said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need people to start working from home where they possibly can.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine \u2013 and you should do this as little as you can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>7 Johnson himself then went down with coronavirus, and he ended up in hospital, where he spent three nights in intensive care.</strong> On leaving hospital he recorded <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-12/coronavirus-prime-minister-boris-johnson-s-easter-sunday-message-in-full/\">an Easter Sunday message</a> (the resurrection video) in which he movingly described how he had come close to death, thanked the nurses who had looked after him, and paid tribute to the contribution of the public. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset - our National Health Service.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>8 On 27 April, on his first day back at work in Downing Street after his recuperation, Johnson says that preparations to ease the lockdown have been under way for weeks, but that the government will proceed cautiously.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2#block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2\">He said: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity.

It is a meeting note, dated 1 April, prepared for a Sage meeting on 2 April.</p> \n  <p>The newly released material is everything from point 3, starting with the headline: \u201cSpecific comments about new suggestions for improving adherence within the Framework (27 March)\u201d. It shows Sage rejected three proposals to toughen the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The framework proposes four new suggestions for increasing adherence, numbered as options 17 to 20 that SPI-B have not commented on before. These focus on: 17) increasing the financial penalties imposed; 18) introducing self-validation for movements; 19) reducing exercise and/or shopping; 20) reducing non-home working. We have reservations about options 17 to 19. </p> \n   <p>First, we are unclear what the evidence base is that the targeted behaviours are a substantial contribution to disease transmission, particularly given the high adherence rates currently observed in the community. Is there evidence, for example, that exercise conducted more than 1km away from the house leads to higher rates of transmission than exercise conducted within 1km of the house? Indeed, for this option, there is a risk that reducing the ability of people to apply some flexibility in choosing where to exercise will increase risk by preventing people from spreading out in nearby open space. Tightening restrictions without clear epidemiological need may lose support among people who have been attempting to adhere.</p> \n   <p>Second, the implicit assumption underlying options 17 to 19 is that people lack motivation to adhere to current guidance. This may apply to some specific subgroups (the example of young men has been given), but broadly the current levels of adherence we are witnessing suggest this is not the issue. </p> \n   <p>Third, there are equity issues within options 17 to 19. Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households, while the assumption that printing and completing paperwork is straightforward for all households can also be challenged. The assumption underlying restrictions on shopping frequency is that people can afford to buy in larger quantities.

  "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Ten people were arrested on Sunday and a police officer was injured after protests against Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in Victoria. </strong>More than 100 demonstrators gathered in Melbourne\u2019s CBD to protest against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">\u201cself-isolating, social distancing, tracking apps and 5G being installed\u201d</a>. The protest, which was promoted on various Facebook groups linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and anti-vaxxers, featured signs about China and the Murray-Darling basin. People also chanted: \u201cArrest Bill Gates.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said there is a lot of \u201cvery silly misinformation\u201d out there, such as that the 5G network spreads the virus. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p><strong>Anthony Albanese will use a speech on Monday to demand a post-Covid-19 recovery \u201cin which no one is left behind\u201d</strong> and there is no return to \u201cthe law of the jungle and unfettered market forces\u201d.<strong> </strong>As the political contest shifts from the public health response to economic recovery, the Labor leader will call on the government to bring forward infrastructure projects and increase investment in affordable housing. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we are still saying, \u2018We are all in this together,\u2019 after the lockdown has come to an end \u2013 and not just saying it; living up to that standard,\u201d Albanese will say. \u201cLet\u2019s not snap back to insecure work, to jobseekers stuck in poverty, to scientists being ignored.\u201d Albanese makes his speech as a new report from Deloitte Access Economics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/society-must-not-snap-back-to-insecure-work-and-poverty-after-coronavirus-crisis-albanese-says\">warns that national income next financial year could fall nearly $200bn short of predictions</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Donald Trump continued to fume over the Russia investigation on Sunday</strong>, more than a year after the special counsel Robert Mueller filed his report without recommending charges against the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">but only three days after the US justice department said it would drop its case</a> against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Trump used Twitter to accuse Barack Obama of the \u201cthe biggest political crime in US history\u201d. The tweet accompanied a conservative talkshow host\u2019s claim that Obama \u201cused his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. Since Flynn\u2019s acquittal, Trump has attacked journalists who reported on the events leading to what he describes as \u201cthe impeachment scam\u201d. Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia in his inquiry but did lay out extensive links with Moscow and instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<p><strong>A new Australian green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in regional areas reliant on coalmining, according to a report by the

  "<p>Boris Johnson urged the country to take its first tentative steps out of lockdown this week in an address to the nation that was immediately condemned as being divisive, confusing and vague.</p> \n<p>In a speech from Downing Street, Johnson said if the circumstances were right, schools in England and some shops might be able to open next month, and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work if they cannot do so from home.</p> \n<p>But he stressed that this was \u201cnot the time simply to end the lockdown\u201d and that he intended to take a cautious approach guided by the science, otherwise a second deadly wave of the \u201cdevilish\u201d virus would take hold.</p> \n<p>But his remarks drew criticism and concern from across the political spectrum \u2013 and his decision to drop the \u201cstay at home\u201d message in favour of advice to \u201cstay alert\u201d was met with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\">chorus of disapproval from the leaders of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales</a>.</p> \n<p>Though he gave no details, Johnson explained his blueprint for a gradual easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/10/boris-johnsons-plans-for-primary-schools-prompt-concern-among-unions\">could see primary schools, shops and nurseries partially reopening</a> from 1 June, while some cafes or restaurants with outdoor space, plus places or worship and socially distanced cinemas, could return to business from July.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He also said more outdoor activity will be allowed in England from this Wednesday, including unlimited exercise, trips to beauty spots such as beaches and national parks, and sport such as angling, golf and tennis, as long as they are kept to household groups.</p> \n<p>People will also be allowed to meet one other member of another household at a time outdoors, either while exercising or sitting down, according to government sources.</p> \n<p>Johnson said he would only start reopening the economy if the pandemic is clearly under control, but his call for people to get back to their workplaces led to immediate condemnation from trade unions worried about the safety of their work.</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer said the prime minister \u201cappears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work tomorrow\u201d without the necessary guidance.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t got the guidelines, and we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to work with public transport so there\u2019s a huge number of questions arising out of this,\u201d the Labour leader added.</p> \n<p>Workers were urged not to use public transport where possible, but cars, walking or bikes instead \u2013 in advice that will be impossible to follow for many.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/calendar-zip/giv-39022o1EibiZSseO\" data-alt=\"Calendar\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/calendar-zip/giv-39022o1EibiZSseO\">Calendar</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s decision to loosen the lockdown also led to a breakdown in the UK\u2019s \u201cfour nation\u201d approach to dealing with coronavirus, with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refusing to replace the \u201cstay home\u201d messaging\u201d with Johnson\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan.</p> \n<p>Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, said dropping the \u201cstay home\u201d message could have \u201ccatastrophic\u201d consequences north of the border and ordered Scots to follow different advice on outdoors exercise.</p> \n<p>This will be unlimited but there must be \u201cno sunbathing, picnics or barbecues\u201d, she said, in contrast to Johnson\u2019s new advice. She said the new \u201cstay alert\u201d message was too \u201cvague and imprecise\u201d to be used.</p> \n<p>Sturgeon told BBC Scotland Johnson needed to be much clearer that his proposed easing of the lockdown only related to England.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mark Drakeford, first minister of Wales, emphasised that the country\u2019s stay-at-home advice \u201chas not changed\u201d. He announced on Friday that Wales will allow more frequent exercise and the opening of garden centres, but said schools will not reopen from 1 June.</p> \n<p>Johnson will set out further details of his approach to parliament on Monday, publishing a document that will set out a roadmap for reopening the economy. This is likely to include ambitions for:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Shops and primary schools to return from 1 June, starting with reception, year one and year six. It is understood he would also want nurseries and other early years providers to return at the earliest opportunity.</p></li> \n <li><p>Secondary school pupils sitting exams next year to be given an opportunity to see their teachers before the end of term but there are no plans for other secondary pupils to return to school before the next school year.</p></li> \n <li><p>Some of the hospitality industry and other public places to reopen \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d. He was not specific about which hospitality venues could reopen but it is understood that it means a return for cafes and restaurants with outdoor space that can enforce social distancing, rather than pubs, even ones with beer gardens.</p></li> \n <li><p>People in England to be allowed to sit in parks within their household groups, to drive to beauty spots for walks and take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.

  "<p>Boris Johnson famously dislikes disappointing the people around him.</p> \n<p>The result is this weekend\u2019s barrage of confused messaging over whether the lockdown is ending, as he tries to please both sides in the battle raging within the Tory party about how to respond to the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, the rightwing hawks in his cabinet have been pushing him towards a swift return to business as usual to save the economy, setting out a roadmap to lifting the lockdown sooner rather than later. On the other, the more centrist doves, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have been pulling him in another direction, urging caution for fear of a second peak and more lost lives.</p> \n<p>The received wisdom is that Johnson is now on the side of the doves following his brush with death during a four-day spell in intensive care suffering from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The start of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-details-first-careful-steps-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown\"> his address on Sunday</a> was cautious: he insisted that there was \u201cno immediate end to the lockdown\u201d and would allow only a gradual shift to unlimited exercise within household groups from Wednesday.</p> \n<p>However, his overall shift in tone, ditching the \u201cstay at home\u201d message in favour of a \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan, told a different story. That new message appears designed to appease some of his critics within the Conservatives \u2013 mostly on the Brexit-backing libertarian right of the party, who want to see more emphasis on people being trusted to take their own decisions about risk.</p> \n<p>The decision to set out an ambition to reopen schools and some shops in June and some hospitality venues in July \u2013 without the epidemic in care homes and hospitals yet under control \u2013 also shows he has also been swayed by the hawks in his cabinet.</p> \n<p>And a renewed emphasis on asking people to get back to work, even if they cannot observe social distancing, is another move that will please Tory MPs worried about the furlough scheme \u2013 while alarming trade unions concerned about the safety of their workforces.</p> \n<p>It is clear from the scathing reaction of Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, that there are serious worries in the devolved administrations about the risk of lifting the lockdown too soon and the chaotic messaging that is accompanying it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Supporters of Johnson argue that he is trying to strike a careful balance between setting out a roadmap for reopening the economy and making no promises about exactly when schools, shops, cafes and restaurants would reopen.</p> \n<p>He insisted that the government would ultimately be \u201cdriven not by mere hope or economic necessity, [but] \u2026 [by] the science, the data and public health\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, sooner or later Johnson is going to have to pick a side in the argument over whether the threat of a crashing economy requires taking some risks with public health \u2013 unless the epidemic starts to clear more quickly than scientists anticipate.</p> \n<p>And in the meantime, the public has been left with some of the biggest questions unanswered \u2013 especially about when they will be able to freely see their family and friends again.</p>",

  "<p>It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2013 your freedom \u2013 of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it\u2019s the only way to defeat the coronavirus \u2013 the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.</p> \n<p>And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense, and though we grieve for all those we have lost, it is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst-case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> and saved many thousands of lives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And so I know \u2013 you know \u2013 that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike.</p> \n<p>We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.</p> \n<p>And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children.</p> \n<p>So I want to provide tonight \u2013 for you \u2013 the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening.</p> \n<p>I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates, and though it is right to be flexible in our response, I believe that as prime minister of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress \u201ccould\u201d. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>We must protect our NHS.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must see sustained falls in the death rate.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people<br>who need it, and yes, it is a global problem, but we must fix it.</p></li> \n <li><p>And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease \u2013 the R \u2013 back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid alert system run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.</p> \n<p>And that Covid alert level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid alert level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures \u2013 the lower the level, the fewer the measures; the higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.</p> \n<p>There will be five alert levels. Level one means the disease is no longer present in the UK and level five is the most critical \u2013 the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>Over the period of the lockdown, we have been in level four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level three.</p> \n<p>And as we go, everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down, there are two more things we must do.</p> \n<p>We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done.</p> \n<p>And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that \u2013 all told \u2013 we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day.</p> \n<p>We have made fast progress on testing, but there is so much more to do now, and we can.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>When this began, we hadn\u2019t seen this disease before, and we didn\u2019t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes, because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups \u2013 in your area \u2013 as well as giving us a national picture.</p> \n<p>And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given, we have by no means fulfilled all of them.</p> \n<p>And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.</p> \n<p>And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week.</p> \n<p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n<p>And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible \u2013 because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can\u2019t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces Covid-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following Covid-secure standards.</p> \n<p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports, but only with members of your own household.</p> \n<p>You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.</p> \n<p>And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.</p> \n<p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, year 1 and year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n<p>And step three \u2013 at the earliest by July \u2013 and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice: if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n<p>Throughout this period of the next two months, we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.</p> \n<p>And I must stress again that all of this is conditional \u2013 it all depends on a series of big ifs. It depends on all of us \u2013 the entire country \u2013 to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.</p> \n<p>And to prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time \u2013 with transmission significantly lower \u2013 to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/calendar-zip/giv-39022o1EibiZSseO\" data-alt=\"Calendar\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/calendar-zip/giv-39022o1EibiZSseO\">Calendar</a> \n</figure> \n<p><br>And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally, and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.</p> \n<p>We have been through the initial peak, but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already \u2013 the patience and common sense you have shown; the fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can; the incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers; the devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease \u2013 police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more; the scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine; when I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country, and that have helped to get us through this first phase, I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. </p> \n<p>And if we can\u2019t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won\u2019t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right.</p> \n<p>We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before. More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing.</p> \n<p>But for now, we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives.</p> \n<p>Thank you very much.</p>",

  "<p>Fifteen years ago I was waiting by a red light when a dishevelled-looking cyclist, blond mop-top untamed by comb or helmet, pootled past without pausing. A couple of minutes later, the same thing happened again. Yes, it was Boris Johnson. And yes, he had form for this sort of thing \u2013 at one point he was filmed jumping through six red lights and a pedestrian crossing <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-565882/Caught-camera-The-film-shows-Boris-Johnson-cycling-red-lights-failing-stop-zebra-crossing-AND-mounting-pavement.html\">during one ride</a>.

Over the weekend the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, pledged \u00a32bn towards plans to double the number of cyclists and walkers by 2025 while also telling local authorities to make \u201csignificant changes\u201d to give them more space. There were even hints of changes to the law so that motor vehicles would be automatically at fault if they hit a cyclist unless they can prove otherwise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/back-to-work-capacity-of-transport-network-will-be-down-by-90\">Back to work: 'capacity of transport network will be down by 90%'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is certainly the stirring of something radical here: of money and political will unlocking doors campaigners thought would remain welded for ever. Of Britain \u2013 dare one say it \u2013 becoming more like our European neighbours.</p> <p>But it is only a start. Much more needs to be done \u2013 not simply when it comes to investment and infrastructure but attitudes, too. Dr Rachel Aldred has calculated that per hour spent cycling, cyclists in England are around four times more likely to be killed than in the Netherlands. No wonder many potential converts feel afraid. It doesn\u2019t help when many bike journeys involve at least one close encounter of the four-wheeled kind. Or when influential groups, such as the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, attack cycling campaigners wanting safer roads as the \u201cIsis of London\u201d.</p> <p>However <a href=\"https://adamtranter.com/\">Coventry\u2019s bicycle mayor, Adam Tranter</a>, is cautiously optimistic. \u201cIt is clear that it has come from the top, with Johnson and his transport adviser Andrew Gilligan leading it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, the government\u2019s own analysis shows that to meet their goals of doubling cycling and walking they will need \u00a36bn.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f80bc21234b0e336bffc49d005a17f7a0d768061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f80bc21234b0e336bffc49d005a17f7a0d768061/0_169_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The government is to give \u00a3250m for extra cycle lanes as the UK prepares for the lifting of lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The government is to give \u00a3250m for extra cycle lanes as the UK prepares for the lifting of lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tranter says the long-term goal must be for bikes to be seen as just another normal form of transport \u2013 so the quarter of journeys made by cars in Britain that are under one mile comes down significantly. \u201cBritain\u2019s cycling revolution will be created by people of all backgrounds and sizes, in jeans and a T-shirt, and at about 9mph. It shouldn\u2019t be the likes of Team Ineos\u2019s Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas telling people to #GetPedalling that lead the change but ordinary people.\u201d</p> <p>It might help, too, if governments felt less shy in hammering home a simple fact: that exercise is a magic pill we should all take every day. Not only does it enhance mental and physical health but, as the US surgeon general made clear in a 278-page report published in the 1990s, exercise is also a vital component in preventive medicine \u2013 especially when it comes to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and colon cancer.</p> <p>Perhaps a new academic paper, Covid-19: A tocsin to our ageing, unfit, corpulent, and immunodeficient society, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254620300600?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email\">by the scientist David C Nieman</a>, might focus minds. Nieman, who helped to establish that regular moderate exercise lowers upper respiratory tract infection rates while improving immunosurveillance, makes the point that reducing the risk for Covid-19 for communities and individuals shouldn\u2019t only involve what we know already \u2013 physical distancing, washing hands and covering faces \u2013 but \u201cregular moderate-intensity physical activity\u201d, too.</p> <p>In his article, published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science, Nieman points out that regular aerobic exercise \u201csimilar to 30\u201360min of near-daily brisk walking improves overall surveillance against pathogens by stimulating the ongoing exchange of important types of white blood cells between the circulation and tissues\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile epidemiological and randomised clinical trials \u201csupport a 40%\u201345% reduction in illness days stemming from acute respiratory infections in younger and older adults who engage in near-daily aerobic activity compared to sedentary behavior\u201d.</p> <p>Regular exercise also guards against obesity, which as Nieman makes clear \u201cmarkedly increases the risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three of the most important underlying conditions for Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>In the past decade governments of all stripes have been reluctant to talk about the dangers of inactivity. Those on the left are perhaps worried they could be accused of fat shaming; those on the right of nanny-statism. There is no hiding from the truth \u2013 a few years ago a study in the Lancet put the global death toll from inactive lifestyles at around 5.3 million people a year, about the same as from tobacco.</p> <p>Yet the science is crystal clear: exercising for 30 minutes every day is a far better way to help the NHS than clapping for two minutes every Thursday.</p> <p>Meanwhile last week Johnson suggested this \u201cshould be a new golden age for cycling\u201d. If those words are matched with enough real change it may just be one promise the prime minister can keep.</p>",

is expected to intensify scrutiny of Scott Morrison and his ministry \u2013 including over gaps in the government\u2019s Covid-19 support packages and <a

minister\u2019s office in the sports grants saga</a>.</p> <p>Albanese will say the Labor party has an obligation to hold the government to account. \u201cThe enormity of government expenditure approved in recent months makes it an imperative,\u201d he will say.</p> <p>Morrison has nominated July as an \u201caspiration\u201d for all states and territories to work their way through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/scott-morrison-details-australias-three-step-path-out-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">national cabinet\u2019s three-step plan to ease restrictions on social and economic activity</a> and said he hoped it would build confidence.</p> <p>The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is set to update parliament on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-to-cost-4bn-a-week-in-reduced-economic-activity-treasurer\">vast fiscal and economic impacts of the crisis</a>.</p> <p>But in its latest \u201cbudget monitor\u201d released on Monday, Deloitte Access Economics estimates the underlying cash deficit could be $143bn this financial year and $132bn in the next.</p> <p>The report argues rapid budget repair would be \u201cmisguided\u201d and there is a need to accept a further period of higher deficits, in part to fund more infrastructure spending.</p> <p>It is understood the government sees the next federal budget \u2013 delayed until October \u2013 as a chance to unveil a raft of \u201cpro-investment policies\u201d to grow the economy, amid calls from some business groups for corporate tax cuts and a more flexible workplace relations system.</p> <p>But Albanese will call for a focus on inclusive economic growth where the benefits are shared, together with an industrial relations system that promotes co-operation, productivity improvements and shared benefits.</p> <p>He will also say policy makers need to look at increasing opportunities for people to gain secure employment, \u201cespecially for the next generation of younger workers who nowadays have little idea of the meaning of reliable income or holiday pay\u201d.</p> <p>More generally, Albanese describes the post-Covid-19 debate as a \u201conce-in-a-century opportunity to renew and revitalise the federation\u201d and a \u201conce-in-a-generation chance to reshape our economy so it works for people and deepens the meaning of a fair go\u201d.</p> <p>He will tentatively weigh into the emerging debate over the balance between free trade and building up domestic capacities.</p> <p>He says Australia must continue to trade, but the pandemic is a reminder of the need to secure critical supply chains in the face of global shocks.</p> <p>While the downturn was triggered by a disease, he argues, it could just as easily have been sparked by a trade war, cyber attack or military standoff, adding that the \u201cmad scramble for items as simple as personal protective equipment for our frontline medical staff\u201d should be a wakeup call.</p> <p>Albanese says the death of the Australian car manufacturing industry on the Coalition\u2019s watch had led to a withdrawal of private capital from research and development, the depletion of critical skills, and the destruction of the viability of smaller manufacturers further down the supply chain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

  "<p>Thank goodness for video, and the various pieces of software that let people talk to each other face to face during lockdown.

In a matter of weeks, organisations from big businesses to universities and campaign groups have found ways of doing what they do (or some of it) remotely. Plenty of people still rely on phone calls, emails or messaging apps. But for those separated from relatives and friends as well as colleagues, and especially people who are alone or isolated, video calls have provided a lifeline. Some families have relied on them to keep in touch with those being treated for Covid-19 in hospital.</p> <p>With busy commuter trains and venues of all kinds likely to remain unattractive, if not entirely off limits, for some time, tech enthusiasts promote the idea of the home office and virtual hangout as the new normal. To some extent, they are probably right. The pandemic has sent us hurtling into a future that was already on its way to meet us, via a younger generation <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/video-conferencing-now-more-popular-than-email\" title=\"\">already much more habituated to screen life</a>.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean such changes have to be accepted, let alone embraced. Zoom\u2019s chief executive was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52133349\" title=\"\">forced to apologise</a> for the company\u2019s lax approach to data and promised to address security and privacy concerns as a matter of urgency.

Not everyone has the equipment, broadband connections or physical space in their home to make virtual work and study possible. Much tighter regulation of technology companies, particularly in their dealings with children, is long overdue. Crucial aspects of communication \u2013 body language, physical companionship \u2013 cannot be replicated online.</p> <p>In countries where the virus was effectively controlled, lockdowns are being eased, with gatherings of up to 100 to be allowed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/new-zealand-halfway-down-everest-as-ardern-plans-big-easing-of-covid-lockdown\" title=\"\">New Zealand</a> as soon as this week. In the UK, by contrast, most people must continue to rely on technology to keep in touch.</p> <p>More virtual business meetings, and fewer flights, would reduce carbon emissions. Remote and flexible employment suits some jobs and people. Whether or not video technology should play a larger role in our lives must be thought about, while the companies behind it are subjected to scrutiny. But the more pertinent question is when the virus will be brought under control. Video conferences are useful, but they are no substitute for real people.</p>",

Throughout the week there was a noticeably less cautious mood on the streets of German cities, with clusters of people once again dotting parks to share drinks in the sunshine.</p> <p>In cities including Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart, demonstrators \u2013 including rightwing extremists and anti-vaxxers \u2013 gathered in their thousands on Saturday, protesting against lockdown restrictions that are already being rapidly loosened.</p> <p>The wearing of hygiene masks, while now mandatory in shops and on public transport, is not consistently policed, and often only casually adhered to.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the empirical findings of the Robert Koch Institute, the government\u2019s disease control agency, seemed to match the anecdotal evidence that many people had gathered over the past few days.</p> <p>The RKI announced on Sunday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">the reproduction number (R)</a>, indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, had for two consecutive days risen above the critical threshold of one, to 1.1.

The R number is an estimate that deliberately ignores lag-prone data from the last three days and backdates known cases to their likely day of infection, around a week earlier.</p> <p>Rising R numbers over the weekend therefore do not indicate how the spread of the virus developed following this week\u2019s lockdown relaxation, though it could account for a new mood in the country following the first step of relaxation on 20 April.</p> <p>The RKI itself urged caution on the latest R number \u2013 since new infections in Germany have dropped to relatively low figures, it said, the estimate was more prone to statistical fluctuations.</p> <p>Other mathematicians analysing the spread of the pandemic also believe they are witnessing a new dynamic, however. \u201cThere are signs that the reproduction number is going back up again,\u201d said Prof Thomas Hotz of Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, <a href=\"https://stochastik-tu-ilmenau.github.io/COVID-19/germany\">which has used a differently weighted model</a>. Hotz added: \u201cAnd if you see how people have started acting in the big cities, it doesn\u2019t completely surprise me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902uar9sXnuYqel/\" data-alt=\"Covid-19 infections in Germany\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902uar9sXnuYqel/\">Covid-19 infections in Germany</a> </figure>  <p>There is some positive news among the latest negative numbers. The number of active cases in Germany on Sunday sank to 17,423, now making up only 10% of confirmed cases in the country, meaning if the virus is indeed accelerating again, it is doing so from a considerably smaller and more controllable base than a month ago.</p> <p>Under the new emergency mechanism Merkel announced last week, hospitals, care homes or entire municipalities can be put under lockdown if they cumulatively register more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days.</p> <p>By the weekend, only three German municipalities were in breach of this new limit: one in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, one in eastern Thuringia, and one in western North-Rhine Westphalia.</p> <p>The hope is that the new, more localised braking system can prove an efficient replacement for a nationwide lockdown and slow down the spread of the virus before it grows into a second wave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

  "<p><br>Angered by police entrapment operations after the murder of a gay actor in a west London park, LGBT activists set up the protest group OutRage! 30 years ago this week.</p> <p>The campaign \u2013 which involved mass kiss-ins, invasion of police stations, disruption of the archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s Easter sermon and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/17/helencarter\">citizen\u2019s arrest of Robert Mugabe</a> as he went Christmas shopping \u2013 helped transform equal rights in the UK.</p> <p>Decades after its launch, however, its leading figures are trying to establish whether they were targeted by undercover police who they believe infiltrated and undermined the campaign.</p> <p>The brutal kicking to death of Michael Boothe outside public toilets in Elthorne Park, Hanwell, on the night of 30 April 1990 sparked fury among LGBT rights activists.</p> <p>They resented the resources police dedicated to anti-gay operations and raids on public toilets long after homosexuality had been formally decriminalised. Boothe\u2019s murder remains unsolved to this day.</p> <p>On 10 May 1990, about 30 people met to create the movement that became OutRage! Prominent among the activists was Peter Tatchell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90b86a19d2bb088e6b3a5fa3180389e3772dfea7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90b86a19d2bb088e6b3a5fa3180389e3772dfea7/184_232_4658_6660/699.jpg\" alt=\"Outrage kiss-in demonstration in Piccadilly Circus.\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outrage kiss-in demonstration in Piccadilly Circus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A public meeting followed two weeks later at which a statement of aims featured the right to sexual freedom, an end to discrimination and preventing violent attacks on the gay and lesbian community. It also condemned homophobia which had become more prevalent following the 1980s Aids epidemic and the Conservatives\u2019 section 28 legislation that banned promotion of homosexuality.</p> <p>In June that year, OutRage! held its first rally outside Hyde Park public toilets, in protest against Metropolitan police entrapment operations targeting gay men. A mass kiss-in by same-sex couples, under the winged statue at Piccadilly Circus known as Eros, followed in protest at arrests for public displays of affection. One activist climbed up and embraced the sculpture.</p> <p>Many arrests were under 19th-century laws against \u201cindecency\u201d that were poorly defined and not finally repealed until 2003. Even the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860, which outlawed indecent behaviour, was pressed into service.</p> <p>OutRage! was the first UK organisation to call for same-sex marriage. In 1992, it arranged for five same-sex couples to arrive at Westminster register office. The registrar was alarmed to discover the ceremonies would not be outlawed by the 1949 Marriage Act and called the Home Office. She was reassured the prohibition did exist but was instead under the 1973 Matrimonial Causes Act.</p> <p>One high-profile action involved OutRage! activists \u2013 bearing posters declaring \u201cCarey backs gay marriage ban\u201d - <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/77536.stm\">taking over the pulpit</a> in Canterbury Cathedral on Easter Sunday 1998 during a sermon by George Carey, the then archbishop. They were arrested swiftly by police who had been in the congregation. Tatchell suspects they had been tipped off in advance by an informant inside the organisation.</p> <p>Mugabe was ambushed by OutRage! because his regime punished anyone committing homosexual acts with 10 years in prison. They halted his convoy as it was leaving the St James\u2019 Court Hotel in October 1999 and attempted to make a citizen\u2019s arrest on charges of torture. Officers intervened. \u201cMugabe was given a police escort to go Christmas shopping,\u201d Tatchell recalled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e808f1b74bef670bc1781eda1f26d1c890de3859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e808f1b74bef670bc1781eda1f26d1c890de3859/0_76_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Tatchell is attacked by Robert Mugabe\u2019s security guards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Tatchell being attacked by Robert Mugabe\u2019s security guards after a second attempt to make a citizen\u2019s arrest of the then Zimbabwean president, in Brussels in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Boucau/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outrage\u2019s last action was in 2011. \u201cWe achieved a lot of our aims,\u201d Tatchell said. \u201cThe policing campaign was extremely successful. Homophobic sexual offence laws were repealed. A 2007 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/15/gayrights.ukcrime\">report labelled the police institutionally homophobic</a>. Same-sex marriage has become law.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of our success was due to non-violent direct action and civil disobedience. It raised public awareness about anti-LGBT discrimination and put the state under pressure to speed up change. We partly modelled ourselves on the suffragettes and the black civil rights movement in the USA.\u201d</p> <p>Three decades on, Tatchell is now trying to find out the truth over police infiltration. \u201cWe know we were under surveillance and investigation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He has applied for core participant status at the undercover policing inquiry but been rejected.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been knocked back for no good reason,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIt is confirmed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/27/undercover-police-spied-on-more-than-1000-political-groups-in-uk\">police spied on 1,000 activist groups</a> but the inquiry won\u2019t say if OutRage! was one of them and it won\u2019t reveal the names and aliases of all the undercover cops. We need that information to determine if, when, how and by who we were infiltrated.\u201d</p> <p>His solicitor, Mike Schwarz of the law firm Hodge, Jones and Allen, has written to the inquiry asking to know whether or not \u201can \u2018RF\u2019 or special branch file was prepared on Peter Tatchell or one of the campaigns with which he was connected\u201d.</p> <p>Suspicion about the identity of the informer has fallen on one man, believed to have formerly served in the army, who claimed to have had military intelligence training and become disillusioned with the armed forces. The inquiry, however, has ruled that since there was no proof he had been a police officer, it would not investigate his role.</p> <p>Schwarz, who represents about 90 core participants at the undercover policing inquiry, said: \u201cPeter has been trying for around four years to have his concerns examined. I wrote to the inquiry last week asking them to review their refusal.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to show you were directly affected but it\u2019s very difficult given the secrecy of the inquiry over the identities, even cover names, of many of the officers. Peter believes he must have been targeted. But, for activists and their lawyers, it\u2019s like a game of battleships where you have to hit targets not knowing exactly what\u2019s there. It\u2019s immensely frustrating and unfair.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the significant advancement in LGBT rights since 1990, inquests still to be heard into the victims of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/25/serial-killer-stephen-port-jailed-for-life\">serial killer Stephen Port</a>, who drugged and murdered four young gay men in Barking, east London, are expected to show that police understanding of the gay community may still be limited.</p> <p>Port\u2019s victims were all drugged, raped and their bodies dumped. Despite the striking similarities in the murders, the Metropolitan police failed to link them until the family of his final victim forced officers to re-examine all the deaths.</p> <p>After Port was found guilty of murder in 2016, Commander Stuart Cundy, who leads the Met\u2019s specialist crime and operations command, said: \u201cAll I can say is from the evidence we\u2019ve heard at trial there were potential opportunities that were missed.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s pubs should have been heaving over the bank holiday weekend as the glorious sunny weather on Friday and Saturday lured drinkers to their favourite beer garden. </p> <p>Instead of enjoying a VE Day boost, 40% of publicans fear they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/thousands-uk-pubs-go-under-without-bailout-industry-warns-coronavirus-lockdown\">could go bust</a> due to a prolonged lockdown that has taken a greater toll on the industry than on almost any other.</p> <p>While there are hopes that pubs could reopen before the end of the summer as restrictions begin to ease, times in the industry are tighter than ever.</p> <p>Even before Covid-19 forced pubs to call time indefinitely, trouble was brewing. Many of the 9,126 proprietors who lease their premises from one of the UK\u2019s major pub companies, or pubcos, have been fighting to reform or abolish the \u201cbeer tie\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/oct/19/beer-tie-oft-pub-trade\">for years</a>.</p> <p>The tie, currently the subject of a regulatory review, is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/31/tied-up-pub-landlords-battle-law-that-was-meant-to-help-them\">ancient but controversial deal</a> under which pubs buy their beer at inflated prices from the business that owns their property. In exchange, supposedly, they pay lower rents.</p> <p>According to some publicans, the big pubcos have long exploited weaknesses in the tie to their own ends, trapping tenants in unfavourable terms that make it nigh on impossible to run the establishments at a profit. Now, with the excess strain placed on the industry, festering resentment is at risk of boiling over into a full-blown pub brawl.</p> <p>The bone of contention is that, despite the lockdown choking off publicans\u2019 source of income, nearly all of the major pub companies have refused to cancel rents, opting to defer their demands or offer a discounted rate instead.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just debt that we can\u2019t repay when we reopen,\u201d warned Edward Anderson, who runs three pubs in Cheltenham: the Railway, the Swan and the Vine.</p> <p>His landlords, the pubcos Marston\u2019s and Ei, have offered to postpone the rent bill, but he says that will not be enough. This is because rents are set based on a pub\u2019s \u201cfair, maintainable trade\u201d, in other words the turnover it expects to make in a year.</p> <p>But while takings have fallen off a cliff overnight, rent reassessments take place only every five years, meaning that when those rent demands resume, there will be less in the till to honour them with.</p> <p>\u201cWe need rent to be cancelled during the period,\u201d insisted Dave Law, who runs the Eagle Ale House near London\u2019s Clapham Common. \u201cWe\u2019re being forced to pay based on turnover that we can\u2019t make because of government decree. Rents are already inflated and when we come out of this, we\u2019re going to be in a recession.\u201d</p> <p>Like Anderson, he fears he won\u2019t be able to recoup his lockdown losses unless pubcos step up and share more of the pain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"569d7b5797e9a65f3da1a5150f59815566fe0361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/569d7b5797e9a65f3da1a5150f59815566fe0361/1111_546_3165_1899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Law behind the bar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Law behind the bar at the Eagle Ale House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/pubs-code-adjudicator\">Pubs Code Adjudicator</a>, which regulates the beer tie, has twice warned pub companies to make sure they are being \u201cfair\u201d to tenants. So far, the pleas have had little effect.</p> <p>There is some help at hand, in the form of the government\u2019s decision to waive business rates this year. Pubs below a certain size are also eligible for a grant of up to \u00a325,000 from the state to help them pay costs.</p> <p>The concern, though, is that as soon as they receive the money, publicans will simply be handing it straight over as rent to pubcos who ought to be better able to take a financial hit. That would leave publicans dipping into their own savings \u2013 if they have them \u2013 to pay other costs.</p> <p>One pub-owning firm, Admiral Taverns, has broken ranks with its peers. On 21 March, it cancelled all rent until the end of April. After that, pubs that don\u2019t receive any government support will remain free of rent. Any that do receive help will be asked to hand over only a small percentage of it as rent, in most cases less than half of what they would ordinarily pay.</p> <p>A spokesperson said the aim was to help pubs recover from the pandemic \u201cnot weighed down by debt and fear about the future\u201d. But Admiral is the only one of the big six pubcos to take this step, and the other players in the sector are taking a tougher stance.</p> <p>Punch Taverns, Ei Group, Star Pubs &amp; Bars, Greene King and Marston\u2019s all told the Guardian that they were taking steps to help pubs that needed it. In some cases this could involve rent reductions. None, though, have taken a blanket decision to cancel rents altogether. Instead, some have taken measures that have enraged their tenants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"453f457d1e0fb3597d704dbec8d35bb4854c5a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/453f457d1e0fb3597d704dbec8d35bb4854c5a66/0_163_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A London pub boarded up during the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A London pub boarded up during the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British Pub Confederation declared itself \u201cappalled\u201d at a letter sent by Heineken-owned Star Pubs &amp; Bars to its tenants.

They would also lose the discount, they were told, if they revealed the terms of the agreement.</p> <p>A Star spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already written to clarify the content of the letter regarding rent reductions with our licensees, confirming they don\u2019t have to pay any of their reduced rent until June or when pubs reopen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), the pub industry\u2019s trade body, has warned that thousands of pubs could go out of business unless the government extends financial support until they can reopen.</p> <p>But the BBPA, backed as it is by the major pubcos, had less to say about rents. \u201cRent is a commercial decision and the BBPA does not advise its members on commercial decisions,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Publicans, typically a cynical bunch, won\u2019t be surprised.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s something profound about the irony. The world\u2019s highest coronavirus death tolls belong to two countries whose leaders came to power promising the restoration of greatness and control \u2013 the United States and Great Britain. Neither can claim to have been caught by surprise: both nations had the benefit of time, ample scientific warnings, and the cautionary examples of China and Italy.</p> <p>The similarities are striking, the conclusions unavoidable. Here in the UK, we comforted ourselves with the belief that while our own buffoonish rightwing leader had his faults, at least he was no Donald Trump. But in the end, Boris Johnson has managed to stumble over even this lowest of hurdles. The UK government\u2019s response to the crisis has turned out to be nearly as flippant and ill-prepared as the US\u2019s.</p> <p>Two nations that prided themselves on their extraordinary economic, historical and political status have been brought to their knees. Their fall from grace is the outcome of a damaged political culture and distinct form of Anglo-American capitalism.</p> <p>Over the past four years, reckless political decisions were justified by subordinating reality to rhetoric. The cost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-hell-brexit-promoters-most-likely-burn\">leaving the EU</a> would be \u201cvirtually nil\u201d, with a free trade agreement that would be one of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/20/liam-fox-uk-eu-trade-deal-after-brexit-easiest-human-history\">easiest in human history</a>\u201d. Imaginary enemies were erected and fake fights confected as both countries pugnaciously went about severing their ties with other nations and international institutions.</p> <p>Political discourse focused on grand abstract notions of rebirth and restoration, in a way that required few concrete deliverables. All the Tory government needed to do was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/06/boris-johnson-pledges-to-get-brexit-done-within-weeks-of-re-election-video\">Get Brexit Done</a>, no matter how slapdash the job. In the US, all Trump needed to do to maintain his supporters\u2019 loyalty was bark about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/construction-us-mexico-border-wall-coronavirus-pandemic\">wall with Mexico</a> every now and then, pass a racist travel ban, and savage various public figures for sport.</p> <p>This is corrosive stuff \u2013 not only to the quality of public debate, but to the calibre of politicians. When the business of government becomes limited to populist set pieces, its ranks are purged of doers and populated instead with cheerleaders. This is how we ended up with the current cast of dazed-in-headlights Tory cabinet members. In the US, the very notion of an \u201cadministration\u201d has been worn away. As the New York University journalism professor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1174409846961168387?lang=en\">Jay Rosen puts it</a>, \u201cThere is no White House. Not in the sense that journalists have always used that term. It\u2019s just Trump \u2013 and people who work in the building.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Covid-19 hit their shores, the UK and US were lacking not just the politicians but the bureaucracies required to respond effectively. Prior to the crisis, Trump repeatedly attempted to defund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the UK, the pandemic inconvenienced a Tory cabinet embroiled in a feud with its own civil service. The intellectual and practical infrastructure to deal with facts had been vandalised.</p> <p>But there is a longer, non-partisan history that rendered both nations incapable of an adequate response to the pandemic. The special relationship is not just one of linguistic and cultural proximity, but an ideological partnership forged in the post-second world war era. Anglo-American capitalism, pursued by both right and centre-left parties, rooted in small government and powered by exceptionalism, had dismantled the state. No notice or warning could have refashioned the machinery of government quickly enough to save lives. An economic and political model that hinges on privatisation, liberalisation and the withdrawal of labour rights created a system prone to regular crises, despite such shocks being framed as one-offs.</p> <p>The economic and regulatory kinship<strong> </strong>was strengthened by the transformation of Britain\u2019s quaint and mercantile financial sector into a replica of the US\u2019s aggressive markets. The City caught up with Wall Street.</p> <p>An interventionist foreign policy \u2013 publicly moralistic but privately cynical \u2013 gave the model an expansionist edge, which helped both nations project power abroad and defend their own financial and political interests. But the wars led to quagmires, and the rapidly expanding financial sectors to economic near-death experiences. Neither triggered significant rethinking or reflection. After the 2008 financial crisis, when this system came within \u201c48 hours\u201d of the \u201capocalypse\u201d, two centre-left leaders, Barack Obama and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/21/gordon-brown-saved-banks\">Gordon Brown</a>, chose to shore up the infrastructure that had brought their economies to the brink, recapitalising the banks and revitalising the markets, opting for more regulation rather than fundamental reform.</p> <p>Just as the financial crash was treated as the malfunctioning of a particular unsupervised bug in the system rather than as a feature of it, so is the failure to grapple with the pandemic being cast as an unforeseen, exogenous event, rather than a result of an ideology that enables the state to scramble unprecedented resources to save banks but not lives. A nurse will wear a bin liner as PPE in the US for longer than a failing bank can go unfinanced.</p> <p>Hollow triumphalism about making America great again and Britain taking back control becomes more and more likely in such a system. Trump and the Tories alighted on this formula not entirely out of mendacity or ideology. Without radically challenging Anglo-American capitalism, they have nothing else to offer their voters. And so they must separate economic suffering from politics, and attempt to blame it on immigrants and outsiders. They must blame other countries and international institutions \u2013 the EU, WHO, Nato \u2013 for the feelings of helplessness experienced by their own citizens. The swagger is a facade. Behind it hides a rotting national landscape.</p> <p>As the bodies pile up, the failure of the US and the UK will be somehow spun into victory. The triumphalism will intensify; that is certain. The only question now is how many will continue to believe it.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>When lockdown was announced, Maria Fernanda Guirao\u2019s north London neighbours leapt into action. \u201cWithin a few hours, we\u2019d set up a WhatsApp group,\u201d says the interior designer. \u201cEveryone pulled together to donate money to a local charity and help out with pharmacy runs or dog walking.\u201d She watched as long-standing feuds were resolved \u2013 with the clink of wine glasses over garden fences.

  "<p>Of all of the strange side effects of the pandemic, I suppose the craft boom was inevitable. The mindfulness industry (which goes hand in hand with sewing, knitting and the like) was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality\">already thriving</a> before lockdown sent our levels of boredom and anxiety through the roof. Now, we\u2019re seeing something of a craft renaissance: John Lewis\u2019s haberdashery sales have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/a-good-yarn-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-spawns-arts-and-craft-renaissance\">reported an online boost</a>, while Hobbycraft, that stalwart of the craft-industrial complex, has said the number of people visiting its website for crafting ideas has tripled since the lockdown began. For every sourdough starter, there\u2019s also a handmade face mask or a piece of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/tiger-king-reflects-our-world-back-to-us-one-run-by-megalomaniacs-and-amateurs\">Tiger King</a><em>-</em>inspired embroidery.</p> <p>It\u2019s not difficult to see why people turn to crafts in times of crisis. During a particularly potent spell of unemployment in my early 20s, I took to making little people out of tampons. It started when, unable to sleep one night, I gathered up all the \u201ccrafting\u201d materials I could find in my room (some felt tips and a box of Tampax) and turned five tampons into the Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. This was, it should be said, in the wake of the twee-core explosion of the late 2000s, when doing this sort of thing was considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/16/why-the-manic-pixie-dream-girl-must-never-return\">Zooey Deschanel-esque</a>, and therefore good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My 'painting' looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until now, this was my last memorable episode of adult crafting. As a mild dyspraxic, I\u2019ve never been particularly good at anything involving fine motor skills. My movements are both frantic and indecisive, like a ham descending a staircase. The idea of me sitting down to embroider is about as reasonable as the idea of Donald Trump sitting down to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/15/infinite-jest-at-20-still-a-challenge-still-brilliant-emma-lee-moss\">Infinite Jest</a>. But here I am holding something called an embroidery hoop. Having watched the same YouTube instructional video three times, I\u2019ve managed to fit said hoop with a piece of fabric bearing an intricate floral template.</p> <p>On opening up my embroidery kit (which, by the way, had a photo of a child on the packaging) I was nearly overcome by panic. The different coloured threads hung next to one another, on the same piece of card. There was a weird clippy tool I\u2019d never seen before. And one brief look at the instructions told me they\u2019d been run (possibly from Mandarin, going by some Chinese characters on the packaging) through Google translate, which only served to exacerbate my confusion. If it weren\u2019t for the glut of calming \u201chow to\u201d videos on embroidery (many of which have been uploaded over the past few weeks) I would\u2019ve been tempted to dump the entire kit in the bin and put the ordeal behind me before it had even started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90ded4d022c433d7da4503e6d6631bd67e8129f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90ded4d022c433d7da4503e6d6631bd67e8129f6/15_0_5337_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eleanor Margolis not enjoying crafts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After 10 minutes I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual routine of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonore Schick/Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Admittedly, the first stitch I sew is quite satisfying. I use some of the green thread to make a start on a flower stem, and am frankly awed by my own ability. But before long, it dawns on me just how slow this process is: it has taken me about 15 minutes to do an inch of stem and one tiny leaf. My mind wanders. I\u2019m bored. Had I been born hundreds of years ago, I think to myself, this is probably what I would\u2019ve done (as a lesbian) to avoid contact with my rank, toothless, clap-infested husband. I would\u2019ve sat embroidering poorly by candlelight, thinking impure thoughts about wenches. Maybe this is why lesbians are so into crafting: it\u2019s a throwback to the days when they channelled all the sadness of forbidden desire into quietly subversive needlework.</p> <p>But having decided embroidery is emphatically not for me, I move onto modelling clay. Dyspraxic or not, I loved this stuff as a kid, and have warm memories of making animals, vegetables and minerals<strong> </strong>that inevitably fell apart in the oven. I roll out some balls and make colourful, abstract models. The polymer clay is satisfying to mould and play with, especially for someone given to nervous fidgeting. But after about 10 minutes, my hands feel dried out and achy, and I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual soothing activity of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/a-good-yarn-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-spawns-arts-and-craft-renaissance\">A good yarn: UK coronavirus lockdown spawns arts and craft renaissance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I will myself to try one last craft. YouTube informs me that, using just cardboard toilet-paper rolls and paint, of which I happen to have both, I can make quite handsome little dandelion prints. Of all crafts I\u2019ve attempted, this seems by far the easiest. You just cut strips into the toilet roll, splay them out and use the end product as a kind of fat paint brush.

My \u201cpainting\u201d looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall. It\u2019s an unmitigated disaster. I stand up and look at my war zone of a table, strewn with paint, loose pieces of thread and multicoloured clay crumbs. I can\u2019t deal with this right now, I think to myself. I\u2019m too stressed.

  "<p> When a woman named Shanawdithit died from tuberculosis in Newfoundland nearly 200 years ago, it was widely believed that her death marked a tragic end to her people\u2019s existence.</p> <p>For centuries, the Beothuk had thrived along the rocky shores of the island, taking on a near-mythical status as descendants of the first people encountered by Norse explorers in what is now Canada.

At one point, as many as 2,000 Beothuk lived in communities scattered around Newfoundland.</p> <p>For generations, they largely resisted and avoided relations with European settlers; the few interactions between the two were defined by violent encounters.</p> <p>Early European settlements on the coast cut off Beothuk access to critical salmon and seals \u2013 forcing them to move further inland where they sustained themselves on caribou before finally succumbing to starvation and disease.</p> <p>But Carr\u2019s research suggests it was only a \u201ccultural extinction\u201d; their genetic legacy lives on.</p> <p>In his study, Carr used DNA samples from Shanawdithit\u2019s aunt and uncle \u2013 Demasduit and Nonosbawsut \u2013 whose skulls were sent to the University of Edinburgh in the 1850s. After a long campaign by Chief Joe\u2019s community,<a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/beothuk-remains-returned-to-newfoundland-after-almost-two-centuries-in-scotland-1.4849511\"> the remains were repatriated to Newfoundland from National Museums Scotland in March</a>.</p> <p>After running samples through a genetics database, Carr was able to find his \u201csmoking gun\u201d \u2013 a man in Tennessee who was genetically similar to Nonosbawsut, but had no known Indigenous ancestry.</p> <p>With only a small amount of data to work with, Carr hopes more samples will further demonstrate a connection.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to obtain the DNA sequence from somebody and you can count the number of similarities. That\u2019s a very easy thing to do. But to reconstruct the patterns of a relationship is a very challenging problem,\u201d said Carr, adding that further research into the known movement and connections between the Beothuk and Mi\u2019maq was still required.</p> <p>The findings also illustrate the way in which genetic uniqueness \u2013 in this case the distinct sequence of Beothuk mitochondrial genomes \u2013 can persist intact for generations. While humans share an immense amount of DNA that traces back millennia, said Carr, the intent of his research lay in teasing out the subtle and distinguishing differences between known groups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/29/inuit-oral-historian-who-pointed-way-to-franklin-shipwrecks-dies-aged-58\">Inuit oral historian who pointed way to Franklin shipwrecks dies aged 58</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For years, academia has ignored the oral histories of Indigenous peoples, said Chief Joe.</p> <p>\u201cAcademics are hard people to convince.

  "<p>It\u2019s been called the four-person puzzle. If you could only have the same four family members or friends to dinner for a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, who would you choose? That is the dilemma the Belgian government has handed its citizens as it moves to the next phase in easing restrictions on everyday life.</p> <p>From Sunday, every household in Belgium can invite up to four guests to their home. Two sets of four people make a \u201ccorona bubble\u201d, who can visit each other\u2019s homes. No one else is allowed into the domestic social circle. The concept, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">also being discussed by the British government</a>, opens up the biggest social minefield of the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, announced the plan last week, after being accused of prioritising the economy over people\u2019s wishes to be reunited with friends and family. Allowing social bubbles to start on Sunday, Mother\u2019s Day in Belgium and much of continental Europe, is no accident.</p> <p>\u201cThe physical separation from those whom we love has in some cases become unbearable,\u201d Wilm\u00e8s said, but visitors are told not to hug or exchange the typical three-kiss greeting. The government expects guests to stay 1.5 metres apart and suggests people meet in gardens or on terraces where possible. Authorities say it impossible to police the policy, so they are relying on people\u2019s sense of civic duty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Belgium\" data-alt=\"belgium deaths\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Belgium\">belgium deaths</a> </figure>  <p>Belgians, especially large families or those where one or both parents have remarried, are already contemplating their choices. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly complicated.

That means I can\u2019t allow any of my kids\u2019 friends to visit them.\u201d</p> <p>Her priority is to see her teenage son, who lives with his father and has asthma, meaning he has been isolated from the rest of the family. But she doesn\u2019t want to cut her two daughters off from their friends. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to keep a flipchart of who is seeing who,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is more important to get into the spirit of it than the letter.\u201d</p> <p>There has been a lot of confusion about the letter of the policy. \u201cThe problem is that the way the idea was communicated was not very clear from the start,\u201d said Karen Phalet, a professor in psychology at KU Leuven university. Many people did not realise that all four guests were meant to come from the same household.</p> <p>Epidemiologists advising the government chose the number four because it matches current capacity to do contact tracing if someone falls ill. Pairing two households also reduces the risk-multiplier effect that would come from allowing more varied mixing, but epidemiological models do not square with how people socialise in real life.</p> <p>\u201cIf one family can have contacts with one family for Mother\u2019s Day, we have to make a choice, either the mother or the mother-in-law,\u201d Phalet said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard choice for some families. Is it children\u2019s friends?

These new rules will be in place until 5 June, by which time they will have been reviewed.</p> <p>In Spain, which has been under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, the government has said that groups of up to 10 people will be able to gather in private homes or outdoors from Monday, but only in areas of the country that have been given permission to move to the second phase of the lockdown de-escalation plan.</p> <p>About 51% of people in Spain, including those in the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, will move to the next phase on Monday.

If they meet other peers they can also learn from each other\u201d</p> <p>On Mother\u2019s Day, Phalet and her siblings will meet their 81-year old mother via Zoom.</p> <p>For now, the Belgian government\u2019s main message is that people should stay at home as much as possible. \u201cI am hoping that when contract tracing is in place we can get some social life back pretty soon in a way that is responsible,\u201d Phalet said. \u201cBut we are not there yet.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Kate Connolly in Berlin and Sam Jones in Madrid</em></p> <p>\u2022 The graphic in this article was amended on 11 May 2020 to correct the information about the Netherlands, where cinemas, cafes and restaurants remain closed for now; and to clarify that all shops selling essential items in Belgium are open.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global cases at over 4 million</strong></h2> <p>Global coronavirus cases stand at 4,024,973, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, with global deaths at 279,321. The US has the most fatalities, at 78,794, followed by the UK (31,662) and Italy (30,395).</p> <h2><strong>UK death toll \u2018could hit 100,000 if lockdown eased too fast\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The Sunday Times is reporting that the UK death toll could climb to 100,000 if lockdown restrictions ease too quickly. At 7pm BST on Sunday, British prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, but some scientists are worried about a second wave of the virus. According to the report the PM has been warned of having \u201cvery little room to manoeuvre\u201d by his top scientific advisors and told Britain could suffer more than 100,000 deaths by the end of the year if ministers relax the lockdown too far and too fast, the paper reports a scientific adviser telling the government last night.</p> <h2><strong>New infections on rise in Germany</strong></h2> <p>New coronavirus infections are accelerating again in Germany just days after its leaders loosened social restrictions, raising concerns that the pandemic could once again slip out of control. The Robert Koch Institute for disease control said in a daily bulletin the number of people each sick person now infects \u2013 known as the reproduction rate, or R \u2013 had risen to 1.1. \u200b</p> <h2>France reports new cluster hours before lockdown ends</h2> <p>Hours before France ends its strict seven-week coronavirus lockdown on Monday, a worrying new Covid-19 cluster has been reported in the Dordogne. The outbreak has been traced back to the funeral of a 51-year-old man in the small village of L\u2019Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt \u2013 population 500 \u2013 south of P\u00e9rigueux. The man did not die of Covid-19.</p> <h2><strong>Bars closed in South Korean capital</strong></h2> <p>Seoul, the South Korean capital, has closed bars and clubs over fears of a second virus wave, after more than two dozen cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend.</p> <h2><strong>Three White House taskforce members self-quarantine</strong></h2> <p>Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce, including Dr Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <h2><strong>Sweden apologises for failing to protect older people</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWe failed to protect our elderly. That\u2019s really serious, and a failure for society as a whole.\u201d Sweden\u2019s government has apologised for not protecting older people, with 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 deaths occurring in the over-70s.</p> <h2><strong>Japan sees rise in bullying of sick people</strong></h2> <p>There has been an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers in Japan, with the PM labelling such behaviour \u201cshameful\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Musk says he may quit California</strong></h2> <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has threatened to pull his factory and headquarters out of California, saying health authorities have gone overboard in their corona protection measures, which do not allow Tesla to open.</p>",
  "<p>The Argentinian radio journalist Alejandro Fantino shouted \u201cWe are a disaster\u201d in the 89th minute. He was right. The match that most had expected to be a rout was turning into a historic upset. </p> <p>Argentina were as bad as Iran were good. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda were not working as a front three while the Asian champions were performing especially well at the back. Carlos Queiroz, Iran\u2019s manager, appeared to have perfected the defensive formula that had plagued Argentina during the qualifiers: a parked bus and Lionel Messi well under control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/06/my-favourite-game-panini-pest-zoltan-peter-comes-unstuck-against-ussr\">My favourite game: Panini pest Zoltan Peter comes unstuck against USSR | Paul Doyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through the 90-inch plasma TV, it was clear that the spectre of Argentinian expectations hung over Messi just as much as Diego Maradona\u2019s presence did in the stands. Messi was quiet and I was too on that summer afternoon. He was lost in the Mineir\u00e3o Stadium while I sat clutching a beer at a Persian rooftop party in Miami.</p> <p>My friend\u2019s Iranian father had invited me to watch this Group F game over a barbecue at his new downtown penthouse. Still a teen, I brought my dad with me. He drove, I drank, and we were the only Argentinians in attendance. We rode the elevator in our Argentina jerseys, bursting with pride. But upstairs, interest in the match was casual. People ate burgers and chatted while we munched our nails and breathed through every second of the contest in front of us.</p> <p>Messi\u2019s inability to carry us to success, allied to his demure manner, were a cocktail of weakness that made him in the eyes of many, if not most, a <em>pecho fr\u00edo</em><em>. </em>For some he was not even<em> </em>Argentinian. Every minute we didn\u2019t score was an excruciating one as we watched the narrative of his and our greatness trickle away. The veil was lifting and for the generation who had seen Maradona conquer the world, and for another who had grown up on Diego\u2019s legend, patience was wearing thin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39ec75a83347672c7b817c6f50aeee9a7c43ffe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39ec75a83347672c7b817c6f50aeee9a7c43ffe2/14_0_3572_2144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The stadium erupts as Lionel Messi (right) wheels away in celebration after his shot beats Iran\u2019s goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ede12440f78a5affadb453d5733a15a8841104a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ede12440f78a5affadb453d5733a15a8841104a9/705_98_2230_2786/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi celebrates after scoring for Argentina against Iran in Belo Horizonte.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The stadium erupts as Messi\u2019s shot beats Iran\u2019s goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi.

But history is written by the victors.</p> <p>The party had mostly turned away from the TV and I had already received a few consoling pats on the back from guests as the game entered injury time. But then Fantino, I and the rest of the country ate our words. From the same spot he had lingered looking toothless and ineffective, and following a pass from Ezequiel Lavezzi, Messi curled the ball over two Irani defenders \u2013 one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Ghoochannejhad\">nicknamed Gucci</a> \u2013 and, finally, the goalkeeper. It was a wonderful finish and also meant Argentina had qualified for the knockout stages.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Pulga! Thank you, Messi! Thank you, Argentina!\u201d screamed Fantino at the top of his voice. Meanwhile my dad and I absolutely lost it. We hugged and jumped up from our bar stools, also screaming at the top of our voices. My beer and a few others flew, soaking burgers and clothing nearby. It was a pure release, for in that moment the pain of waiting for success expired. Past and present met and the feeling lasted all of two more weeks, until Mario G\u00f6tze <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QJ6P8Yxil4\">did what he did</a> in the final.</p> <p>When the ecstasy passed on that afternoon, my dad apologised to the host for soaking everyone\u2019s food and clothing. He understood.</p>",
  "<p>Doctors are taking legal action to force the UK government to launch an independent inquiry into its failure to provide adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff and other frontline care workers.</p> \n<p>News of the challenge, brought by the Doctors Association UK (DAUK) and the Good Law project, comes as the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it was withdrawing a model of protective goggles \u2013 \u201cTiger Eye\u201d protectors \u2013 from use because they offered insufficient protection.</p> \n<p>A pre-action letter sent to the DHSC says an immediate independent inquiry is essential to ensure sufficient PPE can be made available as soon as possible and to ensure healthcare workers are properly equipped for any second or third wave of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Doctors\u2019 Association UK said: \u201cIt is a tragedy that nearly 200 healthcare workers in the UK have died due to Covid-19.

  "<p>In 1933, the year of the Nazi takeover, the French writer Julien Benda wrote his Discourse to the European Nation,<em> </em>urging Europeans to come together around their shared universalist values and against the rising monsters of nationalism. As Europe marched towards the murder of its soul and its people, many dared to dream the impossible.</p> <p>Benda was not alone. The Ventotene manifesto, one of the founding texts of European federalism, was drafted in 1941. And it was against the background of a continent in ruins that Churchill spoke of a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d in 1946. The rebirth of Europe would have been unthinkable if the flame of European unity had not been kept alive throughout the continent\u2019s darkest hour.</p> <p>While the challenge posed by Covid-19 has been compared to a war, we are thankfully very far from the murderous scenario of those years. And yet, the current crisis is drawing Europeans further apart and not closer together. Animosities and divisions grow \u2013 whether that is between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/western-liberalism-failed-post-communist-eastern-europe\">east and the west</a> on democracy and the rule of law, or between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-could-be-final-straw-for-eu-european-experts-warn\">north and the south</a> on economic solidarity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Spaniards must not look at the threat of unemployment with any greater fear than the Dutch</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Europe was thought to advance through crises. Emergencies, so the argument went, would allow visionary politicians to overcome national resistance and bring the continent towards the \u201cever closer union\u201d dreamed by its founders. But Europe has now been enmeshed in more than a decade of financial, political and humanitarian crises, and the result is constant and ever more worrisome disintegration.</p> <p>The collapse of the European Union has been predicted for years. But Europe does not need to collapse to die. Europe dies when it just shrugs its shoulders at nation-first politics. Disintegration is not a single event, but rather a process marked by diminishing bonds, gradual loss of faith, and renationalisation of politics. Europe may end not with a bang but a whimper.</p> <p>Fellow citizens: our national elites have failed us, and we must rescue the ideal of a united Europe from them. On 9 May, Europe Day, the European Union was planning on launching its Conference on the Future of Europe and opening a new chapter in the history of integration, following Brexit. These plans have now been <a href=\"https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/future-europe-conference-limbo\">delayed</a>. And this may be just as well. The conference was structured to be yet another spectacle of top-down chatter without vision or ambition.</p> <p>We call on you, on us all, to take the lead and keep the flame alive in these times of crisis. In place of another insignificant institutional conference, we call for the establishment of a European Citizens\u2019 Congress on the Future of Europe, forming the basis of a modern constituent assembly. Such a congress would be a hybrid structure: falling somewhere between a social movement, a political actor and a deliberative platform, providing a rallying point for all those wishing to resist the path of disintegration.</p> <p>It was similar congresses that decreed the enfranchisement of millions in South Africa and India over the last century. We, disenfranchised citizens of Europe, must now dare to demand and organise for the impossible: a European republic where all citizens are equal, independent of national affiliation. Where there is no question of some receiving generous aid and having access to exceptional healthcare, and others being left in misery and with overflowing hospitals.</p> <p>Can there be such a thing as a European republic of equals, in such a diverse continent? Indeed, what defines a nation? A nation is neither ethnicity nor language, neither culture nor identity. A nation is a law that establishes a group of equals boasting common rights. It is, as the French sociologist Marcel Mauss wrote a century ago, a group that is collectively aware of its economic and social interdependence and that decides to transform this interdependence into collective control over the state and the economic system.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t this exactly the juncture where Europe stands today? Are we prepared, as citizens of Europe, to take the necessary step towards such institutionalisation of solidarity, so that a Bulgarian and a Finn, a German and an Italian enjoy the same social protections, benefit from the same economic support and pay the same taxes? Are we willing to create, for the first time in history, a new democracy on a par with the global challenges banging on our doors? Are we ready to do so despite, and when necessary against, our own national governments?</p> <p>We need one European social security number, a common European welfare that guarantees human dignity and security independent of nationality. Spaniards must not look at the threat of unemployment with any greater fear than the Dutch. Greeks must not look at the prospect of hospitalisation with any greater worry than a German. Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9, not security, was the motto of the French revolution, which is the cultural and political heritage of all Europeans!</p> <p>We need an impressive programme of ecological and economic transformation. We cannot let some countries drown in debt and let our union be mistaken for a committee of loan sharks while our environment collapses. Just as Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal allowed for the creation of modern federal institutions in the United States, a real <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European Green Deal</a> boasting significant federal resources would at once address the economic slump caused by Covid-19, alter our toxic production model and create the institutions for a genuine economic union.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/coronavirus-threatens-future-eurozone-brussels-economic-social-divisions-pandemic\">Coronavirus threatens future of eurozone, Brussels warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need a modernised common tax system for our companies as well as for us as European citizens. Modern European nations were built by centralising the power of taxation from the feudal regime. The opposite process is under way today, with European states played against each other by multinational corporations dodging paying their fair share. A common European tax on large assets, a redistribution of the profits of automation, and a common tax on the profits of multinationals would build a new, broad-based taxation from scratch, recovering resources that are currently unattainable.</p> <p>Don\u2019t let anyone convince you that any of this is inconceivable. For ours is a continent that time and again has shown that citizens\u2019 power can make the impossible possible. On 20 June, 1789 in France the representatives of the third estate called themselves the National Assembly and swore not to separate until a constitution was established. The result was revolution and the birth of the modern French republic. Europe today needs its own Tennis Court Oath, a second peaceful revolution after the one of 1989, and the birth of its own republic.</p> <p>As Julien Benda was fond of saying, emperors cannot produce Europe \u2013 only citizens can.</p> <p>\u2022 Lorenzo Marsili is a founder of <a href=\"https://euroalter.com/?s=Marsili\">European Alternatives</a> and Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot is founder and director of the <a href=\"https://europeandemocracylab.org/en/\">European Democracy Lab</a></p>",

Other states in the south, including Georgia, Texas and Florida, have also moved to open despite growing numbers of cases.</p> <p>Like many conservative governors, Reeves has taken cues from Donald Trump, who has encouraged states to open in the face of White House taskforce guidance, which states that phased reopening should not commence until a 14-day decrease in the number of coronavirus cases has been seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9ac1b7dbbd5d18951808d182ec1544ec25d2a85c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_6720_4480&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb2908ea9d3f7126b17980447aeb3f90d5bd62313%3Fcrop%3D0_0_6720_4480&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"reopening restaurants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9ac1b7dbbd5d18951808d182ec1544ec25d2a85c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_6720_4480&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb2908ea9d3f7126b17980447aeb3f90d5bd62313%3Fcrop%3D0_0_6720_4480&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">reopening restaurants</a> <figcaption>Left: Kayla Hester, bartender at the Blind Tiger, pours a drink for a customer on the day restaurants reopened.

  "<p>As many as 43 million Americans could lose their health insurance in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute.</p> <p>Prior to the pandemic, 160 million Americans, or roughly half the population, received their medical insurance through their job.

Many will use social safety nets to obtain insurance, including Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income people. However, eligibility criteria varies from state to state, with more restrictions in Republican-led states.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly segmented and every state has a different story,\u201d said Hempstead. \u201cThere\u2019s 50 different experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Christine Mohn, 51, lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and worked as a physical therapist. She lost her job of 18 years when her company was bought out in November 2019.</p> <p>\u201cYou walk in the door one day, and they said: \u2018Your job is not here and neither is your health insurance \u2013 bye,\u2019\u201d Mohn said.</p> <p>For several months, Mohn, her husband and college-age daughter relied on a program called Cobra, which allows Americans to continue the benefits they once received from a job. But the benefits came at a steep cost. Mohn paid $1,700 a month for insurance using a line of credit on her mortgage until April 2020, when she finally got a new job.</p> <p>Mohn only worked two weeks before the job indefinitely furloughed its workers because the pandemic closed down all non-urgent health services.</p> <p>The company that furloughed Mohn allowed her to keep her health insurance, even though it is under no obligation to do so. The insurance costs Mohn $400 a month, and after four weeks she still has not received her first unemployment check. When she finally does go back to work, she said: \u201cI can get to paying off my line of credit I\u2019ve been living off.\u201d</p> <p>Of those who lose employer-based insurance, an estimated 7 million Americans will remain uninsured, and will lack access to healthcare during the worst pandemic in a century, RWJF predicted. Another <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/aug/who-are-remaining-uninsured-and-why-do-they-lack-coverage\">30 million</a> people lacked insurance even before the pandemic, according to the Urban Institute. </p> <p>\u201cYou have people who think they have an infectious disease, but they don\u2019t want to come forward to get tested or get treatment because they\u2019re so worried about what kind of financial liabilities they will have,\u201d said Hempstead. \u201cThis problem exposes, really, a lot of the inadequacies in our system.\u201d</p> <p>Emily Jones, 22, is one of them. She lives with her mother and sister in Flushing, Michigan, and is a cancer survivor. People\u2019s Action, an advocacy group, said her insurance lapsed when she missed renewal paperwork just as the pandemic set in. Now, she is without insurance even as her mother is an essential worker.</p> <p>Estimating the number of people who lack insurance is a complicated task. America\u2019s fragmented health system lacks a single metric for how many people are shut out. Some researchers believe insurance losses will be low relative to job losses, because many lacked insurance despite working.</p> <p>\u201cThe American healthcare financing system was not built to withstand the combined impact of a pandemic and a recession,\u201d said Dr Adam Gaffney, the president of Physicians for a National Health Program. PNHP advocates for a single-payer health system in the US, similar to the NHS. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that people will die because they can\u2019t get the care they need, because of the looming recession.\u201d\ufeff</p>",

This model could have many benefits for maintaining physical distancing and minimising risk of transmission as part of the transition from lockdown back into early learning and childcare and school. While specialist outdoor nurseries are well attuned to the needs of children spending all day outdoors, other establishments are considering how to adapt their practice to enable more time to be spent in gardens and playgrounds.\u201d</p> <p>The outdoor experience is already a part of Scotland\u2019s \u201ccurriculum for excellence\u201d, while many councils have ambitious plans to expand outdoor learning as they meet the Scottish government\u2019s commitment to a near-doubling of funded childcare this year.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s educators and policymakers have been acting on a growing weight of evidence about the exponentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/02/forest-schools-grow-in-scotland-as-grasp-of-benefits-takes-root\">positive impact of learning outdoors</a> on everything from eyesight to risk assessment to resilience, but now practitioners are convinced their experience could offer a model for returning to school.</p> <p>Since lockdown began, a number of outdoor nurseries across the country have become childcare hubs for children of key workers. Zoe Sills, who manages the Earthtime forest school nursery in Elgin, said: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got the natural world at your fingertips, you don\u2019t need so many toys, which means fewer surfaces where the virus can be passed on.\u201d Each child is given a bag containing their own paintbrush, crayons and glue stick, then encouraged to spread out and find their own space to do crafting activities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc68a8020cd758a740977e772eb061f539179845\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc68a8020cd758a740977e772eb061f539179845/0_0_720_960/375.jpg\" alt=\"Children playing at Earth Time for All nursery\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children playing at the Earth Time for All nursery.

We have rolling snacks and lunches to avoid them clustering together, and handwashing every hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis might be the way that outdoor learning gets pushed forward, but it\u2019s about so much more than infection control. Teachers do need support to do this: there are not many things you can\u2019t teach outdoors, you just have to think creatively.\u201d</p> <p>Kenny Forsyth, the chief executive of Stramash social enterprise, which runs outdoor nurseries across the Highlands, suggests that the answers to the challenges posed by coronavirus are already embedded in outdoor settings.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have an indoor nursery with four walls and a square metrage per child defined by the local council, then the number of children who can come back will be limited by social distancing. You can manage and control infection risk better outdoors, and we are a better option, especially at the time of year. The biggest single issue is that there are not enough of us to go round.\u201d Forsyth estimates that less than 1% of nursery age children in Scotland all-day all-day outdoor nurseries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Practitioners are also keen to underline that outdoor learning is a specialism that requires training and expertise, rather than something that can be immediately transposed into conventional schools that have widely varying amounts of outdoor space available.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a significant challenge to expect the indoor national establishment to suddenly understand how to deliver all-day outdoor provision,\u201d said Forsyth. \u201cBut it would be a tremendous outcome for the country if the benefits of the outdoors became embedded in all schools.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>They say you never forget your first time, and Paul Jordan is no exception. It was a Saturday night, 15 May 1993, to be precise. Downstairs at his family home in Peterborough, his mum and dad were holding a dinner party. Their son, meanwhile, had sneaked into his parents\u2019 bedroom, desperate not to attract the attention of the grown-ups.</p> <p>A few hours later, emotions overwhelmed him. His dad came up to check on his son and when the bedroom door burst open, their eyes met as the credits rolled on the small television set. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision\" title=\"\">Eurovision Song Contest</a> was over, and after a nail-biting finish to voting, the United Kingdom\u2019s contestant had missed out on first place in the final round.</p> <p>What started as a childhood obsession for Jordan later became all-consuming. It was the subject of his undergraduate dissertation, closely followed by a PhD on how different countries attribute their own meaning to the contest. He joined the competition\u2019s comms team for a while, earning the nickname \u201cDr Eurovision\u201d for turning the pop culture phenomenon into an intellectual pursuit.</p> <p>Twenty-seven years later, clutching a glass of prosecco in his Northampton living room, the 36-year-old laughs as he retells the story via Zoom to a group of fellow Eurovision fanatics. \u201cWhen he heard me cheering,\u201d says Jordan, \u201cDad just assumed I was watching <em>Match of </em><em>the Day</em>.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a memory that resonates with his friends who have logged in from across Europe for their regular lockdown catch-up: Simon in Brussels, Elaine in Dunfermline and Dan in rural south Wales. Each has their own similar tale to tell of watching for the first time.</p> <p>But this digital get-together isn\u2019t just for reminiscing. It\u2019s 7.45pm and in a few minutes the opening titles of their beloved Eurovision will appear on their screens once again.

For superfans across Europe and beyond, this is simply a minor detail that they refuse to let stand in their way. It\u2019s why Jordan and his friends have instead turned to collective viewings of reruns.</p> <p>For a week, I\u2019ve been joining the online viewing parties and Eurovision quiz nights that the competition\u2019s fans have been hosting.

Back then, seven countries played two songs each accompanied by a live orchestra: a joint venture to harness the power of newly perfected long distance broadcasting technology while attempting to unite a fractured Europe still recovering from the wounds of war.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes Eurovision so special is its legacy,\u201d explains Jon Ola Sand, the contest\u2019s executive supervisor. \u201cIt would be impossible to pitch the show to broadcasters now.\u201d But, he says, its heritage and history make it work. \u201cAnd because it travels from Moscow to Dublin, Athens to Helsinki, it has established itself as a true European project, every year a different country adds a new tone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1322c5a578309160fd76950796a9108371f2c50f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1322c5a578309160fd76950796a9108371f2c50f/456_312_2856_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans from the UK dressed in jackets with British symbols arrive in Stockholm for 2016\u2019s show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The biggest shame is that it\u2019s the one time we get to see our family from across Europe.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the 1950s it has grown in every conceivable way. Last year, more than 180 million people tuned in to watch 26 countries battle it out in the glitzy grand final. With Brexit now under way, Eurovision has taken on a new significance for many British viewers \u2013 our participation is one of the few public examples of pan-European co-operation in which we will still partake.</p> <p>From low-key beginnings, it has become a huge event; planning for the next contest starts the moment the last one finishes. The rules dictate that the winning country plays host the following May. Hotels need booking before prices are hiked up the next morning; once that\u2019s decided, fans can start plotting out which other events might complement this final destination.</p> <p>There\u2019s the summer party in Berlin; the Eurovision cruise that sets sail every September. January to March is national selection season \u2013 fans pick which events they\u2019ll be attending to watch the qualifiers progress. April and May are for preview parties: Amsterdam\u2019s <a href=\"https://eurovisioninconcert.nl/en/eurovision-in-concert-6-april-2019-in-afas-live/\" title=\"\">Eurovision In Concert</a> is the biggest, plus Moscow and Madrid, Tel Aviv and London are ones not to miss.</p> <p>\u201cFor half the year, fans are crisscrossing through Europe,\u201d says Simon Bennett from his home in London. \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, it can consume your whole calendar.\u201d It\u2019s probably a little late for the 56-year-old to be worrying about that now. A tour guide by trade, for the past five years, he has been the president of the Eurovision fan club, <a href=\"https://ogaeinternational.org/\" title=\"\">OGAE International</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re the umbrella organisation for the 45 national Eurovision fan clubs around the world, made up of more than 13,000 members,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>For the people Bennett represents, news that Eurovision had been called off was devastating. There\u2019s the financial hit: ticket packages through OGAE cost a hefty \u20ac799 (\u00a3698); whether refunds will be forthcoming for flights, hotels and local events remains to be seen. And then there\u2019s the personal cost. \u201cThe biggest shame is that it\u2019s the one time a year that we see our family from across Europe and beyond.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to cancel the show wasn\u2019t taken lightly. The competition is organised by the European Broadcasting Union, and it\u2019s their biggest event of the year. For Jon Ola Sand, this was to be his 10th and final year at the helm. The production team spent a month, says Sand, monitoring the international situation carefully. At first they considered hosting a slimmed-down event. Could it work with no audience? How about remotely?</p> <p>\u201cIn the end with the advice from the health authorities in the Netherlands,\u201d he says, \u201cand travel restrictions in several participating countries, we realised it would be impossible to go ahead.\u201d</p> <p>While many cultural institutions are adapting to these unexpected circumstances with innovative, online alternatives, Sand and his team saw no feasible way the show could continue fairly. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t want was an uneven playing field with a different type of competition,\u201d he tells me from his base in Norway. \u201cSongs and acts were specially created for that stage \u2013 so we decided it would be unfair to change any variables so late on.\u201d</p> <p>Delaying the event until later in the year was also a non-starter. Eurovision is more than the final television show: there\u2019s a full week of rehearsals, heats and run-throughs, plus a nonstop schedule of other events. For seven days, a host city is overrun with Eurovision fever: infrastructure, outdoor screens, hotels and transport all need to be arranged. Instead, on what was meant to be the finale night, there\u2019ll be an alternative live broadcast. Eurovision<em><a href=\"https://eurovision.tv/eurovision-europe-shine-a-light\" title=\"\">: Europe Shine a Light</a></em><em><a href=\"https://eurovision.tv/eurovision-europe-shine-a-light\" title=\"\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://eurovision.tv/eurovision-europe-shine-a-light\" title=\"\">will see</a> videos of this year\u2019s songs played out non-competitively, with a few sing-alongs and iconic faces from the past appearing, too. The BBC, meanwhile, has also put together its own replacement, <em><a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-31/eurovision-come-togerther-bbc-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Eurovision: Come Together</a></em>. \u201cIn the end we had no other option but to pull it,\u201d says Sand. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m finding it\u2019s harder to close down a contest than to put one on.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>It may take a year</strong></em> of hard graft for organisers to produce a Eurovision show and all that goes with it, but for Samanta T\u012bna the road to Rotterdam 2020 took a little longer to travel. Eight years, in fact. It wasn\u2019t a financial pull \u2013 not even the winning act gets any prize money \u2013 but a career-long ambition she craved to see through.</p> <p>The 31-year-old singer\u2019s first attempt to represent Latvia was back in 2012. She came second in the televised qualifier and the following year was also runner-up. After a further two failed submissions, she gave it a final shot last year and placed seventh. At home in Riga, with only her dog for company, Tina says she had decided not to bother trying for 2020 when applications opened. But then she changed her mind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite the fact there are judges, the show isn\u2019t at all judgmental</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I started performing my new song \u2013 Still Breathing \u2013 on stage,\u201d Tina says, \u201cI realised I had to enter. There\u2019d been other years when I\u2019d attempted to make it, but had known deep down I didn\u2019t have a track that would make me proud to represent my country. But with this song, I did.\u201d This time, she made it through. The ticket was hers. \u201cI just wish I could have clung on to that feeling a little longer,\u201d she says. \u201cFinally, the candy is in your hands but\u2026 when you\u2019re allowed to unwrap it, there\u2019s nothing there. I know that candy is mine.\u201d</p> <p>Cheryl Baker remembers that sweet taste perfectly. It was 1981, and she and her fellow Bucks Fizz band members were in Dublin as the votes from across Europe slowly rolled in. Performing Making Your Mind Up on the Eurovision stage might have been nerve-racking (\u201cBloody terrifying,\u201d she says), but it earned the group a steady stream of points from every country: the catchy lyrics and kitsch outfits had gone down a treat.</p> <p>\u201cIt came down to the final vote,\u201d Baker recalls, nearly four decades later, \u201cand all the cameras were pointing at the German girl who looked happy. I just assumed that she had pipped us to the post. Then I realised: \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019ve won.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the airport arrivals lounge back in England the following evening, their song was pumped out through the PA \u2013 their lives had changed forever. Their single hit number one across Europe and they played Christmas <em>Top of the Pops</em>.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, winning Eurovision wasn\u2019t just fulfilling a childhood dream,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWithout it I wouldn\u2019t have my house, I\u2019d never have met my husband or had our kids. We still tour. Everything I have is because of Making Your Mind Up, a silly song with no meaning. Actually, I\u2019m pretty sure we can credit the four points we won by to the Velcro skirts we wore.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>My virtual journey </strong></em>through Eurovision fandom takes me to every corner of Europe. There\u2019s Vladyslav with a Eurovision photo-collage pinned to his sitting-room wall in the Ukrainian town of Vinnytsia; Paulo in Barcelona, Paul in Manchester and California native Liz Guterbock, too. I make every effort to be indiscriminate, speaking to teenagers and pensioners, men and women, fans old and new. And yet, nearly every punter has one thing in common: they\u2019re almost all lesbian, bisexual or gay.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=bsnglton\" title=\"\">Professor Brian Singleton</a> of Trinity College Dublin has considered why this might be the case more than most others: Eurovision \u2013 and the communities which adore it \u2013 has made up a fair chunk of his university research. His academic papers include: <em>From Dana to Dustin: The Reputation of Old/New Ireland and the Eurovision Song Contest</em>, and <em>Part of the Show: The Global Networking of Irish Eurovision Song Contest Fans</em>. A fan himself, Singleton was hesitant at first to study Eurovision too closely, worried that it might turn the thing he loved into something that felt more like work. But, he\u2019s relieved to say, that didn\u2019t happen, instead his academic research has deepened his appreciation and enjoyment.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Singleton says, \u201cthere\u2019s the campness and the glamour\u201d that helps attract a gay audience. But he believes there\u2019s something in both the music and the spectacle that is a little more profound. The narrative of many songs in the contest is of overcoming adversity, he suggests, and with a production on Eurovision\u2019s scale things do inevitably go wrong from time to time. Regardless, the show goes on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b958c914e334a386bd7ccaaebcae9c94e3fba891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b958c914e334a386bd7ccaaebcae9c94e3fba891/481_271_3272_1964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four fans from France with foreheads or faces painted with the French flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flag waving: fans from France arrive at the 2016 show in Stockholm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are just so many moments of triumph in Eurovision,\u201d he continues, \u201cand that speaks to many LGBTQ+ people, certainly of my generation, who came of age in societies where homosexuality was criminalised.\u201d Singleton grew up just outside Omagh, Northern Ireland, during the Troubles when homosexuality was still illegal \u2013 tuning in through his teenage years offered a window into another, more hopeful and accepting world.</p> <p>Today, LGBTQ+ people in many competitor nations \u2013 Russia, Ukraine and Armenia, among others \u2013 continue to face discrimination or state-sanctioned persecution. At Eurovision 2009 in Moscow, local LGBTQ+ people organised a gay pride parade. \u201cThe police were chasing the few thousand people who turned up,\u201d Singleton recalls, \u201cwhile in the arena the state broadcaster was beaming out gay fans dancing to the world\u2019s LGBT community.\u201d Eurovision\u2019s message of possibility still brings hope to people in places where it\u2019s hard to be out and proud.</p> <p>Most fans I speak to have been hooked on Eurovision since early childhood, long before many of them had come to explore their sexuality and all it means. After a week of embracing all things Eurovision, I\u2019ve come to understand why people who are a little different are attracted to the competition\u2019s bright lights. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/22/sunday-with-rylan-clark-neal-we-get-a-takeaway-roast-from-the-pub-dont-judge-me\" title=\"\">Rylan Clark-Neal</a> \u2013 superfan turned BBC Eurovision presenter \u2013 puts it, inclusivity is woven into the contest\u2019s fabric. However much we Brits might take the piss, the show has a huge heart.</p> <p>\u201cI remember watching it through the years as a kid and being in awe of how, despite the fact there are literally judges, the show isn\u2019t at all judgmental,\u201d Clark-Neal says. \u201cYou can be transgender and win like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/10/viva-la-diva-how-eurovisions-dana-international-made-trans-identity-mainstream\" title=\"\">Dana International</a>; a group that\u2019s camp as Christmas like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/mar/19/flyingtheflagscoochwillcr\" title=\"\">Scooch</a> can take off.\u201d All languages, dances and styles of music are celebrated and welcomed, no questions asked. \u201cIt feels like a bubble \u2013 whether you\u2019re there in person, or watching on your sofa. And once you\u2019re inside, everything is safe and anything goes.\u201d</p>",

That includes dine-in meal services within pubs, bars, community clubs, hotels and WA\u2019s casino. He\u2019s encouraging local governments to ease restrictions on al fresco dining to encourage that.</li> \n   <li>Limits on people attending weddings and funerals will be lifted to 20 attendees. If they are held outdoors, up to 30 attendees will be allowed.</li> \n   <li>Places of worship, community facilities and libraries can reopen, limited to 20 patrons.</li> \n   <li>The number of people who can participate in non-contact community sports will increase to 20 people. McGowan says this means adults and children can train and take part in sports if there\u2019s no physical contact involved and there is no more than 20 people in one group.</li> \n   <li>Outdoor and indoor fitness classes, with minimal shared equipment, can take place, limited to 20 participants.</li> \n   <li>Public swimming pools can open under strict rules, limited to 20 patrons per pool. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T02:08:03.538Z\">at 3.08am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb75c488f0858b1a810731b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T01:44:19.570Z\">2.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>McGowan says WA\u2019s hard border with the east coast \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The hard border, our regional travel restrictions, and our handling of the cruise ship crisis have all played a part in limiting the spread of Covid-19 across Western Australia.

If at the end point, people aren\u2019t going to do that and think that they\u2019ve only got a niggle in the throat and maybe they should go to work, it\u2019s not simply a sick leave issue.

  "<p>Temperature tests, taped-off lifts and potential spikes in harassment complaints are all being examined by British businesses as they prepare for a slow and staggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/uk-plan-for-returning-to-work-puts-peoples-health-at-risk-warns-tuc-coronavirus\">return to work</a>.</p> <p>Companies have already been scrambling for legal and practical advice as they prepare for the realities of managing workplaces during the Covid-19 crisis. However, there are already major concerns that workers are unclear about what to do if they are being put at risk, while industry figures also warn that the mental health impacts of returning to a new \u201calien environment\u201d are not being prioritised.</p> <p>Taped squares in lifts, protective screens between workstations and repurposed meeting rooms are among the basic measures being prepared. A wide range of businesses are said to be considering more drastic action, such as the introduction of temperature tests for staff on arrival, according to employment lawyers. Such testing is fraught with potential issues. The enforcement of testing \u2013 and recording whether or not a staff member has contracted coronavirus \u2013 are areas that could be tested in the courts.</p> <p>An increase in whistleblowing complaints is also likely, as workers see different employers taking varying approaches to the loosening of lockdown \u2013 a tension created by differing interpretations of government guidance.</p> <p>Kevin Rowan, the TUC\u2019s head of health and safety, warned that a huge public awareness campaign was needed to ensure workers know their rights.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the public information message so that people know what employers are required to do, and that there is somewhere they can go to complain?\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make that more transparent, as well as boosting enforcement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2254c37837d5b76b1b8b70b423c9eb7e99cb6e57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2254c37837d5b76b1b8b70b423c9eb7e99cb6e57/0_185_4377_2627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Companies could face a rash of sexual harassment claims.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Companies could face a rash of sexual harassment claims.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barbara Gindl/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also warnings of a spike in sexual harassment and other harassment allegations as employees readjust to life in the workplace, with some social distancing rules likely to remain in place.</p> <p>A memo composed by a London-based team at the law firm Morgan Lewis warns: \u201cEmployers may face a spike in employee misconduct, grievances and litigation as employees adapt to their new workplaces following the long period of isolation. For example, employers may see an increase in sexual harassment issues as employees return to the workplace, and other harassment complaints where employees fail to respect personal space or comply with safety guidelines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, business groups warn any significant return to work is entirely reliant on the reopening of schools and childcare. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cTo say to an employer that schools are going to be open for a couple of year groups on alternate days for a few hours at a time does not solve the problem of getting people back to work.\u201d</p> <p>The government is also being warned that it has to take the psychological impacts of lifting the lockdown as seriously as the logistical difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think what we\u2019ve seen so far recognises the emotional impact and anxiety that people will have of what is essentially an alien environment that some people will be returning to,\u201d said David D\u2019Souza, a director at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.</p> <h2><strong>Travel</strong></h2> <p>Both unions and employer groups have told the <em>Observer</em> that the main concern cropping up over the potential return to work is the commute. Employers will be urged to stagger shifts and start times far more to help ease the pressure on traditional peak-time services.</p> <p>\u201cAt the start of the pandemic, we were seeing pictures of congested trains,\u201d says Rowan. \u201cWhile that has eased a lot, there are still pretty regular concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Public transport bosses have warned that current social distancing rules would see them operating at 20% capacity or less, causing obvious concerns about those rules being breached or cars clogging up cities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/what-kind-of-face-mask-will-best-protect-you-against-coronavirus-covid-19\">Face masks</a> could allow public transport to be used in greater numbers. In Berlin, wearing masks on public transport is compulsory and social distancing is not required. However, the effectiveness of masks remains disputed. Measures have been taken overseas to reduce congestion in bus and train stations, but they are crude \u2013 usually in the form of painted lines denoting the correct social distancing space.</p> <p>Walking and cycling are being advised for some workers and there has been a major increase in bike-purchasing schemes. Temporary bike lanes are being considered in the UK.</p> <h2><strong>Arriving</strong></h2> <p>Testing upon arrival at work is being considered, with temperature tests the most practical and least invasive. \u201cInterest is wider than you would think,\u201d says Matthew Howse, who runs Morgan Lewis\u2019s employment practice team in London. Taping-off lifts to ensure safe social distancing is also being used, while companies have already thought about one-way systems in and out of buildings, as well as hand sanitiser stations at entrances.</p> <p>A major change in shift patterns may be needed to prevent the morning bottleneck. \u201cIt would be helpful if your workforce actually phased the shift rota so they arrive over a two or three-hour period,\u201d says Duncan Spencer, the former head of safety and health at John Lewis and now head of advice and practice at the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. \u201cYou could have an A and B shift, with some working from home.\u201d</p> <p>Many industry figures said the only realistic way to ensure social distancing was keeping high numbers of workers at home or continuing with a state job retention scheme, paying employees not to work. \u201cThere are things that employers can do, but you can\u2019t just turn the tap off on the job retention scheme because it may be that only a third of workers can go back to work and be safe,\u201d says Rowan.</p> <h2><strong>Workstations</strong></h2> <p>Advice on protecting workers has already been issued to companies that were allowed to stay open during the pandemic, such as the introduction of physical screens between workers. In offices, communal spaces such as meeting rooms will be repurposed, to spread out desks. Having workers face in opposite directions has already been advised.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you think there is that level of risk, should you be asking people to return at all?</p> <footer> <cite>David D\u2019Souza, Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Extra cleaning of frequently touched surfaces, from hand rails to photocopier buttons, is another simple measure \u2013 with many companies updating their contracts with cleaning staff.</p> <p>Once the easier measures have been completed, companies are left with what occupational health experts describe as the last resort in the \u201chierarchy of risk\u201d \u2013 personal protective equipment (PPE).

Some of the buildings may make it near impossible to adhere to social distancing within the kitchens or customer areas.\u201d</p> <p>Companies allowing food to be delivered will need to consider the extra hygiene and contamination precautions. Ministers are already encouraging takeaway outlets to reopen, but social distancing rules will leave many workers wondering if they should spend their lunch break in a queue or bring something with them.</p> <p>Laurie wonders if it will lead to an increase in the quality of the homemade lunch. \u201cWe may see a flourish of creativity in people\u2019s lunch boxes if homecooking has taken off during lockdown.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Meetings</strong></h2> <p>Existing guidance already tells businesses to limit the length of face-to-face meetings, if they have to happen at all \u2013 15 minutes or less has been the advice to some sectors.</p> <p>Videoconferencing has already allowed businesses to continue during the lockdown and that enforced technological take-up is likely to be relied upon for months. \u201cThings are working well with staff at home,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cBusinesses have experienced what in normal times would be a five- to 10-year shift to new ways of working in five weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Others are warning that it is that interaction with colleagues that many workers are craving \u2013 and the realities of the return to work could have a significant psychological impact. \u201cFor some people there is almost the comfort blanket of thinking about the return to the traditional working environment, with the buzz of being around colleagues, the camaraderie and the social benefits that come with being in work,\u201d says D\u2019Souza.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really unlikely in the short term that any workplace is going to feel anything other than unsettling and very sterile.

  "<p>Britain is in a lonely place right now. It resembles the scene of a bad traffic accident where shocked passers-by look away with pity and horror in their eyes. Alarmed by what they see, governments around the world practise their own form of social distancing. Once again, Britain is the sick man of Europe.</p> <p>Lethal mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic is not the sole reason for this un-splendid isolation. The disease\u2019s sudden onslaught is the third national disaster in almost as many years. The first was the decision to walk away from Europe. The second was the advent of Donald Trump and his anarchic America First agenda.</p> <p>However the virus\u2019s death toll is calculated, the perception is taking hold, abroad as at home, that the Johnson government\u2019s performance is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">one of the world\u2019s worst</a>, second possibly only to the US. Sympathy for Britain\u2019s plight has not forestalled scathing international criticism.</p> <p>Italians may surely be forgiven a sense of relief that their country is no longer Europe\u2019s biggest blackspot. With this unwanted title came the unspoken inference that Italy was uniquely unprepared. Some in the UK certainly saw it that way. They thought they were immune. They were betting, as usual, on a bogus British exceptionalism.</p> <p>Britain \u201cdid not pay enough attention to what was happening here\u201d, commented Beppe Severgnini in <em>Corriere della Sera</em>, referring to the two- to three-week period when Italy was ahead of the corona curve. The UK \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/complacent-uk-draws-global-criticism-for-covid-19-response-boris-johnson\">lost the advantage</a> that fate and Italy gave it... when it was obvious the virus was spreading\u201d.</p> <p>The view of Britain as Europe\u2019s \u201cproblem child\u201d predates the pandemic but has been greatly reinforced by it. Foreign perceptions of the UK as a badly governed, disorderly, embittered and chronically divided country took deep root in the politically chaotic years that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that outside observers who were surprised by the anger and passion aroused by Brexit simply did not understand Britain. But the stunning levels of incompetence, jingoism and arrogance displayed by the British side during the withdrawal talks dismayed many Europeans. It was genuinely unexpected.</p> <p>This altered view of Britain, or at least of Britain\u2019s government, as a not entirely serious, capable or trustworthy partner is not confined to Europe. Given that Brexit is premised on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d forging a web of dynamic new trade relationships, such reputational damage is potentially calamitous. Unpropitious, too, is the current plunge towards a world recession. The WTO predicts that trade may decline by up to 34%.</p> <p>What is China, for example, to make of leaders who fail to clearly disassociate from Trump\u2019s self-serving claims that Beijing deliberately spread what he calls the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d? Huffing and puffing on the Tory right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/10/government-wins-huawei-vote-despite-tory-rebellion\">over Huawei</a> hardly bolsters Britain\u2019s claim to be a free-trade champion open for business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s government is easy prey. The age of the unequal treaty is back - with Britain the loser this time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet Boris Johnson\u2019s government, ever more desperate for investment, is easy prey. Beijing\u2019s \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats will see the lack of substance at the heart of a remarkably low-calibre cabinet, and spot a chance for knockdown bargains. The age of the unequal treaty is back \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Unequal-Treaty\">Britain the loser</a> this time.<br><br>What is true of China is true in spades of Trump\u2019s America. Talks about a free-trade deal, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/uk-trade-talks-years-brexit-vote-200505220404884.html\">begun last week</a>, promise to expose the harsh reality of an isolated Britain\u2019s feeble leverage vis-\u00e0-vis a relentlessly self-interested superpower. Lowered food safety standards may be among many enforced compromises.<br><br>Yet the Trump presidency\u2019s negative impact on British interests and values far surpasses disputes about chlorinated chicken. Since 2017, Trump has blasted many holes in the foundations of UK security, defence and foreign policy. Britain long counted the US its foremost friend and vital ally. Now that bond is breaking.</p> <p>On the climate crisis, on Iran, on Nato, on Israel-Palestine, on the UN and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/us-quits-un-human-rights-council-cesspool-political-bias\">boycotted agencies</a> such as the Human Rights Council, on multilateralism in general, on the primacy of international law, on relations with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, and on limiting new nuclear weapons, Trump has mostly ignored Britain\u2019s views.<br><br>To this sorry list of spats, splits and schisms may be added Trump\u2019s support for big cuts in foreign aid, crude Islamophobia, the militarisation of space, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/trump-greenland-gambit-sad-sign-arctic-up-for-grabs\">commercial exploitation of the Arctic</a> and his worrying contempt for democracy, honesty and accountability, as revealed by the Mueller inquiry and his Senate impeachment.<br><br>What Johnson and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, dare not admit, for it would wholly explode their Brexit fantasies, is that Trump\u2019s America has become an unreliable, problematic and in some respects, hostile entity, with a tendency to belittle Britain, not build it up. His re-election would extend and intensify the nightmare.</p> <p>Trump, the greatest of all coronavirus failures, is dangerous to know. And yet still they hug him close, risking infection, petitioning for a deal at almost any cost, mimicking his anti-Europe, populist posturing, rejecting pandemic cooperation with the EU and insisting, even now, that Brexit will be sewn up by December. A stitch-up is more likely. It will end in tears.</p> <p>One disaster has swiftly followed another. Rarely in modern times has Britain\u2019s place in the world looked so precarious. Rarely has its global reputation for competence, pragmatism and good sense been so battered and disrespected. Rarely have its people and economy faced such challenges and such crippling levels of debt.</p> <p>Perhaps the last time the country stood alone like this, frightened, sickened, beleaguered, lacking funds and resources and separated from friends, was when it faced a deadly invasion of a different type, 80 years ago next month.

They used the stun gun as he jumped over a wall and he fell, suffering serious back injuries, which his family fear could leave him at least partially paralysed.</p> <p>The man, whose family have since been in contact with the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), was arrested for possession of cannabis with intent to supply and taken to hospital. The amount he had in his possession remains unclear.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an extremely serious incident where, we understand, a man has suffered life-changing injuries,\u201d said IOPC regional director Sal Naseem. \u201cWe are in contact with his family and will keep them and him informed as we carry out our independent investigation.</p> <p>\u201cOur role is to seek answers about what happened and share any learning highlighted by our investigations. Our investigation will look at all the circumstances and consider whether there are any conduct or criminal matters.\u201d</p> <p>Naseem added: \u201cIn line with our tradition of policing by consent, the public has the right to expect police officers to be accountable when they use force, particularly if it leads to a death or serious injury.\u201d</p> <p>Katrina Ffrench, chief executive of StopWatch \u2013 a coalition that promotes fair and accountable policing \u2013 said there was concern about the \u201congoing disproportionate and unnecessary\u201d use of force against black males. \u201cThis type of policing is not only dangerous for the individuals involved, but also obliterates people\u2019s trust and confidence in an emergency service,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe demand that officers be held to account and disciplined. There must be robust mechanisms put in place to ensure that national guidelines are adhered to, especially as Tasers can be lethal.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said the Metropolitan police had made a mandatory referral to them following the incident and that the force was fully cooperating. News of the incident emerged on Friday afternoon when the IOPC informed stakeholders.</p> <p>Det Ch Supt Treena Fleming, of the Met, said on Saturday afternoon: \u201cAll police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions \u2013 officers are not exempt from the law and we would not wish to be. Three officers have been informed they are under investigation and placed on local restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cMy senior leadership team and I are working hard to engage fully with our community partners, key stakeholders and the local authority.

Here was \u201cmeat in its natural state: unrefrigerated, unprocessed, unpackaged, uncooked and sometimes unslaughtered\u201d.</p> <p>Levinovitz, associate professor of religion at James Madison University, had already finished writing his new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/natural-9781788161985.html\">Natural</a>,</em> before the pandemic was unleashed. It is, nevertheless, an indispensable read, not least for all the \u201chumans are the virus\u201d memers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Societies are structured in ways that ensure that innovation and development remain the privilege of the few</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Concepts of \u201cnature\u201d and of the \u201cnatural\u201d have, Levinovitz shows, become synonyms for \u201cGod\u201d and the \u201choly\u201d. Humans are sinners not because we have disobeyed God but because we have violated nature, our teacher, in whose wisdom we must discover the moral rules by which we ought to live.</p> <p>Such a moral appeal to nature has long been the means of justifying particular human laws and structures. From interracial relationships to homosexuality, certain activities are deemed as transgressing natural boundaries and so to be forbidden. A ban on interracial marriage, as a Pennsylvania judge observed in 1865, was necessary to prevent the \u201ccorruption of races\u201d.</p> <p>Many supporters of interracial and same-sex marriage ironically also appeal to nature. Racial mixing, 19th-century campaigners argued, is found throughout history. Non-human species, contemporary LBGTQ activists insist, also exhibit same-sex attraction. \u201cNatural goodness,\u201d Levinovitz observes, is \u201ca mercenary ethic that anyone can hire to fight for their cause.\u201d It\u2019s one of the qualities of both God and nature that he or she is always on our side.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just supposedly aberrant lifestyles that are condemned as unnatural. From IVF to genetically modified food, from vaccines to cloning, critics view many scientific and technological advances as the desecration of nature. How nature <em>is</em> becomes seen as a template for what humans <em>ought</em> to do. And yet so much of human life \u2013 from the aspirin we take to alleviate pain to the fridge that helps prevent milk from souring \u2013 is a recognition that natural processes often work to our disadvantage, and the moral stance would be to keep them at bay.</p> <p>The romanticisation of the \u201cnatural\u201d is, Levinovitz notes, rooted in privilege. Only those who enjoy a lifestyle sufficiently protected from the ravages of nature have the licence to romanticise it. In countries with robust health systems, people have the dispensation to opt for natural childbirth, or alternative medicines, or reject vaccines. In much of the world in which \u201cnatural\u201d childbirth is an imposition on women, not a choice, both maternal and infant mortality rates are staggeringly high. It is poverty that condemns so many in the global south to rely on traditional medicine or to live without vaccines.</p> <p>After reading in the <em>New Yorker</em> about how much better was the \u201cnatural\u201d parenting style of the Matsigenka, a Peruvian Amazonian tribe, Levinovitz travelled to Peru to see for himself. He was disappointed that they lived not in a \u201cstate of nature\u201d but with solar panels and mobile phones. He asked a local whether he was \u201chappy about having electricity\u201d. \u201cHe looked at me with confusion,\u201d Levinovitz recalls: \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said flatly, as if explaining something to a child. \u2018Now we can see at night.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Of course, those who are most desperate for the unnatural wonders that people in rich nations take for granted \u2013 electricity, clean water, transport, refrigeration, medicines \u2013 are also most at risk from the depredations brought about by industrial society. Last week, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/gas-leak-at-chemical-factory-in-india-kills-hospitalises-lg-polymers\">least 11 people were killed</a> and hundreds hospitalised after an explosion and gas leak in a chemicals factory in the Indian town of Visakhapatnam.</p> <p>India remains haunted by memories of the terrible Bhopal disaster of 1984, when an explosion in a pesticide factory led to the release of deadly methyl isocyanate gas. Half a million people were exposed to the toxin, and up to 16,000 may have died. Almost 40 years on, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/the-worlds-worst-industrial-disaster-is-still-unfolding/560726/\">the site is still not detoxified</a>.</p> <p>It is the poor, whether in rich countries or in the global south, who most suffer from industrial pollution, are most imperilled by climate change and most threatened by the consequences of the coronavirus. This is not because humans are violating nature, but because societies are structured in ways that ensure that innovation and development remain the privilege of the few, while depredation and ill health are the lot of the many.</p> <p>Challenging both the lack of development and environmental devastation requires not fatuous claims that \u201chumans are the virus\u201d but confronting policies that limit innovation, impose inequality and put profits before people. It is the \u201cbad\u201d of the social, not the \u201cgood\u201d of the natural, that we need to address.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>Last week, driving to the shops, I passed a care home and saw a figure standing at an upstairs window: an old woman looking out at a world she could not enter. She looked like a prisoner. And in a way, that\u2019s probably what she was.</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk about old people. Let\u2019s talk about people in care homes, about people living with dementia and dying with dementia, out of sight and out of mind, and what the lockdown means for them. Let\u2019s talk about what we are not talking about enough, not thinking about enough, not caring about enough.</p> <p>Of course we should be dismayed and angry at the lack of personal protective equipment in hospitals \u2013 but what about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/protective-equipment-being-diverted-from-care-homes-to-hospitals-say-bosses\">in care homes</a>? We should clap for NHS workers and recognise their courageous, crucial work \u2013 but what about also celebrating carers, those men and women who are badly paid or not paid at all, who are barely recognised for doing the hard work of looking after the frail, the defenceless, the invisible crowd of humans we may prefer to forget?</p> <p>It is estimated that approximately a sixth or more of all deaths from Covid-19 have occurred in care homes, although their residents only account for about 1% of the population. In England and Wales, in the week ending 17 April, nearly 25% of recorded deaths from the virus happened there. The peak of infection is said to have passed \u2013 but in care homes it is accelerating, and recorded Covid-19 care home deaths are now running at approximately 2,500 a week. One care home provider has said that death rates are now eight times the rate of admission. In Scotland, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52284281\">40% of its 2,272 </a>deaths from the virus up to 26 April took place in care homes. Many experts believe that the eventual death toll will be higher in these settings than in hospitals. In Spain, it is now thought that <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHNMSjMhrSVtZZkQwvqvpxqFlX\">more than two-thirds of deaths </a>from coronavirus have been in care homes. Outside one home in New York, trucks were parked to store bodies. It\u2019s carnage.</p> <p>At first, the old and the vulnerable were airbrushed out of the UK picture: until the end of April, only deaths from the virus that occurred in hospital were counted, which was why on 29 April, the figures suddenly jumped by 4,000. And then, the old and vulnerable became almost like collateral damage: people were dying, dying in their hundreds and thousands \u2013 \u201cbut\u201d they were old. It\u2019s sad, of course, but not very sad, for the old aren\u2019t us. They\u2019re different, the others, the ones who don\u2019t matter so much because they\u2019re at the end of things, not the fresh beginning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Time changes the meaning of isolation for someone who is old and vulnerable and may not have much time left</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since those who are old are at high risk, many care settings have become like fortresses or besieged cities \u2013 no one\u2019s allowed in, because they might carry the virus and release it to run amok among the most vulnerable. But if the virus is dangerous and often deadly, so too is isolation for people living with dementia.</p> <p>At the start of the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-hospitals-tightening-restrictions-on-visits-even-to-dying-patients-coronavirus\">hospitals suspended visitors</a>, but made three exceptions: patients were allowed to have one partner or visitor if they were receiving end-of-life care, were in labour, or were children. A few weeks later, after heartbreak and devastation, a fourth category of visitor was added to the NHS guidance: patients who had mental health conditions such as dementia, where the absence of a loved one would cause distress and damage \u2013 because isolation is dangerous for those who are frail and confused; it can be fatal.</p> <p>Many hospitals are still not following this clear and explicit advice: John\u2019s Campaign \u2013 \u201cfor the right to stay with people with dementia\u201d \u2013 looked at the websites of 52 mental health trusts and found that only 12 were allowing close relatives access to mental health in-patients. And it is clear that many acute hospitals are also failing to open their doors to the people whom their vulnerable patients need the most.</p> <p> There are approximately 220 NHS hospital trusts; there are more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52284281\">15,000 care homes (with about 450,000 residents)</a>, and they have been given no clear guidance. Some of them are still allowing family carers in, with the obvious caveat that they follow strict procedures. Many have chosen to control infection by closing their doors \u2013 except in some cases, to receive patients discharged from hospital, even when they have had Covid-19, in order to free up hospital beds. On care home websites, there are statements of regret at the distress this may cause both to residents and to their families, and assurances that members of staff are doing their utmost to step into the yawning gap.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the staff \u2013 the great, unsung army of men and women classed as \u201cunskilled\u201d who do the hardest job for the lowest pay and who now have to witness the daily anguish of those they look after \u2013 are doing their best. But there are approximately 120,000 vacancies in care homes, and a paid carer isn\u2019t a family carer, or a partner or spouse or daughter or son or grandchild. A paid carer isn\u2019t an intimate, can\u2019t be the memory, the gatekeeper, the beloved link to the familiar world.</p> <p>The public has been asked to make sacrifices in these lockdown days. People with dementia have not been asked. Some are enduring an enforced isolation that is a violation of their fundamental human rights, and many of them simply do not understand why they can no longer see those they are close to. They ask for them and are refused. They feel abandoned and scared. Many will deteriorate, many will never recover from this deterioration. It will be terminal. There are other ways of dying than from the virus.</p> <p>The pandemic isn\u2019t going away any time soon. People talk about months, even years. Time changes the meaning of isolation for someone who is old and vulnerable and who may not have much time left. It turns it into profound suffering. It shocks me that the close relative of someone with dementia is not allowed to see their loved one. Can\u2019t they be trusted to obey rules of hygiene, of social distancing, or to keep away from the home if they feel unwell? In hospital and residential settings, essential carers are just that \u2013 essential, as vital as the paid carer or the nurse or the doctor. There are many ways of dying, and many ways of saving a life.</p> <p>The transformation of a home into a jail, which has led some relatives to turn to the law to try to break out their loved one, has been done for good motives, and in the name of protection. But such enforced loneliness is cruel and is wrong. It causes untold pain and harm. Children calling to their trapped parent through a fence, comforting them despairingly through a closed door. The helpless attempt at communication by phone, by Zoom. Last goodbyes by Skype. Death alone.</p> <p>The virus has laid bare gross inequalities in the country. People living and dying with dementia \u2013 at home or in hospital or a care home \u2013 are among the most vulnerable in society, and they are also the easiest to ignore and forget.

  "<p>Almost all the desks at Ecotricity\u2019s headquarters in Stroud are empty. Pot plants, cards and personal photos are the only signs of the hundreds of employees at the green-energy firm who used to file in and out of the building in the Cotswold town every day.</p> <p>Like most office-based employers, the firm\u2019s founder, Dale Vince, sent virtually all of his 700-strong workforce home at the start of the lockdown in March. Now he is considering how to bring some of them back in anticipation of government guidance for reopening non-essential businesses.</p> <p>He admits that the Gloucestershire company is unlikely to return to the days of routine face-to-face meetings and rows of staff chatting across computers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush back into \u2018business as usual\u2019. Some of our functions have worked really well during the lockdown,\u201d he says in his glass-plated office.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping we will be able to sell two of our three offices in Stroud. We will then space ourselves out in this one and a new one over the road. We\u2019ll operate a cycle of working from home and from the office, where we will arguably end up with half as much space.\u201d</p> <p>Halving the number of people in the office at any one time will allow staff to keep their distance and avoid sitting opposite each other. \u201cWe will be giving everyone more space,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Vince, who spent 10 years as a new-age traveller before launching the UK\u2019s first green electricity company, believes that now is the right time to plan the reopening of workplaces. However, he acknowledges that his workers will face a degree of risk when they return. \u201cIf we are going to exist in lockdown, we are going to have to take some risks,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality is that the virus hasn\u2019t gone away and there\u2019s no vaccine, but we\u2019re going to live in the gap in between.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People don\u2019t want to work from home all the time \u2013 it is too isolating</p> <footer> <cite>Dale Vince</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Staff who are worried or have vulnerabilities will be under no pressure to go back to their desks. \u201cWe will not be forcing anyone to come in and take a risk they are not comfortable with,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Vince, 58, has also been thinking about how to restart his other diverse interests, including a wind turbine factory, a kitchen making vegan school meals and the country\u2019s only vegan football club, <a href=\"https://www.fgr.co.uk/\">Forest Green Rovers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFootball is probably the least of the issues because games played behind closed doors are very controllable,\u201d he says. \u201cPutting people back into office spaces, back on the roads, back into town \u2013 that\u2019s much harder to control.\u201d</p> <p>Ecotricity has seen its turnover fall by about 20% as commercial power consumption has dropped, but Vince insists all his workers, including the 50 employees furloughed on 100% of their wages, have nothing to worry about. \u201cThey will definitely come back to jobs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There are some positive lessons to be learned from the country\u2019s mass home-working experiment, with traffic down and emissions reduced. But Vince acknowledges that people still need offices: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to work from home all the time \u2013 it is too isolating. We can get the best of both worlds by cycling from one to the other.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Pavlos Pandelides realised the coronavirus pandemic was moving west, he bought a plane ticket and flew from Athens to London. He then drove north to Nottingham to collect his daughter, a student at the city\u2019s university, before returning with her the next day to Greece. An ardent admirer of all things British, the businessman had absolutely no doubt that what he was doing was right. \u201cThe British are fighters but I could see they were underestimating this,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>While Covid-19 was tearing through northern Italy, Boris Johnson was still faltering, with his government showing worrying signs of complacency.

He went to a friend whose theatre company, <a href=\"http://www.withwings.co.uk/\" title=\"\">withWings</a>, took inventive musical adaptations to the Edinburgh fringe. That year they were doing <em>Le Bossu</em>, a retelling of <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>. Patel mentioned that he wanted to get out of his comfort zone and do some theatre. \u201cHe came back to me and said, \u2018Cool, well, I can offer you the role of a pigeon.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Most actors who had spent their lives being watched by 8m viewers, four nights a week, would be unwilling to start again at the bottom rung of acting. (The pigeon was a bit part.) But Patel, now 29, leapt at the chance.</p> <p>\u201cAnd, honestly, playing that pigeon, for so many reasons, was one of the most important things I ever did. I remember that feeling being side of stage as the lights went down \u2013 that fear was so visceral. Then, as the run went on, it slowly ebbed away. It let me become a more extroverted performer, which set me up for what came next.\u201d</p> <p>What came next was a starring role in Danny Boyle\u2019s counter-factual caper <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/05/yesterday-review-the-beatles-richard-curtis-danny-boyle-himesh-patel\" title=\"\">Yesterday</a></em>, in which Patel stars as Jack Malik who, after a freak thunderstorm, is the only person on earth who remembers the music of the Beatles. Malik becomes a star overnight, plays Wembley with Ed Sheeran, and is hailed as the greatest songwriter of his generation. The film transformed Patel\u2019s life with similar force. His follow-up roles have all screamed prestige: leading turns in Armando Iannucci\u2019s sci-fi spoof <em>Avenue 5</em> and the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Eleanor Catton\u2019s <em>The Luminaries</em>, the 2013 novel, set in the New Zealand goldrush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84096c19d2116a39f2b26698956e4af45af16491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84096c19d2116a39f2b26698956e4af45af16491/0_1219_4912_6141/800.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel in profile in a brightly coloured patterned shirt\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s the responsibility, as someone British, to say that this story about Indian soldiers is a British story\u2019: Himesh Patel.

When Patel started shooting, he was most concerned about how freezing Illinois gets in January. Then, as more news came from China, the strangeness of the situation started to sink in.</p> <p>\u201cThe episode we filmed was the beginning of the outbreak. It felt incredibly odd, making a show about a global pandemic, and now here we are.\u201d The oddest moment, he says, was finding out that production of a series about a pandemic was now on hold because of a pandemic. </p> <p>We meet on a weekday lunchtime at a pub in Islington, London in that eerie period before the enforced lockdown when pubs and restaurants are still open but people are furiously washing their hands and firing evil glares at anyone clearing their throat. The pub has posters declaring that the toilet doors have been jammed open so you don\u2019t have to touch any handles. It means the faint sound of ablutions can be heard throughout our conversation.</p> <p>Patel arrives straight from the photoshoot, an experience he tentatively enjoyed. His parents own a newsagents in the small village of Sawtry, near Cambridge, and he likes knowing that they\u2019ll get the papers in one morning and see photos of him looking suave. He hasn\u2019t always been a fan of Sunday supplements. As a teenager, he had to help out his folks by doing the local paper round. Weekends, he says, were always the worst. \u201cThe papers were full of magazines! So I\u2019d have to walk up the hill, then go back down, and then go further up the hill because you can\u2019t carry them all at once.\u201d</p> <p>His childhood days were crammed.</p> <p>As well as school and the paper round, he went to several different drama schools. He giggles when I ask what it was that set apart the kinds of kids he met at those after-school classes. \u201cWe were all a bit odd, mimicking things we\u2019d seen on telly, creating these little pop-culture storms within our own lives. Maybe some of us were quite attention-hungry, but we were alive with this energy. It\u2019s the antithesis of a maths lesson. It\u2019s about play.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0e45c8a3400599d7c18c3788c67b6a21d190ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e45c8a3400599d7c18c3788c67b6a21d190ba4/220_202_1615_969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel as a teenager with Meryl Fernandes in EastEnders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was important for me to be on national TV and doing a paper round at the same time\u2019: Himesh Patel, with Meryl Fernandes in EastEnders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was 16 when a new executive producer on <em>EastEnders</em>, Diederick Santer, began an overhaul of the families on the soap to make it \u201cfeel more 21st century\u201d. That included introducing a Pakistani family on the show, the Masoods. Patel was nervous in the audition for Tamwar Masood and thought he\u2019d ruined his chances when he told producers he didn\u2019t really watch the show. But they saw something in him and, once on board, he went about turning Tamwar into one of the most unusual characters in soap. He was removed and analytical. He existed almost outside the show, a kind of geeky flaneur who saw the absurdity of Albert Square in the same way the audience did. In a show that\u2019s always been about dramatic bust-ups and big acting, Patel played against the action: quiet and pitying, often lingering in the back of someone else\u2019s family crisis. Patel quickly became a fan favourite. His character\u2019s marriage to Afia Khan (Meryl Fernandes) won the pair <em>Inside Soap </em>award for best wedding.</p> <p>His parents, though proud, were also insistent that the paper round must continue. \u201cThose were the days,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be, like, \u2018It\u2019s the weekend, I\u2019m trudging round the village in the rain, why am I having to do this?\u2019 But I look back on it fondly. It was important for me to be on national TV and be doing a paper round at the same time. It was just a daily reminder of being brought back down to earth.\u201d</p> <p>By his mid-20s, Patel was beginning to look at the career paths available to him. \u201cThere\u2019s a thin line between being on a soap and being a celebrity. You often see people from <em>EastEnders</em> going to do <em>I\u2019m a Celebrity</em> or <em>Strictly</em> \u2013 which is great if that\u2019s what you want to do. But from going to a lot of these awards ceremonies, it wasn\u2019t somewhere I was ever going to enjoy myself.\u201d</p> <p>He said the decision to leave was both easy and scary. \u201cI\u2019d been doing it since I was 16 and it was all I\u2019d known as an adult. It was a leap of faith. I remember on that last day I drove out the gates that last time, and I just thought: here we go, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>His certainty about wanting to do something more than <em>Strictly</em> is the result of his particular upbringing, he says. The closest town growing up was Huntingdon, in the heart of John Major\u2019s old constituency. (Patel\u2019s mother would always point out his house when they drove past.) He didn\u2019t have any traumatic experiences of racism growing up, \u201cbut there were very few people who looked like me and there is a part of you that you consciously or subconsciously dilute in order to fit in. There are a lot of feelings that I grew up with that I later started to realise I wasn\u2019t alone in feeling, and that perhaps there\u2019s something to be done about that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c92a3bea7b60d69014f63b14d708a4cbe2cb7f1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c92a3bea7b60d69014f63b14d708a4cbe2cb7f1b/0_42_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel on stage with a guitar in a scene from \u201cYesterday.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guitar man: in Yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His adolescence left him with a dogged feeling of responsibility \u2013 to make it easier for the next generation of kids like him. He talks about \u201cresponsibility\u201d a lot. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s the responsibility, as someone British, to say: \u2018This is also British, the story that I\u2019m telling you about my parents, or Indian soldiers that fought in the world wars.\u2019 These stories are also British. At a time when people want to limit the idea of Britishness, physically speaking, I think I\u2019d quite like to broaden it.\u201d</p> <p>He gives the example of Britain\u2019s colonial history in India, something he feels mainstream Britain has never properly wrestled with. \u201cWe watched a lot of Indian movies growing up, and every now and then there\u2019d be one about British rule, but I never really learned about that in school. So there was a disconnect between these films I was watching, set during a very turbulent time in India\u2019s history, and school, where we might be taught that Gandhi was a liberator, but not what he was liberating from.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not angry at people who haven\u2019t taken the time to learn that history, he says, but he sees his role as bringing those stories to them. He talks about watching <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> in history class, how it brought to life a war he would have otherwise struggled to imagine. \u201cOne of the most powerful ways of finding out about stuff is TV and film. If I can, in my current position, get the ball rolling on some of those stories then I\u2019d really like to do that.\u201d (He says he has writing and acting projects in the works that would fulfil that brief.)</p> <p>It\u2019s a sense of duty that imbues much of Patel\u2019s life. Even when we\u2019re talking about <em>The Luminaries</em>, in which he plays Emery Staines, a young prospector, conversation veers back to the importance of minority stories in national history. During the six months he spent in New Zealand filming the show, which will air later this year, he was impressed by the public\u2019s understanding of a wide range of historical events. \u201cI fell in love with the culture. For a country that was a colonial outpost, as it were, they\u2019ve really made efforts to integrate the indigenous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/m-ori\" title=\"\">M\u0101ori</a> culture. The country is not without its troubles, but we went up to Waitangi, where the British signed a treaty with the M\u0101ori, and even just tiny gestures, like the signs being both in English and in M\u0101ori. A lot of people who I met who were not of M\u0101ori descent were just as aware of that history, which was commendable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3932dabf4530e7a189fc137a13648f7bfa23f33e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3932dabf4530e7a189fc137a13648f7bfa23f33e/869_48_2249_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel with Eve Hewson in The Luminaries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costume drama: with Eve Hewson in The Luminaries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One concrete change he is trying to make is through his membership of Bafta, which was heavily criticised for all-white shortlists in a number of award categories. Patel was one of several actors who offered alternative shortlists in protest: \u201cThe oddity for me is how an amazing film such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-south-korean-satire\" title=\"\">Parasite</a></em> did so well and yet none of the actors got nominated.\u201d</p> <p>I ask whether he ever feels annoyed having to hand over his annual Bafta membership fee (not cheap at \u00a3495), when the awards fail to recognise diverse talent again and again. Does there ever come a point where the institutions themselves should be left to fail?</p> <p>\u201cI know some people feel like that, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m there yet because the impact of things like the Baftas is still huge. I grew up in a rural place, naive to how a lot of the industry works. For me watching the Baftas was a big deal. When <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/slumdog-millionaire\" title=\"\">Slumdog</a> Millionaire</em> won all those awards I thought, wow it\u2019s relevant on that level. So now I\u2019m a member I want to change things from the inside.\u201d</p> <p>Patel has a persistent seriousness about him. His manner is more that of an activist: dogged and thoughtful. The paper round, the pigeon, the desire to make movies that get shown in a classroom\u2026 it all reflects a person entirely uninterested in flashness. We all want to be seen as compassionate, but surely he has moments of indulging his new wealth and celebrity? What\u2019s been his most lavish purchase?</p> <p>\u201cMmm, well recently I kept seeing Teslas everywhere, so I did have a brief look at their website kind of going, \u2018Well, it\u2019s good for the planet isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But it is still very expensive. And I live in London, so I don\u2019t need a car.\u201d Instead, he says, he bought a new camera. \u201cMy dad always had cameras around. I like the very quiet way of saying things through photography. There\u2019s something about the ambiguity, and the silence of a photo...\u201d I am convinced, with the sombreness of this remark, this is the real Himesh.</p> <p><em>The Luminaries will screen on BBC Two later this year</em></p> <p><em>Grooming by Petra Sellge at The Wall Group using Living Proof; photographer\u2019s assistant Harry Brayne; fashion assistant Peter Bevan; shot at Big Sky Studios</em></p>",

  "<p>A commonplace criticism of political parties is that they have drifted \u201cinto their comfort zone\u201d, which mostly means that Labour talks a lot about raising spending, while the Conservatives talk about cutting taxes. But politicians have comfort zones that are operational as well as ideological: ways of working that they find more attractive than others.</p> <p>In late 2014, one ambitious young shadow cabinet minister asked his aides to draw up a 14-point plan to help him become leader of the Labour party. Step two involved an itemised list of Labour MPs, each of whom, he was told, he needed to wine and dine if he was to have any hope of making a successful bid at the job. The frontbencher in question contemplated evening after evening spent in conversation with his colleagues versus time spent with his wife and children. Surely, he reasoned, he could achieve the same end by writing thoughtful columns in the newspapers and delivering wide-ranging speeches? His leadership bid never recovered.</p> <p>The government has, similarly, fallen back into its comfort zone in the fight against coronavirus. There are few problems in life that Whitehall doesn\u2019t seek to solve through swallowing up our personal details: if the second coming were to take place in modern Britain, the authorities would doubtless immediately want Jesus to fill in 2,000 years of backdated tax returns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government regardless of its political hue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Officialdom\u2019s addiction to hoovering up information has numerous benefits: it has allowed the Office for National Statistics to establish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">a link between ethnicity and the risk of dying</a> of Covid-19, because it was able to eliminate other explanations \u2013 income level, household type, occupation and so on \u2013 through the use of the vast reams of information that the state collects.</p> <p>But the downside of the government\u2019s appetite for surveillance can be found in the NHSX <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\">contact tracing app</a> that is a vital plank of any attempt to keep new infections down and isolate outbreaks once lockdown ends. Although the app asks only for a postcode, storing the information centrally will allow the government, armed with the huge amounts of data it already holds, to identify other facts and secrets about the app\u2019s users. That horrifies privacy campaigners, but the biggest problem in practice will be the efficiency of the app. As designed, it is a battery hog that saps the life from users\u2019 phones \u2013 probably a far bigger barrier to people downloading it than its implications for surveillance. A second app is now in development \u2013 one that will be free of the government\u2019s tendency to collect as much information as it can about citizens.</p> <p>The endless desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government, regardless of its political hue. But this government has also reverted to a comfort zone that is distinct to itself: treating the battle against the virus as if it were a battle against a rival political party, one to be defeated by a savvy media strategy and careful leaks to preferred outlets. Genuine transparency should be kept to a minimum, with real news confined to setpiece events featuring the government\u2019s biggest gun, the prime minister.</p> <p>As a method to dispatch Labour in 2019, it worked like a charm. As an approach to defeating Covid-19 it lacks a certain something. Leaks beget leaks \u2013 cabinet ministers see that leaks are emerging from \u201cDowning Street\u201d and grumble to journalists; civil servants surmise that their bosses are spreading stories too, and also complain to the press. The process has also led to a muddled understanding of what exactly is being eased and when.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer 'a collaborator' in any politically painful decisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reality is that the changes to how we live \u2013 people to be able to go out for exercise twice a day, garden centres to be reopened \u2013 are minor and sensible. The disease spreads less effectively in the open air, provided people observe physical distancing. It\u2019s easy to observe social distancing in garden centres, which will, in any case, probably fold if they cannot reopen over the coming months, which are as important to them as Christmas is to the high street. But the drip-drip of headlines suggesting an \u201cend\u201d to lockdown has made some voters think the government is taking unnecessary risks, and encouraged others to take unnecessary risks of their own, safe in the apparent certainty that the lockdown will soon be ended.</p> <p>The comfort zone strategy has real long-term downsides, too. MPs generally agree that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/pmqs-verdict-floundering-johnson-meets-calm-and-focused-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> has had a good week: the Labour leader\u2019s call for the government to publish its lockdown exit plan has been validated twice over, once by the unhelpful culture of leaks and hints about what is to come, and once because, when all is said and done, the government will have actually produced and published an exit strategy.</p> <p>The fear among Labour MPs, however, is that the government will try to bind Starmer to any unpopular measures he signs up to. One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer \u201ca collaborator\u201d in any politically painful decisions. Hardly anyone believes that the global increase in the popularity of incumbent governments will last all the way to the next general election, but many think it will be harder for Starmer to criticise the government\u2019s unpopular decisions \u2013 of which, it\u2019s assumed, there will be many, due to the economic consequences of the lockdown \u2013 if he has been brought into the fold.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has had regular conversations with the opposition parties, but he has thus far failed to establish any crucial moments at which Starmer\u2019s hands are also at the tiller. The leaks have also allowed the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, neither of which have been without fault during the crisis, to assert their distinctiveness from Westminster simply by clearly communicating a near-identical approach openly and transparently, rather than through the pages of favoured papers.</p> <p>But the comfort zone approach has obscured an issue that ought to be a real source of political pain for Johnson and Starmer. The way out of lockdown isn\u2019t a mystery: governments must first reduce the rate of new transmissions to as close to zero as possible, and then have the necessary infrastructure to test at scale, track the movements of possible carriers, and isolate the infected as and when new outbreaks emerge.</p> <p>There are two barriers in the UK\u2019s path to that destination. The first is logistical: Britain doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to implement a system of testing, tracking and isolating infections. That is a painful area for the Conservatives, as it means discussing whether they have fallen short in procurement, or if the spending decisions taken since 2010 have left the state ill prepared for crisis.</p> <p>But the second barrier is painful for both parties: a functioning system of testing, tracing and isolating new cases would require a major reduction in our liberties and a prolonged period of increased surveillance. It\u2019s far from clear that there is a majority in parliament for that approach, and it\u2019s not a natural political position for Johnson or Starmer. Both are commonly said to be \u201cinstinctive liberals\u201d, though their records at the big organisations they ran, whether as mayor of London or director of public prosecutions, are muddier than that.</p> <p>What matters more is that most British people are not liberals, instinctive or otherwise. It\u2019s easy to forget that while New Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/27/theresa-may-scrapping-id-cards\">ID cards scheme</a> was unpopular within the party and in parliament, it enjoyed <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/05/12/majority-brits-support-introducing-id-cards\">majority support</a> in the country as a whole. The great British public has enthusiastically embraced CCTV, and no successful political party in the democratic era has been without a generous bung to the police. Whether the SNP in 2007, Johnson in 2019 or even Jeremy Corbyn in 2017, the way to win votes and influence people in British politics has long run on an authoritarian axis.</p> <p>So what will happen if British politics is dominated by two men, neither of whom are instinctively minded to point to the clearest and safest way out of lockdown? The lesson of Johnson\u2019s recent electoral success, in which he tapped into a political demand that has long existed \u2013 for a party that is tough on migrants and criminals but spends lavishly on the NHS and schools \u2013 but has been unavailable to voters since 2005, is that eventually the voters get what the voters want. If neither Johnson nor Starmer is willing to leave their comfort zone, they may find that someone else will.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Bush is the political editor of the <em>New Statesman</em></p>",

Allin-Khan reported that the government\u2019s failures were contributing to a greater loss of life and she wanted answers on its testing strategy. The health secretary awkwardly responded by suggesting that Allin-Khan\u2019s testimony was untrue and moreover, that she \u201cmight do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state\u2019s book in terms of tone\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWatch your tone!\u201d Allin-Khan exhales, still in mild disbelief. \u201cI have written to the government several times since March, asking why we haven\u2019t followed WHO guidelines, asking for clearer messaging on social distancing, urging for more PPE. I\u2019ve had no response. I was bringing messages from the frontline,\u201d she says over the phone from her home in south London.</p> \n<p>The exchange went viral <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1257644583158251522\">after she tweeted it</a>, morphing into a meme online then as a talking point on Good Morning Britain, Sky News, BBC News, LBC and beyond. Being patronised by Hancock was one thing, but to be dismissed so audaciously on the day the UK reported the highest death toll in Europe galls her.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was very courteous in my delivery. If Matt Hancock found it difficult, that\u2019s on him. Addressing the fact that lives could have been saved and families\u2019 hearts might not have been broken had we got on top of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/08/antibody-tests-coronavirus-how-do-they-work-10-steps\">testing </a>earlier? These are legitimate questions that people all across the country have. I was very polite. He didn\u2019t like the content, so instead felt it easier to make a derogatory comment towards me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Allin-Khan says she is used to confounding people. Her mother is Polish and her father is Pakistani and she grew up in a poor household in the constituency she now represents as \u201ca proud British Muslim\u201d. She describes her upbringing as \u201cdifficult \u2026 turbulent\u201d.</p> \n<p>She won\u2019t elaborate out of sensitivity towards her parents, except to say it meant \u201cI failed my A-levels spectacularly\u201d. Nonetheless, at 24, Allin-Khan ended up reading medicine at Cambridge and gained a masters in public health before working as a doctor in disaster zones across the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are still confused by who I am or what I am,\u201d she says, of the layers of ignorance she has navigated her whole life. \u201cThe biggest learning journey I have had as a politician is seeing how much I can be hated for being eastern European, for being Pakistani, for being Muslim. I never came from a political background. The vitriol shocked me.\u201d</p> \n<p>At 42, alongside her constituency work, Allin-Khan serves as a shadow cabinet minister for mental health and is an amateur boxer, wife, and mother to two children under six. She stopped her campaign for Labour\u2019s deputy leadership in March and then went to work treating Covid-19 patients at St George\u2019s hospital in south London and at the newly opened Nightingale. The experience has been harrowing and frightening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a8abdae1ea938c176290ded3d9a133bdc4f0ebb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a8abdae1ea938c176290ded3d9a133bdc4f0ebb/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors on frontline in fight against Covid-19 prepare ward.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frontline doctors face the heartbreak of passing on \u2018goodbye messages\u2019 from loved ones to patients dying of Covid-19, says Dr Allin-Khan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cFamilies are begging me for a miracle I can\u2019t give them. You\u2019re unable to console them with a hug or a touch on the shoulder. You have to watch their hearts break, you\u2019re the one delivering goodbye messages to their loved ones,\u201d Allin-Khan takes a pause. \u201cMessages like \u2018please hold on, Dad\u2019, \u2018please hold on for the kids\u2019 \u2013 it puts chills through your body but you have to hold it together and stay strong for these families. It is very hard to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>At home, her children have been taught not to run to her until she has stripped her clothes into the washing machine and showered. She uses separate cutlery, crockery and towels from her family and has found herself in tears \u201cwondering about how many of all those deaths could have been avoided\u201d. She has found the clapping for key workers \u201ca wonderful way for communities to feel they are supporting frontline staff. It\u2019s an opportunity to say thank you\u201d. But she is scornful that it is \u201ca pointless exercise if government ministers clap, but don\u2019t provide resources the NHS needs\u201d. </p> \n<p>Allin-Khan became a Labour councillor during her first maternity leave in 2014, winning \u201cin a local ward that had been Conservative for 24 years\u201d. Two years later, just after the birth of her second child, Sadiq Khan left his Tooting seat to become mayor of London and Allin-Khan was encouraged to stand.</p> \n<p>There were 119 candidates up for selection and she found the campaign gruelling; the Daily Mail published old photos of her in a bikini, claiming that the working-class doctor had in fact been a secret swimwear model with \u201ca glamorous past\u201d. At the time, she was distraught. \u201cThat people would be out there trying to tarnish my character over something that wasn\u2019t true and deliberately using my ethnicity and religion to try and humiliate me was upsetting. It can be all-consuming.\u201d But she says she kept on \u201cbecause I have a work ethic that means that once I commit to doing something, I give 2,000%\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> Allin-Khan was elected the day MP Jo Cox was murdered in 2016. \u201cIt was horrific,\u201d she says flatly, at the time unsure of what she had got herself into. </p> \n<p>Allin-Khan claims not to have any political heroes \u2013 \u201cmine are more everyday heroes\u201d \u2013 but says she became more interested in politics at university. \u201cThe Labour party did change my life and gave me opportunities that wouldn\u2019t have happened under the status quo,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been possible for someone with a background like mine to have gone to medical school otherwise.\u201d</p> \n<p>Witnessing the erosion of the health service firsthand has been a prime motivator for her political energy. \u201cI am so grateful to be doing the work I always did, but now I have MP after my name and suddenly people are interested. I can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is indisputable to Allin-Khan that coronavirus has escalated a system already in crisis. \u201cUncertainty breeds anxiety. Labour wants to support the government to get this right. Our priority is protecting public health, but we do need a consensus on what happens next.\u201d Is there a sense that criticism has been tempered in the Commons chamber for the sake of fostering national unity?</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody likes political point-scoring, but it is a challenge not to be able to scrutinise decisions that affect the whole country. Things like Boris Johnson announcing a press conference on Sunday to decide the future of the country? That sort of announcement should be made in parliament where there can be due diligence and scrutiny.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Public Health England review into why so many BAME people are dying disproportionately from Covid-19 fills her with similar frustration. \u201cI have reservations about the review and how it will be conducted.\u201d Referring to the controversial appointment to the review of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/equality-and-human-rights-commission-ehrc\">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> who has been suspended from the Labour party over allegations of Islamophobia, she says: \u201cWe need to have trust in this review. Our BAME communities deserve it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Allin-Khan says she was underestimated at the beginning of her political career, but that it only fuelled her to keep going. \u201cI\u2019m an ordinary woman living an extraordinary life, and I am driven very much by what is right and what is wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I lose my seat tomorrow, I will have been grateful to have represented my community and saved as many lives as I could. That\u2019s why when Matt Hancock said what he said, I just thought no. No, I won\u2019t watch my tone \u2013 I\u2019ve got something I need to say.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2020 because an earlier version said that Allin-Khan \u201cdropped out of Labour\u2019s deputy leadership campaign in March\u201d.

  "<p>Leading nurseries are urging the government to let them help primary schools cope with social distancing rules by allowing children to stay in their pre-school classes for months longer than planned.</p> <p>Primary schools are expected to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/03/primary-schools-england-could-reopen-june-boris-johnson-coronavirus\">first to reopen</a>, but many are concerned about the basic practicalities of doing so. A group of 70 prominent providers has written to ministers, setting out how the nurseries can help. It says that encouraging more children to start school in January or April next year, rather than this September, could ease the problems and help children cope with life after lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very aware of the difficulties faced by young children who will be transitioning back into settings, and for some also due to move on to primary school settings in just a few months, having spent in many cases a number of months away from their key attachments and familiar learning environments,\u201d the group writes.</p> <p>As well as protecting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/07/prioritise-play-when-schools-reopen-say-mental-health-experts-coronavirus-lockdown\">emotional wellbeing of children</a>, the group says it would ease the \u201congoing social distancing demands placing additional pressure on schools\u201d.</p> <p>Such a move would not require changes in the law, but the group says it would need schools to guarantee places for children starting later in the academic year. It would also require councils to pay schools as if the children had started in September, as well as continuing to fund the pre-school places.</p> <p>The Early Years Covid 19 Response group, which includes Kids Planet, Care Concern Nurseries and Old Station Nurseries, also calls for clarity on how councils will help them through the transition period as parents return to work, as well as clear advice on the use of personal protective equipment.</p> <p>It comes with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/childcare-industry-crushed-by-coronavirus-crisis\">crisis looming in post-coronavirus childcare</a>. More than 10,000 childcare providers in the UK are likely to have folded or gone out of business by the end of the lockdown, according to survey by the <a href=\"https://www.childcare.co.uk/information/about-us\">Childcare online platform</a>. </p>",
  "<p><br></p> <p>For the past 40 years it has been a warning to parents about the monstrous consequences of ignoring their children. Now new illustrations of the classic picture book <em>Not Now, Bernard</em> have been created to better reflect the daily life of families in the age of smartphones and tablets.</p> <p>They show the protagonist Bernard\u2019s parents paying more attention to their digital devices than their son \u2013 even when he is eaten and replaced by a raucous purple monster from the garden.</p> <p>The publishers hope the new version, which is being released on 4 June to celebrate the book\u2019s 40th anniversary, will appeal to all those parents spending the lockdown shouting \u201cnot now!\u201d at their kids as they try to work from home.</p> <p>\u201cI know there are more reasons now \u2013 because there are more electronic things \u2013 that people say \u2018not now\u2019,\u201d said the author and illustrator David McKee, 85. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad... But we humans continue to make the same mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>He was speaking to the <em>Observer</em> from his partner\u2019s home near Marseille in France, where he has spent the last month gardening, painting \u2013 and struggling to concentrate. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a normal life. I was brought up during the war. Everything was shared and people were united. This business of lockdown \u2013 with everyone supposed to be wearing masks and keeping their distance, even from friends \u2013 it separates people.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks listening to children is one of the most important things a parent can do \u2013 and during the lockdown, when children are isolated from their teachers and friends, it is even more important. \u201cIf they\u2019re good parents, they\u2019ve got to make sure during this time that they do listen, that they do say: \u2018Yes, what is it?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70b8639faf45ac799f97544b46e79e2139e8711f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70b8639faf45ac799f97544b46e79e2139e8711f/0_2736_5896_4974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David McKee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"844\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David McKee, author of Not Now, Bernard, also created children\u2019s characters such as Elmer the Patchwork Elephant and Mr Benn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the very least, he says parents should take the time to explain to their child why they are unavailable, if they are busy. One of the great jokes of the book is that neither Bernard nor the monster understand why their interruptions are constantly met with indifference from Bernard\u2019s parents. \u201cAt the end, the monster doesn\u2019t know how to handle the situation, because they\u2019re so insistent [on ignoring him].\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Picture books are one type of book shared by adults and children.

The story can be read either way, he says \u2013 but he does think there is an angry monster inside all of us. \u201cIf we are ignored or badly treated, there\u2019s something inside of us that starts to rise up and we react.

I\u2019ve seen a few adults who didn\u2019t like it, because it made them feel guilty.\u201d</p> <p>But he has also noticed that children today say \u201cnot now\u201d to their parents more often than they did 40 years ago, favouring the virtual world in their pocket to the one outside. \u201cIt is a world they are used to being in, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>As for himself, McKee doesn\u2019t own a smartphone, send emails or even wear a watch.

  "<p>Twenty years ago, the US Department of Defense set out a clear warning: \u201cHistorians in the next millennium may find that the 20th century\u2019s greatest fallacy was the belief that infectious diseases were nearing elimination. The resultant complacency has actually increased the threat.\u201d</p> <p>Along with other western nations, federal and state governments in America had spent the previous decade or so dismantling public health programmes dealing with communicable diseases in order to concentrate funds on degenerative illnesses: diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke. Corporate investment in the development of new vaccines and antibiotics almost dried up, as if the battle that humans had waged over millennia against plague and pestilence had now been won \u2013 at least in the developed world. Michael Osterholm, the Minnesota state epidemiologist, informed US Congress in 1996: \u201cI am here to bring you the sobering and unfortunate news that our ability to detect and monitor infectious disease threats to health in this country is in serious jeopardy. . . . For 12 of the states or territories, there is no one who is responsible for food or water-borne disease surveillance. You could sink the Titanic in their back yard and they would not know they had water.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since, as Frank Snowden\u2019s illuminating history shows, that indifference became endemic. The World Health Organization has argued for years that the mechanics of our globalised economy, the dramatic increase in urbanisation and mass intercontinental travel has exponentially increased the chances for infectious disease to mutate and spread. It identified a record 1,100 \u201cworldwide epidemic events\u201d between 2002 and 2007. A year later, researchers identified 335 new human diseases that had emerged since the development of the polio vaccine in the late 1950s, most of them originating in animals (many in bats). \u201cTheir names now run the gamut from A to Z \u2013 from avian flu to Zika,\u201d Snowden notes, \u201cand scientists caution that far more potentially dangerous pathogens exist than have so far been discovered.\u201d Yet still, when he finally acknowledged the destructive presence of Covid-19 in his nation\u2019s population, the primary response of the president of the US was one of genuine surprise: \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://history.yale.edu/people/frank-snowden\">Snowden</a>, an emeritus professor of history at Yale, believes that epidemic disease has shaped nations and civilisations every bit as starkly as economics or politics or war. One of the more depressing realisations in reading this necessary and persuasive book is that almost every line of it would apparently come as news to Donald J Trump: the terrible decades and centuries in the shadow of the bubonic plague, the desperate blight of smallpox and cholera and typhus and polio, and the enormous advances in public health brought about by sanitation and vaccination and antibiotics. All of that cumulative hard-won wisdom \u2013 the triumphs of Edward Jenner and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/09/butchering-art-review-joseph-listers-quest-grisly-world-victorian-medicine-lindsey-fitzharris\">Joseph Lister</a> and Alexander Fleming and Florence Nightingale and <a href=\"https://www.salk.edu/about/history-of-salk/jonas-salk/\">Jonas Salk</a> in persuading governments of the possibilities of their science \u2013 was erased from history by a president who believes injections of disinfectant might represent a novel cure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Napoleon\u2019s expansionist dreams were defeated by his inability to contain the spread of infections in his armies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Snowden\u2019s book began as an undergraduate lecture course at Yale during the immediate aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">ars</a> and Ebola, which exposed for him the vulnerability of modern society to sudden outbreaks of infectious diseases. No such course then existed. Snowden examined not only how the modern world was created in large part in response to the primary plague event, the Black Death, but also how that event still shadows the response of governments to epidemics.</p> <p>The trial and error measures of quarantine (the Venetian practice of holding the crew of trading ships in isolation for 40 days) and lockdown established \u201ca style of public health\u201d that \u201cconferred upon authorities the legitimating appearance of acting resolutely, knowledgably, and in accord with precedent\u201d. Sometimes those measures were justified, sometimes not, but in recent times, this book shows, they have been employed in large part to hide and mitigate a criminal lack of preparedness for what, with proper international coordination and immediate application of best practice, should be a predictable and manageable event.</p> <p>Of all the conditions that promote virulent disease, hubris emerges across the centuries as a prime mover. Napoleon\u2019s expansionist dreams were ultimately defeated not by the collective will of rival generals, but by his inability to predict or contain the spread of infections in his armies: he was defeated in the Caribbean in 1803 by an outbreak of yellow fever, and then in Russia in 1812, where the then largest assembled military force in human history was undone by dysentery and typhus.</p> <p>In an updated introduction to his book, Snowden traces a comparable arrogance in our own leaders, who have allowed global inequalities to foster the illusion that infectious diseases, old and new, are a thing of the past. As we enter the next phase of this pandemic, it is worth keeping in mind that there were, in 2014, more people suffering with TB, for example, than at any time in history (because of Covid restrictions, it is predicted that 1.4 million more people will die of that disease by 2025). Epidemics have never stopped being a fact of life and death for hundreds of millions of people across the world. Now that their presence has been brought home to all of us again, Snowden argues, the old wisdom that saved human societies in the past must be brought to the front and centre of government: \u201csalus populi, suprema lex esto\u201d, as the ancients had it; public health must be the highest law, and all else follows from it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present</em> by Frank M Snowden is published by Yale University Press (\u00a316.99).

His letters have taken on new meaning in the wake of the pandemic and the \u201cstay at home\u201d orders. While I would never compare these constraints to incarceration, his words are nonetheless helpful. \u201cIt all boils down to limits,\u201d he recently wrote. \u201cWhether enforced by nature \u2013 biologic or social, tangible or abstractions \u2013 we all confront the parameters of our cage eventually. What we do when we reach those bars helps define us.\u201d</p> <p>As a photographer I\u2019m really struggling to respond to the pandemic, because I\u2019m not a crisis-response type photographer. I\u2019ve done little photographic experiments, and they\u2019ve been OK. But by far the most meaningful thing that\u2019s happened to me is this letter exchange. In terms of the image itself, I just took a picture of the letter with my iPhone, using the screen on my bedroom window to make the writing illegible, though a few words pop out here and there. I really do find it interesting to reflect on the constraints of prison, which are a million times worse than what I\u2019m going through, and all the psychological weight of incarceration that you can\u2019t even imagine.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m rattling my cage at the moment, but it\u2019s so not a cage. I\u2019m in a city but it\u2019s very spread out. I have a studio, which I have no problem getting to.

All you need is fresh dandelion flowers, sugar, a lemon and water. She suggested that perhaps it was something I could do with my granddaughter, Bella, because she knows we like making things together and doing things outside. Bella is six. In normal times we see each other quite a lot but because we\u2019re trying to obey the lockdown rules I haven\u2019t seen her for many weeks.</p> <p>Dandelions started to appear opposite my house and along the path where I take my daily walk, so even though I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be making the honey with her, I picked them and I\u2019m planning to follow the recipe. I\u2019m not vegan and neither is she but that is irrelevant, really \u2013 I just know it is something she would have loved to do.</p> <p>It was a coincidence that the cloth on our kitchen table the day I gathered the dandelions happened to have a pattern on it that looks like a beehive. But coincidence is a fantastic thing and I like it when it comes into my work.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been talking to Bella on Zoom and WhatsApp and because she is a child of the digital age she is very comfortable with that but I can\u2019t go outside with her and pick dandelions so the act of doing that by myself felt like a lovely link with her. What\u2019s really nice as well is that dandelions represent the sun and, in fact, yellow is her favourite colour. I also like the idea that after dandelions are dandelions they become clocks that we blow as a game, counting down the days to the end of our confinement. <strong>LO\u2019K</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.nadavkander.com/\">Nadav Kander</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8272df44b4c22086424d34c0aa7dac2b14b5d959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8272df44b4c22086424d34c0aa7dac2b14b5d959/0_0_7702_6106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Inside 22.04.2020 \u00a9 Nadav Kander Courtesy Flowers Gallery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"793\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Inside 22.04.2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Nadav Kander Courtesy Flowers Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Winner of the outstanding contribution to photography prize at the 2019 Sony world photography awards, Nadav Kander is an acclaimed landscape and portrait photographer</em></p> <p>At the beginning of lockdown, my kneejerk reaction was to come to my studio, set things up and immediately start working. I realised quite quickly that this was an internal pressure I was putting on myself, it wasn\u2019t organic or authentic. I needed more time to process what I was feeling. I knew it was around solitude and touch but I wanted just to spend some weeks digesting it and then see how it comes out in my work rather than pushing.</p> <p>Part of that process was to bring a camera home and start looking more carefully at my house, turning my eyes on, in a way, and looking more deeply at my surroundings. I started taking pictures inside the house and spent a lot of time looking out of various windows at the plain blue sky without any streaks. One day we had this rainbow and I happened to notice it through the blind.</p> <p>I find it quite a gentle, poignant image. I like the way the blind drawn between inside and outside asks questions rather than answers them. The clear view would have been less ambiguous, I guess. This is veiled \u2013 I think that makes it more alluring.</p> <p>When lockdown was announced all my projects and the work I had just absolutely evaporated. But in many ways this period has been amazing, not frustrating. There are six of us at home \u2013 I have four children aged from 24 to 20 \u2013 and I feel very privileged to spend this time with them. I\u2019m actually in my element. I like everything being slower and having time to think and look. I feel more sorry for my children than myself: I think they are bursting to get out and hug people, see people and socialise. <strong>LO\u2019K</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/artists/35-eamonn-doyle/overview/\">Eamonn Doyle</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Dublin</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13fc13642231768795bdba65e021c580dcc5e1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13fc13642231768795bdba65e021c580dcc5e1e4/0_0_6336_9504/667.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled, by Eamonn Doyle\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn Doyle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>A record label owner and DJ, Eamonn Doyle returned to photography in 2008, focusing on working-class life on Dublin\u2019s north side.

While the lockdown was going on, I decided to move to his house in Sandycove, south Dublin, to be near my little nephew, who lives next door. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve lived out here since the late 80s, and I\u2019ve been taking a lot of photographs around the house where I grew up, which is up the road in Killiney. I\u2019ve been craving to go back into that house for decades and I\u2019d love to photograph it. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been wandering around the area, within two or three roads of the house, just photographing odd things \u2013 lampposts, markings on the ground, some surreal hedges \u2013 for a short-form publication.</p> <p>There was something about this trolley that drew me in, I\u2019m not sure what: the particular light, the wall behind it, the direction of the wheels\u2026 There aren\u2019t really any supermarkets nearby \u2013 the nearest Tesco is a couple of kilometres away \u2013 so somebody must have pushed it quite a bit. It\u2019s not part of a narrative or anything. I was just in the mode of focusing on singular objects.</p> <p>The lockdown has been fine for me. In terms of my day-to-day, it\u2019s been really nice to be out here by the sea, walking around, but I\u2019m very aware that it\u2019s a very unrealistic, unsustainable situation. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going through any heavy grieving or anything \u2013 the overriding emotion is one of absolute relief that my dad isn\u2019t dying in hospital right now.

Instead, I\u2019ve been reading books, watching movies and thinking about my new work, as well as doing some printing in my darkroom.

One of my ambitions in my photography is to make pictures that look like they were taken by a writer, but in a good way. They\u2019re not just pure emotion, they\u2019re constructed.</p> <p>I took this image in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within walking distance of my house. What drew me to the scene was the ladders. Ladders are a recurring theme in my work. They are full of metaphorical intensity: a ladder can take you up, but it can also bring you down. And, of course, in many religious positions, ladders suggest heaven. So I walk by this blue house and there\u2019s four ladders \u2013 it\u2019s slight ladder overkill. I tried to see what was going on and I saw the man and took a photo.</p> <p>That was my initial attraction. But once he turned around something had changed, because he was wearing a mask. And I was wearing a mask. The usual element of surveillance that we get in street photography has gone away because I couldn\u2019t identify him. He couldn\u2019t identify me. But a new tension had entered the exchange and that new tension felt to me like a new language that we were all learning to speak at the same time. There is also this cascade of association of what it means when somebody covers their face, and I thought about <em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Beekeepers_and_the_Birdnester_-_WGA03528.jpg\">The Beekeepers and the Birdnester</a>,</em> a drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.</p> <p>Emotionally, this is a particularly difficult time to do work. It\u2019s not like: \u201cOh, it\u2019s a wonderful vacation!\u201d I\u2019m not sitting here writing <em>King Lear</em>. I cannot have that blithe attitude to it, because thousands of people are dying every day. But I think the images I\u2019ve made in the past six weeks have had even more focus and tension than they usually do. And tension is usually what I\u2019m looking for when I choose a photograph.<strong> TL</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lizjohnsonartur/?hl=en\">Liz Johnson Artur</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Brighton</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cecfc5e5bb83549d981a9d52b5c9a3dd5973003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cecfc5e5bb83549d981a9d52b5c9a3dd5973003/0_0_4128_6752/611.jpg\" alt=\"Lockdown image by Liz Johnson Artur\" width=\"611\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Ghanaian-Russian photographer Liz Johnson Artur documents the lives of people from the African diaspora.

So I went to Brighton. April was a very beautiful month in terms of the weather and this picture was taken in my garden there.</p> <p>The image is by a photographer called Peter Basch, a German \u00e9migr\u00e9 who lived in New York. He did a series of photographs of women in the 1960s, which he called \u201cexotic beauties\u201d. So I was looking at this book and it was badly bound and very windy in the garden, and suddenly all the pages flew off. While I was collecting them, I thought they actually looked quite nice in the garden. There\u2019s a lot of poetry in real life: sometimes it\u2019s there simply by picking something up and combining it with something else that you wouldn\u2019t usually combine it with.</p> <p>The work that I do as an artist and as a photographer has a lot to do with black and brown representation. On one side, I was aesthetically attracted by Basch\u2019s photographs, but at the same time, I was also irritated by the whole \u201cexotic beauties\u201d setup of the book. This picture felt like a way to give these \u201cexotic beauties\u201d my own kind of interpretation.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very painful time, and the people that I like to represent are especially affected. But there\u2019s a certain luxury for me in being able to slow down and look at things without any time pressure. In Brighton, I have a 35mm camera and black-and-white film. That\u2019s all I need. Big plans at the moment are hard to accomplish, so I like the idea of small steps and small gestures. This picture is part of that. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.newshatavakolian.com/\">Newsha Tavakolian</a><br>Tehran</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"464409494c4251fce555e4a9876795b97be0af0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464409494c4251fce555e4a9876795b97be0af0c/0_0_7433_5943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Me at home being bored in the living room of my house, playing with my lighter., Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Me at home being bored in the living room of my house, playing with my lighter, Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Newsha Tavakolian/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Iranian Magnum photojournalist is renowned for her coverage of conflict and social issues across the Middle East</em></p> <p>Iran was one of the first countries to be hit by coronavirus after China, so I wanted to show the outside world my experience of day-to-day life in self-quarantine. Stuck at home, you become more sensitive about details you might otherwise miss. For 17 years, I have been looking at this view of a lampshade at my home in Tehran, but I never thought of taking a picture of it. One night I was bored by myself and I was playing with my camera. I wanted to smoke, so I flicked on my lighter and noticed how the flame lined up nicely with the light from the bulb.</p> <p>My father passed away exactly a year before this was taken. We were meant to have a big ceremony for the anniversary, but we had to cancel it at the last minute. Instead, my mother, my sister and I went to the cemetery to visit his grave. I was shocked by how quiet it was \u2013 we were completely on our own. Then I came home and I was wondering: is this the new normal? It\u2019s like a scary film we are living. Fortunately or unfortunately, nearly two months later, I\u2019ve kind of got used to it. When I want to visit my mother, who lives close by, I put on my face mask without thinking.</p> <p>If I can say one thing to other photographers and artists , it\u2019s that they must act before this lifestyle becomes normal.

I am not sure if the sea reflects my mood or the mood of the sea is reflected in me but there is definitely a reciprocity of some kind. Often I\u2019ll wake up feeling a bit flat and I look at the sea and find it is a bit flat and grey too. This picture was taken on one of those days.</p> <p>I\u2019m in isolation on my own. It would be nice to have company but I guess photographers are loners by nature. I\u2019ve been cooking relentlessly \u2013 it\u2019s my way to relax \u2013 and the button burst off my trousers last week, so I\u2019ll have to watch that.</p> <p>I\u2019m spending the rest of the time trying to be useful.

Then the other night, I realised I hadn\u2019t been out after dark for over a month. So I decided to go for some night wanders. The American photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/24/robert-adams-photographs-american-west-paris\">Robert Adams</a> did a series of nightscapes in the 1970s called <em>Summer Nights, Walking</em>. I\u2019ve always really admired that work so I thought I\u2019d explore the area around where I live, in Holloway, north London.</p> <p>This photograph was taken around 10.30pm on a housing estate near the Emirates Stadium. The day had been warm, but the evening was chilly and there was a strong breeze. So you had the trees blowing, which is quite atmospheric, and then the warmth and pockets of light in the windows of the people getting ready for bed or having a late dinner. Most of my recent work has been shot in black-and-white, although this was digital, because I normally use an old-fashioned 5x4 plate camera. I might have been arrested if I\u2019d got that out.</p> <p>I was surprised, because it felt eerie and quite unsettling. I\u2019ve lived in London for more than 20 years and never really felt unsafe, but I didn\u2019t really enjoy it, and that probably sums up how I was feeling at that particular moment. There were people lurking in the shadows and it felt odd to be in a neighbourhood I\u2019m so familiar with yet not feel comfortable.</p> <p>After the lockdown is over, I\u2019ll probably look more towards stories around me. In the past, I\u2019ve never felt that inspired by what\u2019s on my doorstep, but you don\u2019t have to go to the Amazon or Antarctica to make interesting pictures.

  "<p>Ralph Reed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/06/republicans-us-politics\">an evangelical leader and conservative political activist</a>, first met Donald Trump in 2011, after being \u201ccoincidentally\u201d seated next to Ivanka Trump at a meeting. The following year, he writes now, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/07/donald-trump-evangelical-supporters\">his own Faith &amp; Freedom conference</a>, Trump \u201cbounded on stage to the thumping strains of \u2018Money, money, money\u2019 from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXE_n2q08Yw\">For the Love of Money</a>, a song by the 70s soul group the O\u2019Jays\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/kayleigh-mcenany-donald-trump-white-house-press-secretary-profile\">Who is Kayleigh McEnany \u2013 and why is she saying nice things about Donald Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the page and off, Reed is usually quick to provide apposite quotes from the scriptures. In a book that is part history of the 2016 campaign, part <em>apologia</em>, part work of political theory, and part political shell game, he chooses not to include here 1 Timothy 6:10: \u201cFor the love of money is the root of all evil.\u201d</p> <p>Reed purports to offer \u201cthe Christian Case for Trump\u201d but his preaching is largely to the converted \u2013 and, most urgently, to those worried by the potential flames of Joe Biden.</p> <p>For Reed, Trump offered an appealing path: \u201cWith his money and celebrity, combined with a socially conservative message aimed at evangelicals, he could make a serious run\u201d for president and secure policy victories galore.</p> <p>Reed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/28/mike-pence-shadow-president-review-path-to-power\">very fond of Mike Pence</a>, and likely wishes the vice-president were top of the ticket this year. But he sees success under Trump on issues including abortion, religious freedom, support for Israel and helping ex-offenders re-enter society through the bipartisan First Step Act.</p> <p>Ultimately, abortion and the supreme court are more important than personal failures. Talk about issues and a dig at Hillary constituted Reed\u2019s response to the misogynistic Billy Bush video, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/sexual-assault-definition-trump-comments\">Trump boasted of sexual assault</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is pure and simple advocacy, and it is deceptive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reed writes that \u201cTrump has led with great moral clarity [on religious freedom]. If keeping one\u2019s word is central to one\u2019s character \u2013 and it clearly is \u2013 then Donald Trump has shown he has far more character than his critics.\u201d</p> <p>Writing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/apr/19/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-church-state-separation-missouri\">the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court</a>, Reed claims \u201call the doubts, reservations, even suspicions \u2013 every one of them had been false.\u201d</p> <p>Every one?</p> <p>Reed\u2019s reliance on the \u201cteaching of Jesus about the difference between words and works\u201d is misplaced. He writes: \u201cI measure a man more by his actions than by the occasional rash or ill-advised word.\u201d How about false? <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/donald-trump-wins-appeal-allegedly-defamatory-tweets-1066737\">Allegedly defamatory</a>? <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/870368/65-worst-trump-tweets-2010s\">Demeaning</a>? <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-worst-offense-mocking-disabled-reporter-poll-finds-n627736\">Belittling</a>? <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/15/741827580/go-back-where-you-came-from-the-long-rhetorical-roots-of-trump-s-racist-tweets\">Racist</a>?</p> <p>And this: \u201cI have learned to be suspicious of the smooth talker who never delivers.\u201d</p> <p>As have those who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-university-court-upholds-25m-settlement-to-give-students-money-back\">plumped down money for Trump University</a>.</p> <p>This is pure and simple advocacy, and it is deceptive. Reed\u2019s statements often have qualifications, feints and writing designed to obscure or distract. For instance, he writes: \u201cThe fact that [Trump] didn\u2019t act or talk like a typical evangelical, didn\u2019t come from the Bible Belt, and didn\u2019t attend a Christian college or quote scripture also meant he could reach a new \u2013 and larger \u2013 audience.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s missing here? Oh yes \u2013 Trump <em>didn\u2019t usually attend church</em>. (Barack Obama did, generally at Camp David so as not to disturb worshippers in regular churches.)</p> <p>In essence, Reed invites readers not to look behind the curtain, positing instead a simple choice between Trump and \u201cliberals\u201d. His first and last chapters focus on the left, with bonus \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and \u201cLiberal Hypocrisy\u201d in the middle. Elsewhere, it\u2019s Trump or \u201ccivic withdrawal\u201d, a true straw argument.</p> <p>Some of his political science has a point. Trump did talk about issues that mattered to many voters. But Reed can\u2019t quite make up his mind.</p> <p>\u201c[E]vangelicals gravitated to Trump with ambivalence and more than a little reluctance,\u201d he writes. \u201cSome were dragged kicking and screaming to the voting booths.\u201d</p> <p>He seems happiest at a rally in Valdosta, Georgia: \u201cIt was as if a seventies band reunion had met a Nascar race \u2013 all for the enjoyment of the great unwashed of the American heartland, the forsaken and forgotten, the rejected and looked-down upon \u2026 these voters had found their Pied Piper, and his name was Donald J Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Following the Pied Piper did not end well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c65e159b3fbc96a0c320b78cd7084190727fb94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c65e159b3fbc96a0c320b78cd7084190727fb94/0_84_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Reed at the White House in January, for remarks by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Reed at the White House in January, for remarks by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does Reed really believe all this? Occasionally, glimpses of an earlier Republican party and flashes of honesty peek through the rhetoric. He gives some play to the opposition of evangelical critics such as Russell Moore, Al Mohler and Mark DeMoss. He offers nice words on the former Ohio governor John Kasich and Medicaid expansion. He writes that \u201c[Jesus] showed concern for people\u2019s physical needs for food, water, shelter and health, and so should we.\u201d He even comments favourably on Hillary Clinton\u2019s faith and devotional life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/07/donald-trump-evangelical-supporters\">Faith and freedoms: why evangelicals profess unwavering love for Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And he is correct that many evangelicals did change their views on politicians who commit immoral acts. But here are straw arguments again: \u201cDoes the Gospel teach that someone who has had a personal moral failing is disqualified from serving in a position of public trust? In fact, the Bible teaches the opposite, offering redemption and hope through faith in Christ to all sinners.\u201d</p> <p>Curiously, Reed uses the example of Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus and subsequent office in the church rather than the most obvious example in the state: King David\u2019s adultery with Bathsheba and murder of her husband.</p> <p>The key is \u2013 or should be \u2013 repentance, and Reed claims Trump \u201cfreely acknowledges \u2026 flaws and mistakes of his past\u201d. Then why so many false statements, including those that are easily checkable? Avoiding responsibility seems the exact opposite of repentance \u2013 and leadership. Reed also omits Trump\u2019s appalling behavior at two <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhV9RMEko3E\">National Prayer Breakfasts</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes, Reed gets the theology right \u2026 He quotes Psalm 146: 'Put not your trust in princes'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reed\u2019s definition of the 2016 election is flawed: a choice between \u201cdiametrically opposed political agendas \u2013 one of which embraced the intrinsic good while the other advanced grave evil\u201d. Surely, too narrow a definition on both counts.</p> <p>Simple distortions of fact abound, formed by putting one hand on the scale and ignoring other evidence. Reed is quick to dismiss accusations against Trump while not giving the full story. His chapters on Russia and impeachment are particularly, almost clownishly one-sided.</p> <p>Reed writes of \u201cthe Russia hoax\u201d. Robert Mueller said election interference \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/07/24/robert-mueller-russian-election-interference-not-a-hoax-sot-vpx.cnn\">was not a hoax</a>\u201d. Reed writes the Mueller investigation had nothing \u201cto do with criminal wrongdoing\u201d. Mueller said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/29/muellers-statement-annotated-if-we-had-confidence-that-president-clearly-did-not-commit-crime-we-would-have-said-so/\">he would have cleared Trump if he could have</a> but did not.

He also states that his Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition offers no endorsements but merely presents candidates\u2019 statements on issues. Then why not do the same for Lt Col Vindman, Ambassador Yovanovitch or Mueller? Reed quotes Hosea 4:6: \u201cMy people perish for lack of knowledge.\u201d Indeed.</p> <p>Sometimes, he gets the theology right. Political power should indeed be used \u201cprimarily to glorify God\u201d. He quotes Psalm 146: \u201cPut not your trust in princes.\u201d And he wishes that whatever the outcome of the 2020 election, \u201cWe will glorify God and be witnesses in our time for the transcendent, heavenly values that can transform society today.\u201d</p> <p>That is a noble vision, far removed from the \u201cmuck and mire of politics\u201d. In the end, there\u2019s not really much of a case for Trump here.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>The</strong><strong> deckchairs are all theirs</strong></h2> <p>In the past month some mundane words seem to have regained their old mystery. \u201cTravel\u201d is one.

Germany is negotiating an agreement for its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52547403\">holidaymakers to visit Greece</a> and the Balearics. The tourism minister for the latter has not been alone in explaining how such arrangements will need to be selective: \u201cThere are countries like the UK that have taken too long to adopt containment measures. That puts us in a different situation with respect to them.\u201d The Little Englanders might have been careful what they wished for.

Johnson is planning to tell workers who cannot do their jobs from home to begin returning to their workplaces while following social distancing rules.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court, Tesla accused the Alameda County Health Department of overstepping federal and state coronavirus restrictions when it stopped Tesla from restarting production at its factory in Fremont. The lawsuit contends Tesla factory workers are allowed to work during California\u2019s stay-at-home order because the facility is considered \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d</p> <h2>Seoul shuts down bars after infections spark fear of second wave</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/it-isnt-over-south-korea-records-34-new-cases-the-highest-in-a-month\">South Korea reported 34 new coronavirus cases on Sunday</a>, the highest daily number in a month, after a small outbreak emerged around a slew of nightclubs that a confirmed patient had visited. Of the new cases, 26 were domestically transmitted infections and eight were imported cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The resurgence followed a small but growing coronavirus outbreak centred around a handful of Seoul nightclubs, which a man in his late 20s had visited before testing positive for the virus. The outbreak prompted Seoul city to impose an immediate temporary shutdown of all nightly entertainment facilities on Saturday.</p> <h2>Three child deaths in New York potentially linked to Covid-19</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/children-coronavirus-death-kawasaki\">deaths of three children in New York</a> of inflammatory complications possibly linked to Covid-19 has prompted Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s governor, to warn of \u201can entirely different chapter\u201d of a disease that had been believed to cause only mild symptoms in children. State health authorities said last week there have been 73 reported cases in New York of children falling severely ill with a toxic shock-like reaction that displays symptoms similar to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/kawasaki/index.html\">Kawasaki disease</a>. \u201cThis is new,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis is developing.\u201d</p> <h2>Restrictions to ease in France and Spain</h2> <p>France and Spain, two of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus, are preparing to ease out of lockdown. French officials on Saturday said the day\u2019s death toll of 80 was the lowest since early April. Nursing home fatalities also fell sharply as France prepared to relax curbs on public movement imposed eight weeks ago. In Spain, about half the population will be allowed out on Monday for limited socialisation, and restaurants will be able to offer some outdoor service as the country begins a phased transition set to last through June.</p>",

She attended the Academy of the Holy Names Catholic high school in Tampa and found time to volunteer for the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004. She moved to Washington to study at Georgetown, took an exchange year at Oxford to study politics and served an internship in the Bush White House.</p> <p>After graduating in 2010, she worked for three years as a production assistant at Fox News for Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and father of Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s second press secretary.

  "<p>\u2018In spite of the sunny bank holiday, it is vitally important that we continue to abide by the current restrictions: stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d That was the message delivered by the environment secretary, George Eustice, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1259043536156196865?s=20\">at Friday afternoon\u2019s press conference</a>.

Its core message, asking the public to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives, has been very effective, but this has consistently been undermined by ministers and advisers inaccurately briefing the press that there is about to be a shift in policy. Before the Easter weekend, reports appeared that ministers thought that the public had been too obedient in following the lockdown, and that a relaxation was imminent. The same happened before this bank holiday weekend, forcing the government to clarify that there was no change in restrictions and that people must continue to abide by the law.</p> <p>The tone of these briefings has been shockingly out of step with reality. Last week, the UK\u2019s official death toll overtook Italy\u2019s to make us the worst-hit country in Europe at this point (the UK\u2019s official statistics <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PedderSophie/status/1258497092953219072?s=20\">capture a smaller proportion</a> of excess deaths than in many other European countries, suggesting that, if anything, the UK will look worse as the death toll becomes more accurate). Every day, hundreds of families lose their loved ones to this virus, healthcare workers put their lives at risk by going to work without adequate protection, and care homes struggle to manage the spread of the disease among residents. As a result of high levels of public compliance with the lockdown, infection rates have fallen, but not to a point where there can be any significant relaxation of social distancing: the measures that will be announced later today will rightly be very incremental.</p> <p>It beggars belief that government sources have, regardless, been briefing that the end of lockdown is nigh, and floating, then stepping back from, major policy changes \u2013 such as the potential for households to mix in closed groups of up to 10 people. It is a recipe for sowing confusion and seeding a laidback approach to social distancing. New policy should be announced only to parliament or at the daily press conference. We can only hope that the public continues to listen to and comply with social distancing, despite the government\u2019s unclear messages.</p> <p>These shambolic communications are a sign of a worrying lack of competence at the heart of government. Bombastic war metaphors are being used as a substitute for long-term strategy. The government\u2019s success in rapidly expanding NHS critical care capacity has not been matched in other areas, from ensuring adequate supplies of protective equipment for frontline workers, to delays in expanding testing capacity, to the disaster that is unfolding in many care homes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bombastic war metaphors are being used as a substitute for long-term strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government has consistently faced calls from the opposition and scientific experts to be more transparent about how it intends to relax social distancing restrictions without triggering a second wave of deaths later in the year. Any significant relaxation of the lockdown is contingent not just on getting infection rates lower but on having adequate testing and tracing capacity to quickly identify and isolate new outbreaks.</p> <p>Yet the government has failed to publish a proper strategy. It has adopted arbitrary testing targets: first a quarter of a million tests a day, then 100,000, and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/boris-johnson-misses-coronavirus-testing-target-for-fourth-day-in-a-row\">200,000</a>, without explaining how these targets fit into a strategy for managing future outbreaks. It manipulated testing figures \u2013 sending out a large number of tests post on one particular day, and counting these as completed tests \u2013 in order to meet its arbitrary 100,000 target, which it has since fallen back from. It would make more sense to adopt a dynamic target that aims to keep the proportion of tests that come back positive below a fixed figure: this would help ensure that we are testing in sufficient numbers given the incidence of the virus. We do not know what assumptions the government is relying upon; for example, how quickly test results will need to be turned around to feed into an effective track and trace system.</p> <p>In terms of tracing, experience from countries such as Singapore suggests that <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/contact-tracing-apps-coronavirus\">technology and contact tracing apps </a>can only assist, not replace, teams of human contact tracers. Yet there are worrying signs the UK may be relying too heavily on the development of an app, with all the privacy concerns that this involves, and not enough on building skilled teams of contact tracers. While it has committed to recruiting 18,000 contact tracers by the middle of this month, this may not be enough, and it emerged last week that the government is <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-private-call-centres-will-run-new-contact-tracing-system-bjqnpsxqc?wgu=270525_54264_1589026507825_73e1b80e32&amp;wgexpiry=1596802507&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278\">in talks </a>with large private-sector contractors to provide 15,000 call-centre staff, who would have only a day\u2019s training. One company is Serco, which was last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/03/serco-fined-229m-over-electronic-tagging-scandal\">fined </a>\u00a323m by the Serious Fraud Office over its delivery of electronic tagging contracts. Meanwhile, it is unclear if and how the government intends to deploy the thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/uk-missed-coronavirus-contact-tracing-opportunity-experts-say\">environmental health officers</a> who work for local councils; it has been far too slow to involve local government public health experts in other areas, for example <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/public-health-directors-take-charge-covid-19-testing-care-homes\">testing in care homes</a>.</p> <p>This is the most difficult governing challenge the country has faced in decades; the gaps in our knowledge about this virus means that there is often uncertainty as to the best way forward. It would be unreasonable to expect a government to make no missteps. Yet the evidence is mounting that this government\u2019s rank incompetence has contributed to the terrible numbers of deaths of recent weeks. This cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry: ministers have to face up to and learn from their mistakes in the here and now. People\u2019s lives depend on it.</p>",

He was fined $1,000.</p> <p>How the Daily Telegraph got tipped to the story \u2013 they captured pictures of him shopping in Sydney and hanging out at Pearl Beach \u2013 remains the subject of intense conjecture. But most Liberals are are looking among their own colleagues for the culprit.</p> <p>\u201cHand on heart, it wasn\u2019t us,\u201d one Labor source said. \u201cThe Liberals catch and kill their own.\u201d</p> <p>Harwin was a big scalp for whoever weaponised the information.

Some Liberals sheet home the problems of the recent past to Berejiklian\u2019s reshuffle after the election in 2019, which left some key members of the right unhappy.</p> <p>But it may also be something about the NSW division.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hand on heart, it wasn\u2019t us. The Liberals catch and kill their own</p> <footer> <cite>A Labor source</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Liberal party, like many organisations, has seen its membership dwindle in modern times.</p> <p>The exact numbers are secret but <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/nsw-liberal-party-member-numbers-skyrocket/news-story/2f3268e2882110439f25f7a655fb2936\">the Australian reported</a> last year that 1,300 people, mainly from Pentecostal churches, had joined, raising the numbers by 10%. That implies the membership is now at around 14,000. It\u2019s a far cry from 1945 when the party of Menzies had 90,000 members, nationally.</p> <p>Among that relatively small membership, there are those who plan their career in politics from the day they join the Young Liberals or Young Nationals.</p> <p>These careerists seem to gravitate to state parliament, having served apprenticeships in ministers\u2019 offices as staff and in politically aligned consultancies.</p> <p>Perhaps they never learn to moderate the dark arts they honed while in university politics and the youth wings of the party. Some of the behaviours would certainly not be tolerated in most private sector workplaces.</p> <p>Which brings us to Constance and Barilaro.</p> <p>For those who haven\u2019t followed this soap opera, in the last fortnight Constance, the state MP for Bega and a Liberal, and Barilaro, the state MP for Monaro and a National, both put their hands up to run for the federal seat of Eden-Monaro, which will have a byelection sometime soon, after Labor\u2019s Mike Kelly said he was retiring for health reasons.</p> <p>On Monday Barilaro pulled out. The seat has been won by Liberals in the past but no National has won, so Barilaro faced a very difficult task in a three-cornered contest, particularly if Constance ran.</p> <p>But having said he was happy with his decision Barilaro then badmouthed the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, by text for his lack of support of his candidacy and reportedly called his former friend Constance \u201ca cunt\u201d. He has declined to comment on the allegation.</p> <p>Constance then declared he would not run, having made much of his decision to take the fight for his bushfire-ravaged community to Canberra.</p> <p>An emotional Constance did a press conference on Monday: \u201cWhen I said politics is stuffed in this country and some of the people in it needed to take a long hard look, I meant it and we\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t signed up to contest federally to be called that type of smear.\u201d</p> <h2>Barilaro and Constance turn on each other</h2> <p>Barilaro and Constance both had a reputation of playing rough politically and there was some glee among colleagues that they had turned on each other.</p> <p>Others put Constance\u2019s about-face down to the difficulties he would have faced in gaining preselection, as the seat includes some very conservative branches. Driven by Tony Abbott, the party has reformed its preselection processes to give the branches a bigger say.</p> <p>Even more sinister suggestions emerged that there were dirt sheets circulating and about to see the light of day. One MP was said to have compiled files on his colleagues and to have boasted about them.
