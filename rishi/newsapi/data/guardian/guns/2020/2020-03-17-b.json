  "<p>On Monday afternoon, as news rippled across the San Francisco Bay area that millions of residents had been ordered to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">shelter-in-place\u201d</a> , the streets of Oakland hummed with the energy of a grim Christmas eve.</p> <p>Shoppers crisscrossed roads, bags in hand, in an urgent dash to stock up on last-minute items before stores closed their doors until at least 7 April \u2013 a drastic measure meant to curb the spread of coronavirus that California has reported has sickened<strong> </strong>more than<strong> </strong>472 people, including 326 in the Bay Area, and killed 11, although other sources report the number of confirmed cases at nearly 700. </p> <p>Restaurants will be delivery or take-out only. Gyms, bars and most stores will shutter \u2013 a stinging blow to the local economy, and an opening act to a recession that economists say will <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-pushes-u-s-into-recession-california-to-be-hit-hardest-ucla-economists-say/\">hit California hardest</a>.</p> <p>By midnight, when the shelter-in-place order took effect, the streets of Oakland were as quiet as a temple. Nobody stood in line waiting to get into a local nightclub. Stools at bars had been turned upside down and the lights turned out. Last call had already come and gone on Sunday, when California\u2019s governor ordered all drinking establishments to shut, and wouldn\u2019t come again for weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60dd1d56759e72dbd396aca6f9bc4afbae0edea2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60dd1d56759e72dbd396aca6f9bc4afbae0edea2/0_0_3563_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man crosses a nearly empty street in San Francisco on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man crosses a nearly empty street in San Francisco on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike the stricter lockdown measures enforced in China and Italy, California\u2019s order doesn\u2019t confine residents to their homes unless they have permission to leave; it also allows grocery stores, pharmacies and business selling items considered essential to remain open.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/shelter-in-place-california-coronavirus-bay-area-explained\">What does 'shelter in place' mean? California's coronavirus order, explained</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Monday\u2019s order nonetheless set off a rush on stores, forcing shopkeepers to grapple with large crowds at the same time health officials have asked everyone to stand at least six feet apart.</p> <p>Lines at grocery stores stretched outside the door. In an effort to control the size of the in-store crowd, security guards at Sprouts, a mid-size grocery chain that specializes in natural and organic foods, let in no more than 20 customers at a time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just picking up a few things,\u201d said Erica Straus as she waited to enter Sprouts. \u201cI felt like this was coming, so I stocked up over the past couple weeks.

I\u2019m just hoping we get through it.\u201d Straus said she\u2019s less concerned with her own health than she is about the crippling effect it will likely have on local businesses and residents.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at a Target across the street, security guard Luis Lugo said the store has been \u201cbusier than Christmas\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re selling out of hand-sanitizer and toilet paper within five to 10 minutes of opening in the morning,\u201d Lugo said.

The governor this weekend called on all seniors ages 65 and older to self-isolate. Ridership on public transit plummeted 61% in the span of a month. Major tech conferences, athletic contests and concerts had been canceled.</p> <p>By Monday, many Bay Area companies had already asked their employees to work from home. Gatherings of 35 people had already been banned in Santa Clara county, home of Silicon Valley and more than a third of the state\u2019s coronavirus cases.</p> <p>Foot traffic on the streets of Oakland\u2019s Chinatown was light for a typical lunchtime rush, but shoppers still made runs on local stores, many wearing masks.</p> <p>A mother grabbed her daughter\u2019s hand as they walked, making sure to give passing strangers a wide berth. Produce bins have been picked over and emptied as the line at Yuen Hop Noodle Company, a market, snaked to the back of the store.</p> <p>At the Chinese restaurant Cam Anh, next door to the market, half of the usually brimming buffet bins had been nabbed by customers as the restaurant prepared for the coming days.</p> <p>\u201cHere, we have so much freedom, and people do what they want,\u201d said the cashier, who declined to give her name.</p> <p>\u201cIn China, if the government says do it, you better do it, and you better do it right,\u201d she said of the impending lock down.</p> <p>The cashier pointed to a bin of rice and vegetables, boxed and ready for transport to a nearby not-for-profit that provides meals for clients. To stay afloat financially, Cam Anh plans to sell food to the agency as it locks its doors to in-person diners.</p> <p>\u201cWe help them and they help us,\u201d said the cashier. \u201cWe have to help each other. I pray that we\u2019re strong.\u201d</p> <p>Down the street at Happy Burrito, a Mexican restaurant usually overflowing with patrons, Julia Contreras said she still wasn\u2019t clear on the rules, and whether they\u2019d have to close. But nonetheless, they planned to draw the curtains.</p> <p>\u201cNobody gave us a warning, but we don\u2019t have the money to pay the staff,\u201d Contreras said from behind the counter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b16298bbbf4621249d6173ced55b9726e0364e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b16298bbbf4621249d6173ced55b9726e0364e75/0_0_4098_2766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dog cruises empty Geary Boulevard in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dog cruises empty Geary Boulevard in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Panic-buying at cannabis dispensaries\u2019</h2> <p>News of the lockdown also motivated the more recreationally minded, particularly those looking to stock up on staples such as pot and video games to pass the time during self-isolation.</p> <p>The line at Oakland\u2019s Blum, a medical and recreational marijuana dispensary, pushed out the door.

  "<p>We live in strange times, for sure, but who would have thought that the one thing missing from them was a mashup of ITV\u2019s remake of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07pshh6\" title=\"\">BBC One\u2019s Gold Digger</a> (the one starring Julia Ormond and some heavy yet sexy cardigans) called <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/flesh-and-blood/2a4234\" title=\"\">Flesh and Blood</a> (the one starring Imelda Staunton, Francesca Annis and some fresh yet sexy sea views) and Arthur Miller\u2019s A View from the Bridge? Not me. But television drama has located a new narrative seam, that of relationships between older women and younger men, and is currently mining it for all that it\u2019s worth, so far most successfully by the team behind HBO\u2019s Mrs Fletcher.</p> <p>The newest nugget brought up from this yielding vein and set before us, this time by Channel 5, is a three parter called <a href=\"https://www.channel5.com/show/penance/\" title=\"\">Penance</a>. It stars Julie Graham and Neil Morrissey as grieving parents Rosalie and Luke Douglas, who \u2013 as the story begins \u2013 receive news of the death of their 20-year-old son Rob, who died while swimming in Thailand. As with Flesh and Blood, there is a mystery element. His sister Maddie\u2019s first reaction to the news is odd (\u201cMum, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she cries guiltily, and her parents swoop down on her either to comfort or prevent her saying any more in front of the police), and Rosalie refuses to accept what has happened \u2013 Rob was a strong swimmer and there are snagging details in witnesses\u2019 accounts of the evening. While Maddie (Tallulah Greive) turns to drink and drug-taking to cope with the family\u2019s bereavement, Luke soldiers on \u2013 at least until Rosalie throws him out, unable to come to terms with both the situation and an earlier infidelity.</p> <p>Into this maelstrom of emotion arrives young Jed (Nico Mirallegro), with whom Rosalie and Maddie bond at their bereavement counselling group, which he is attending after losing both parents in a car crash and more recently the grandmother who then raised him. Rosalie invites him back to supper, hoping he will be a good influence on out-of-control Maddie. Nothing, surely, can go wrong here. Oh. No, wait.</p> <p>Children of course trail clouds of glory, heaven lying about them in their infancy. Alas, young Jed is a little past this age and trailing clouds of testosterone. Soon Maddie and Rosalie are both dreaming of lying about him in various states of undress, and Jed soon makes it clear that he is very willing to partake of the latter option. Rosalie is aware that the Rob-replacement aspect, her anger at Luke\u2019s betrayal and \u2013 well, let\u2019s call them assorted other sociocultural norms \u2013 complicate her situation and manages to reject him, at least when awake, for almost the whole of the first episode.</p> <p>As the suspenseful psychological thriller it purports to be, Penance is a bit slack. The suspicious nature of Rob\u2019s death is asserted rather than felt, and the subtext of the role Jed is playing in Rosalie\u2019s life and vice versa is rendered far too \u201ctext\u201d in conversations between the two of them and between Rosalie and her friend Father Tom (Art Malik). And the sense of further mysteries waiting to emerge comes less from any delicate script manoeuvrings than from the extra-viewing knowledge that you don\u2019t put Neil Morrissey or Art Malik in such parts without them having much more to do than has actually been suggested yet on screen.</p> <p>There are the occasional sounds of cogs and gears clunking \u2013 such as in the scene where Rosalie shows Jed childhood books, including \u201cfirst editions!\u201d, that she apparently keeps in the damp, barely used country cottage instead of her warm, dry home, purely so that he can buy her a replica of the necklace worn by one of her infant heroines and later lean in to fasten it round her neck. But, despite all this, it is basically fit for purpose. Which is mainly, at this point in the subgenre\u2019s development, still to work out how a mass audience feels about sex-swapped, intergenerational banging (I mean, romance \u2026 I mean banging) and how long writers and makers have before they need to start adding real meat, real characters and real plots, because the frisson of novelty has worn off.</p> <p>My own feeling is that they have a little longer to measure out and cut off the serviceable stuff by the yard before they have to start minding the quality as well as feeling the width. You don\u2019t undo generations of male, middle-aged gaze overnight, but I look forward to the developments when they come. If they could get here before I divorce and have some actual aged skin in the game, that would be great. Which is what, after all, it has always been about, hasn\u2019t it?</p>",

It has also led to a sharp decline in business in sectors ranging from airlines to hospitality.</p> <p>Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has already agreed two smaller pieces of legislation to help the US confront the coronavirus crisis with Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives. The $800bn-$850bn package, however, could be more contentious.</p> <p>The Trump administration has proposed a cut to payroll taxes, which fund government pensions and healthcare programmes, and stimulus to stricken sectors of the economy. Democrats are pushing for measures that are more tailored towards low-income families, such as unemployment assistance and food aid. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e70f8948f088d75755951da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T16:23:47.829Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s a video clip of Steve Mnuchin speaking at the White House, telling Americans:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to a million dollars as an individual....and $10m to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days. </p> <p>All you have to do is file your taxes.

Sunak\u2019s stimulus came after the London market had closed but the FTSE-100 also closed up 2.8% at 5295 as hopes for stimulus grew.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Robert Chote, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the body responsible for the government\u2019s economic forecasting, said the UK faced a \u201cwartime situation\u201d and should not hesitate to borrow more to deal with the disruption caused by the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Sunak\u2019s failure to announce immediate measures to directly support workers was criticised by Labour\u2019s John McDonnell. The shadow chancellor said: \u201cThe further announcements laid out by the chancellor lack the certainty required amidst growing public anxiety, and still do not go far enough in protecting workers, renters and those who are losing their jobs, or in fully supporting businesses at the scale necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn particular, the chancellor\u2019s claim that new forms of employment support will be developed does not appreciate the urgency and gravity of the situation. Workers and businesses need to know now that they will be supported, not in a few days\u2019 time.</p> \n<p>Sunak told McDonnell in the House of Commons that the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, would announce measures in the coming days, \u201cto protect renters in these difficult times\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/the-chancellors-stimulus-package-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough\">Labour leadership contender Keir Starmer, writing in the Guardian</a>, attacked the government\u2019s response to the crisis in recent days, warning that \u201cconfused messaging and policy-making\u201d has \u201cexacerbated uncertainty and cannot continue\u201d.</p> \n<p>He called for the government to publish a \u201cnational plan of action\u201d and for Sunak to update MPs regularly on the evolving economic situation and the measures he will take to combat the crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe chancellor should commit to making regular financial statements, with updated economic forecasts. That way, parliament will be able to subject the government\u2019s approach to effective scrutiny and test what further intervention may be necessary to protect jobs and the economy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cThe chancellor has acted swiftly to back retail businesses dealing with the unprecedented challenges created by coronavirus. He is to be congratulated for listening carefully to the concerns of retailers and has delivered a big, bold package of measures that will be a huge cashflow boost and will improve confidence for those affected.</p> \n<p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cThe chancellor is right to provide this emergency support for business. But it must be conditional on employers protecting jobs and livelihoods, as is the case in countries like Sweden and Denmark. This can\u2019t be just a bailout for boardrooms \u2013 it has to be about putting money in workers\u2019 pockets too.</p> \n<p>Sunak was criticised by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, for announcing his plans to the media, before telling MPs. \u201cMinisters have a duty to report first to this house when major changes of policy are announced,\u201d he said, prompting the chancellor to apologise, before repeating almost word for word the announcement he had already made on live TV.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-covid-19-economic-plan-fine-sentiment-but-lacks-details\">The Guardian view on the UK\u2019s Covid-19 economic plan: fine sentiment, but lacks details | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The announcements came as No 10 created a new system of ministerial committees devoted to streamlining the government response to the virus.

  "<p>Mark Gallagher, a consultant cardiologist, is at home with a temperature of 38 and is pretty certain he has Covid-19. But the NHS will not test him for it. Instead, he has paid for a test kit from a private UK clinic and a colleague in China is sending him another.</p> \n<p>Gallagher has been in and out of his London hospital every day for the last 28 in a row.

If the test is negative \u2013 as these days it usually is \u2013 they will be admitted after a second negative test on arrival. They went through a total lockdown and they tested and tracked the contacts of every single suspected case and tested them as well. \u201cThat\u2019s how you kill an epidemic,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Although the self-isolation policies announced by the prime minister on Monday were a slight improvement, Gallagher feels they are not enough. \u201cIt could be eliminated if we worked really hard, but there is a policy of surrender,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur in-house occupational health and infection control teams are competent and hard-working and the infection control people have been at excellent and brave, circulating on the affected wards,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem is the instructions coming out of Public Health England and the government, which is attempting to control the UK epidemic by mathematical modelling.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny such model is only as good as the input data, and the data going into this one are not necessarily applicable to the UK being based on countries with very different behaviour patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also solely intended to flatten the curve, when even a flat curve will kill thousands. These approaches would be an acceptable experiment if there were no alternatives but we have strategies from elsewhere that have been shown to work.\u201d</p> \n<p>We should be learning the lessons, he says, from the sharp lockdown in Hubei \u2013 and the very energetic contact tracing that has taken place in South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. The approach of the UK falls far short of that.</p>",

In practice it has been neither.</p> \n<p>Uefa\u2019s plan was a product of the banking meltdown in Europe, which deprived football of a suitably lavish and willing host. The border\u2011hopping, low-cost air\u2011travel compromise was a response to this. Eight years on The Euros of Everywhere occupies a neat but sickly position, bookended by two global crises.</p> \n<p>There is something extra poignant in their failure. The European Championship was conjured initially out of a spirit of hope, and of internationalism. Henri Delaunay, the first general secretary of Uefa, was hugely enthused by the ideals of the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor to the EU. His championship, the first edition of which eventually kicked off two years after his death, was in some small part a force for integration and progress.</p> \n<p>That skein of idealism has of course been consumed by the urge to expand and monetise this wildly successful arm of the entertainment industry.</p> \n<p>At the end of which Uefa has ended up bringing us this ludicrously distended version, with matches staged 3,200 miles apart, and one quarter-final due to take place at a point east of Riyadh.</p> \n<p>Even before the current crisis this has not been a story of endless growth. The Euros has looked for some time like an ailing, overstretched concept.

It follows concerns raised by pathologists that current legislation allows coronavirus victims to have open coffins and have their bodies embalmed while remaining contagious.</p> \n<p>The National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors and the National Association of Funeral Directors were among organisations which coordinated a conference call with the Cabinet Office on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>According to sources one suggestion raised with government officials was to encourage mourners to stream funerals over social media to friends and family. </p> \n<p>Modern crematoriums tend to be equipped to broadcast funerals via the internet to mourners living abroad. Funeral directors believe that social distancing and self-isolation could see more people take up this option. Family members who do attend could be advised to stand further apart during a funeral service, or limit numbers.</p> \n<p>There were also calls for the government to give funeral directors access to personal protection equipment if they are removing bodies from homes where someone is suspected of having died from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Burials could also take place with a memorial at a later date, according to Alison Crake, a funeral director who helped draw up the nationwide pandemic plan for the funeral industry.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe likelihood is a family will be self-isolating immediately after someone has died. We are concerned about inconsistencies which is making it very difficult for us to give advice. It may be that a family takes a decision to have a smaller service now and a memorial service at a later date,\u201d said Crake, who did not take part in Tuesday\u2019s meeting.</p> \n<p>She said it was \u201cnatural instinct\u201d for people grieving the death of a loved one to reach out and comfort each other and the government needed to clarify what would be a safe way to congregate in the case of a funeral.</p> \n<p>\u201cA traditional funeral where you expect people to go into a venue, a church, a crematorium chapel \u2013 if you think of the advice on social distancing and if you think what happens at the funeral, it\u2019s a very natural instinct to comfort people and have your family close to you.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to think about what advice we give people to help [them] understand where there is different advice in terms of older people. Earlier start times for burials are also likely, with the usually unpopular 9am slots likely to be filled,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Crake\u2019s guidance suggests all staff removing an infected body should wear a long-sleeved gown, goggles and a face mask.</p> \n<p>The Association of Anatomical Pathology Technology (AAPT), which represents morticians, is seeking urgent clarification from Public Health England (PHE) over the rules of handling the bodies of coronavirus victims.</p> \n<p>A leaked email from the organisation said: \u201cAAPT are aware of the latest guidance stating that body bags are not required and that viewing, hygienic preparation, viewing and embalming are all permitted. We are urgently trying to clarify this guidance with PHE, especially around body bags and personal protective clothing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Irish Association of Funeral Directors provoked criticism last week when it said all funeral services for coronavirus victims should be postponed, and the deceased brought straight to the crematorium or cemetery for committal. It also recommended banning family members from funeral homes and limousines for transport.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The British government has been reluctant to put a definitive figure on the number of potential Covid-19 deaths in the months ahead.

Treasury officials \u2014 like the rest of government \u2014 were completely blindsided by yesterday\u2019s dramatic clampdown, and were last night hastily considering a range of options that might keep small businesses afloat.

  "<p>China will expel US reporters of three major US news outlets, in a hugely damaging attack on foreign media coverage of the country \u2013 and an escalation of the showdown over the press between Washington and Beijing.</p> <p>The decision, announced just after midnight Beijing time, requires US citizens working for the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal to halt reporting and hand in their press cards within 10 days, if their credentials expire before the end of 2020.</p> <p>China usually gives journalists only 12-month visas and press cards, so the measure is likely to impact most correspondents. It will decimate some of the biggest newsrooms in China and force reporters with decades of experience covering the country to leave.</p> <p>They will be barred from working not only in the mainland, but also Hong Kong, the self-autonomous city that has in the past provided a base for China correspondents unable to get a visa from Chinese authorities.</p> <p>\u201cThey will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People\u2019s Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1757162.shtml\">the ministry of foreign affairs</a> said.</p> <p>The decision to include Hong Kong in the announcement raised disturbing questions about the city\u2019s autonomy, as it is meant to control its own media accreditation under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement between the UK and China that succeeded the handover from colonial rule.</p> <p>\u201cThis is obviously an escalation in the tit-for-tat between Washington and Beijing. But the scale and scope of it is surprising, disproportionate and unprecedented,\u201d said Yuen Chan, senior lecturer in journalism at City University London.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s particularly unusual and disturbing that Hong Kong and Macau are included in the restrictions. In the past, American correspondents who\u2019ve been kicked out or experienced visa delays have worked in their organisation\u2019s bureaus in Hong Kong \u2013 this won\u2019t now be possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/18/us-chinese-media-propaganda-state-department\">US tightens rules on Chinese state media over 'propaganda' concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he regretted China\u2019s decision and hoped Beijing would reconsider, saying the move would deprive the world of information in \u201cincredibly challenging\u201d times caused by the coronavirus.</p> <p>The three papers whose staff are being expelled \u2013 and two other US outlets, Time and Voice of America \u2013 will be required to \u201cdeclare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China\u201d.</p> <p>China said it was responding to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/18/us-chinese-media-propaganda-state-department\">US move last month</a> to tighten controls on Chinese state media organisations, classifying them as foreign missions.</p> <p>\u201cIn recent years, the US government has placed unwarranted restrictions on Chinese media agencies and personnel in the US, purposely made things difficult for their normal reporting assignments, and subjected them to growing discrimination and politically-motivated oppression,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said.</p> <p>\u201cThe above-mentioned measures are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organisations experience in the US.\u201d</p> <p>But Pompeo disputed the comparison, saying all reporters in Washington enjoy press freedoms that don\u2019t exist in China.</p> <p>\u201cThe individuals that we identified a few weeks back were not media that were acting here freely,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were part of Chinese propaganda outlets. We\u2019ve identified these as foreign missions under American law. These aren\u2019t apples to apples, and I regret China\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct free press operations.\u201d</p> <p>The US state department initially said in February that it would not impose any restrictions on Chinese media\u2019s activities in the US.</p> <p>But after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/china-bars-wall-street-journal-reporters-over-derogatory-column\">China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters</a>, the US slashed by nearly half the number of Chinese nationals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/washington-slashes-chinese-journalist-quota\">allowed to work for their state-run media there</a>.

While this is a welcome step, we urge the government now to release all UK dual nationals arbitrarily detained in Iran, and enable them to return to their families in the UK,\u201d the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said.</p> <h2>Euro 2020 is suspended</h2> <p>The summer\u2019s international football tournament, which was due to be held in various countries simultaneously rather than in one host nation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/17/euro-2020-postponed-coronavirus-uefa-champions-league-europa-league\">became the latest sporting event to be postponed</a>.</p> <p>European football\u2019s governing body, Uefa, said it would be put back until 2021 after a conference call with Europe\u2019s 55 national football associations.</p> <h2>Donald Trump criticised over \u2018Chinese virus\u2019 tweet</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">The US president escalated a diplomatic spat</a> when he referred to \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d.

  "<p>TikTok moderators were told to suppress videos from users who appeared too ugly, poor or disabled, as part of the company\u2019s efforts to curate an aspirational air in the videos it promotes, according to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/\">new documents published by the Intercept</a>.</p> <p>The documents detail how moderators for the social video app were instructed to select content for the influential \u201cFor You\u201d feed, an algorithmic timeline that is most users\u2019 first port of call when they open the app. As a result, being selected for For You can drive huge numbers of views to a given video, but the selection criteria have always remained a secret, with little understanding as to the amount of automation involved.</p> <p>TikTok\u2019s moderators were instructed to exclude videos from the For You feed if they failed on any one of a number of categories, the documents show. Users with an \u201cabnormal body shape (not limited to: dwarf, acromegaly),\u201d who are \u201cchubby \u2026 obese or too thin\u201d or who have \u201cugly facial looks or facial deformities\u201d should be removed, one document says, since \u201cif the character\u2019s appearance is not good, the video will be much less attractive, not worthing [sic] to be recommended to new users.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, the documents show, videos were to be removed from the feed if \u201cthe shooting environment is shabby and dilapidated\u201d, since \u201cthis kind of environment is \u2026 less fancy and appealing\u201d.</p> <p>A TikTok spokesperson said the goal was to prevent bullying on the platform, tying the document to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/03/tiktok-owns-up-to-censoring-some-users-videos-to-stop-bullying\">a report from December</a> that showed that the company was suppressing vulnerable users\u2019 videos in a misguided effort to prevent them from becoming the centre of attention that could turn sour. The categories of video suppressed in the latest document are far broader than those revealed in December, however, nor is any mention of bullying, a discrepancy the company attributes to a local interpretation of the wider policy.</p> <p>Other documents published by the Intercept show the extent of TikTok\u2019s former rules requiring moderators to enforce Chinese foreign policy overseas. The site published the company\u2019s livestreaming policies, which instruct moderators to take down \u201ccontroversial content\u201d that promotes Taiwanese independence or is \u201cuglification\u201d of history, such as the Tiananmen Square \u201cincidents\u201d.</p> <p>The language is identical to that used in documents first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing\">reported by the Guardian in September 2019</a>. At the time, TikTok said the documents were old, and had been out of use since May that year, but the Intercept cites a source who indicated that the policies \u201cwere in use through at least late 2019\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, TikTok said:</p> <p>\u201cThe livestream guidelines in question appear to be largely the same or similar to the guidelines the Guardian already reported on last year, which were removed both before the Guardian\u2019s reporting and also prior to when the Intercept says the document was accessed. Over the past year, we have established trust and safety hubs in California, Dublin and Singapore, which oversee development and execution of our moderation policies and are headed by industry experts with extensive experience in these areas. Local teams apply the updated community guidelines that we published in January, all aimed at keeping TikTok a place of open self-expression and a safe environment for users and creators alike.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the guidelines the Intercept presented are either no longer in use, or in some cases appear to have never been in place, but it is correct that for live streaming TikTok is particularly vigilant about keeping sexualised content off the platform.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech unicorn Bytedance, has been trying to separate its international efforts from its Chinese home for at least a year. But many staff, including moderators, are still based in China.</p> <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, the last of those China-based moderators will be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-to-stop-using-china-based-moderators-to-monitor-overseas-content-11584300597\">shifted to other work inside the company</a> shortly, with locally-based moderators picking up the slack. TikTok had already succeeded in moderating all US content from outside China, but relied on China-based moderators for many other countries, in particular to provide 24-hour cover for much of Europe.</p>",
  "<p>The government has placed the economy on a wartime footing to support businesses and people affected by coronavirus, announcing state-backed loans of at least \u00a3330bn as the outbreak escalates.</p> \n<p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a>, said if more help was needed it would be provided, with a pledge to deliver \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep companies and households solvent.</p> \n<p>Saying the British state would need to intervene in the economy in ways that were unimaginable just weeks ago, the chancellor said he would also provide tax breaks and other measures worth \u00a320bn to protect companies and households suffering amid the economic collapse triggered by the virus.</p> \n<p>Cash grants worth \u00a325,000 would be made to retail, leisure and hospitality firms to help them survive the period of turbulence.

These are only the first steps,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Other nations around the world are stepping up their efforts to combat the unfolding economic collapse amid the coronavirus outbreak. Donald Trump\u2019s administration announced earlier on Tuesday that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/us-government-to-give-citizens-emergency-financial-aid\">planed</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/us-government-to-give-citizens-emergency-financial-aid\"> to send cheques directly to American citizens</a> as part of a package of emergency financial support to the world\u2019s largest economy worth at least $850bn (\u00a3702.1bn).</p> \n<p>He said he would set out further steps in the coming days and that he was holding talks with unions and business groups to develop a form of employment support to help protect jobs and incomes.</p> \n<p>Sunak and Johnson were vague about the specific help that would be provided to individuals in difficulty because of the virus, beyond a three-month mortgage holiday and the promise of more details to come.</p> \n<p>However, the amounts involved are unprecedented in peacetime. The sum of \u00a3330bn is equivalent to 15% of GDP, and Sunak said more would be provided if needed.</p> \n<p>The loans, made on \u201cattractive\u201d but unspecified terms, would allow firms to carry out fundamental day-to-day tasks such as paying wages and rent bills and buying stock. The money, available from the start of next week, will be offered via the Bank of England for bigger firms, while smaller enterprises can seek business interruption loans of up to \u00a35m each.</p> \n<p>Emergency legislation being presented by the government on Thursday to coordinate the response to coronavirus will include the power \u201cto offer whatever further financial support I decide is necessary\u201d, Sunak said.</p> \n<p>The announcements came as No 10 created a new system of ministerial committees devoted to streamlining the government response to the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson will still chair regular meetings of the existing Cobra emergencies committee, but also another, coronavirus-specific committee of ministers and senior officials, known as C-19, which will meet daily.</p> \n<p>Additionally, No 10 has created four so-called implementation committees focusing on health, the economy, preparedness elsewhere in the public sector and on the international response, all of which will feed into C-19.</p> \n<p>The health committee will be chaired by Matt Hancock, the health secretary; that on the economy by Rishi Sunak; the public sector committee by Michael Gove; and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will chair the international committee.

  "<p>Even as Broadway shows were shuttered and Disneyland was closed due to the Covid-19, most US national parks were open for business on Tuesday, confounding public health officials and worrying park staff who did not want to be exposed to the virus.</p> <p>National parks have become a haven over the past week as the public seeks places to go during spring break. One park employee reported on Facebook that a visitor center at Big Bend national park was full on Monday with hundreds of people. Another shared a photo of shoulder to shoulder crowds at Zion national park waiting to board shuttle buses. (The park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/news/zion-national-park-to-temporarily-suspend-shuttle-operation-to-comply-with-coronovirus-protective-guidelines.htm\">closed</a> its shuttle bus system later in the day.)</p> <p>The only units in the system that have closed in response to Covid-19 are Golden Gate national recreation area, the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty.</p> <p>National park staff who were interviewed for this story but requested anonymity for fear of retribution reported that superintendents in charge of at least two parks had requested permission from the Department of the Interior to close their units but so far no approvals have been granted. The Department of Interior did not respond to a request for comment on its park closure policy. </p> <p>\u201cOur focus is on ensuring park employees are safe,\u201d said Grand Canyon national park public information officer Lily Daniels.</p> <p>Grand Canyon tourists milled around inside the park visitor center yesterday, rode shuttle buses and ate at restaurants.</p> <p>Daniels said that social distancing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/grand-canyon-national-park-public-health-update.htm\">measures</a> taken by the park include limiting shuttles to passengers who can find a seat, paying entrance fees at kiosks rather than at counters, and closing the theater inside the visitor center. \u201cWe are working in close consultation with the Centers for Disease Control,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked about the CDC guidelines on preventing large gatherings of people, Daniels said she was not sure how many people were in the Grand Canyon visitor center yesterday. Grand Canyon is one of the most popular parks in the system with nearly 6 million visitors a year.</p> <p>Many national parks offer wide open spaces that are ideal for social distancing and are not inherently risky environments during the coronavirus pandemic. However, park infrastructure such as restrooms and trash cans require regular upkeep from staff in order to prevent the kind of rapid deterioration that occurred during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.</p> <p>Park employees from units across the country vented on social media about fears for themselves and their community. Many staff live in dorm-like quarters.</p> <p>One low-level park employee who cleans public restrooms wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if I get sick but when.\u201d While park employees in management positions are allowed to work from home, many minimum wage-level workers are forced to come in contact with visitors from all over the world in order to earn their paycheck.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians never go to the frontlines themselves but they often decide to put others in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Tom Myers, who has worked as a physician at Grand Canyon national park\u2019s clinic for 30 years. \u201cIn this case it\u2019s the park\u2019s working poor, all in the name of maintaining the economy. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that southern Utah\u2019s national parks and other popular federal lands are still open prompted the Southeast Utah health department to declare a \u201clocal public health emergency\u201d on Sunday in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus to a remote area where no cases had been reported to date.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned people will come and get sick,\u201d the mayor of Moab, Emily Niehaus, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2020/03/17/amid-coronavirus-threat\">told</a> the Salt Lake Tribune. While Moab is internationally famous for its proximity to iconic national parks like Arches and Canyonlands, its hospital only has 17 beds. \u201cBeing a rural community, we don\u2019t have the capacity to deal with a pandemic,\u201d Niehaus added.</p> <p>It may be private concessions operators that finally push the Department of Interior to close parks as coronavirus spreads. On Monday, Eastern National, which runs retail stores in 170 national parks, announced it would no longer provide staffing at those facilities. \u201cOur store staff are unable to maintain the social distancing that the CDC recommends in our store while serving visitors,\u201d wrote Eastern National\u2019s CEO, Kevin Kissling, in a memo sent to national park managers.</p> <p>In the Grand Canyon, private outfitters are also taking matters into their own hands.</p> <p>\u201cWe proactively canceled all our trips,\u201d said Dave Logan, owner of Flagstaff, Arizona-based Four Season Guides. \u201cWe decided to do it not only for the health of our guests but also for the health of our guides. We don\u2019t want them getting sick and then spreading the virus around in our community.\u201d</p> <p>The decision is a big financial hit for Logan who depends on the popular spring break hiking season for a large chunk of his revenue. \u201cWe refunded every penny,\u201d he said. \u201cMy company has a sense of personal responsibility in dealing with this crisis.

  "<p>Universities and colleges need to prepare their students for a new world of work. Workplaces are becoming more collaborative, data-driven and agile.

They will connect with subject experts for any queries, but the onus will be on the students to work collaboratively to drive their learning.</p> <p>The traditional academic programme is being reimagined at the university \u2013 a collaboration between King\u2019s College London, UNSW Sydney and Arizona State University \u2013 in its quest to turn out a new type of engineering graduate.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a particular shortage of engineers who have broad skills, who can integrate and who are socially aware. So what we\u2019re trying to do is develop that type of graduate,\u201d says TEDI-London dean and CEO Judy Raper.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that pedagogy will influence how professionals get those essential skills, such as teamwork, leadership, collaboration and being aware of society and how it behaves. And so we\u2019ve turned the pedagogy upside down,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Students will learn primarily through designing and making products rather than theoretically. The campus is based at London\u2019s Canada Water and students will build products to help the area\u2019s goal of becoming a tech-enabled smart city.</p> <p>TEDI-London\u2019s revolutionary approach is a response to the demands of industry, where employers are seeking graduates who can quickly fit into the new ways of working, she says.</p> <p>Employers are particularly concerned about a lack of relevant skills and experience among new employees. Only 18% of executives interviewed in a <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/consultancy/deloitte-uk-digital-disruption-index-2019.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey</a> by Deloitte thought that UK school leavers and graduates have the right digital skills.</p> <p>In light of this, universities are giving students experience of using the latest workplace collaboration tools, such as Microsoft Teams, Google G Suite, Slack and Zoom. These are being widely adopted in workplaces. They allow staff to collaborate on documents and files in real time and hold virtual meetings through video conferencing. Microsoft Teams \u2013 which is free for students \u2013 is being introduced into many colleges as a tool to allow groups of students to collaborate on tasks from different locations.</p> <p>\u201cMicrosoft Teams is a gamechanger for us,\u201d says Vicky Gosling, head of digital experience at Falmouth University, which runs specialist courses for the creative industries. A pilot scheme is running in the university\u2019s games academy, using Microsoft Teams to bring students together to work on designing computer games. The Teams software will be introduced more widely across the university\u2019s courses in September.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a pioneering approach to learning is being taken at the University of the West of England\u2019s faculty of business and law in Bristol. Its \u00a355m state-of-the-art building that opened in 2017 aims to showcase the types of work settings students will encounter once they graduate. The building includes social and learning spaces that allow staff, students and business people to work together.</p> <p>The centre has a number of technology-enabled active learning (Teal) classrooms. These have a screen at the front of the room and six desks around its edges, each with a connected computer so students can work in groups then showcase their work to those on other tables via the main screen.</p> <p>On entering the building, there is a ground-floor cafe and an atrium that shows off the professional workspaces on the centre\u2019s seven floors. There\u2019s a Bloomberg financial trading room, showcase law courts where students can act out court cases and a team entrepreneurship space where students set up and run their own businesses.

After a frenzied few months of Tin, Championship Manager 01-02 and rediscovering the concept of \u201cbaths\u201d, can you imagine actually wanting to watch a real-life football tournament? The Fiver certainly can\u2019t. The home brew is coming along nicely, and we\u2019ve just signed Mike Duff, but in actual breaking news that will come as a shock to absolutely nobody (although we\u2019re sure rolling sports media outlets can find some), Euro 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/17/euro-2020-postponed-coronavirus-uefa-champions-league-europa-league\">will now take place next summer</a>, hypothetically giving room this year for Europe\u2019s domestic leagues to finish in time for the start of next season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/west-ham-karren-brady-calls-for-premier-league-cancellation-coronavirus\">Fear not, Karren Brady</a>!</p> \n<p>Following an emergency MSN Messenger group chat with 55 federations, the Norwegian FA was first to disclose the news on Social Media Disgrace Twitter. \u201cUefa has decided that the European Championship is postponed to 2021,\u201d it parped. \u201cIt will be played from 11 June to 11 July next year.\u201d Uefa\u2019s chief suit, Aleksander Ceferin, followed, er, suit. \u201cWe are at the helm of a sport that vast numbers of people live and breathe that has been laid low by this invisible and fast-moving opponent,\u201d he sighed. \u201cUefa tabled a range of options so that competitions can finish this season safely and I am proud of the response of my colleagues across European football.

Currently the Women\u2019s European Championships \u2013 long scheduled for 7 July-1 August 2021 \u2013 directly clashes with the new dates, but with Ceferin asserting last year that <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/uefaorg/Womensfootball/02/60/51/38/2605138_DOWNLOAD.pdf\">\u201cwomen\u2019s football is the football of today, it is not the football of tomorrow\u201d</a>, The Fiver foresees no immediate problems with this particular hiccup.

Like some clubs who \u2018live tweeted\u2019 games that didn\u2019t happen, surely The Fiver could just carry on as usual and pretend football was not stopped. Of course this might lead to lazy journalism and factual inaccuracies, but I suspect none of us would notice the difference, or care terribly much, and we\u2019d all still feel we were getting value for money. Oh. Stay safe Fiver\u201d \u2013 Phil Smyth.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like to hear about my small but significant contribution towards The Fiver\u2019s noble STOP FOOTBALL campaign. A group of Dickensian urchins were noisily kicking a football outside the flats at the weekend, using hoodies for goalposts and disturbing my afternoon\u2019s virus discussion with Mrs Tin. I loudly told them that the season is over and football has been stopped. Naturally, I was left with no choice other than to confiscate the ball, goalposts, and rudimentary VAR machine. There were tears of course, but I told them it\u2019s for their own good\u201d \u2013 Mark Husbands.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere were me and my fellow Bury fans thinking that football had stopped last August\u201d \u2013 Darrien Bold.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems like the success of the Stop Football campaign is beneficial to The Fiver.

Comments include that women lawyers are \u2018bitches\u2019, \u2018evil\u2019, \u2018snakes\u2019, and \u2018fugly\u2019. I trust that such comments would not have been allowed if they had been present at the hearing and those making them would have been removed from the hearing.</p> <p>\u201cAs well as some generally offensive comments, many of the comments perpetuate discredited notions about domestic violence; for example, denying that the vast preponderance of domestic violence is perpetrated by men upon women and that women are \u2018liars\u2019.

I have written to the chair and echo the concerns of the Law Council of Australia.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry was controversially established last year despite the Australian Law Reform Commission having recently conducted <a href=\"https://www.alrc.gov.au/news/family-law-inquiry-final-report-released/\">its own review,</a> which made a number of recommendations for reform. The process has been criticised as a concession to the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, who has taken up the mantle of the men\u2019s rights movement, and the far-right party\u2019s influential position on the Senate crossbench.</p> <p>While many expert groups and women\u2019s advocates have told the inquiry that reforms to better protect vulnerable women are urgent, the first full week of the inquiry has been dominated by the airing of fringe, discredited and dangerous views; including debate about whether women lie about domestic violence to gain advantage in the family court. Experts have repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16293307\">refuted those and similar statements</a>.</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Legal Service Queensland and Women\u2019s Legal Services Australia have both also lodged complaints about the conduct of the inquiry.</p> <p>The Queensland body\u2019s letter said <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/mothers-futile-search-for-answers-over-eevas-death-in-a-system-fatally-flawed/news-story/ae07cf1e485774c6e4b31dea01b8ecc2\">Michelle Dorendahl</a>, whose child Eeva was murdered by her father, had been in the audience at the Brisbane hearing and was \u201cparticularly impacted\u201d by the \u201cabusive and disrespectful\u201d manner in which the inquiry was conducted.</p> <p>\u201cThe manner in which Senator Hanson conducted herself \u2026 was unprofessional, disrespectful and verging on vitriolic,\u201d WLSQ chief executive Angela Lynch said.</p> <p>\u201cVirtually screaming at a women\u2019s service \u2018what about the men\u2019 does not further the issues in dispute and in our opinion is purely made to enliven an emotional and argumentative response from us and embolden her Facebook followers.</p> <p>\u201cWe are more than happy to participate in civil debate about these issues but not in a public screaming match.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch said attacking women as liars was particularly harmful as many were vulnerable, lacked support or were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>\u201cSenator Hanson\u2019s presence was always going to impact on the neutrality of the committee and impact on the ability of survivors to give evidence, thereby restricting and skewing evidence to the inquiry\u201d.</p> <p>In her letter to Andrews, Wright asks the committee to prevent future broadcasts by One Nation, to refer certain posts on the broadcast to \u201crelevant authorities\u201d, and to direct all footage and comments be removed.</p> <p>\u201cFurther, in light of the events outlined above the Law Council believes the committee\u2019s inquiry should be discontinued,\u201d Wright said.</p>",

  "<p>Ali Cobby Eckermann had $47 in the bank and was living in a caravan when she found out, in March 2017, that she\u2019d won the world\u2019s richest literary prize, the Windham Campbell.</p> <p>The prize is a coup for any writer. Administered by Yale University, judged anonymously and not open to submissions (it comes as a shock to all who are selected, not least one who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/02/helen-garner-learns-of-207000-literary-prize-win-after-checking-junk-email\">found it in her junk mail</a>), it was worth some A$215,000 a head when Eckermann learned she was one of eight winning writers.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Windham Campbell prize is announced on Thursday. Its aim is to \u201ccall attention to literary achievement and provide writers with the opportunity to focus on their work independent of financial concerns.\u201d</p> <p>For Eckermann, a member of Australia\u2019s Stolen Generations \u2013 who only started writing in earnest after finding both her long-lost mother and the son who was taken from her \u2013 it was transformative.</p> <p>\u201cI lived debt-free, but still, I was pretty poor,\u201d says the poet, 57. \u201cYou\u2019re so used to living that way. I thought I was living quite a comfortable, happy life, so it was very, very shocking to receive the recognition of my work.\u201d</p> <p>From her first publication, the 2009 poetry collection Little Bit Long Time, to her 2012 verse novel Ruby Moonlight and the award-winning 2015 collection Inside My Mother, Eckermann has written through the trauma, violence, loss and healing of her own and other Indigenous people\u2019s lives under colonisation.</p> <p>Born in 1963, Eckermann was taken from her mother \u2013 a survivor of the British nuclear testing at Maralinga, South Australia \u2013 when she was a baby. She was adopted by a white family who lived on a farm in north-east South Australia.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have a happy time at school, she says, and was expelled for standing up to racism before finishing. \u201cThat was schooling done for me.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 17 she ran away. \u201cI didn\u2019t really run away from my adopted family; I ran away from the adopted society that I was living in,\u201d she says. She made her way \u2013 instinctively, she says \u2013 to the desert (\u201cI probably felt safer out there,\u201d she says). She landed at the tiny town of Ooldea, little more than a railway siding on the edge of the Nullarbor Plain. There, she met the man who would become her son\u2019s father.</p> <p>Sometimes she caught wild camels; sometimes she picked up manual labour. For a while she worked as a roller on a road gang. She liked working outdoors, and the remoteness of the country meant she could keep her relationship with drugs and alcohol in check.</p> <p>Things changed when she moved back down south. It was the 1980s, and while Indigenous child removal was no longer legislated, there was still little meaningful support for Indigenous parents. Her son was adopted out, and Eckermann, having been both stolen and stolen from, checked in for a six-month stint in rehab.</p> <p>When she came out of rehab, she began a long search for her mother: activist and Yankunytjatjara woman, Ngingali Cullen. \u201cMy instincts had led me so close,\u201d she says now: that tiny speck of settlement on the map that she had found when she was 17 turned out to be her mother\u2019s birthplace. She made her way to Alice Springs to be close to her Aboriginal family \u2013 and it was there that she was finally reunited with her son.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden I was the mother and realising, oh my god, this empty hole [I feel] is not my mother; this empty hole has been my son,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever have estimated the effect of the loss of him. And so meeting him \u2013 he was tangible, and he was there in front of my eyes, this handsome 18-year old-lad.\u201d</p> <p>They lived together in a shed on the edge of town, with furniture sourced from hard rubbish, under the watchful eye of the local elders and traditional healers.</p> <p>\u201cI learned so much in that four years. I was starting to learn a little language, the old people were looking after me, mentoring culture and healing, and that was when the poetry started coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to hold my guard up any more.\u201d</p> <p>At the urging of a fellow writer, she sent off a collection to a competition run by Australian Poetry. To her astonishment \u2013 she had been writing for herself, not for a career \u2013 the manuscript, Little Bit Long Time, was published.</p> <p>She left Alice Springs after the Northern Territory intervention began wrenching apart the community that had shown her so much kindness. \u201cMy heart was crying too much,\u201d she says. But she kept writing \u2013 weaving the stories of her newfound family into her work. Despite having very little money, she started the first Aboriginal writers\u2019 retreat at her home in an old colonial building in Koolunga. \u201cPeople were saving up on the Centrelink for months and then coming out for a weekend and sitting around the fire and bringing the kids.\u201d </p> <p>In 2013, Ruby Moonlight won the NSW premier\u2019s book of the year award. Soon afterwards, Eckermann moved to Adelaide, to the caravan that was her home when she won the Windham Campbell.</p> <p>It\u2019s taken these past three years to really feel the benefits of winning the prize, she says \u2013 one of the biggest of which was her reorientation to seeing writing as a career, as well as personal path to healing. \u201cGood foundations are built not in haste \u2026 It\u2019s taken me a little time to adjust. I now have to accept that I\u2019m an internationally known writer.\u201d</p> <p>RMIT offered her a three-year position as an adjunct professor, and she began investing in her writing career, working on a collection of essays and a novel. With the money, she self-funded a mentorship for a young Indigenous writer; she was able to help out family members \u201cwho still live pretty humbly\u201d; and she paid herself a salary.</p> <p>That salary allowed her to spend time with her adopted mother, who died only a few months ago.</p> <p>\u201cI really needed that time because she\u2019s the mum that had known me the longest,\u201d Eckermann says. \u201cShe knew every aspect of my journey. It was very important for me to sit with her. And I could afford to, right up to the end.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The 2020 Windham Campbell is announced on Thursday at 9am London time, 3pm New York time, and at 6am on Friday Australian eastern standard time.</em></p>",

  "<p>Chinese students at UK universities are \u201cfleeing back to China\u201d amid concerns about the British government\u2019s handling of the spread of the virus and an increase in racist attacks triggered by so-called maskaphobia.</p> <p>While some students have already returned, many of those who remain are struggling to secure seats on a dwindling number of flights, which are being sold at inflated prices. There are also reports that some are trying to book private jets to get home.</p> <p>\u201cI was a bit shocked by how quickly the UK is hit by the coronavirus,\u201d said Tao Wang, a politics PhD student at the University of Manchester. \u201cMany Chinese students are now fleeing back to China, and I have been struggling to make a decision.\u201d</p> <p>Wang said many in the Chinese student community believed they would now be safer in China than in the UK, and their families were begging them to return. \u201cI think people are very suspicious about the [UK] government measures. Here, until now, we\u2019ve seen some soft measures calling for people to wash their hands. As a Chinese student you expect more draconian measures.\u201d</p> <p>Chinese students also report an increase in racist attacks as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, with some wearing masks becoming targets for racists.</p> <p>Yinxuan Huang, a sociology research fellow at City University London, has been conducting research among Chinese Christian communities in the UK, who have been supporting Chinese students during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/coronavirus-weaponised-way-to-be-openly-racist\">Coronavirus fears fuel racism and hostility, say British-Chinese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAlmost all incidents they reported were associated with \u2018maskaphobia\u2019,\u201d said Huang, which is a fear of masks which then triggered racist attacks. \u201cMost of the victims \u2013 some got called \u2018virus\u2019 and others got shoved \u2013 were wearing masks when attacked.</p> <p>\u201cMany Chinese students feel that the issue of the mask is the single biggest cultural shock they have ever experienced in the UK. They are now facing a dilemma and have to choose between two bad choices - insecurity (for coronavirus) and fear (for racism).\u201d</p> <p>One 24-year-old Chinese postgraduate student at the University of Manchester described an incident while out shopping in the city centre with a friend. \u201cBoth of us wore face masks. When we were crossing the road, a car passed by and slowed down as it approached us.</p> <p>\u201cAt first, I thought that maybe they just want to let us go first, like most other polite and friendly drivers I met before. But instead, they rolled down the window, and sneezed at us, and then laughed away. Many of my Chinese friends have experienced similar discrimination recently, which has a very bad impact on our study abroad experience.\u201d</p> <p>A 26-year-old Chinese postgraduate student, also in Manchester, said Chinese students were now staying indoors and ordering food online rather than going shopping. \u201cWe are not only afraid of coronavirus, but the violence brought by racism is also much more scary now. I have got the feeling I am an outsider in the UK. And now I finally find we are not welcomed by British people. Diversity sounds like a joke.\u201d</p> <p>Universities in the UK have welcomed growing numbers of students from China in recent years.

The growing coronavirus-related racism is truly disturbing.</p> <p>\u201cIt may well lead some to question: why should I spend tens of thousands of pounds and travel thousands miles away from home to study in a place where I could be attacked simply because of my skin colour, or because I wear a face mask?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have issued an urgent call to protect health workers in hospitals after finding \u201cextensive\u201d levels of coronavirus contamination in specialist wards and intensive-care units and on equipment ranging from keyboards to gel hand sanitisers.</p> \n<p>The widespread contamination was revealed by more than 600 swabs taken throughout a major hospital in Wuhan, China, as the outbreak swept through the city in February, with patients and visitors filling the wards and nearby waiting areas.</p> \n<p>Despite extra cleaning procedures that were introduced at the 3,000-bed Zhongnan medical centre at Wuhan University, researchers found significant contamination in intensive care units and obstetric wards caring for people with the virus, where nearly one-third of swabs tested positive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A fifth of swabs from wards used to isolate coronavirus patients were also contaminated, along with 17% of swabs from the outpatient lobby. More than a 10th of the swabs from the emergency department and clinical labs bore traces of the virus.</p> \n<p>The scientists found substantial contamination on common hospital equipment too. Tests on swabs taken from hand sanitisers and self-service printers that patients use to print out copies of their medical reports found that 20% tested positive. Keyboards, doorknobs and desktops also harboured the virus, with 16% to 17% of swabs containing traces of the germ. One in eight telephone swabs also tested positive.</p> \n<p>The researchers, led by Xinghuan Wang at the hospital, describe the findings as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546v1\">an urgent call</a>\u201d to protect healthcare workers. \u201cThese findings suggest that the hospital environment could potentially be a source of virus spread, including among healthcare workers, patients and visitors,\u201d their report states, adding that the results emphasised the pressing need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning and infection prevention training among healthcare workers during the outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-pandemic-visualising-the-global-crisis\">The coronavirus pandemic: visualising the global crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Coronavirus is spread primarily by droplets that are coughed or sneezed into the air by people who have the infection. But the global movement that is under way to encourage regular and effective handwashing aims to reduce infections that are spread by touching contaminated surfaces.</p> \n<p>According to the study, the highest levels of contamination found in Zhongnan should inform others about the most effective cleaning and disinfection procedures.</p> \n<p>Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said there was no reason for hospitals to be contaminated if they had enough staff and resources. But in many cases they did not, she added.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are starting on the back foot. We are not in a good place because of the austerity measures.

  "<p>There\u2019s a special, sparsely populated subgenre of films that have had a unique effect on my behaviour. They\u2019ve lingered long after the end credits not based on quality but on how they\u2019ve then proceeded to invade my day-to-day decision-making. The most topical example of which, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s cautionary thriller Contagion, has dominated the thoughts of many lately, a chilling warning to watch what we touch and who we interact with. After I saw it back in 2011, I stepped on to the subway suddenly acutely aware of the potential danger of a surface and ever since, when I absent-mindedly touch my face during the day, Kate Winslet\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0e8SxK-_qw\">horrifying reminder</a> of why we shouldn\u2019t be doing this replays in my head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/erin-brockovich-20th-anniversary-julia-roberts-steven-soderbergh\">Erin Brockovich at 20: how a grim true story became a glossy star vehicle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s another that\u2019s been part of my life for even longer and despite its comparative silliness, it\u2019s arguably had a more profound grip, spookily re-entering my mind at strange times such as these. This week marks the 20th anniversary and my (probable) 20th rewatch of Final Destination, a compellingly nasty yet darkly humorous film about the crushing inescapability of death. The set-up remains an underappreciated stroke of genius. A teen has a premonition that his flight to Paris will explode mid-air but finds out that by abandoning the plane with a random assortment of peers, a plan has been interrupted and the Grim Reaper must find gruesome ways to redress the imbalance.</p> <p>And so began a formula that was regurgitated over the span of another four sequels as unintended survivors of a tragedy were picked off one-by-one in a series of freak \u201caccidents\u201d, each one nastier than the last. Dismissed by some at the time as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/movies/film-review-lucky-teenagers-skip-doomed-flight-only-meet-their-match-ground.html\">\u201cdramatically flat\u201d</a> scrap of nonsense made by <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/film/final-destination\">\u201ccontemptuous\u201d</a> film-makers, it was Roger Ebert who <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/final-destination-2000\">provided</a> one of the few voices of dissent, recognising the appeal of the film\u2019s \u201cbiblical\u201d dilemma and its \u201cunusual substance\u201d. As a 15 year old at the time, I was enthralled as I watched and then faintly terrified in the months after.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc06e8f89b3e4b2beeef56875c2e5c79acbf9cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc06e8f89b3e4b2beeef56875c2e5c79acbf9cf0/0_0_4000_2598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Larter in Final Destination\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Larter in Final Destination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: United Archives GmbH/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the film made waves for its deviously well-modulated shocks (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7Um256bbk\">one of which was so effective</a> that the makers had to insert an extended introduction to the next scene as test audiences needed time to calm down), what struck me at the time, and more so with every next rewatch, was the sheer hopelessness of it all, the brutal unambiguousness of its conceit: death is coming for us and there\u2019s nothing we can do to stop it. This wasn\u2019t a villain who could be brought down in a blaze of bullets. There was no cathartic finale to leave us feeling safe and satisfied. Death would remain at large for the rest of time and while we might be able to cheat it once, maybe even twice, it will keep coming and coming and coming until it bumps us off.</p> <p>It would be one thing if death was content to just go about its business with a sense of cold and clinical professionalism but the Final Destination movies suggest that instead, it takes a great level of glee in constructing a series of elaborate and macabre traps. While the opening scene remains the most frightening plane crash ever put to screen, it\u2019s the gory, startling death sequences on the ground that stayed with me, longer than I anticipated. Rather than needing to avoid a masked madman (in the first iteration of the script, intended to be an episode of The X Files, death <em>was</em> personified), in Final Destination, characters would need to avoid <em>everything</em> in order not even to survive but to live a little bit longer (in the sequel, the only survivor from the first film locks herself in a padded cell for protection). Seemingly innocuous elements of everyday life suddenly became instruments of torture. It brought an unsettling fragility to the world of the film and in turn, my teenage real-world view of it.</p> <p>Walking past a construction site would bring visions of a falling brick smashing me in the face. A bathroom would inevitably lead to a fatal slip. The dentist\u2019s chair a myriad of ghoulish possibilities. It\u2019s not quite the crippling fear that it might sound like but more of a \u201cHuh, what if?\u201d thought that would flash into my mind with the same speed with which it would then disappear, long enough for me to second-guess a potentially risky everyday decision. For early millennials that came of age with the franchise, it became a go-to punchline for when one would narrowly cheat death, however low the stakes might seem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7be55f376c7df985e8bf208ac524cb0098e3f93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7be55f376c7df985e8bf208ac524cb0098e3f93/0_129_2640_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristen Clioke in Final Destination.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristen Clioke in Final Destination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a flawed film for sure \u2013 its stabs at broad comedy, courtesy of a post-American Pie Seann William Scott, are as tiresome as the nonsensical law enforcement characters \u2013 but it\u2019s a rare horror film that allows for brief existential grapples from teens who had previously thought of life as unending and death as out of reach. It\u2019s not an openly religious film but I imagine for some who do subscribe to certain belief systems, there\u2019s a strangely reassuring throughline here, that everything happens for a reason, that we\u2019re all part of a grand design. In the film this might be a particularly sadistic one but only when we step out of the lives that are pre-written for us to fulfill.</p> <p>With each film, things got sillier (although the fifth installment did end with a killer twist), but the core messaging remained the same: death is inescapable. In recent years, attempts to replicate the formula have been equally hard to avoid with low-rent copycats like Wish Upon and Truth or Dare forcing their teen casts into similarly structured yet markedly less effective death sequences and recently it was announced that the franchise that started it all would finally be getting an inevitable reboot. Details are scarce and so far <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/14/final-destination-producer-reveals-glimpse-new-movie-already-terrified-12398255/\">early word</a> suggests it will take place in the world of first responders. It\u2019s an intriguing proposition and at a time when hit-making horror house Blumhouse has ensured that its films turn a tidy profit by keeping costs under $10m, usually as little as $5m, the relatively extravagant budgets required by the Final Destinations (between $25m-$40m) means they can\u2019t afford the risk of audience lack of interest.</p> <p>But how will a new generation of teens, haunted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/04/the-queen-of-evil-dolls-why-annabelles-work-ethic-makes-her-a-great-role-model\">evil dolls</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/03/it-chapter-two-review-stephen-king-bill-skarsgard-andy-muschietti\">evil clowns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/05/a-quiet-place-review-john-krasinski-emily-blunt\">evil aliens</a> react to a film about \u2026 evil accidents? What\u2019s notable about many of the horror films that have been big hits of late \u2013 the Its, the Annabelles, the Conjurings \u2013 is the remarkably low body count which in some cases is entirely non-existent. The threat of death gently lingers in these films but in the mean-spirited, give-no-fucks world of Final Destination, it\u2019s waiting on a plane, in the kitchen, on the street, plan already in motion. In this particular franchise, death isn\u2019t coming, it\u2019s already here.</p>",

  "<p>At 42, the end is near for Tom Brady, though the quarterback insists he can still play until he\u2019s at least 45. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/tom-brady-leaves-new-england-patriots-nfl-football-new-team\">announcement</a> on Tuesday that he will leave the New England Patriots after 20 seasons and a record six Super Bowl titles gives rise to the biggest question in the NFL: where will Brady line up in 2020? (Note: this article was originally published on 8 January 2020 but has been updated to reflect Brady\u2019s decision to leave New England).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/tom-brady-leaves-new-england-patriots-nfl-football-new-team\">Tom Brady to leave New England Patriots after 20 years and six NFL titles</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Los Angeles Chargers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why he should go</strong> LA are the sexiest pick. The Chargers will be entering a new stadium in 2020 as the little sibling <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28117460/inside-rams-chargers-marriage-nfl-fights-los-angeles\">in a partnership with the Rams</a>. Grabbing Brady would give them much-needed oomph, and would steal some of the attention away from the Rams, who seem to have a vice-like grip on LA fandom.</p> <p>The Chargers have the weapons, too. They legitimately run seven deep with good skill position players, of all body shapes and sizes. They should have one of the most diverse, complete offenses in the game, and they have similar talent on defense. They are built to compete now, and play in Brady\u2019s home state. Also, those <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/blog/los-angeles-chargers/post/_/id/22131/in-fight-for-l-a-chargers-should-embrace-powder-blue-uniform\">powder blue uniforms</a>. I mean, come on. They\u2019re the best in football.</p> <p><strong>Why he shouldn\u2019t </strong>Sure, the Chargers have the weapons, but their issues in recent years have stemmed from an awful offensive line. They\u2019ve poured in resources, but due to injuries and draft/free agency misses nothing has improved.</p> <p>In the last two years, the Patriots have finished first and third in offensive pressure rate, averaging a quarterback pressure on 23% of Brady\u2019s snaps. The Chargers, by comparison, have given up pressure on 31% of snaps, putting them 28th in the league over that span. Does Brady, who turns 43 in August, want to take that level of punishment at his age?</p> <p><strong>Likelihood of deal </strong>The most likely spot at the moment</p> <h2><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why he should go</strong> Tampa have a host of weapons \u2013 Mike Evans is one of the league\u2019s best receivers \u2013 a solid if unspectacular offensive line and a proven coach, one who has thrived with aging, veteran quarterbacks.</p> <p><strong>Why he shouldn\u2019t </strong>It\u2019s an iffy fit. Bruce Arians is a vertical coach. He likes to chuck the ball downfield, run the ball, then chuck it down the field some more. That\u2019s not Brady\u2019s game.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood of deal</strong> Least likely of the frontrunners</p> <h2>Las Vegas Raiders</h2> <p><strong>Why he should go</strong> A first-time NFL city and a sparklingly new $1.8bn stadium. A name-brand coach in Jon Gruden. And there\u2019s the speculation Brady reportedly bought property in Las Vegas and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VicTafur/status/1218782602401697792\">was seen glad-handing with Raiders owner Mark Davis</a> at Conor McGregor\u2019s last fight on the Strip.</p> <p><strong>Why he shouldn\u2019t </strong>The owner is, shall we say, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/raiders-owner-mark-davis-bowl-cut-mini-van-2017-1\">eccentric</a> and the franchise\u2019s well-documented reputation for dysfunction is earned. A move to Vegas could easily veer into a sideshow with all the attention on off-field extracurriculars. And while Brady has become accustomed to a life of superstar glare out of necessity, he doesn\u2019t exactly welcome it.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood of deal</strong> A roll of the dice</p> <h2><strong>Carolina Panthers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why he should go</strong> It\u2019s hard to find a better batch of weapons, with a quarterback opening, than in Carolina. The Panthers have the players but need a healthy quarterback: Cam Newton has been unable to stay on the field in recent years, and Carolina are ready to move on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28916134/panthers-give-cam-newton-permission-seek-trade\">with a trade looking imminent</a>. Owner David Tepper is ambitious, and he will do whatever is needed to add Brady and to surround the quarterback with the talent \u2013 on and off-the-field \u2013 to compete right away. Adding Brady would give the Panthers a chance to chase a long-term fix in the draft while riding out the final two years of a legend\u2019s career, forever associating themselves with the best to ever do it. However, news broke on Tuesday that Teddy Bridgewater is close to a deal with the Panthers.</p> <p><strong>Why he shouldn\u2019t </strong>Going to a new organization is hard, even for the greatest players. This made more sense before the Panthers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/07/giants-eye-judge-as-new-head-coach-with-panthers-set-to-appoint-rhule\">hired ex-college coach Matt Rhule</a> to a mega-money deal. Had Josh McDaniels come, he and Brady could have lifted the Patriots blueprint and dropped it in Carolina. Now, Brady would be working with a first-time NFL head coach \u2013 though he may see that as a bonus: giving him complete control over the offense.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood of deal</strong> Not impossible, but looking more unlikely with Bridgewater nearing a deal with the Panthers</p>",

  "<p>It took more than two years for British diplomats to secure the extradition of Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, amid claims the UK government paid \u00a39m in \u201cbribery\u201d aid and was complicit in his torture under Boris Johnson\u2019s watch as foreign secretary.</p> <p>Abedi, now 22, the younger of the two brothers, was arrested in Libya alongside his father, Ramadan, shortly after his older brother, Salman, carried out the attack on 22 May 2017.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism officers had been granted a warrant for Abedi\u2019s arrest \u2013 so he could face mass murder charges for his role in planning the deadliest terrorist attack on UK soil since the 7/7 bombings \u2013 but it would take them years to negotiate his extradition.</p> <p>In closed court hearings, which could not be reported under UK law until the jury reached its verdict, the British government was accused of bribing Libyan authorities with a multimillion pound aid deal in return for Abedi\u2019s extradition.</p> <p>Abedi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/17/hashem-abedi-brother-of-manchester-arena-bomber-being-extradited-to-uk\">was finally extradited in July 2019</a>, almost two years after Boris Johnson \u2013 the then foreign secretary \u2013 visited Tripoli and allegedly offered a \u00a39.2mpackage to help Libya deal with the terrorist threat and tackle illegal migration.</p> <p>During <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-visits-libya--3\">the visit</a> in August 2017, Johnson\u2019s second to the country in less than six months, he met the prime minister, Fayyez Al-Serraj, the foreign minister, Mohamed Siala, and the president of Libya\u2019s high state council, Abdurrahman Swehli. The four men discussed how the UK could support Libya in combating terrorism.</p> <p>However, Abedi\u2019s barrister, Stephen Kamlish, told the Old Bailey in London that the aid money was a bribe to secure his client\u2019s extradition, and that the process had been illegal under Libyan law.</p> <p>\u201cThe British were effectively having to bribe the Libyans,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After their arrest, Abedi and his father were held by Rada Special Deterrence Force, the most powerful of Tripoli\u2019s militias, at its base at Mitiga airport alongside dozens of other terrorist suspects and fighters. With the jail being repeatedly attacked by rival militias trying to free their members, the race to extradite Abedi to the UK began.</p> <p>In October 2017, the then British ambassador to Libya, Peter Millett, handed over extradition documents to the Libyan attorney general beginning the \u201clong drawn-out process\u201d.</p> <p>One of the obstacles was that the extradition request was made under a treaty, signed during the Muammar Gaddafi era, which does not allow Libya to extradite its own nationals to the UK.</p> <p>One western source said Abedi had entered Libya on a British passport, and that Libya\u2019s justice officials had eventually decided he could be regarded as British and extradited within the terms of the treaty.</p> <p>In an account reminiscent of episodes in which British security services were implicated in serious human rights abuses in the years after 9/11, Abedi claimed he was held in solitary confinement from the moment he was arrested. Shackled and blindfolded, he was allegedly forced to sign a 40-page confession with a fingerprint under \u201cextreme duress\u201d.</p> <p>Officers from MI5 and MI6 visited him twice at the detention centre that his British lawyers described as \u201ca torture establishment\u201d.</p> <p>His claims of torture were supported by medical evidence, including photographs taken by a British consular official showing marks on his back, arms and ankles. He is also said to have been taken from the detention centre to a clinic for treatment to a groin injury.</p> <p>Kamlish said MI5 and MI6 must have known Abedi was being tortured but they continued to feed questions to his torturers on key aspects of the UK investigation.</p> <p>He said: \u201cHe was arrested the day after the bombing, and until the end of May he was asked questions about people in Manchester and addresses, none of which could have been known to his [Libyan] torturers \u2013 it would not have been possible.</p> <p>\u201cThey must have received the questions from either Operation Manteline [the name of the Manchester bombing investigation] or the security services or both. Those questions under torture went on for almost a month.\u201d</p> <p>Abedi\u2019s older brother, Ismail, who remained in the UK, had alerted the British government that his sibling and father were being tortured in Libyan custody.</p> <p>At one point, Kamlish said, British intelligence officers questioned Abedi in the presence of members of the militia that was allegedly torturing him. After Abedi signed the confession on 23 June 2017 the worst of the torture allegedly ceased, the court was told.</p> <p>Kamlish alleged the extradition in conjunction with Abedi\u2019s torture amounted to an abuse of process and called for the trial to be halted.</p> <p>The prosecuting lawyers did not deny the allegation of British complicity in Abedi\u2019s torture but went on to successfully argue that his trial should proceed regardless of his treatment in Tripoli.</p> <p>In the aftermath of 9/11, British intelligence officers were repeatedly implicated in involvement with intelligence agencies known to use torture, but these allegations were routinely denied by the government.</p> <p>However, the UK parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee <a href=\"https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/20180628%20HC1114%20Report%20Detainee%20Mistreatment%20and%20Rendition%20-%20Current%20Issues.pdf?amp%3Battredirects=0&amp;attachauth=ANoY7cpiYobn3Nn1tJRZFdWfGg107iyT_ACyDK1osKVmIuWmuHOZoZEu9WJDokchjOnSteGJgJQnphxn7qYbH-ep9Jgwnieu51J9Bi26iEaSsVOJH8CW0axeO6ypqE21Mr95G6vlnH92ETJlw8Im1O9qjuD-jIHcRRaDhuONQ7KpDGz5Ue1OLrmIbOyhlIPKRLPQdz5iqq4_hgUfsWklUzbUKk3dOOsU6PaHvqFW2WX-z79zalqon_kgOPZMP24UkrrPhbEOD88vsjQU4Modeg76r4v1Kt9xxcks4BBqmrA9wbtGCgxWY0I%3D&amp;attredirects=1\">confirmed</a> in 2018 that MI5 and MI6 officers had engaged in human rights abuses, but concluded these abuses were a historical issue.</p> <p>An apology was issued to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/10/britain-apologises-for-appalling-treatment-of-abdel-hakim-belhaj\">Libyan couple</a> for the British security services\u2019 involvement in their kidnap and rendition to Tripoli, and a second Libyan family received an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/13/libyan-dissident-mi6-aided-rendition\">out-of-court settlement</a> after bringing proceedings over MI6\u2019s involvement in their kidnap.</p> <p>Since 2017, a judge known as the investigatory powers commissioner has been responsible for reporting to the government on whether intelligence officers are following the appropriate guidance.

Some states, like Washington and Oregon, conduct their elections entirely by mail. Other states allow voters to request an absentee ballot, but set varying deadlines for when the application and ballot must be received. Several states, including those with upcoming primaries, also have longstanding restrictions on who can use a mail-in ballot, risking millions of votes in the upcoming election.</p> <p>New York, set to hold its primary in April, is among <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/3/16/1927986/-These-17-states-must-change-their-laws-to-let-voters-cast-absentee-mail-ballots-without-an-excuse\">17</a> states that require voters to give a specific excuse if they want to vote by mail.

But he said there was some \u201cwiggle room\u201d. \u201cIllness is not defined anywhere and a voter could use that to justify a lot of things,\u201d he said, adding that the requests were mostly based on the \u201chonor system\u201d.</p> <p>Several other states are in a similar position to New York. Catherine Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the Delaware department of elections, said the state accepts absentee ballots from voters who list one of six pre-approved excuses that do not include a public health crisis. Jennifer Gardner, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia secretary of state, said her office was researching whether the state\u2019s absentee restrictions could be loosened.</p> <p>With primaries fast approaching, voting advocates are pushing governors to issue emergency executive orders clarifying that anyone can cast a mail-in ballot ahead of November when the political environment will be more heated.</p> <p>Some state governments have made progress.

  "<p>A military tribunal in Beirut has ordered the release of an American citizen accused of running a southern Lebanese prison notorious for torture during Israel\u2019s occupation of the region.</p> <p>Amer Fakhoury was a member of the South Lebanon Army, a militia group that collaborated with the Israeli army during its 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon starting in 1982.</p> <p>Lebanese authorities have accused Fakhoury, 57, of running Khiam detention centre, a prison where thousands of dissidents and militants were tortured during the 1980s and 1990s, earning him the nickname \u201cthe butcher of Khiam\u201d.</p> <p>He fled to Israel shortly before its forces withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 after years of conflict with the Shia militia Hezbollah. After nine months he migrated to the US and tried to claim political asylum but was turned down. Fakhoury became a US citizen through one of his children last year.</p> <p>The court on Monday said he should be freed because the 10-year statute of limitations for his alleged offences had passed. Another charge against him, of having contact with Israel, had been dropped by the military court in 2018 as part of a wider amnesty for Lebanese who collaborated with the Jewish state during the occupation.</p> <p>Fakhoury, who has four children and owns a restaurant in the US state of New Hampshire, has not been attending interrogation sessions since he was hospitalised a few months ago with with stage 4 lymphoma.</p> <p>It was not clear if he would immediately be set free, as another case filed by former Khiam prisoners accusing him of torture is still pending.</p> <p>A US senator from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, and other officials have called for sanctions to be imposed on Lebanon to pressure Beirut to release him.</p> <p>Former Khiam prisoners have protested outside court during some of Fakhoury\u2019s appearances, including several who alleged they were tortured on his orders. \u201c[The jailers] used to whip our bodies with electrical cables until our skin got lacerated.

For those of us lucky enough to be able to go back home our thoughts pass to our exams.</p> <p>Coming from a current finalist like me, a plea for our exams to be cancelled might sound like someone looking for an easy way out. But universities are the ones that have to face up to reality in the middle of a life-changing global emergency. It\u2019s the fairest option we have left.</p> <p>Having devoted a staggering amount of the last four years to my studies, to lose out on the satisfaction of completing them properly would be beyond demoralising. The ideal scenario would have been for exams simply to be relocated to smaller centres or postponed until after the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised\">with this outbreak predicted to peak during exam season</a>, using venues of any size seems implausible, while rearranging exams for as late as the autumn would be equally unrealistic for students expecting to graduate in June.</p> <p>By frantically drawing up plans to test us remotely, universities like mine are desperate to avoid devaluing degrees that we have worked extremely hard to get through. But moving exams online would still put entire groups of students at a huge disadvantage, as well as probably distorting the results. It means that cancelling exams would be the only way of guaranteeing the integrity of our degrees without reducing their accessibility to many students and, most importantly, without harming students\u2019 mental and physical health.</p> <p>Traditional exams, for all their flaws, just about work because everyone knows what we signed up to. Students will have had some say over what share of their marks is taken from exams compared to coursework. To impose a different system on us at this late stage, under these difficult circumstances, would be to tear up any notion of a level playing field.</p> <p>Online exams rely on a false assumption that we all have a stable home with a place to study and the same access to technology. If the libraries and coffee shops all closed, many of us wouldn\u2019t have the resources or the peace and quiet we needed. </p> <p>Likewise, students with disabilities have had to fine-tune how they take exams over many years in order to hold their own within the constraints of the traditional format. They need the discretion of invigilators by their side during exams to help them with any problems that they may have on the day.</p> <p>In subjects such as law, medicine and, as in my case, foreign languages, where a relatively large number of candidates come from families or social circles with backgrounds in those areas, privileged students will surely get a helping hand. How could you prevent a would-be lawyer from asking their solicitor auntie to call in with some advice? Or who\u2019s to stop me from checking over my translations with my French friends?</p> <p>Even if there were a magic solution to each one of these logistical problems, this doesn\u2019t begin to take into account the direct impact of coronavirus.</p> <p>Universities would have to be abundantly clear about the special consideration that would be given to the very many candidates who might be ill, in isolation or have family members in hospital during the revision or exam period.</p> <p>I am especially worried for the students I know, most of them international, who have been affected by this crisis since the start of the calendar year. They have often felt torn between their lives at university and at home, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/chinese-in-uk-report-shocking-levels-of-racism-after-coronavirus-outbreak\">racist incidents and microaggressions</a> adding to their ordeal.</p> <p>What I fear will be true for us all is that it would be irrational and insensitive to imply that how students fare in these exams, faced with these pressures, would in any way be a reflection of how we would ordinarily perform. It shouldn\u2019t have to be spelled out: these are no longer ordinary circumstances. </p> <p>Examiners will do their best to be considerate in their planning and marking but, particularly after limited contact with students, they will find it impossible to allow for the full range of our experiences over the coming weeks and to judge us based on biased essay marathons run in our rooms.</p> <p>In any case, students deserve the chance to focus on looking after ourselves and our loved ones. Young people may be less susceptible to the symptoms of this virus, but we are not immune to the effects of the pandemic on our lives and our learning.</p> <ul> <li><p>Daniel Wittenberg is a languages student at the University of Cambridge</p></li> </ul>",

If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/visualisations/traveller-screening\">airport screening at arrival</a> is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/how-do-coronavirus-containment-measures-vary-across-europe\">containment</a> has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.</p> <p>So how does an epidemic spread through a population \u2013 and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as <em>R</em>), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.</p> <p>The larger the value of <em>R</em>, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404\">1.4 new infections</a>. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/current-patterns-transmission/global-time-varying-transmission.html\">early stages of an outbreak</a>. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.</p> <p>In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce <em>R</em> below 1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/05/measles-vaccinations-social-responsibility\">For diseases such as measles</a>, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on <em>R</em>. For <em>R</em> of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for <em>R</em> of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get <em>R</em> below 1.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8e202231034f27dbd07269af48a6660cdb0e40c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8e202231034f27dbd07269af48a6660cdb0e40c/0_149_5304_3182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Covid-19 test kit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In order for tests to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">effective vaccine for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">Covid-19</a> is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.</p> <p>Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.</p> <p>Another option to reduce the duration of infection is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-government-vows-accelerate-testing\">continued testing</a>; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).</p> <p>If we can\u2019t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants\">with hot water and soap</a>, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick \u2013 all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"724796f560a194c5e166fa78bae58c05351b83e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/724796f560a194c5e166fa78bae58c05351b83e4/0_214_5448_3269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nearly empty tube carriage during rush hour in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population.\u2019 A nearly empty tube carriage during rush hour in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">Cancelling large gatherings</a>, working from home and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/shutting-schools-would-reduce-coronavirus-transmission-expert\">school closures</a> are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.</p> <p>But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called <a href=\"https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/features/cambridge-perspectives-julia-gog-and-bbc-pandemic-project\">BBC Pandemic</a>, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.</p> <p>What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 \u2013 who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-covid-19-q-and-a-protect-ourselves-vaccine\">particularly at risk</a> from severe Covid-19 illness \u2013 make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/new-data-uk-government-coronavirus-pandemic-measures\">Stark new data made the UK government's U-turn on coronavirus inevitable | Jennifer Rohn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number <em>R</em>, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.</p> <p>We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it.

During that time, she learned several lessons applicable to anyone living with roommates.</p> <p>\u201cTalking about a potential conflict early on prevents things from getting worse,\u201d says Barnard. \u201cOur strategies in the habitat were to be open about our feelings and avoid blame. It can help to carve out private places in the same home so that you can decompress alone if you need to,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Barnard and her team ate dinner together every evening, using that time to set aside any issues and work on their relationships with each other. \u201cI think having a positive attitude and looking at your situation as a temporary opportunity instead of a setback can help keep you moving forward,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>What if it\u2019s just me and the kids?</h2> <p>According to Joshua David Stein, editor-at-large of the parenting publication Fatherly, if you\u2019re practicing social distancing with your kids, now is the time to readjust your rule structure.</p> <p>\u201cJust like how when you take kids on a plane they can watch as much TV as they want \u2013 it\u2019s kind of the same, at least for now,\u201d he says.

Like, \u2018Grandma is doing fine, for her safety and our safety, we\u2019re going to rely on FaceTime for now.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s also to be expected that your patience will wear thin at times. \u201cYou\u2019re going to freak out at your kids a little bit,\u201d says Stein. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best thing in the world but it\u2019s not the end of the world, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it, try to do better next time.\u201d</p> <h2>What if I\u2019m suddenly spending a lot more time with my live-in partner?</h2> <p>\u201cThis is a situation where you kind of know what is going to happen so you have time to come up with a gameplan,\u201d says Erin Davidson, a couples and sex therapist. \u201cChat about what to do in moments where things are stressful \u2013 normalize that it\u2019s OK if you get on each other\u2019s nerves, and decide on a signal that means \u2018OK, we need to take a moment in separate rooms, or recognize better communication is needed, or perhaps someone needs a hug or to talk about emotions that are coming up.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Davidson says both partners should get comfortable asking for \u2013 and giving each other \u2013 space. While it may be a tricky time to date, low-risk, symptom-free partners living in relative isolation together can certainly use this time to have more sex. \u201cThere\u2019s a website called MojoUpgrade.com and it\u2019s fun because both of you fill out \u2018yes-no-maybe\u2019 questions about sexual things you want to try individually, and then it only emails you with the things you both matched up with a \u2018yes\u2019 on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a low-pressure fun thing you can do.\u201d</p> <h2>What if I\u2019m alone?</h2> <p>For the last three years, writer and musician Kristal Jax has been making ironic, Barbie-heavy memes about coping with mental illness, trauma and social issues, which she posts to her Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dyingbutfine/?hl=en\">@Dyingbutfine</a>.

  "<p>Just after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-prompts-more-cultural-institutions-to-shut-doors\">many UK theatres announced indefinite closures on Monday night</a>, Paul Hart, the Watermill\u2019s artistic director, took to the stage to confirm that The Wicker Husband would go ahead as planned. The show-must-go-on moment carried the poignancy and weight of the impending interregnum of darkness.</p> <p>A folk musical based on a short story by Ursula Wills-Jones but with a feistier ending, The Wicker Husband follows a lonely fisherwoman, derisively named Ugly Girl by villagers and ostracised for being a misfit. She makes friends with a basket-weaver who, like a rustic Dr Frankenstein, has the power to weave beings into creation. He weaves her a wicker husband and this union sparks sexual jealousies and tribal antipathies among the townsfolk.</p> <p>As a story about insider parochialism, the demonising of outsiders and the tyranny of conformity in village life, it bears echoes of Brexit Britain. But the musical \u2013 which has a book by Rhys Jennings \u2013 steers away from outright parallels on the whole. It is located in a world of yokel archetypes (characters are simply named Tailor, Cobbler, Old Basketmaker, etc), and has all the fabular edges of a children\u2019s folk tale. \u201cOnce upon a withy on the edge of a deep dark swamp,\u201d the cast sings.</p> <p>The only open reference to today comes towards the end when the town\u2019s evil plan against Ugly Girl (Laura Johnson) is foiled. \u201cYou said we\u2019d take back control,\u201d says the Cobbler to the Tailor\u2019s Wife.</p> <p>There are magical moments in The Wicker Husband yet weaknesses, too: characterisation is so flat that the villagers are dastardly to the point of cartoonishness. There are affecting lyrics but some of the \u201cdiddly-di\u201d ditties lack depth, though the Cobbler\u2019s Wife (Angela Caesar) lifts her lines with her bawdy, no-nonsense deliveries.</p> <p>What brings Charlotte Westenra\u2019s production flaring to life is Darren Clark\u2019s balladic music, strong singing voices and lively musicianship (guitars, violins, a whistle, and live sound effects). Johnson as Ugly Girl brings emotional drama to her songs, from the romantic yearning in My Wicker Man to Have You Seen My Husband when catastrophe strikes her wicker lover.</p> <p>Other cast members do the same: Julian Forsyth as the Old Basketmaker has an unfortunate comic resemblance to Worzel Gummidge but he sings with plaintive power; and the otherwise conniving Tailor\u2019s Wife (Zo\u00eb Rainey) wrings sadness from a song about the loss of her baby.</p> <p>It is a bold move to cast a puppet in a lead part and the handsome, six-foot \u201cwicker husband\u201d puppet designed by Finn Caldwell is a beguiling presence, with flowers growing from his weave and a childlike gaucheness combined with romantic devotion to Ugly Girl. (Puppeteers Yazdan Qafouri, Eilon Morris and Scarlet Wilderink manipulate him and speak his lines.)</p> <p>There is a charming menagerie of animals, too, including scuttling mice, a skylark and a tail-wagging dog, all made of wicker. It is these puppets that steal the show.</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Most pharmacies keep at least a month or two of drugs on hand, and the wholesalers who supply them have another month or two in stock, multiple experts said. Companies that produce completed medications also keep extra ingredients to ensure they can make their products. After that, the forecast is less clear.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe vulnerability of supply for drugs that people take every day is an issue,\u201d said Rena Conti, a health economist at Boston University. \u201cAnd as China, Korea, Japan and Italy reduce exports of products, either because of facility problems in manufacturing or of staffing their facilities, or for their own national security purposes \u2026 we should expect there to be potential supply shortfalls, which might lead to shortages.</p> \n<p>But, she emphasized: \u201cYou can have a supply shortfall that doesn\u2019t ultimately lead to a shortage.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the US does have a strategic stockpile of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, it contains things like respirators and antibiotics, not blood pressure medications or birth control pills.</p> \n<p>One drug company, Merck, said it was not aware of any significant near-term impacts on the availability of its medicines and vaccines.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have also assessed potential longer-term impacts,\u201d said spokesman Patrick Ryan. \u201cThe situation is fluid, but at this point we do not anticipate impacts to our supply chain unless disruption due to the Covid-19 outbreak is sustained over the next several months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ryan added that for clinical trials, which are often the last option for critically ill people to seeking treatment, \u201cthe situation is evolving\u201d, but the effects have been minor and manageable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/us-states-improvise-coronavirus-trump-federal-leadership-absent\">US states improvise rules to combat coronavirus in absence of federal leadership</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cAt this point, we do not believe that any of our global studies are at risk,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert and senior pharmacy director at the University of Chicago, said the situation is \u201chighlighting how fragile our direct supply chain can be\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US has long faced drug shortages, but mostly in hospitals, where doctors cannot always find drugs in their preferred dosage or have to use substitutes that serve the same purpose, she said. That is time-consuming and difficult.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the main concern is are we going to pile on a whole bunch of new shortages on top of what we already have,\u201d Fox said.</p> \n<p>Drug experts say the FDA has far too little information about the percentage of drugs in use in the US that are reliant on facilities abroad.</p> \n<p>Medicines are manufactured in three steps. First, raw biochemical ingredients are made and turned into \u2018intermediaries\u2019. Second, the intermediaries are then turned into an active form that is not readily consumable by patients. Last, those active ingredients are converted into consumable forms. Each step can happen in a different country.</p> \n<p>US regulators know what facilities are licensed to produce medications, but they do not know how much of a given ingredient or drug they are making in a particular month.</p> \n<p>The US has only about 14% of the sites that turn ingredients into their active forms, and India and China have nearly half, according to a study on generic drugs \u2013 which are the vast majority of what Americans take \u2013 that Conti and other researchers presented to the FDA earlier this month.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only way that we know where specific products are made is to go and ask the companies themselves who are making them,\u201d Conti said. \u201cHistorically, pharmaceutical companies have viewed the location of manufacturing of their individual products as being a trade secret and the FDA has generally agreed with them.\u201d</p> \n<p>US lawmakers have for years been aware of the regulatory system\u2019s knowledge gaps about drug supplies.

In these cases evidence beyond the word of the victim or defendant is seen as central to building a strong case. Digital evidence requested from complainants, such as data, location information and texts from phones, is time-consuming to investigate. In 2018, more than half of all rape cases took more than 100 days to assign an outcome.</p>\n    <p>A charge or summons is one of the steps in proceeding to a trial.

It was the right thing to do, and it was entirely necessary to challenge our justice system institutions when they are failing to keep women safe and deliver access to justice.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have been approached by so many women who have been let down by the CPS as we prepared this case. We know there are really serious problems. But instead of working with us, the CPS chose to fight us.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is a long way from the kind of leadership we need in our public institutions \u2026 The CPS is arguably failing to keep with the times on expectations for justice after sexual violence. The situation as it is cannot hold, it amounts to the effective decriminalisation of rape.\u201d</p> \n<p>The charity received hundreds of donations, many for \u00a310 and \u00a320, via a <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/justice-after-rape/\">crowd justice campaign</a> ahead of the hearing. Many messages left with the donations were from women who said they had been raped but denied justice. One donor wrote: \u201cHaving been through the system myself and being failed on every level I so wish you every success.\u201d Under the anonymous donation of \u00a310, someone simply wrote: \u201cI never got justice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The legal challenge also received \u00a310,000<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/mar/14/jill-saward-ealing-family-donate-cps-legal-claim\"> from the family of Jill Saward</a>, the Ealing rape victim who became a leading figure in the fight against sexual violence.</p> \n<p>Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, who supported the claim, said: \u201cWe are deeply, deeply disappointed that [the judges] didn\u2019t see there was a basis on which the case arguable.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe feel they were just not prepared to grapple with all the detail and ultimately they saw it as a factual dispute.

  "<p>Growing up in England, people would always ask me if I was Chinese or Japanese,\u201d says Bora Kwon. \u201cThey\u2019d never heard of South Korea \u2013 well, not until the Seoul Olympics [in 1988].\u201d Now, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar\" title=\"\">Oscar-winning film Parasite</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/15/cowell-pop-k-pop\" title=\"\">K-pop (Korean pop music)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/19/taste-test-kimchi-kefir-kombucha-fermented-food\" title=\"\">kimchi</a>, the UK\u2019s first British-Korean councillor no longer has to explain about her country of birth. Instead she says she is enjoying <em>Hallyu</em> \u2013 the Korean cultural wave \u2013 that has swept Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/local-london-mayoral-elections-postponed-year-coronavirus-uk\">Local elections and London mayoral race postponed for a year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kwon, 40, arrived in the UK in 1982 at the age of three, when her father, a middle manager for a high end Korean fashion retailer, was posted here. Her parents didn\u2019t plan to stay long, but like other Koreans working for companies such as Samsung or Hyundai, once her younger brother was born and the children were in school, they changed their minds. The family moved to New Malden, a corner of south west London now commonly known as Korea Town, thanks to a large proportion of the UK\u2019s small Korean community \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">numbering </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">45,000</a> \u2013 settling there.</p> <p>It was a comfortable childhood, but her mother\u2019s poor English meant Kwon had to deal with things like council tax and doctors. Teenage magazines, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/18/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-bookclub\" title=\"\">Sue Townsend books</a> and Mr and Mrs Robertson, who coached her in extra maths and English, helped her to integrate into British society, and as a teenager she rebelled against Korean culture. \u201cThere were certain expectations I rejected,\u201d Kwon explains, from attending Korean Catholic church, to getting married and dressing a certain way. She now lives in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, works in the media and has a diverse range of friends across the capital and in Korea. Yet ask her today if she feels more British or Korean, and she says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t split the two. It would be like chopping off a hand.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago Kwon decided to run as a local councillor, having coming late to politics. She joined the Labour party in 2014, and the following year became an active member of her local branch in Hammersmith and Fulham, where she had lived for six years.</p> <p>She says it took her so long to get into politics partly because she couldn\u2019t vote until her mid 20s, when she became a British citizen. Until 2010, she didn\u2019t feel she needed to do anything as she thought that the right people where in charge. Then, she says, things changed. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m finally grown up, I pay my taxes and I\u2019m very upset about austerity\u2019 (although it didn\u2019t really affect me). I was also worried about the local Charing Cross hospital, which was threatened with being closed or downgraded. I knew a Labour leadership election was coming up and I didn\u2019t think they had the right leader at the time.\u201d She backed Liz Kendall in the leadership contest that saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn sweep to victory</a>.</p> <p>Locally, the Labour party was very welcoming, she adds. \u201cThey had just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/jun/01/hammersmith-and-fulham-tories-reveal-true-colours-as-labour-prepares-to-take-their-place\" title=\"\">won back control of Hammersmith and Fulham</a>, which had been David Cameron\u2019s flagship Tory council, so there was lots of enthusiam and hope.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b594535c87ef91c51732a4d16a1ecda6c414c4e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b594535c87ef91c51732a4d16a1ecda6c414c4e1/0_167_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Keir Starmer is the leader the Labour party needs at the moment.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kwon threw herself into campaigning for the local hospital and against a third runway at Heathrow and when the party was looking for new ward councillors she put herself forward, although she assumed someone as new to politics as herself didn\u2019t stand a chance. \u201cTurns out they liked the fact I was an active member of the party, Korean and a woman,\u201d she says. She was selected for her own Ravenscourt Park ward to stand in the 2018 local elections. The ward had been Conservative for 12 years, but <a href=\"https://www.andyslaughter.co.uk/blog/2019/10/21/hammersmith-brexit-survey-results-and-johnsons-deal/\" title=\"\">had voted 80% remain</a><a href=\"https://www.andyslaughter.co.uk/blog/2019/10/21/hammersmith-brexit-survey-results-and-johnsons-deal/\" title=\"\"> in the 2016 EU referendum,</a> so was a target for both Labour and the Lib Dems.</p> <p>\u201cI took my mother to the count in the town hall. We heard at 2am that we\u2019d won. It was very dramatic. All three Labour candidates were elected. I cried when the results were read out,\u201d she recalls. Kwon holds the title of the first British Korean councillor by 12 hours; shortly after her victory, Jaesung Ha was elected as a Lib Dem councillor in New Malden.</p> <p>Kwon says it never occurred to her to stand in the ward where she\u2019d grown up with a predominantly Korean population. But a letter she received from a Korean women living in another borough who was having problems with her benefits made Kwon aware that she is a Korean councillor as well as a Ravenscourt Park one. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help her because I\u2019m not her councillor, so I passed it on to her local Labour MP. But if there are things I can do to help the Korean community, I will. I\u2019m afraid that many older Koreans don\u2019t ask for help. It\u2019s an ageing population, but most don\u2019t want to make a fuss and will try and sort out issues within the community,\u201d she says. </p> <p>The last few weeks have been difficult for those with friends and family in Korea with the spread of the coronavirus. Kwon\u2019s brother, who lives there and presents a daily radio show, has had to postpone his wedding, but no one she knows in the country \u2013 which has been testing 20,000 people a day \u2013 has tested positive. It now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/european-countries-take-radical-steps-to-combat-coronavirus\" title=\"\">more recoveries than new infections</a>.</p> <p>Are there any lessons for the UK? \u201cThe Korean response is best summed up as \u2018panic and act fast\u2019. Korea took the virus incredibly seriously from the start. The country is very agile and dynamic in the way that it responds to events. The British government looks slow in comparison, but I\u2019m not an expert,\u201d she replies.</p> <p>Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago, Kwon has an interest in lifestyle and health and sits on the council\u2019s health and social care committee. She has enrolled on a pilot for a year-long weight loss and diet restriction programme, and hopes to be medication-free by the end of it. As editor-in-chief of a news aggregation app, she is also concerned about value for money of digital technology and the NHSShe also <a href=\"http://democracy.lbhf.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1818\" title=\"\">chairs the </a><a href=\"http://democracy.lbhf.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1818\" title=\"\">community safety and environment policy and accountability committee</a>, which scrutinises and forms policy at public meetings on issues dear to her heart, such as green spaces and transport.</p> <p>She is backing Keir Starmer in the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/09/labour-leader-tories-brexit-eu-britain\" title=\"\">Labour leadership campaign</a>. \u201cHe is the leader the party needs at the moment. I want us to be a really good opposition. I don\u2019t want any legislation to go without forensic scrutiny.\u201d Asked if she hopes to be a cabinet member, or an MP one day, she replies: \u201cI don\u2019t have a grand master plan. I\u2019d like to get re-elected as a councillor in 2022 and then see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>As for a Korean role model \u2013 maybe a Parasite actor or a K-pop star? \u201cI\u2019ve been mistaken for the US-Korean comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/29/margaret-cho-review-comedy-box-bristol\" title=\"\">Margaret Cho</a>, but it has to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/14/ban-ki-moon-united-nations-world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul\" title=\"\">Ban Ki-moon</a>, the former UN secretary general.

  "<p>With the coronavirus crisis hammering the aviation industry, it is going to do all it can get to get back on its feet when the emergency is finally over.</p> <p>One modest proposal snaking its way through the UK government\u2019s legislative agenda is to revive the art of skywriting \u2013 in which planes pen messages in the air with smoke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0646ce62-b01e-423b-bce4-7b5febf1f0d5\"         data-atom-type=\"guide\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>While not an unusual sight elsewhere in the world, skywriting and skytyping \u2013 where planes flying abreast and puff smoke at intervals to form letters like a dot-matrix printer \u2013 have been banned in the UK for six decades.</p> <p>Cautious officials of the era halted the practice out of safety concerns, and also as a pre-emptive response to the possibility that it could be used to spread communist propaganda at the height of the cold war. Officials believe such concerns are no longer valid.</p> <p>The proposals have so far reached the consultation stage, with the Department for Transport inviting responses from the public.</p> <p>\u201cShould skytyping and skywriting become lawful, there is a potential commercial benefit to enable such services to be provided in the UK given its large population and significant aviation and advertising markets,\u201d the DfT\u2019s consultation document says.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough these activities are currently banned in the UK, we already boast some of the world\u2019s best skytyping pilots, who currently perform abroad, mainly in the EU and China, but would be ready to deliver services in the UK once the law is changed.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cSkytyping and skywriting could also add entertainment and display value to various spectacles. Skytyping is likely to take place at mass outdoor events such as music festivals and sporting fixtures.</p> <p>\u201cSkywriting is expected to generate activity in the form of enhancement to existing air displays and private individuals could use it for personal messages, such as marriage proposals or birthday celebrations.</p> <p>\u201cSkywriting and skytyping could also be used as part of public events, such as for marking royal birthdays, military commemorations or national memorial days.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the government\u2019s enthusiasm, Alan Elliott, 71, the owner of Blackpool, Lancashire-based aerial banner towing business Air Ads, was sceptical about the chances of an airwriting industry taking off in the UK. \u201cI think they will struggle to find anyone to do it, because of the weather conditions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTo do skywriting you really have to have a beautiful calm day - and we don\u2019t get too many of those - otherwise it blows away. There won\u2019t be too many people rushing to equip their aircraft to do it, and no doubt the Civil Aviation Authority will want another rating on their pilot\u2019s licence.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott, 71, said under the current licensing regime he was not even able to train other pilots to tow banners, as the CAA said it did not have the ability to approve his training. He is one of only two pilots left in the country who is able to tow banners, and only has official approval because he\u2019s been doing it for so long that he has grandfather rights acquired before the new licensing regime was imposed.</p> <p>Another problem was the cost. While Elliott said his business charged from \u00a3500 to tow a banner, skywriting would cost in the thousands at least - for a message that would blow away in minutes.</p> <p>A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cGeneral aviation is an incubator for the aviation workforce of tomorrow, a vital industry which employs 230,000 people and adds \u00a322bn to the UK economy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we do all we can to promote and strengthen the sector and enabling skywriting and skytyping will encourage innovation, provide jobs and create businesses.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A United Nations agency has voiced alarm after a migrant boat stranded in Maltese waters carrying 49 people was returned to Libya, where hundreds have gone missing since the start of the year.</p> <p>The International Organization for Migration said it was \u201calarmed by this apparent breach of international law\u201d, after the wooden boat was sent back to Libya on Sunday.

Libyan authorities have failed to respond to requests for information about what happened to these people, the IOM said.</p> <p>\u201cThe worry for the safety of these people is obviously there, because we don\u2019t know their fate and they could have been smuggled,\u201d Msehli has said.</p> <p>Last year, the UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/italy-police-arrest-three-over-and-torture-of-migrants-in-libya\">raised concerns </a>that migrants rescued at sea and returned to an unofficial detention centre in Khums were being sold by Libyan police to smugglers and traffickers, or simply disappearing.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency estimates that Libya hosts more than 43,000 refugees and asylum seekers, in addition to 217,000 people displaced by conflict. An estimated nine in 10 people attempting to reach Europe by sea start their journey in Libya.</p> <p>Since the start of the year more than 2,700 people have reached Italy, while nearly 1,000 have arrived in Malta, the EU\u2019s smallest member state.</p> <p>The UN has been urging the EU for months to set up a scheme that allows people rescued at sea to disembark safely in Europe and apply for asylum \u2013 something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-leaders-summit-migration-doubts\">EU leaders promised in June 2018</a>.</p> <p>But the plan has been stymied by a general lack of political will and anti-migrant politicians, such as Matteo Salvini, who turned away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/17/salvini-crossed-red-line-in-pushing-refugee-boat-policy-says-military\">boats </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/17/salvini-crossed-red-line-in-pushing-refugee-boat-policy-says-military\"> from Italy while he was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/17/salvini-crossed-red-line-in-pushing-refugee-boat-policy-says-military\">the country\u2019s deputy prime minister</a>.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Malta\u2019s interior ministry said international law had been observed at all times. \u201cIn fact, contrary to the claims being made, Malta rescued 112 irregular migrants during the same period that is being referred to,\u201d a point made in the IOM\u2019s original statement.</p> <p>The spokesperson added: \u201cThe Maltese authorities remain committed to reducing the loss of lives at sea.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>What is it about animals? As the bad news about the coronavirus continues, \u201csend me dogs and cats\u201d has become a regular cry on social media, an easy-to-grasp shorthand for \u201cI feel terrible, cheer me up\u201d. The response is always the same: a torrent of pictures of animals doing daft things \u2013 but somehow it has a magical, calming effect.</p> <p>The therapeutic value of our relationship with our pets, particularly dogs, is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1289326/\">increasingly recognised</a> by researchers. Cats can be wonderful too \u2013 but dogs have been domesticated by humans for much longer, and, as even the most devoted cat lover will admit, dogs are far easier to train for companionship. Most cats, as we know, are admirable for entirely different reasons. <a href=\"https://www.starwards.org.uk/animal-magic/\">Marion Janner,</a> a mental health campaigner and all-round animal lover, says that dogs teach us a whole range of lessons. \u201cDogs love us unconditionally. They\u2019re the ultimate in equal opportunities \u2013 entirely indifferent to race, gender, star sign, CV, clothes size or ability to throw cool moves on the dance floor. The simplicity and depth of this love is a continuous joy, along with the health benefits of daily walks and the social delights of chats with other dog walkers. They teach kids to be responsible, altruistic and compassionate and, valuably but sadly, how to cope when someone you love dies.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Doward* felt this odd effect when his health suddenly took a downward turn. \u201cI\u2019d been working incredibly hard, long hours, too many days. One day I started crying and just couldn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t put sentences together properly. I\u2019d been pushing everything so hard for so long, and I just couldn\u2019t do it any more.\u201d</p> <p>It took a long time to put himself back together: plus some therapy, another job and changes to his family life. But the key factor, he says only half-jokingly, was a small Greek rescue dog called Maria. \u201cTaking her out for walks, getting out into fresh air, just putting one foot in front of the other, that lifts your spirits. And then there\u2019s nothing like having a dog curled up beside you, even when you feel absolutely miserable. She\u2019ll check my face anxiously, as if she knows something is wrong. And that makes me smile \u2013 and that somehow makes you feel better. There is just something magic about dogs. Honestly, she got me through.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48287837cb4e2af2b4eac5ee4e7a6de7dcc1a6bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48287837cb4e2af2b4eac5ee4e7a6de7dcc1a6bc/0_0_3500_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rayssa plays with Troia, a therapeutically trained dog\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patient Rayssa plays with Troia, a therapeutically trained dog, during a therapy session in Hospital Infantil Sabar\u00e1 in S\u0101o Paulo, Brazil. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But why? What is responsible for these therapeutic effects? One key aspect appears to be social recognition \u2013 the process of identifying another being as someone important and significant to you. The bond that forms between owner and pet is, it seems, similar to the bond that a mother forms with her baby.</p> <p>The importance of <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2014.00171/full\">social recognition</a> is increasingly acknowledged for the role it plays in helping us form networks. We now understand that healthy social bonds can play a key role in mental health; without them, we become lonely, depressed and physically unwell. And pets, it seems, can fulfil that role. Academic and psychologist <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sam_Ahmedzai/publication/7461293_Pet_Ownership_and_Human_Health_A_Brief_Review_of_Evidence_and_Issues/links/0deec51daa6f3c9196000000.pdf\">June McNicholas</a> points out that pets can be a lifeline for socially isolated people.</p> <p>\u201cPet care and self-care are linked. When you take a dog out for a walk, people talk to you and that may be the only social contact an isolated person has the whole day. If you have a cat, you can have a conversation standing in the cat food aisle in the supermarket, deciding which brand to buy. When pet owners leave the house to buy pet food, they\u2019re more likely to buy food for themselves and when they feed their pet, they\u2019ll sit down to eat too. People with disabilities often find that able-bodied people are socially awkward with them; if they have a dog it breaks down barriers and allows a more comfortable and natural interaction.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"920eed434fd5a748c2a642d0b4f96a4db32d001f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/920eed434fd5a748c2a642d0b4f96a4db32d001f/0_0_4166_2773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman caresses a therapy dog in Markhot Ferenc hospital, Hungary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman caresses a therapy dog in Markhot Ferenc hospital, Hungary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e9ter Komka/EPA-EFE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Social recognition is something humans share with a few (though not all) mammals, including sheep and prairie voles. We are primed to look after those we have made social bonds with; we don\u2019t breastfeed just any old baby and we don\u2019t take random dogs home from the park. <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Made_for_Each_Other.html?id=skS2zZTvTOUC&amp;redir_esc=y\">Author</a> and <a href=\"https://warriorcanineconnection.org/\">researcher</a> Meg Daley Olmert explains \u201cWhen we call our dog, \u2018our baby\u2019 it is because we recognise it on a neural level as such. And this recognition triggers the same maternal bonding brain networks that allow a mother to look at her red, slimy newborn and say, \u2018mine!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A small <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107205\">study</a> of functional MRI brain scans in 18 women showed similar responses in regions involved in reward, emotion and affiliation when the women looked at images of their child and pet dog.There were important differences though; dogs caused activity in the fusiform gyrus (involved in facial recognition) and babies in the tegmentum (centres of reward and affiliation). We love our pets, but in a fire we\u2019re primed to save the baby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24e52c9a3a6f35248221806845f20d39090f23d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24e52c9a3a6f35248221806845f20d39090f23d8/0_0_2443_1571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child pets a utility dog in Bucharest, Romania\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child pets a utility dog at a facility for children affected by Down\u2019s syndrome in Bucharest, Romania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vadim Ghird\u0103/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although scientists have some understanding of social recognition and where it takes place in the brain, we still don\u2019t entirely understand how it happens. The missing link could be oxytocin, the so-called \u201chug\u201d, \u201clove\u201d or \u201ccuddle\u201d hormone. Oxytocin has a key role in both childbirth, lactation and sperm movement, but it also has an increasingly recognised role in our social behaviour, acting as a chemical messenger in pathways that control sexual arousal, recognition, trust, mother-infant and human-pet bonding.</p> <p>Oxytocin works in tandem with another brain hormone, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00335/full\">vasopressin</a>, to help to modulate our response to stress and deal with social situations. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a lot of interest in a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120070/\">possible role</a> for oxytocin in addiction, brain injury, anorexia, depression, autism and severe anxiety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/21/lessons-in-happiness-how-a-short-course-can-boost-your-wellbeing\">Lessons in happiness: how a short course can boost your wellbeing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And there are other reasons that pets and therapy animals are increasingly recognised as being good for our mental health. In addition to helping to alleviate stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness, there are all the benefits that come from having to exercise a dog. Daily walks outdoors boost physical and emotional wellbeing. Chucking sticks, picking up balls \u2013 even scooping up dog poo \u2013 can provide an all-round workout.</p> <p>Increasingly that knowledge is being turned to practical use, with some lovely effects. When the Centre for Mental Health ran an <a href=\"https://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-12/CentreforMentalHealth_Restoring_something_lost.pdf\">evaluation on therapy dogs in</a><a href=\"https://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-12/CentreforMentalHealth_Restoring_something_lost.pdf\"> prisons</a>, for example, the feedback was off the scale. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but even when I am running around with [the dog] I just feel better inside, calmer, more peaceful,\u201d said one prisoner. Another told the interviewer: \u201cDogs have a magic effect on you, you can feel their love and that just makes you feel better inside you.\u201d</p> <p>The good feelings persist even after the dogs have left, the reviewers found, with one subject saying: \u201cI just walk around for the rest of the day on cloud nine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da746a58e8020203f7e8d7dbf468b3789211032b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da746a58e8020203f7e8d7dbf468b3789211032b/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Retirement home residents in Aliso Viejo, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Retirement home residents in Aliso Viejo, California, play with therapy dogs brought by female volunteers.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marmaduke St John/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the UK\u2019s most dangerous and violent mental health patients are cared for in one of four high-security psychiatric hospitals. Most are diagnosed with schizophrenia and stay an average of seven years. The State hospital in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of these facilities and runs an <a href=\"https://www.tsh.scot.nhs.uk/Person%20Centred/Docs/Animals%20as%20Therapy%20booklet%20-%20Aug%2007.pdf\"> animal </a><a href=\"https://www.tsh.scot.nhs.uk/Person%20Centred/Docs/Animals%20as%20Therapy%20booklet%20-%20Aug%2007.pdf\"> therapy centre</a> which gives patients the chance to pet and care for a range of animals including chipmunks, rabbits, hens, geese, pygmy goats and pigs.</p> <p>Staff say that animal therapy helps to develop problem-solving skills, empathy, attention to the needs of others, a sense of responsibility and a way of channelling aggressive thoughts among individuals who have proved hard to reach with conventional psychiatric drugs and talking therapies.</p> <p> But what if you don\u2019t have a pet? Is there any shortcut to reproducing the beneficial effects? One candidate is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23007624\">sildenafil </a>(Viagra). Having sex causes an oxytocin surge in the brain and taking Viagra may reproduce that surge without the faff of mating. A more practical idea might be an oxytocin spray or tablet. </p> <p>But biologist <a href=\"https://kinseyinstitute.org/about/profiles/cscarter.php\">Sue Carter</a> says that translating naturally occurring oxytocin into a commercially available product is challenging.

  "<p>Film director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-schrader\">Paul Schrader</a> has castigated the producers of his current film after the shoot was shut down after one of the actors was diagnosed with coronavirus.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paul.schrader.900/posts/10219264706081711\">a brief post on Facebook</a>, Schrader said his producers had stopped the production five days before it was due to finish \u201cbecause an LA day player had the coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMyself, I would have shot through hellfire rain to complete the film.

There is no evidence whatsoever that somehow the political changes nearly two generations later, in 1989, had any effect upon that legal reality as it existed in and after 1949.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The judges summarised the petitioner\u2019s argument as a claim that Frydenberg had a \u201cshell\u201d citizenship passed to him at birth \u201ccapable of revivification into full Hungarian citizenship by the political transformation of Hungary with the end of Communist rule\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Nice try, they said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we may say so, the argument as to the revivification of a \u201cshell\u201d of citizenship is an imaginative one, displaying a creative fineness of distinction, which may be, or may have been, seen as appropriate in some legal contexts. Such an approach is inappropriate here.

Even if Covid-19 just went on its irksome way as a granny-killing hyperflu, we\u2019d have to take extreme measures. Each scenario is possible, and the evidence suggests a couple of them are likely.

The German MEP with Scottish roots even puts milk in his tea and says he would rather have a slice of British white bread than traditional German <em>schwarzbrot.</em></p> \n<p>Appointed the chair of the European parliament\u2019s EU-UK coordination committee in January, McAllister will steer 705 MEPs through the upcoming talks on the future relationship. EU and UK negotiators are examining whether they can talk via video link, after face-to-face meetings in London due to start on Wednesday were abandoned because of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The Brexit job comes after a meteoric rise in German politics, when he became the youngest leader of a German region, as minister-president of Lower Saxony from 2010 to 2013. Long seen as a favourite of Angela Merkel, McAllister was elected to the European parliament in 2014, where he soon landed one of the biggest MEP jobs: chair of the foreign affairs committee.</p> \n<p>The role, which he retains, involves having to deal with one of the EU\u2019s most tricky foreign policy problems: reconstructing relations with a former member state after a painful, three-and-half year divorce.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/12/uk-and-eu-agree-to-dial-down-rhetoric-in-brexit-talks\">UK and EU agree to 'dial down rhetoric' in Brexit talks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cBrexit is a very sad event and I will always be of the opinion that the UK is in a better position as a member state of the European Union, but I am not sad to do this job,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want us to have the best possible relationship with the UK, and the European parliament will play an important role in shaping our future relations.

The MEP, who got married in a kilt and enjoys drinking sugar-free Irn-Bru, would only say that Scottish independence was \u201can inner British issue\u201d for Edinburgh and London.</p> \n<p>He also advises the 447 million-consumer trading bloc to tread carefully when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/13/brexit-eu-demands-uk-negotiations-draft-treaty\">negotiating</a> with its smaller neighbour: \u201cThe EU always is well-advised to treat negotiating partners with respect no matter which size they are.\u201d</p> \n<p>He rejects simple labels for the deal, whether Canada-plus or EU- , saying the future agreement will be unprecedented in its depth and breadth. \u201cWhat we need is a unique agreement with the UK, but there is no country which will match 100% the demands of the British. So what we are going for is a cooperation agreement, which will of course have an important part on trade, but it\u2019s more than trade. There are many other issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last month, the European parliament endorsed a resolution, drafted by his committee, calling on EU negotiators to keep the UK in line with the bloc\u2019s standards on environment, workers\u2019 rights and industrial state subsidies, in exchange for maintaining free trade in goods. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/key-mep-group-to-demand-level-playing-field-with-uk-in-return-for-free-trade\">The MEPs approved the maximalist position of \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d</a>, meaning the UK would have to match the EU\u2019s rising standards in these areas. However, other parts of the text suggested the parliament could accept a less demanding agreement not to retreat from existing standards (non-regression). The ambiguity is a sign of a compromise text stitched together to meet the expectations of MEPs spanning conservative right to radical left.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"532df0a3-11ca-4d4e-8f76-d04fd6d181ce\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1961)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brefusal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1973)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brentry</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With Sir Edward Heath having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/the-highs-and-lows-of-britains-47-years-in-the-eec-and-eu\">signed the accession treaty</a> the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1975)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Referendum</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\".

In 1989, he did two years\u2019 national military service in a tank battalion, when he also learned to drive a lorry while training in the Canadian prairies of Manitoba.</p> \n<p>During his teenage years he became a member of Germany\u2019s centre-right Christian Democratic Union party. Several decades on, he remains a loyal supporter of the outgoing German chancellor. \u201cI am in favour of Angela Merkel\u2019s announcement that she wants to finish this term.

Because at the moment we are a global payer,\u201d he said, a reference to the EU\u2019s aid budget, the largest in the world.

  "<p>A fictional film about a US president mismanaging the response to a dangerous pandemic would never depict its lead character anywhere near as selfish and bumbling as Donald Trump in the age of Covid-19. He\u2019d be too cartoonish and inept to be believable.</p> <p>And yet, here we are. At a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70n5Xc-rCs\">press conference</a> on Sunday \u2013 the same day that state governors declared closures of bars and restaurants and when the Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51901976\">death count</a> shot up in Italy \u2013 the American president spent more time gushing over the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut, heaping praise on big corporate retailers for keeping Americans well-supplied, and praising Friday\u2019s rise in the stock market (\u201calmost 2,000 points!\u201d) than, say, addressing the health concerns of the public.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s response goes beyond incompetence \u2013 it\u2019s a political abomination. However uncoordinated his administration\u2019s moves have been, Trump has made it clear he sees this pandemic chiefly as a threat to the market and wealthy people\u2019s personal interests (and relatedly, his own political future) \u2013 not to the people whose lives it will threaten or claim.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened with the Fed is phenomenal news,\u201d Trump gushed at the press conference, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news!\u201d \u201cRelax,\u201d he later continued, \u201cwe\u2019re doing great, it all will pass.\u201d These words hardly matched the reality on the ground, as Covid-19 was shutting down whole nations across Europe, and American hospitals were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/coronavirus-covid-surgeries-canceled.html\">cancelling</a> elective surgeries to prepare for a potential surge of the critically ill.</p> <p>Trump and his allies\u2019 impulse to protect the powerful led the administration to undercut the nation\u2019s public health infrastructure long before the rise of coronavirus \u2013 a fact that helps contextualize his response today. For instance, he signed an executive order in January 2017 that froze hiring of federal workers, leading to almost 700 vacancies at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC); some such positions were at a key department that \u201cregulates some of the world\u2019s most dangerous bacteria and viruses and manages the nation\u2019s stockpile of emergency medical countermeasures\u201d, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/05/19/nearly-700-vacancies-at-cdc-because-of-trump-administration-hiring-freeze/\">reported</a>.</p> <p>That same year, Trump and congressional Republicans nearly succeeded in passing a bill that would have gutted Medicaid \u2013 and that also would have eliminated the Prevention and Public Health Fund, <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170307.059053/full/\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/03/08/obamacare-repeal-guts-crucial-public-health-funds/?arc404=true\">source of 12% of the CDC\u2019s budget</a>. Such cuts had one big beneficiary: corporations and the very wealthy, who would have seen big tax cuts had the repeal legislation passed. Later, in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/14/21177509/coronavirus-trump-covid-19-pandemic-response\">it </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html\">disbanded the White House\u2019s pandemic office</a> charged with responding to outbreaks like Covid-19 \u2013 putting no leadership structure in its place.</p> <p>Since the pandemic began, the administration has hardly reprioritized. As Politico\u2019s Dan Diamond <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/07/trump-coronavirus-management-style-123465\">reported</a>, Trump opposed evacuating a cruise ship that was stuck off the coast of California, even though it seemed like the right thing to do, noting that: \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d As Diamond suggested in an interview on National Public Radio\u2019s Fresh Air, \u201c[t]he lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.\u201d</p> <p>In that same vein, the president has baselessly boosted the stock market while providing deceptive public health reassurances. \u201cThe Coronavirus,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339?ref_src=twsrc%255Etfw\">tweeted</a> on 24 February, \u201cis very much under control in the USA \u2026 Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d</p> <p>Trump built on this idea last Friday. At a press conference where he finally declared Covid-19 a national emergency, Trump bizarrely passed the microphone to one corporate CEO after another \u2013 \u201ccelebrities in their own right\u201d, he <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference-3/\">gushed</a>, \u201c\u2026 the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world\u201d. After the conference, he sent a note to his supporters, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/trump-stock-market-gains-signed-photo/index.html\">obtained and reported by CNN</a>, that trumpeted: \u201cFrom opening of press conference, biggest day in stock market history!\u201d It included a graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with his signature \u2013 as much a statement of his political priorities as historians are likely to uncover.</p> <p>Sooner or later, however, Trump will realize that he cannot bullshit his way past biology. Viruses are immune to propaganda; Covid-19 will advance regardless of Trump\u2019s avarice. From his push to grind up Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the rich in 2017, to his bungling stock-market-obsessed response to Covid-19 in 2020, Trump and company have elevated self-interest above life.</p>",

  "<p>Most bands form over pints, broken hearts and aspirations of superstardom. Few start with mild bullying. But Asha Lorenz, the frontwoman of London band Sorry, used to torment guitarist Louis O\u2019Bryen at middle school. Teasing and cruel comments were easy for Lorenz when in close proximity to someone as shy and awkward as O\u2019Bryen. \u201cShe was a bit mean,\u201d he admits over a lukewarm soup in a Shoreditch pub. During their GCSE years, Lorenz mellowed out, and the pair slowly bonded over his long, blond hair, deemed cool by Lorenz, and a love of playing instruments. After competing to see who could release the better songs on SoundCloud, they realised they were, in fact, better together.</p> <p>Today, Sorry create an unusual, sexy take on modern indie rock \u2013 the febrile sound of city-dwelling, broke 22-year-olds, whose nights are dominated by hook-up culture and casual drug-taking \u2013 as evidenced on their debut album for Domino Records, 925. Co-produced by James Dring (Gorillaz, Jamie T), it sees them finally wriggle free of being called a guitar band. Lorenz and O\u2019Bryen describe their sound as pop music, but in early press Sorry saw themselves lumped in with bands in the south London music scene \u2013 sludgy art-school outfits such as Shame, Goat Girl and HMLTD. \u201cWe\u2019re both from north London and live with our mums but play at [Brixton pub] the Windmill a lot,\u201d says Lorenz. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a strong identity to where I\u2019m from.\u201d</p> <p>According to O\u2019Bryen, journalists and those within the music industry \u201cjust want to give people a reason to listen to something by calling it guitar music\u201d. So what are Sorry? They\u2019re a very 2020 band, in that they build their songs round the mood of whatever they\u2019re singing about. A typical Sorry track is just as likely to be inflected with 90s grunge as with jazz or trip-hop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf49eaf9fe756178988f0b313cb92be4f9adcf6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf49eaf9fe756178988f0b313cb92be4f9adcf6d/0_202_4075_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sorry perform in Manchester in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sorry perform in Manchester in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Sorry, they were called Fish (until they realised the ex-lead singer of prog rockers Marillion went by the same name), and before that, Lorenz and O\u2019Bryen were a covers band who played <a href=\"theguardian.com/music/jimi-hendrix\">Jimi Hendrix</a> songs. At school, Lorenz was apparently loud in comparison to O\u2019Bryen, but both are people of few words. The pair\u2019s answers serve as cul-de-sacs, revealing little and circling back to face you. Dressed in nondescript jumpers and coats, with no makeup and scruffy hair, they could easily disappear into the background altogether, having never given anything away.</p> <p>In person, the band have a spaced-out quality, close to the 2000s-internet affliction of being \u201cso random\u201d. At one point, Lorenz removes a hair from the small pot of soup she and O\u2019Bryen are casually sharing, and then puts it back in, to his bewilderment. They profess to being lazy, beholden to very little ambition (\u201cWe\u2019re just making some music and seeing how it goes,\u201d shrugs Lorenz). Drummer Lincoln Barrett and bassist Campbell Baum are absent today.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t let them come to interviews,\u201d says O\u2019Bryen, with a straight face. After a long silence, he adds: \u201cWell, we\u2019re kind of a duo in the way we write songs, but the live thing is more a band.\u201d</p> <p>Their performances on tour, opening for the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/09/fat-white-family-every-one-of-us-had-a-hard-drug-or-drink-problem\">Fat White Family</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/23/sunflower-bean-twentytwo-in-blue-review\">Sunflower Bean</a>, have drawn rave reviews for their technical virtuosity and the impressive, insular world they build. But it is the songwriting that sets Sorry apart, featuring intricate layers of sound and an apparent disregard for genre. What is real, this album asks, when everything socially and politically around us is so questionable?</p> <p>Across 925, the band vacillate between hell and heaven. There is a reference to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ZvPSpLxCg\">Tears for Fears</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ZvPSpLxCg\">\u2019 Mad World</a> over an ominous sax-line on the jazz-influenced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiBTA5BCl1Y\">Right Round </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiBTA5BCl1Y\">the Clock</a>, and later a nod to Louis Armstrong\u2019s What a Wonderful World on the prangover ballad As the Sun Sets. On More, a pantomime of rock star swagger proclaims the nihilistic MO of every person of student age in London (\u201cI want drugs and drugs and drugs and drugs, I want love\u201d). Highlight <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cshb6NAwcFo\">Snakes</a> serves as an analysis of a confusing relationship breakdown: over echoing guitars, Lorenz half-whispers: \u201cEvery time I made you cry, I was crying too.\u201d Album closer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT73Hs_UOQw\">Lies</a> (Refix) is a deliberately uncomfortable listen, too, with Lorenz\u2019s childlike vocals buried in the mix, emerging to raspily deliver the word \u201clies\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiBTA5BCl1Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FiBTA5BCl1Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It is an intricate record, the product of years\u2019 worth of material. Instead of attending university, the pair spent their spare time in their bedrooms making music together. \u201cWe had space to do it, we wrote the songs over four years,\u201d says Lorenz. \u201cWe\u2019re happy we took our time. The earlier singles we put out were more rocky, and that\u2019s not what we want to do.\u201d</p> <p>Before Sorry were signed by Domino, the British indie label that launched the careers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcticmonkeys\">Arctic Monkeys</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/franzferdinand\">Franz Ferdinand</a>, Lorenz emailed to say they liked its client Alex G; a year later, label reps were at a Sorry show.</p> <p>\u201cWe were gonna put in our contract that we had to play with Alex G,\u201d Lorenz says, grinning. They didn\u2019t, but they ended up supporting him on tour in 2019 regardless. It is clear why they look up to Alex G: he is a prolific songwriter with endless ideas and lo-fi production. He hasn\u2019t crafted a personal brand, and doesn\u2019t post selfies; the music speaks for itself.</p> <p>As the band prepare to discover who their fanbase is \u2013 it has been hard to tell thus far, with so many gigs as a support \u2013 they have been told to do more on social media. Their posting has been sporadic at best, half down to laziness, half down to not knowing how to best present themselves. O\u2019Bryen shrugs and says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to come across well. Or funny. Maybe we never will.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe they won\u2019t have to.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://sorryband.co.uk/\">925 is out 27 March; Sorry tour the UK from 26 March</a></em></p>",

Restaurants and bars in the three states - home to more than 22 million \u2013 will serve takeout and delivery only.</p> \n<p>Trump was asked about the Twitter spat with Cuomo at Monday\u2019s White House briefing. \u201cI think he can do more,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an area of the country that\u2019s very hot right now. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/new-york-coronavirus-new-rochelle-containment\">New Rochelle</a>, a place I know very well, I grew up right near New Rochelle.

One journalist asked him to give himself marks out of 10 for his response to the outbreak. \u201cI\u2019d rate it a 10,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In Ohio and Massachusetts they closed restaurants and bars, in Florida they closed beaches and at least 32 states closed schools.</p> \n<p>The emergency measures brought in across America to combat coronavirus have all been slightly different from state to state \u2013 but for weeks they have had one thing in common: nobody was acting on guidelines issued by the federal government, because there weren\u2019t any.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see a whole hodgepodge of efforts being taken across the country,\u201d said Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, which announced a tri-state agreement on Monday with neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut on Monday to close all gyms, movie theaters and casinos.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis state is doing this, this state is doing this, this city is doing this \u2013 it\u2019s chaos.

China, South Korea and Japan used mandatory quarantines, shutdowns and curfews to go from more than a 1,000 new cases per day each to figures now in the low-tens.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou look at the countries who have handled this, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s China, South Korea, Italy, they were all handled by national leadership,\u201d said Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cThis is a national problem.

The recommendations said bars, restaurants and gyms should be closed \u201cin states with evidence of community transmission\u201d \u2013 but no state was safe from community transmission.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems to me that if we do a really good job we\u2019ll not only hold the death rate down to a level that is much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August, something like that,\u201d Donald Trump said at the news conference. \u201cI say it washes through.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump told state governors in a conference call on Monday that they should pursue the acquisition of key medical equipment themselves instead of waiting for Washington to act.</p> \n<p>\u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves,\u201d Trump told the governors, according to a recording <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html\">obtained</a> by the New York Times. \u201cWe will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point-of-sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has often downplayed the coronavirus threat, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html\">calling it</a> \u201cmild\u201d, saying \u201cI\u2019m not concerned\u201d and promising \u201cit will go away, just stay calm\u201d. Asked about a shortage of diagnostic tests, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>The emergency response of the White House has seemed to be guided by concern for the hotel and cruise industries, which Trump has repeatedly promised to support, and for the performance of the stock market, which in the past weeks has crashed through a series of floors.</p> \n<p>As a new week of struggle with coronavirus began on Monday \u2013 the first day in which many Americans either stayed home from their jobs or reluctantly attended, began home-schooling or inventoried their pantries \u2013 the White House announced a news conference not for the morning but for 3:30pm, in what critics said was a transparent attempt to score a market rally in the last half-hour of trading.</p> \n<p>In trying to stop the market hemorrhage, Trump in previous days had announced made-up federal initiatives, such as a website engineered by Google to help people find testing locations, which the company only later, more than 24 hours after the fact, agreed to begin working on.</p> \n<p>The Centers for Disease Control has advised people to avoid large gatherings and said anyone who has come into contact with a known carrier should seek medical advice and self-quarantine for two weeks.</p> \n<p>In the vacuum of guidance, state governors have made rules on the fly. The Democratic governor of Illinois shut down all bars and restaurants in the state until next month. Pennsylvania announced similar restrictions, but only for certain counties. In Ohio, the Republican governor, Mike DeWine, announced statewide closures.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re two days from St Patrick\u2019s Day, when people get together and crowd into bars,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cWe are at a crucial, crucial stage.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pwoodreporter/status/1239569058321829889\">Maryland governor on Monday</a> closed the port of Baltimore to cruise ships seeking to dock, banned evictions, mobilized state troopers, activated the state\u2019s medical volunteer corps and announced the automatic reactivation of expired medical licenses.</p> \n<p>The federal government, by contrast, has not yet announced moves by the defense department, national guard, Army Corps of engineers or Veterans\u2019 Administration \u2013 which has a nationwide network of hospitals \u2013 to help set up field hospitals, rededicate medical facilities, contract with private companies to accelerate manufacture of key supplies, maintain order or otherwise manage the expected wave of critical Covid-19 cases.</p> \n<p>Without federal guidance, local officials have in some cases issued conflicting orders. In Pennsylvania, the governor at the weekend advised people to stay home, and the commissioner of Montgomery county, which includes the Philadelphia suburbs, told people to cancel gatherings.</p> \n<p>But the mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, had different advice, telling people to go out to eat, the <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/restaurant-closings-coronavirus-vetri-bars-pennsylvania-20200315.html\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a> reported.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would recommend you wash your hands, you stay out from within three feet of people, and go out and have dinner \u2013 and tip your waitstaff because they\u2019re struggling right now,\u201d Kenney said.</p> \n<p>While school districts across California closed, schools stayed open in the district of the Houseminority leader, Kevin McCarthy, a close Trump ally who calls Covid-19 \u201cChinese coronavirus\u201d.</p> \n<p>McCarthy\u2019s Republican colleague, Devin Nunes, encouraged people at the weekend to \u201cgo to your local pub\u201d.</p> \n<p>Where many Americans hear conflicting messages, Trump heard harmony.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverybody is so well unified and working so hard,\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cIt is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 23 March 2020.

The commission, in a report partly stemming from the 2016 EU referendum, is proposing measures to change the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/online-political-ads-should-be-labelled-says-law-commission\">Victorian-era laws that govern how UK democracy operates</a>. In 2017, 42.8% of the total reported campaign advertising spend was online \u2013 much of it micro-targeted, making it hard to ensure electoral spending rules are observed and can be enforced. By contrast, printed material must by law identify its publisher. \u201cBeing able to track the origin of campaign material is also important for voters, as it enables them to assess its credibility,\u201d the report notes. Other recommended reforms include wider powers to suspend polling due to, for example, natural disaster or terrorism; letting courts throw out frivolous challenges to election results; and prison sentences for electoral fraud.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>More woe for Metro \u2013 </strong>A group of 17 Iranian customers is suing Metro Bank, saying their accounts were unfairly suspended without notice or explanation.

It\u2019s easy to assess medical conditions, but after that come tougher choices. In Italy, ventilators have been restricted to those under 65, priority given to the young. We, with many fewer beds, are still a few weeks behind them.</p> <p>Later come the political questions of how the country came to be left so nakedly unprepared \u2013 the NHS and social care brutally worn down by a decade of needless, ideologically driven austerity, with local government and civil service stripped of experience and capacity. We are where we are, right now. Public services will no doubt do their heroic utmost, often in appalling situations.</p> <p>In this context, the decision to save the young before the old is, without question, right. Who comes first, the pensioner or the young parent? The one mercy of this virus is that it seems to pass over children. That\u2019s a comforting thought for we grandparents to bear in mind if we find ourselves at the back of the queue, even as we gnash our teeth at the wanton failings of government of the past 10 years.</p> <p>What happens to those infected older people left at home alone to survive or die? NHS England\u2019s guarded <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/preparedness-letters-for-general-practice/\" title=\"\">letter to GPs</a> claims: \u201cWe have taken urgent measures to commission a Covid-19 Home Management Service in all parts of England, to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d It will \u201cprovide urgent primary care services to patients diagnosed with Covid-19 who are self-isolating in the community\u201d. Does that sound reassuring? Not if you ask GPs. Out-of-hours services and locums are far too threadbare to care for everyone at home. Nor will they do home visits, though they can prescribe.</p> <p>Dr Jonathan Leach, joint honorary secretary of the Royal College of General Practitioners and a clinical lead on the plans, says his practice, like many, is discussing how to cope with six local care homes. With mortality rates high, he says, \u201cit\u2019s not in patients\u2019 interests to admit them. We need to have meaningful conversations with families about what might happen. We will tell ambulance services not to take them to hospital.\u201d</p> <p>GPs will encourage end-of-life plans, with DNR (do not resuscitate) forms. \u201cStandard palliative care practice is to keep them comfortable.\u201d People at home or in care homes will get four drugs to ease suffering, including morphine, a tranquiliser to stay calm, one for anti-sickness and another to dry secretions in the airways to help breathing. \u201cWe will give out this \u2018just in case\u2019 medicine, as in end-of-life care, to put in the bathroom cupboard for when it\u2019s needed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he says, and so far there\u2019s no official guidance.

  "<p>What is it about mating common frogs that is so humorous? Part of it is surely their physical comedy, such as the winking white throats bellowing in and out as the males chorus at the surface.

  "<p>It would be nice, as America lurches into a coronavirus shutdown, to immerse in a simpler time \u2013 say, maybe the late 1990s, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a place where keeping your lawn below six inches is seen as a pressing concern. In this idyllic suburb outside Cleveland, appearances are paramount, and talking politics taboo. It\u2019s not a far cry from the insular, subtext-laden Monterey of Big Little Lies, in which Reese Witherspoon navigated an all-star cast of highly competitive mothers for a greater, if troubled, cause of female solidarity amid domestic abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/13/big-time-adolescence-review-pete-davidson-hulu\">Big Time Adolescence review \u2013 Pete Davidson plays to type in low-key comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Little Fires Everywhere, Hulu\u2019s confident if ultimately limited adaptation of Celeste Ng\u2019s 2017 bestselling book (Ng also serves as producer and co-writer), will no doubt draw comparisons to Big Little Lies. It\u2019s also produced by and starring Witherspoon as sharp-eyed queen of a town with its own code of wealth and sanitized language determined to unravel a central, disturbing mystery \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t have as much to say beyond a personal melodrama backlit by an impression of an archetypical wealthy American suburb.</p> <p>The series, adapted for television by Liz Tigelaar, starts, like the book, with said mystery: Elena Richardson (Witherspoon) stands stricken on her lawn, watching her slate-roofed house go up in flames. She\u2019s quintessential \u201cShaker\u201d, a planner and image upholder, married to a defense attorney (Joshua Jackson) and the type to send her children (four kids in four years, all in high school) to school with letter-shaped pancakes and a directive for extracurriculars. Her three eldest, senior Lexie (Jade Pettyjohn), junior Trip (Jordan Elsass), and sophomore Moody (Gavin Lewis) suspect their youngest sister, black sheep Izzy (Megan Stott) of arson \u2013 a hunch their mother refuses to accept. She\u2019s likely to suspect the enigmatic tenant of her parents\u2019 old duplex, nomadic artist Mia Warren (Kerry Washington) and her teenage daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWGkX8ClhBI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JWGkX8ClhBI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The show backtracks four months to August 1997, and unspools the drama over eight hour-long episodes (seven of which were available for critics). In the waning days of summer, Elena battles with Izzy, who, unbeknownst to the family, is bullied at school for an unknown transgression. Elena rents to a reasonably wary Mia, who makes ends meet with cobbled-together server jobs and artwork, and naive Pearl. Their presence sets off a chemical reaction between the two families: Pearl entrances Moody with her quiet intelligence, but is attracted to Trip; Lexie magnetizes Pearl with her thoughtless popularity; Mia draws in Izzy with her nomadic artist life, a rejection of all things Shaker; Mia and Elena fascinate and repulse each other \u2013 Mia wheedles into the Richardson fray to protect their daughter, while Elena, her journalism career thwarted by children, investigates Mia\u2019s past.</p> <p>The series sticks, for the most part, to the book, with one major difference: Mia and Pearl, whose race is not specified in the book, are black characters in the show, adding a fraught jolt to the polarity between the two families. The decision contrasts the mothers even more starkly, and illuminates the bold prejudice and self-righteous blindness of Shaker Heights and its ilk. Suddenly, Elena\u2019s offer for Mia to be her \u201chouse manager\u201d has wider significance, as does Lexie\u2019s use of Pearl\u2019s story for a college application essay. Some of the Richardsons\u2019 dinner table scenes read more as compendiums of various micro-aggressions than actual scene of people at dinner, but the point gets across.</p> <p>But whereas the book traced the knotted threads connecting two families, especially its high school characters, the show\u2019s center of gravity is Mia and Elena \u2013 their differences in worldview, race, and privilege, their fierce codes as mothers and eventual obsessive crusades against each other. Washington and Witherspoon anchor such a fixation; their lines are heavy with sometimes clunky monologues but it\u2019s a thrill to watch, for example, their uneasy tolerance, even understanding, evaporate in real time in a standout second episode scene (with wine, naturally). Their fault lines rupture further over an explosive parental rights case. Mia takes the side of her co-worker at a Chinese restaurant, Bebe Chow (Lu Huang), an illegal immigrant who left her infant by a fire station in poverty-strained postpartum fog. Elena supports her infertile best friend Linda (Rosemarie DeWitt), who is finalizing the adoption of Bebe\u2019s daughter and is desperate not to lose another child.</p> <p>Both Mia and Elena insert themselves into the case intimately and insensibly, and the second half of the series diverts from Shaker into their pasts to justify why each woman responds to the case so intensely. Little Fires Everywhere becomes, ultimately, a referendum on motherhood filtered through middlebrow drama \u2013 the choices mothers make, the worlds they do or do not provide, the secrets they keep, the control they want and increasingly can\u2019t have.</p> <p>Like The Morning Show, yet another show produced and starring Witherspoon, Little Fires Everywhere throws a lot of fraught themes at the wall \u2013 the myth of color-blindness, sexuality, motherhood, abortion, transracial adoption. Not all of them land, and the combination of so many in one series can sometimes feel chaotic, especially when some of the younger characters remain opaque. But it\u2019s compulsively watchable, a portrait of two combustible women anchored by magnetic performances \u2013 which, in these times, works in its favor.</p>",

<p>They accepted expert evidence the Strausz family left Hungary on a single use passport and an exit permit which did not permit re-entry into Hungary.</p> <p>They said Staindl had \u201cnot only \u2026 failed to prove that any obligation of allegiance was at any time owed by Mr Frydenberg to Hungary, but also that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that upon leaving Hungary in 1949 the

If we combine a moderate flu season with a moderate coronavirus season, that could be problematic.\u201d</p> <p>Sheel said: \u201cAs Australia moves into cooler weather, we are likely to see an increase in respiratory diseases such as common colds, influenza and RSV infections.</p> <p>\u201cTo minimise the pressure on the health system it will be important for the community to adopt public health prevention measures, get vaccinated and staying at home when unwell \u2013 practising social distancing.</p> <p>\u201cThis will also help improve our ability to test for Covid-19 and in return protect our vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions and minimise their risk of exposure to infection with Covid-19.

Restaurants will remain open in only a takeout and delivery capacity. Grocery stores, hardware stores and pharmacies will stay open.</p> <h2>What about transit?</h2> <p>All non-essential travel \u201con foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit\u201d is prohibited. Under the order, essential travel is categorized as traveling for necessary supplies, accessing healthcare or going to provide aid to family or friends. Airports, taxis, Uber, Lyft and public transit will continue running to service essential travel, but those using any mode of travel are expected to practice social distancing.</p> <h2>Why are these counties taking such an extreme measure?</h2> <p>California saw a 14% increase in positive coronavirus cases over the weekend, with 335 reported and six deaths. The majority of the cases have been in the Bay Area: 40 in San Francisco, 138 in Santa Clara county and 120 more in the neighboring counties.

There is no community spread in some communities. There is significant community spread in some communities.\u201d</p> <h2>How do you shelter-in-place if you\u2019re homeless?</h2> <p>In the six Bay Area counties that issued the order, an estimated 25,000 people are homeless. In Santa Cruz county, there are 2,167. The order exempts the homeless from having to shelter-in-place, but is \u201curging them to find shelter and government agencies to provide it\u201d.</p> <p>At Sunday\u2019s news conference, Newsom said the state was working to procure hotels and motels for the homeless population living in encampments, as well as an additional 450 trailers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in San Francisco, there is currently a waitlist of 799 to get a shelter bed. More than 90 on that list are 65 years of age or older, and most vulnerable of exposure.</p>",

Biden can win over reluctant Latinos with a bold and progressive stance on immigration, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cI hope that he doesn\u2019t eat up the lie that he has to be more conservative on the immigration issue,\u201d said Romero, who hasn\u2019t endorsed Biden or Sanders since her favoured candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of an issue that is so important for Latino voters, water it down and not have policies that Latinos can get excited about.\u201d</p> <p>Arizona and Florida are both likely to be battlegrounds in the November election. In Arizona, one in three residents is Latino; in Florida, it\u2019s one in four.</p> <p>Early in his administration, Obama aggressively increased efforts to deport immigrants living in the country illegally. He\u2019d hoped to convince members of Congress and the public that he was serious about border security in order to secure a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would extend legal status to millions of people living in the US without authorization. The reform bill never passed, but the deportations disrupted families, drove fear in immigrant communities and left deep wounds.<br></p> <p>Any Democrat\u2019s immigration policies would be superior to Trump\u2019s, but that won\u2019t be enough to excite Latinos, said Tomas Robles, co-director of Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, a Latino organizing group that has endorsed Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot depend on people\u2019s hatred or fear of Trump to inspire them to turn out in droves for Vice President Biden,\u201d Robles said to the AP. \u201cBernie has worked hard to motivate Latinos as a base. But the entire establishment part has failed at doing the same.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f70828f088d7575594308\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:32:10.952Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US calls on Vietnam to release blogger Truong Duy Nhat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The State department have issued <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/sentencing-of-blogger-and-radio-free-asia-contributor-truong-duy-nhat/\">a statement calling for the release of Truong Duy Nhat</a>, a weekly blogger for the Vietnamese service of Radio Free Asia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/truong-duy-nhat-vietnam-blogger-radio-free-asia-thailand\">He disappeared in January 2019</a>, a day after he applied for refugee status with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok, and reappeared in custody.</p> <p>Truong Duy Nhat was sentenced to a 10-year prison term last week.

  "<p>Online political adverts should be labelled or \u201cimprinted\u201d to show who is paying for them, according to the Law Commission, which warns that there is a \u201cvery real risk of the electoral process losing credibility\u201d.</p> <p>Presiding officers should also have the power to cancel polls in the event of major terror attacks as well as severe weather such as widespread flooding or other disruptive events, the commission has proposed in a series of measures to change the Victorian-era laws that govern how democracy operates in the UK.</p> <p>The report, produced in the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum and the cancelled 2014 Tower Hamlets mayoral election, will be handed to the Cabinet Office and the devolved Scottish government for approval. It was completed before the UK government announced last week the postponement of local elections and the mayoral contest in London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/18/mps-call-for-unlimited-fines-for-those-who-breach-electoral-law\">MPs call for unlimited fines for those who breach electoral law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Law Commission\u2019s review is aimed at modernising ballot rules and bringing them together in a single, consistent legislative framework. Other changes proposed include simplifying the nomination process.</p> <p>Some proposed changes are in response to digital developments. In 2017, 42.8% of the total reported campaign advertising spend was online. Much of it was delivered using micro-targeting techniques, which blur the previous distinction between national and constituency electoral expenditure, the commission acknowledges.</p> <p>\u201cWithout knowing who is responsible for material, it is difficult to tell when an offence has been committed, or to enforce the campaign expenditure rules,\u201d it notes. A system requiring online adverts to carry \u201cdigital imprints\u201d would help. \u201cBeing able to track the origin of campaign material is also important for voters, as it enables them to assess its credibility.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, printed campaign material must be labelled, or \u201cimprinted\u201d, with the name of whoever publishes it and with certain other information. Failure to do so is a criminal offence.</p> <p>Nicholas Paines QC, the public law commissioner at the Law Commission of England and Wales, said: \u201cElections are fundamental to democracy yet the laws governing them are no longer fit for purpose. If left as they are, there is a very real risk of the electoral process losing credibility, which could be catastrophic.</p> <p>\u201cOur reforms will simplify, modernise and rationalise the law. This will make it easier to amend legislation so elections are able to overcome future challenges, and help to maintain confidence in the electoral system.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Paton, the chair of the Scottish Law Commission, said: \u201cFor both Scotland and the wider UK, it\u2019s vital that the law on elections is easy to administer, accessible and user-friendly. These reforms will achieve this, ensuring elections work and are fit for the 21st century.\u201d The report has been published jointly by the two commissions which review outdated legislation.</p> <p>UK electoral law is currently spread across 25 statutes and 30 sets of regulations, many dating back to the 19th century. A significant proportion of them are found in the Representation of the People 1983 Act. When changes were last made to to allow those queuing at the close of polls to cast their vote, or example, alterations had to be made to 10 distinct pieces of legislation.</p> <p>The main changes proposed include:</p> <p>\u2022 Expanding the conditions under which polls can be suspended. Voting can currently only be stopped by a presiding officer in response to rioting, open violence or the death of a candidate. The Law Commission recommends allowing for any incident where a significant portion of electors are affected and unable to vote including, for example, flooding, adverse weather or an act of terrorism.</p> <p>\u2022 Introducing a single set of nomination papers for candidates, replacing the existing, confusing mixture of forms and authorisations. UK parliamentary nominations at present involves up to seven different pieces of paper: some are sent by the party nominating officer, some by the candidate; some must be delivered by hand, others can be delivered by post.</p> <p>\u2022 Requiring \u201cdigital imprints\u201d for online campaign material and for social media advertisements. They would include information on who has paid for the advert, as is the case for traditional election leaflets and advertisements.</p> <p>\u2022 Reforming how election results can be challenged. The new proposals would give courts the power to \u201cweed out ill-founded claims that waste court time\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Simplifying the offence of bribery for anyone acting with an intention to procure or prevent the casting of a vote at an election. The ancient offence of \u201ctreating\u201d \u2013 providing meat, drink or provisions to influence voters\u2019 behaviour \u2013 should be abolished.</p> <p>\u2022 Enabling returning officers to reject nominations that use a candidate\u2019s name designed to confuse or mislead electors.</p> <p>\u2022 Introducing sentences of up to 10 years in prison for serious electoral fraud. Prosecutors currently have to resort to the offence of conspiracy to defraud to impose such prison terms.</p> <p>Minister for the Constitution and Devolution Chloe Smith said: \u201cThis Government is committed to updating electoral law and delivering a democracy that works for all in the 21st century. I am grateful for the Law Commissions\u2019 report and will be considering their recommendations carefully.\u201d</p> <p>The cabinet office said that the government has already committed to introducing a requirement for inserting \u2018imprints\u2019 in digital election material.</p>",
  "<p>The consumer group Which? is calling on the government to force all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/banks\">banks</a> to adopt new anti-fraud measures, after finding that more than \u00a31bn has been lost to bank transfer scams in just three years.<br><br>Which? analysed bank fraud statistics since the start of 2017 and says the losses to consumers has been at least \u00a31.1bn.</p> <p>Thousands of consumers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/08/bank-couple-lose-43000-but-cant-get-a-refund\">individually lost life-changing sums</a> after being duped into handing over their life savings, with the banks mostly refusing to refund their losses.</p> <p>By the end of March, the banks are supposed to have introduced a new measure that will curb fraudsters. However, not all are planning to, Which? has warned.</p> <p>The measure, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/29/banks-transfer-scams-errors-payee-account-number\">confirmation of payee</a> (CoP), will ensure the account name matches the one the customer enters when making a payment. Scammers frequently persuade victims that they have set up a new account in the victims\u2019 name and ask them to transfer their money to it. The new measure will show up the true account holders\u2019 name and should halt many scams in their tracks.</p> <p>CoP will help stop fraudsters from posing as trusted organisations such as a bank or solicitor and tricking people into making payments to them, Which? said. Had the measure been introduced in 2017, it believed that \u00a3320m would not have been lost to fraudsters.<br><br>But the Payment Systems Regulator has only directed the six biggest banking groups to sign up by 31 March. Which? believes all banks must join the scheme in order for it to be effective.</p> <p>RBS Group (including Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Ulster Bank) and HSBC (including First Direct) were unable to confirm a specific date when asked if they would be ready by the regulator\u2019s deadline. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/24/metro-bank-refuses-to-refund-scammed-customer\">Metro Bank</a> told Which? that it has no current plans to implement CoP at all. <br><br>Lloyds Banking Group is ahead of the pack, implementing CoP from 2 March for Bank of Scotland customers, before rolling it out to Halifax and Lloyds customers throughout the rest of the month.</p> <p>Amid concerning reports of banks failing to follow the code\u2019s rules around reimbursing blameless \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/30/authorised-push-payment-scam-fraud\">authorised-push-payment</a>\u201d scam victims, Which? is concerned that a voluntary approach to ensuring victims are treated fairly is no longer viable.<br><br>Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: \u201cThe UK has been in the grip of a fraud crisis for years, but new security measures offered by the banking industry should finally give people better protection against increasingly sophisticated fraudsters.<br><br>\u201cAt the end of this month, we should get a true sense of how well the industry is tackling the issue. It is vital for all banks to commit to basic name-check security, and the whole industry should sign up and follow through on the protections offered by the scams code.<br><br>\u201cIf the banks fall short of making these commitments themselves, these initiatives must be made mandatory by the government.\u201d</p> <p>Chief executive of UK Finance Stephen Jones said: \u201cA voluntary agreement alone is not enough and we share the view expressed by Which? that issues of liability and reimbursement would best be addressed by new legislation. Both the government and regulators must also urgently consider how customer data breaches and vulnerabilities in other sectors such as telecoms and social media are facilitating fraud, as part of a holistic strategy to protect consumers from harm.\u201d</p>",

But I think it\u2019s important to realise the scale of UK testing which has been substantial. Over 44,000 tests conducted, of which over 42,000 were negative, and we will continue to scale up the testing every single week from here in moving out into the wider community. </p> \n   <p>The test we have at the moment only tests for people who\u2019ve currently got disease. The thing which will be transformational would be a test to reliably tell us if someone has previously had disease, so we can pick up and find out what proportion of people get this infection without any symptoms.

Good luck with that.</p> \n   <p>No one knows for sure how to predict the unprecedented \u2013 or how to handle it. Initially there was a sense, certainly among the doctors to whom I have spoken,that Britain\u2019s position at the non-hysterical end of the spectrum was correct. The chief medical officer for England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/08/five-coronavirus-experts-guide-british-public-through-crisis\">Chris Whitty</a>, took the view that the illness, though highly contagious, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\">most dangerous</a> for those with a vulnerable immune system.

There were reasons only for contingencies.</p> \n   <p>As the virus expanded and other governments reacted differently, this stance was challenged. But Whitty had accepted that, if circumstances altered, policy would shift from \u201ccontain to delay\u201d. This was undermined as global hysteria rose to a peak. Other countries were reacting as had China and South Korea, and progressed to \u201clockdown\u201d.

Covid-19,\u201d added de Matteis, who is also an associate professor in occupational and environmental medicine at Italy\u2019s Cagliari University.</p> \n   <p>While there is currently no proven link between Covid-19 mortality and air pollution, one peer-reviewed study into the 2003 SARS outbreak showed that patients in regions with moderate air pollution levels were 84 percent more likely to die than those in regions with low air pollution.</p> \n   <p>According to the European Environment Agency, air pollution leads to around 400,000 early deaths across the continent annually, despite

There was a testy exchange where Sanders criticised Biden for his refusal to disavow a super PAC supporting his candidacy and his past comments on potential cuts to social security.</li> \n   <li>Joe Biden<strong> </strong><strong>vowed to choose a woman as his running mate</strong> if he won the presidential nomination.
