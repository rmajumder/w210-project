  "<p>Minneapolis public schools are terminating their contract with the city\u2019s police department following the death of George Floyd.</p> <p>The city\u2019s public school board unanimously approved a <a href=\"https://v3.boardbook.org/Public/PublicItemDownload.aspx?ik=46459777\">resolution</a> on Tuesday night that will end the district\u2019s contract with the Minneapolis police department to use officers to provide school security. The Minneapolis superintendent said he would begin work on an alternative plan to keep the district\u2019s more than 35,000 students safe in the coming school year. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot continue to be in partnership with an organization that has the culture of violence and racism that the Minneapolis police department has historically demonstrated,\u201d Nelson Inz, one of the school board members, said. \u201cWe have to stand in solidarity with our black students.\u201d</p> <p>While the vote does not bring justice for Floyd, \u201cit will show that meaningful change is possible,\u201d Nathaniel Genene, the school board\u2019s student representative, said.</p> <p>Genene said an online survey of Minneapolis students had received more than 1,500 responses, and about 90% of them supported terminating the district\u2019s contract with the police.</p> <p>Public schools \u201ccannot partner with organizations that do not see the humanity in our students\u201d, Minneapolis school board member Josh Pauly, who helped draft the resolution, wrote on Twitter last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">Anger as local police union chief calls George Floyd a 'violent criminal'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The school district \u201ccannot align itself with [the Minneapolis police&nbsp;department] and claim to fight institutional racism\u201d, Pauly added.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Minneapolis teachers union had endorsed the change, calling for the city\u2019s schools to \u201ccut all financial ties\u201d with the police department, and to invest in additional mental health support for students instead.</p> <p>\u201cThe officers of the&nbsp;Minneapolis police department have become symbols of fear to the children those officers were sworn to serve and protect,\u201d two local union officials said in a <a href=\"https://www.mft59.org/end-contract-with-mpd\">statement</a> last week.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the school board meeting, several members praised the work of individual police officers who had served in Minneapolis public schools as \u201cschool resource officers\u201d and said at least a few of the officers did have deep, meaningful community relationships that would be missed.</p> <p>But Pauly, the school board member, told the Guardian in advance of the vote that he had received hundreds of emails and phone calls from students in Minneapolis who support ending the school district\u2019s relationship with the police department.</p> <p>Other school board members across the country \u2013 including from districts in Arizona, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Washington, Oregon, New York and Illinois \u2013 have also reached out privately for support in crafting similar resolutions, he said.</p> <p>A vote to end Minneapolis schools\u2019 contract with the police department is a major victory for activists across the country who have been working to&nbsp;remove all police from schools.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very specific group of people who feel safe with police, but most&nbsp;black and brown children&nbsp;do not feel safe with police in schools,\u201d said Jackie Byers, the executive director of the Black Organizing Project, which has been working since 2011 to end the use of police officers in Oakland public schools, including asking teachers and administrators to pledge to not call the police on their students.</p> <p>School districts \u201cneed to see someone step forward\u201d, Byers said. \u201cFolks are afraid of being the first district to do something.\u201d</p> <p>More than 70% of public secondary schools and 30% of primary schools in the United States have sworn law enforcement officers who routinely carry firearms, according to 2015-2016 data from the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_233.70.asp\">National Center for Education Statistics</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn San Francisco, we\u2019ve had 10-year-olds that have had the police called on them. Kindergarteners. Fifth-graders,\u201d said Neva Walker, the executive director of Coleman Advocates for Children and Youth, a non-profit group that focuses on creating more equitable public schools.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to get past the idea that police are the means to protect our children, especially for black and brown students,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For decades, school shootings, typically carried out by young white men, have prompted the American government to invest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/18/school-shootings-security-industry\">hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars</a> in putting armed law enforcement officers inside schools.</p> <p>But studies have shown that more&nbsp;students enter the criminal justice system when more police officers are in schools, sparking concern from some advocates that the attempt to protect American children from mass shootings had unintentionally fueled a&nbsp;school-to-prison pipeline&nbsp;that disproportionately harms students of color.</p> <p>Breaking that cycle has not been easy. But one \u201ccritically important\u201d step forward, Byers said, had already come from the University of Minnesota, which announced \u201cimmediate changes\u201d in its relationship with the Minneapolis police department in the wake of widespread&nbsp;protests over Floyd\u2019s death.&nbsp;</p> <p>The university president, Joan Gabel, said in a letter last week that the university would no longer work with the police department to provide security for football games, concerts and other large events, and that it would limit its cooperation with the police to joint patrols and investigations \u201cthat directly enhance the safety of our community\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>The university\u2019s relationship with other police departments in other cities where it has campuses will remain unchanged, a spokesman said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Minneapolis police department did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Zuckerberg is standing by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us\">decision</a> to allow Donald Trump to threaten violence against George Floyd protesters on the platform despite harsh criticism from civil rights leaders and public dissent from his own employees, including a public resignation.</p> <p>In a video conference with staff on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said that his decision to not remove Trump\u2019s warning on social media on Friday that \u201cwhen the looting starts the shooting start\u201d was \u201ctough\u201d but \u201cpretty thorough\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/technology/zuckerberg-defends-facebook-trump-posts.html?smid=tw-share\">New York Times</a> reported.

Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1266272863222292480\">deemed</a> a tweet with the same language dangerous and chose to hide it behind a warning label \u201cin the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts\u201d. But though Zuckerberg acknowledged the statement\u2019s racist historical antecedent, he said that the company has a policy of allowing state actors to warn the public about the use of force.</p> <p>This reasoning has garnered scorn from US civil rights leaders, three of whom spoke with Zuckerberg and his top lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg on Monday evening. \u201cWe are disappointed and stunned by Mark\u2019s incomprehensible explanations,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robinson \u2013 heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Color of Change \u2013 in a joint statement.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;is facilitating Trump\u2019s call for violence against protesters,\u201d the added. \u201cMark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg has also faced continued public criticism from employees \u2013 a highly unusual occurrence for the company.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,\u201d the engineer Brandon Dail <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aweary/status/1267561154349371392\">tweeted</a> on Tuesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8142b3453d8a27c816bfaed7c6d8cfd760eb97cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8142b3453d8a27c816bfaed7c6d8cfd760eb97cb/0_4_386_636/303.jpg\" alt=\"A Facebook ad by Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign running amid widespread civil unrest.\" width=\"303\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Facebook ad by Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign running amid widespread civil unrest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Timothy J Aveni, a Facebook software engineer,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>announced his resignation on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/timothy.j.aveni/posts/3006224359465567\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timothy-j-aveni_blacklivesmatter-activity-6673316720993824768-q_dU\">LinkedIn</a>.<br><br>\u201cMark always told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,\u201d Aveni wrote. \u201cHe showed us on Friday that this was a lie.\u201d<br><br>Aveni connected Facebook\u2019s accommodation of Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric to the company\u2019s track record in Asia, where Facebook has been implicated in ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, mob violence in Sri Lanka and the rise of a demagogue in the Philippines. <br><br>\u201cFacebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponized hatred, is on the wrong side of history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is providing a platform that enables politicians to radicalize individuals and glorify violence, and we are watching the United States succumb to the same kind of social media-fueled division that has gotten people killed in the Philippines, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. I\u2019m scared for my country and I\u2019m done trying to justify this.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook has been central to Trump\u2019s political rise.

At the end of March, the National Statistics Institute (INE), which calculates figures in a different way, gave Spain\u2019s jobless figure as 3.31 million. </p> \n  <p>These figures do not count those who have been furloughed. Between mid-March and the end of May, a total of 3.7 million people were furloughed under a plan rolled out by the labour ministry. But when the furlough scheme draws to a close as planned at the end of June, unemployment figures could rise again.</p> \n  <p>The government has urged employers not to cut jobs in the six months following the furlough period but layoffs are expected.</p> \n  <p>In May, as the lockdown was eased, the number of new jobseekers in the construction sector fell by almost 7% compared with April. In industry and agriculture, the figure remained stable but it grew by 1.5% in the service sector which has borne the brunt of the crisis, particularly due to the loss of significant numbers of temporary jobs in tourism.</p> \n  <p>In the first quarter, Spain\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to 14.4%, INE figures showed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates unemployment in Spain could soar to 20.8% in 2020, while the government expects a figure of 19%.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed620748f084df971c8e11c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:51:50.518Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Concerts have been allowed to restart in <strong>Portugal</strong>, with the country\u2019s prime minister, Antonio Costa, attending a show performed by Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo in Lisbon last night: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83/0_124_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira performs during his show Deixem o Pimba em Paz at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067/0_320_4804_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, center, and his wife Fernanda Tadeu applaud as the lights dim for the start of a concert by Portuguese artists Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo at the Campo Pequeno bullring in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armando Franca/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wearing face masks attend a concert in Lisbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks attend the performing show Deixem o Pimba em Paz by Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:46:02.315Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Statistics watchdog criticises government's testing data</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In a strongly-worded letter, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the Government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d. The government has faced repeated criticism for its daily testing figures, in which it counts in its headline figure the number of tests posted out to people as well as the number of those completed. It is also not clear from the government data how many of the tests carried out are repeat tests on the same person.</p> \n  <p>Norgrove said the government\u2019s current statistics figures were misleading people during the daily No 10 briefing as they often do not explain how the headline figure on the number of tests has been calculated.</p> \n  <p>He said the way the tests were presented at the televised press conference gives \u201can artificially low impression of the proportion of tests returning a positive diagnosis\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Norgrove said it was also \u201chard to believe the statistics work to support the testing programme itself,\u201d adding that they \u201cstill fall well short\u201d of the statistics code of practice which Hancock has said he supported.

He is the sixth doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital to have died from the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city late last year.</p> \n  <p>Cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control. The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634, well below the number of fatalities in less populous nations.</p> \n  <p>Wuhan Central Hospital has yet to give a formal statement on Hu\u2019s death. In early February it said some 68 staff members had contracted coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Hu\u2019s condition became a national concern after Chinese media showed images of him with his skin turned black due to liver damage. Fellow doctor Yi Fan showed similar symptoms, but recovered and has since been discharged from hospital.</p> \n  <p>The death of their colleague Li Wenliang in February triggered a national outpouring of grief and rage against the government as he documented his final days on social media. The 34-year-old ophthalmologist was reprimanded by authorities after he warned colleagues about the virus in late December. Beijing has since named him a national martyr, but suppressed much of the dissent and criticism sparked by his death.</p> \n  <p>Other medical whistleblowers at Wuhan Central Hospital - including emergency unit director Ai Fen - have told Chinese media they were punished by authorities for speaking out.</p> \n  <p>China has not released a complete figure of the number of medical worker deaths from Covid-19, but at least 34 medics have been awarded posthumous honours by health authorities. In February the National Health Commission said some 3,387 health workers had been infected.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f5b5dead4a920e3dc280a8a494aa25f831c64cc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f5b5dead4a920e3dc280a8a494aa25f831c64cc/0_0_3472_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child is tested for coronavirus in Wuhan, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child reacts while undergoing nucleic acid testing in Wuhan, the Chinese city hit hardest by the coronavirus disease outbreak, on 16 May.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>City-wide testing that began in mid-May found <strong>no new cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan</strong>, and 300 asymptomatic cases.

Some of <strong>Brazil</strong>\u2019s hardest hit cities, including the jungle metropolis Manaus and coastal Rio de Janeiro, are starting to allow more activity. <strong>Bolivia</strong>\u2019s government has authorised reopening most of the country and the government of <strong>Venezuela</strong>\u2019s Nicolas Maduro unwound restrictions, while <strong>Ecuador</strong>\u2019s airports were resuming flights. Here is a report filed last night by AP:</p> \n  <p>The executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies program, Mike Ryan, expressed concern over South America\u2019s climbing contagion, telling reporters Monday that the region had become an \u201cintense zone of transmission for this virus,\u201d which had not yet reached its peak. \u201cClearly the situation in many South American countries is far from stable. There is a rapid increase in cases and those systems are coming under increasing pressure,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Data from the WHO\u2019s Pan American Health Organization shows the region\u2019s seven-day rolling average of new cases continues rising, due in large part to Brazil, which accounts for more than half the total.</p> \n  <p>Manaus, the Amazon rainforest\u2019s largest city, was the first Brazilian metropolis whose health care system collapsed. For weeks, overwhelmed intensive-care units were unable to admit patients, deaths at home surged and a city cemetery buried bodies in mass graves.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"209234d84f5f4863dcb05b63640e2cd2335d037f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/209234d84f5f4863dcb05b63640e2cd2335d037f/0_229_5383_3230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Parque Tarum\u00e3 cemetery in Manaus, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An open mass grave at the Parque Tarum\u00e3 cemetery in Manaus, Brazil.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Coelho/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Such burials continue, yet the capital of Amazonas state on Monday began loosening its clamp on non-essential businesses. Amazonas registered 818 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases above 40,000. There are more than 500,000 confirmed cases in Brazil, the second most in the world, and experts believe the true toll to be much higher due to insufficient testing. Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian city with the second-most cases after Sao Paulo, on Monday announced it would begin gradually relaxing restrictions the following day. Already a city in its metropolitan region, Sao Joao de Meriti, started allowing salons, auto mechanics, and hotels to operate on Monday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBrazil tends to look at Europe, and the problem is that there they did one or two months of strict quarantine and are now reopening,\u201d said Renato Mendes Coutinho, a specialist in mathematical biology at Covid-19 BR Observatory, an independent group of more than 50 Brazilian researchers. \u201cThe difference is that the lockdown they implemented and the restriction measures were much more efficient and thorough.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a64d2f78aef5c46e9a146211b6106bc52ba4726\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a64d2f78aef5c46e9a146211b6106bc52ba4726/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mariscal Sucre Airport in Quito, Ecuador\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical tests are carried out on a would-be passenger at Mariscal Sucre Airport in Quito, Ecuador on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franklin Jacome/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Ecuador </strong>was one of the first South American nations hit, with grim scenes of people leaving corpses outside their doorsteps in Guayaquil through March and April. The nation\u2019s caseload continues to surge, yet its airport will resume international flights on 3 June, according to Nicolas Romero, the airport\u2019s spokesperson, though he said arriving passengers must spend 15 days in quarantine, without specifying how such quarantine will be enforced. The airport in the country\u2019s capital, Quito, recorded its first flight in 80 days on Monday, and flights to Miami and Houston will take off on 4 June. \u201cIt has just been one flight so far, but the important thing is the message it gives, of flying safely,\u201d Luis Galarraga, the airport\u2019s spokesperson, told The Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>Marcos Espinal, director of PAHO\u2019s communicable diseases department, said by phone that reopening too soon could cause harm in certain places that aren\u2019t yet ready. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the middle of the epicenter, we don\u2019t recommend to open,\u201d Espinal said from Washington. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are precious, and there shouldn\u2019t be any negotiations of that.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Venezuela </strong>on Monday allowed barbershops, beauty salons, auto shops, construction sites and banks to begin operations, along with other sectors. The nation is dialing down restrictions because it has reported relatively low Covid-19 impact: 1,510 cases and 14 deaths. Experts have roundly criticised Venezuela\u2019s data as suspicious.</p> \n  <p><strong>Bolivia </strong>on Monday instituted a so-called \u201cdynamic quarantine\u201d in most of the country, keeping parks and shows shuttered while resuming work, commerce and public transport, even as contagion continues rising.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d968bab60d2c38103443d4b619f6e543bf42606\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d968bab60d2c38103443d4b619f6e543bf42606/0_0_3500_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaza San Francisco in La Paz, Bolivia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk at the Plaza San Francisco in La Paz, Bolivia, on Monday, the first day of eased restrictions.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mercado/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The government\u2019s public works minister, Ivan Arias, suggested Monday that men shave their beards and moustaches to prevent infection.

after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines.</p> \n  <p>AP reports that strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame. The news agency says its report is based on internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews. </p> \n  <p>The AP report reads: </p> \n  <p><em>Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on 11 January. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Although the World Health Organization continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time. </em></p> \n  <p><em>\u201cWe\u2019re currently at the stage where yes, they\u2019re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,\u201d said WHOs top official in China, Dr Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world in a most timely fashion.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of member states.</em></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab68d6c6501049f3ce739c604796105ff2f35e6f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab68d6c6501049f3ce739c604796105ff2f35e6f/0_197_6048_3630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wearing face masks wait for the green light while riding scooters on a street in Shanghai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks wait for the green light while riding scooters on a street in Shanghai.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H\u00e9ctor Retamal/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>The AP has found rather than colluding with China, WHO was itself largely kept in the dark, as China gave it only the minimal information required. But the agency did attempt to portray China in the best light, most likely to coax the country into providing more outbreak details. </em></p> \n  <p><em>WHO officials worried about how to press China for more information without angering authorities or jeopardising Chinese scientists, whom they praised for decoding the genome with astonishing speed. Dr Michael Ryan, WHO\u2019s emergencies chief, said the best way to protect China was for WHO to do its own independent analysis, because otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question and other countries will take action accordingly.</em></p> \n  <p><em>From the time the virus was first decoded on 2 January to when WHO declared a global emergency on 30 January, the outbreak grew by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention data. </em></p> \n  <p><em>WHO and officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by the AP without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources.</em></p> \n  <p><em>\u201cOur leadership and staff have worked night and day.to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels,\u201d a WHO statement said.</em></p> \n  <p><em>China\u2019s National Health Commission and Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment.</em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T05:49:53.973Z\">at 6.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed5e2cb8f084df971c8df87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T05:31:15.823Z\">6.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK quarantine rules criticised</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the<strong> UK c</strong>ritics have taken aim at the government\u2019s 14-day quarantine rules, calling them \u201cridiculous\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, under draft plans to be laid before parliament.<br></p> \n  <p>The rules, s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/critics-round-on-no-10-over-ridiculous-rules-for-14-day-quarantine-coronavirus\">till being finalised and due to be published on Tuesday</a> before coming into effect next week, have prompted cross-party concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNot only is there no basis in science for this ridiculous policy, but it will unnecessarily cost thousands and thousands of jobs.

  "<p>Scott Morrison\u2019s decision to take a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/21/scott-morrison-hawaii-horror-show-pr-disaster-unfolded\">holiday in Hawaii</a> as fires engulfed the east coast of Australia will go down as among the most unfortunate political missteps in recent history. The trip became emblematic of a federal government caught flat-footed for last summer\u2019s unfolding bushfire catastrophe.</p> \n<p>New documents, some released under freedom of information provisions, have shed more light on the government\u2019s preparations for the bushfire season and response to it. The documents show that while some parts of the bureaucracy were aware by August that the country was facing a horror season, that urgency did not reach their political masters.</p> \n<p>One of the most important questions for the royal commission into the bushfire crisis will be whether state and federal authorities effectively coordinated their response. </p> \n<p>Disaster management is primarily a state responsibility, but the commonwealth also has a role, particularly when fires cross state lines and states need additional resources. Surprisingly, there is no clear power in the constitution to declare a national emergency.</p> \n<p>Some important functions \u2013 notably aerial firefighting, telecommunications infrastructure, emergency broadcasts on the ABC, electricity grids and assistance from the military \u2013 are in the hands of the commonwealth, or funded by it.</p> \n<p>But despite a scientific assessment in August warning of a dire outlook, many of the follow-up actions, such as more funding for aerial firefighting equipment, were slow to flow. There appears to have been little appreciation at the executive level of just how horrific the bushfire season was predicted to be.</p> \n<h2>Aerial firefighting funding slides</h2> \n<p>Most notable was the commonwealth\u2019s ad hoc response on aerial firefighting, which was well documented during the fires.</p> \n<p>A funding agreement between the states and the commonwealth for the National Aerial Firefighting Agency was reached in 2003 after a particularly fierce bushfire season. The Howard government agreed the commonwealth would provide 50% of the funds each year.</p> \n<p>But by 2017, the federal share of funding had fallen to 23%.</p> \n<p>Despite a formal request <strong> </strong>in 2017 from the national agency to permanently increase its budget, the federal Coalition chose to offer an $11m \u201cone-off\u201d top-up to the centre\u2019s $14.8m funding in 2018. That was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/12/bushfires-coalition-responds-to-calls-for-more-water-bombers-with-11m-aerial-firefighting-boost\">renewed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/12/bushfires-coalition-responds-to-calls-for-more-water-bombers-with-11m-aerial-firefighting-boost\"> on 12 December 2019</a>. But by then the east coast was already ablaze.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6b412f58-5bfa-4f28-b443-2ff110965eaa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dt__LIfgXLU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On 3 January, after hundreds of houses had been lost and several coastal towns were cut off, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/04/australian-pm-scott-morrison-agrees-to-permanently-increase-aerial-firefighting-funding\">Morrison announced another $20m to deploy four additional air tankers</a> and agreed to make the $11m top-up ongoing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you look at that \u2026 over the last couple of years and the additional resource that is being provided on top of our standing commitment of $15m, it means the resources were delivered,\u201d a defensive Morrison said.</p> \n<p>Part of the reason for the slow commonwealth response is perhaps that no single minister or department, with the possible exception of the Department of Home Affairs, has ownership of planning for a natural disaster on a national scale.</p> \n<p>At least five portfolios \u2013 health, defence, communications, energy and home affairs \u2013 have control over critical resources. Agencies such as the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have important roles in predicting the likely impact of a bushfire.</p> \n<p>Arguably there are more agencies \u2013 notably the environment department, which has responsibility for threatened species and climate change \u2013 that should also be involved in bushfire response planning.</p> \n<h2>Heightened fire risks predicted</h2> \n<p>In the federal sphere, the main responsibility for assessing the outlook for the bushfire season fell to Emergency Management Australia (EMA) \u2013 once a separate agency, now a branch within the sprawling home affairs portfolio.</p> \n<p>The branch told the Guardian it hosted 11 disaster preparedness briefings across all states, beginning in August 2019 when the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre released its seasonal outlook.</p> \n<p>The outlook warned, quite accurately though in somewhat muted language, where the risk lay.</p> \n<p>\u201cAustralia faces the likelihood of an active fire season with above-normal fire potential forecast for significant parts of Australia, particularly the south-east,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has been the fifth-driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. This is especially the case over the southern half of the country, which has experienced the driest January to July on record (January to July 1902 is the second driest).\u201d </p> \n<p>The outlook pinpointed the areas that faced the higher risk. In NSW, it said, there was \u201csignificant concern for the potential of an above-normal fire season in forested areas on and east of the Great Dividing Range\u201d.</p> \n<p>The risk for the ACT was said to be \u201cabove normal\u201d, while in Victoria \u201cabove-normal bushfire activity continues across the coastal and foothill forests of East Gippsland, extending into West Gippsland and the Great Dividing Range\u201d.</p> \n<p>It also highlighted the risks on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, which had \u201ca combination of drier than average and wetter than average conditions across the island which may result in above average fuel loads in parts\u201d.</p> \n<p>These were the areas that were ravaged by fires over Christmas and New year.</p> \n<p>EMA said it held a further nine briefings with defence department and other agencies that needed to be involved in the co-ordination between August and November.</p> \n<p>But for some reason the impending risk does not seem to have permeated into the executive or to cabinet.</p> \n<p>EMA\u2019s first briefings with ministers on preparedness for the bushfire season took place in November, and by then bushfires had already raged through parts of Queensland and northern NSW. It did not say who attended.</p> \n<p>The minister for emergency management, David Littleproud, issued <a href=\"https://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/davidlittleproud/Pages/emergency-workers-busy-summer.aspx\">three press releases</a> between August and November describing the coming bushfire season as \u201cchallenging\u201d, \u201ctough\u201d, \u201ctesting\u201d and \u201cabove average\u201d. But the gist of the releases was that communities needed to start getting organised, not what the federal government was doing.</p> \n<h2>Warnings \u2018fobbed off\u2019</h2> \n<p>Some who sought to warn the federal government early, such as the former NSW fire chief Greg Mullins, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/former-fire-chief-calls-out-pm-over-refusal-of-meeting/11705330\">felt they were fobbed off</a> by the federal government.</p> \n<p>As reported last year, Mullins \u2013 in his capacity as head of the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action \u2013 contacted the prime minister\u2019s office in April, seeking a meeting to outline the potential calamity he believed was looming.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of the fires, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7848239/Scott-Morrison-defends-decision-not-meet-former-fire-chiefs-saying-talks-current-ones.html\">Morrison has said</a> he didn\u2019t need to hear from former chiefs as the government could hear from the current ones. But Mullins has said it was precisely their \u201cex\u201d status that allowed them to speak freely both about bushfire preparedness and its link to climate change.</p> \n<p>Mullins\u2019s request was referred to the minister for energy and emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, in July.</p> \n<p>Taylor responded on 10 September, offering a date in October for a meeting in Sydney.</p> \n<p>Mullins immediately wrote back, saying it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d it had taken several months to receive an invitation and that the catastrophic conditions he and his fellow fire experts had predicted had now manifested.</p> \n<p>\u201cConsidering the gravity of the situation, a national response from the highest levels of the Australian government is required,\u201d Mullins wrote. He requested an urgent meeting with Morrison, Taylor, Littleproud, finance minister Matthias Cormann and any other ministers involved.</p> \n<p>Taylor replied that he had copied in Littleproud, and perhaps Mullins should seek a meeting with him.</p> \n<p>By then Mullins could see what was unfolding. In November he told the ABC how worried he was. He said he been \u201cfobbed off\u201d by the prime minister, and that Taylor was \u201cnot the right person to meet with\u201d.</p> \n<p>Finally a meeting took place with Littleproud and Taylor on 3 December.</p> \n<p>Mullins told the Guardian: \u201cIt was clear that there was never any intention by the PM to listen to us. We were treated with open contempt by the PM, who said he would deal with the current chiefs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe deputy prime minister [Michael McCormack] said we were time-wasters and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/nov/11/morrison-coalition-labor-bushfires-monday-politics-live?page=with:block-5dc87bde8f0867dcebfd254d#block-5dc87bde8f0867dcebfd254d\">those who talked about climate change and bushfires were latte-sipping greenies</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked in November why he did not meet Mullins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/scott-morrison-says-no-evidence-links-australias-carbon-emissions-to-bushfires\">Morrison said</a> the government already had advice from \u201cexisting fire chiefs doing the existing job\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/we-saw-it-coming-former-fire-commissioner-says-government-was-warned-on-bushfires-20191114-p53agj.html\">his office said</a> the Mullins group had been offered meetings with senior cabinet ministers \u201cseveral times this year\u201d.</p> \n<p>Documents released under freedom of information also show that Taylor did not ask his department for a briefing before the meeting with Mullins \u2013 the usual step for a minister.</p> \n<h2>Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday cited</h2> \n<p>A similar request to the then-Department of Environment and Energy reveals how little thought had been devoted in that portfolio to the potential impact of the bushfire season on the environment, threatened species and its relationship to climate change.</p> \n<p>One cabinet document was withheld, its subject unknown. The only other document produced was an assessment of what bushfires could do to the national electricity network.</p> \n<p>In December the department warned that the Forest Fire Danger Index was high around the electricity<strong> </strong> corridors for the Queensland-NSW interconnector and the NSW-Victoria interconnector, and that dust storms were possible, which could further threaten the transmission network.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe FDDI is tracking similar to those conditions preceding the Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday events,\u201d it warned.</p> \n<p>Emergency Management Australia said it activated the <a href=\"https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/emergency/files/plan-disaster-response.pdf\">COMDISPLAN</a> \u2013 which outlines how states could access non-financial assistance from the commonwealth during disasters \u2013 in early September 2019.</p> \n<p>It coordinated the first requests for commonwealth disaster assistance itself. The Australian defence forces became involved soon after, and by November had liaison officers in the NSW bushfire headquarters.</p> \n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/nsw-bushfires-state-of-tension-scomos-navy-call/news-story/1a9f4e2ea2e427e28997e78955fb2e71\">suggestions in the media</a> that NSW rebuffed help from the federal government, particularly around the use of Navy ships, during the crisis. </p> \n<p>There were clearly some communication problems.

  "<p>A New South Wales police officer has been placed on \u201crestricted duties\u201d and professional standards command is investigating after a video posted to social media showed the officer tripping an Indigenous teenager while arresting him, slamming the boy face-first on to bricks.</p> \n<p>The arrest occurred about 5.30pm on Monday in the inner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney\">Sydney</a> suburb of Surry Hills.</p> \n<p>A family member said the 16-year-old had to be taken by ambulance to hospital to receive X-rays after the arrest.</p> \n<p>One of the boy\u2019s relatives posted in the video caption that the boy was with friends in a park less than 100 metres from his home when the police arrested him for what she said was \u201cno reason at all\u201d.</p> \n<p>The police can be heard in the video talking to the group before the teenager was arrested.</p> \n<p>The police officer said \u201copen up your ears\u201d, to which someone off-camera replied: \u201cI don\u2019t need to open my ears, I\u2019ll crack you across the jaw, bro.\u201d</p> \n<p>The officer then began arresting the boy, using his leg to pull the teenager\u2019s feet from under him while his arms were held behind his back, causing the teenager to slam face-first into the bricks and garden bed.</p> \n<p>The boy could be heard groaning and whining in pain.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe is in pain, bro, I\u2019ve never heard that,\u201d said one of the group in the video.</p> \n<p>Another person off-camera shouted: \u201cYou just slammed him on the face!\u201d</p> \n<p>The relative said the boy had then been taken to the police station holding cells before being taken to St Vincent\u2019s hospital.</p> \n<p>The boy had sustained a bruised shoulder, cuts to his knee, face and elbow, and chipped teeth, she said.</p> \n<p>The relative told Guardian Australia X-rays revealed no broken bones, but the bruising was serious enough that he had to return to the doctor on Tuesday morning.</p> \n<p>The teenager\u2019s sister told the ABC he was \u201cdistraught\u201d and his teeth were damaged after the incident.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen he came back home later that night, he was shaken up,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very sore this morning.</p> \n<p>\u201cTeenagers, they\u2019re lippy, but you don\u2019t just abuse children because they\u2019re lippy.\u201d</p> \n<p>The teenager\u2019s parents and other relatives will speak about the incident at a press conference at the NSW Parliament on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>NSW Police confirmed the professional standards command was investigating the incident and said the constable involved had been placed on restricted duties.</p> \n<p>\u201cAbout 5pm [Monday], officers were patrolling Ward Park, Surry Hills, when they spoke with a group of teenagers.&nbsp;It\u2019s alleged a 17-year-old boy from the group threatened an officer, before being arrested and taken to Surry Hills Police Station,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. <br><br>\u201cHe was subsequently taken to St Vincent\u2019s Hospital for observation before being released into the custody of family pending further inquiries \u2026 Senior officers have met with the community and local elders and will keep them appraised throughout the process.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a press conference on Tuesday assistant&nbsp;commissioner Mick Willing refused to say whether he believed the level of force used by the officer during the incident was appropriate, or to explain why the officer had not been formally stood down during the investigation.</p> \n<p>Willing said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by the footage, but that he was \u201cequally concerned about others who may use this footage to inflame it and turn it into something it\u2019s not\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned that people will use this video, this footage, to create it into something it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all well aware of what\u2019s happening overseas but this is not the United States of America.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have very, very good relations with our local community and I\u2019m concerned that people will pre-empt the outcome of this investigation and draw conclusions prior to that outcome.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked why the group of boys had been stopped by officers, Willing said the officers had been \u201cattending an unrelated job\u201d when they had \u201ccome across\u201d the group and \u201cengaged them in conversation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Willing said he had watched the footage and was \u201cabsolutely\u201d concerned by it, but refused to comment on whether he thought it was appropriate for the officer to use force against the teen.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the investigation is about. It\u2019s about trying to identify whether the use of force was necessary in the circumstances. Now obviously police officers can use force lawfully so this investigation has been initiated to look at the circumstances around that and get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Solicitors from Redfern Legal Centre called for the investigation to be overseen by police watchdog the&nbsp;Law Enforcement Conduct Commission.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis type of policing is not only unacceptable but harmful and impacts community relationships and trust in the police,\u201d said Samantha Lee, a solicitor focusing on police accountability at the centre.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;\u201cRedfern Legal Centre believes the young man should seek immediate legal advice and is offering to assist.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dave Sharma, the Liberal MP for Wentworth, which is the neighbouring electorate to Surry Hills where the boy was arrested, tweeted that he was \u201calarmed and sickened\u201d by the video footage of the arrest.

  "<p>Eight states and Washington DC are holding primaries on Tuesday in the most <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/voting-by-mail-to-face-biggest-test-since-pandemic-started-11591003801\">widespread trial yet over </a>whether America can safely hold an election amid the pandemic and unrest as days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/02/george-floyd-protests-violence-overnight-donald-trump-threat-army-live-updates\">protest over the police killings of African Americans</a> continues.</p> <p>Election officials, who have been encouraging people to vote by mail, already faced an enormous challenge in providing access to voting while protecting public health against Covid-19. Now, they face an additional challenge of conducting an election that guarantees people can vote without risking their physical safety and without police intimidation as curfews clash with voting hours. </p> <p>One of the most closely watched states on Tuesday is Pennsylvania, a battleground state, where lawmakers are already seeing an unprecedented flood of requests for mail-in ballots. More than 1.8 million people have requested an absentee ballot so far; during the 2016 primary, just 84,000 people voted by mail.&nbsp;But some voters are still expected to cast a ballot in person, as well.</p> <p>Pennsylvania law requires voters to return their mail-in ballots to the polls by 8pm on election day. But on Monday evening Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, Tom Wolf, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-mail-ballot-deadline-extension-executive-order-20200601.html\">extended the deadline</a> for voters in six counties in the state to return their ballots, saying they could be counted if they were received in the next week and postmarked by Tuesday.</p> <p>That came after concern that some voters in the state might be disenfranchised because officials could not get them ballots in time. In Delaware county, just outside Philadelphia, elections officials <a href=\"https://www.delcopa.gov/publicrelations/releases/2020/primaryupdate_june1.html\">said Monday</a> they were mailing 6,000 ballots, the day before the election. The county conceded there were 400 ballots that won\u2019t be mailed \u201cdue to timing and staffing constraints\u201d.</p> <p>In Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, election officials have severely limited in-person voting locations because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Philadelphia, officials are monitoring whether they will have to change any of those few locations because of the recent protests, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/george-floyd-protests-philadelphia-pa-primary-election-20200601.html\">according to the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. At at least one voting location in Philadelphia, there were long lines on Tuesday morning as poll workers set up voting machines.</p> <p>Voting rights groups monitoring the elections throughout the country said they were fielding calls from voters reporting problems. In many states, voters reported not receiving mail-in ballot requests in time to vote.</p> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, about 500 people in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> had called in to an election protection hotline run by the groups, about half of the voters were seeking information about their polling location, Suzanne Almeida, the interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a watchdog group, told reporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Elaijuh/status/1267785942393401351\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lee Griffith, 35, is furious.

In Washington DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser <a href=\"https://wtop.com/dc/2020/06/sad-and-angry-after-destruction-mayhem-in-dc-during-protests/\">announced a 7p</a><a href=\"https://wtop.com/dc/2020/06/sad-and-angry-after-destruction-mayhem-in-dc-during-protests/\">m</a> curfew for Tuesday, but polls will be open until 8pm. As the curfew approached, there were still people in line who expected to wait for more than an hour. Bowser said Tuesday no one who was voting would be subject to the curfew.</p> <p>But there was confusion in the city as the day went on.</p> <p>Sherene Joseph was in line to vote at Hardy Middle School in the Georgetown neighborhood of DC just before curfew when a police car drove by twice used a loudspeaker to tell everyone they needed to go home. The announcement set off confusion, she said, and elections staff came out to talk to police and encouraged everyone to stay in line and a volunteer gave out \u201cI voted\u201d stickers for voters to show police.</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen again and the folks working there made it clear everyone in line that they would be able to vote,\u201d she wrote in an email.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267944250379055104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s the middle third of the line to vote in Columbia Heights. <a href=\"https://t.co/H1MSdWGvcW\">pic.twitter.com/H1MSdWGvcW</a></p>&mdash; Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267944250379055104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267941149844615168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So thousands of people are waiting in line to vote across DC, curfew starts in less than an hour, and poll workers are telling people they won\u2019t get arrested if they wear an \u201cI voted\u201d sticker. <br><br>That\u2019s cold comfort for many of these voters.</p>&mdash; Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267941149844615168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Some voters in DC said they never received their ballots and there were still long lines across the city on Tuesday.

  "<p>It has taken four series, multiple lineup tweaks and a channel hop, but this Great British Bake Off spin-off may have perfected its recipe at last. First, precisely measure out 12 teams, each consisting of two chefs, then serve up in two batches of six. Any more that that, and it becomes impossible to remember the contestants\u2019 faces, let alone invest emotionally in their \u201cgelatine control\u201d technique.&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, carefully fold in a pair of judges \u2013 Cherish Finden and Benoit Blin \u2013 who are as exacting as they are eccentric; then finish off with the able, amusing presenting duo of comedian Tom Allen and former GBBO contestant Liam Charles. Some may find the cheesy preshow presenters\u2019 sketch (a leftover from Mel and Sue\u2019s day) overpowers other flavours, but that\u2019s a matter for personal taste.</p> <p>The fifth series (the third on Channel 4) continued this week with a miniatures challenge that was ideal for any chefs given to cryptic self-expression. They had been tasked with making 24 identical<em> </em>millefeuilles, constructed from puff pastry and at least two cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re-like fillings, plus 24 illusion desserts. The latter, in Benoit\u2019s words, should be \u201cin the shape of an egg, but taste nothing like one\u201d.</p> <p>Some of the more intriguing efforts included Lexington Catering\u2019s chocolate-based take on Chinese delicacy \u201ccentury eggs\u201d (\u201cMore like three-and-half-hour eggs\u201d quipped Liam) and Park Plaza hotel\u2019s yolk made from a curd of sea buckthorn. No, me neither, but team leader Domenico informed us that it tastes \u201clike a kumquat, but more sour\u201d, which regular kumquat-quaffers will no doubt find very descriptive.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the ingredient lists that are telling, though. This format allows us to get to know the individual contestants in context as team members and, in some cases, bosses or skivvies. For all that The Professionals is often unfavourably compared with GBBO in its 2013-16 prime, or the more instantly appealing Junior Bake Off, it does bring to the table a deeper understanding of cookery science. And not just the chemistry bit, the psychology bit too.</p> <p>Teams with a traditional chef/sous-chef hierarchy can perform extremely well \u2013 the frontrunners so far, Domenico and Alessandra, have this dynamic \u2013 but it\u2019s the more equal partnerships that seem to demonstrate the most resilience in the face of setbacks. Does the solidarity engendered by Ryan and Clanny\u2019s matching barbershop fades (last week they had stars shaved in; this week it\u2019s diamonds) contribute to The Ivy\u2019s ability to bounce back from disappointment? Is Andrew and Ian\u2019s non-stop pop music punning the secret of The Lounge\u2019s unshakable morale? As ever, the proof is in those puddings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Or rather, in this case, the avian-themed <em>pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e</em> that they were instructed to make as this week\u2019s showpiece challenge. Having managed only eight illusion eggs out of the requested 24, proud Lancastrians Andrew and Ian decide to \u201cbring some northern attitude\u201d and redouble their efforts overnight. They also shrewdly declined to specify the bird species that would be perched atop their ambitious tower of nougatine and Paris-Brest choux pastries: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a swan, sometimes it\u2019s a dove \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s a penguin,\u201d Andrew coyly told the judges.</p> <p>That was actually among the more structurally sound of these constructions. Tracy and Moos, nougatine novices, decided to make their entire swan from the tricky, brittle stuff, while Domenico\u2019s addition of cappuccino flavouring to the classically French Paris-Brest risked provoking Benoit\u2019s patriotic indignation: \u201cSo we go to Brest, but with a small detour via Roma?\u201d</p> <p>The final five minutes is always a tense montage of trembling hands, sweating foreheads and swaying sugar-work, but this episode culminated in the almost unbearable tension of each team attempting to relocate their <em>pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e </em>from the work surfaces to the judging table without it crashing to the floor. As a glum Kristine commented: \u201cIt\u2019s literally whose is gonna fall apart first, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, isn\u2019t that what Bake Off: The Professionals is really all about? Not who makes the most most impressive edible structure, but who most effectively manages their stress throughout the painstaking process? Some people are cortisone-powered perfectionists, driven to excellence by their own nerves, while others own a cooling rack and know how to use it. The fact that many of us at home have also spent the last few months baking the pain away only makes these insights that much more timely.</p>",

He lamented the report\u2019s lack of practical guidance on how to better protect people of BAME origin.</p> <p>\u201cMore specifically, the report fails to mention the staggering higher proportion of BAME healthcare workers who have tragically died from Covid-19 \u2013 with more than 90% of doctors being from&nbsp;BAME backgrounds,\u201d Nagpaul added, and he also criticised PHE\u2019s report for not properly considering the occupations of BAME victims, exposure to the virus and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) as risk factors.</p> <p>A Health Service Journal report published on Tuesday night claimed that the government had removed a key part of the review. It said a section was missing that appeared in a draft version circulated last week with responses from more than 1,000 organisations and individuals, many of them suggesting that discrimination and poorer life chances played a part in greater Covid-19 risk for BAME Britons. PHE and the health department both denied the story. </p> <p>The greater vulnerability of people of colour to Covid-19 has been starkly illustrated in the death toll of NHS staff. About six in ten of the more than 200 who have died during the pandemic, including the first dozen doctors, were from BAME backgrounds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">according to a Guardian analysis</a>.</p> <p>At the daily Downing Street press conference on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, used his opening remarks to highlight the PHE report and explicitly link it to the unrest in the US caused by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of white police. But he offered no solutions to reduce the deaths of BAME people.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a particularly timely publication, because right across the world, people are angry about racial injustice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I get that.

  "<p>Where to start? If it wasn\u2019t already bad enough that the UK has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-50000-latest-official-figures-show\">highest mortality rate in Europe</a> and Dominic Cummings is given a free pass on his midnight flit to Durham and a 60-mile round trip eyesight test, the Tory government has now decided to turn the House of Commons into the world\u2019s worst theme park.

Before the Whitsun recess, the Commons had a perfectly serviceable hybrid participation procedure, along with a fully functional remote voting system, to enable parliament to operate during the coronavirus pandemic. But Jacob Rees-Mogg wasn\u2019t happy with that. Having spent several weeks trying to close down the Commons last year during the unlawful prorogation, the leader of the house has now decided he wants it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">make it as inaccessible for MPs as possible</a>.</p> \n<p>Anyone who is over 70, is pregnant or has health, childcare or travel issues is now effectively barred from parliament. With their constituents disenfranchised. Jakey likes to pretend to be the great parliamentarian \u2013 the master democrat steeped in centuries of tradition \u2013 but the reality is that Westminster is just a stage on which he gets to cosplay his public school fantasies in a suit that\u2019s several sizes too big for him. Ideally the only people he wants in the Commons are people just like him: MPs with large London houses, a private income and an inherited nanny.</p> \n<p>For reasons best know to himself \u2013 perhaps he had forgotten the chamber was still restricted to 50 MPs so he would still be basically on his own during prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 Boris Johnson chose to indulge Jakey\u2019s perversions by turning the vote into a three-line whip for Tory MPs. And as most of them are barely sensate lobby fodder with no mind of their own, they duly obliged by voting to deny other MPs a vote. Not for the first time in the past few weeks, the UK was putting on a good show of acting like a banana republic.</p> \n<p>Still, at least we got to enjoy the spectacle of Tory MPs having to suffer the humiliation of waiting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\">43 minutes in a queue that snaked round Westminster Hall and back into Portcullis House</a>. I shouldn\u2019t think Jakey and Liam Fox can remember the last time they had to queue for anything. And even when they got to the front, dozens could barely manage to blurt out their names and what they were voting for. Tory Stephen Crabb first went down the \u201cno\u201d side while shouting aye, before changing direction and heading for the \u201caye\u201d side where he promptly said no.</p> \n<p>It was low comedy performed by a cast of Tory grotesques who couldn\u2019t even manage to observe the basics of physical distancing. As if they believed themselves immune to a disease that had already killed 60,000 people \u2013 with a lot of help from their own government \u2013 by virtue of their own importance. Some at least had the grace to look slightly ashamed to be participating in this profoundly undemocratic land grab but Maria Miller appeared unrepentant. Until earlier this year, Miller had been chair of the women and equalities committee but was now more than happy to trample all over those whom she used to pretend to care about. How she sleeps at night is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately for the opposition MPs and the handful of Tory MPs with a conscience, they also had to participate in the farce. Not once but twice, as the government had to first see off an amendment tabled by the Tory chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, that proposed to maintain the hybrid status quo until the end of the summer. Some managed to maintain a modicum of good humour first time round, but as the exercise in futility extended towards the 90-minute mark many began to look seriously pissed off and their votes were cast with a definite edge in their voice. Kevin Brennan spat out the words \u201cMogg shambles\u201d.</p> \n<p>Then the voting merely reflected the nature of the debate. Only this time we were seeing the \u201cone rule for the elite, another for the rest of us\u201d enshrined in law. It\u2019s government policy for people to still work from home wherever possible, and here was Jakey and the rest of the cabinet actively making it impossible for MPs to work from home. If the government can treat its co-workers that badly, just imagine the contempt it has for the rest of us. Lou Reed had it about right. Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I\u2019ll piss on them. Your poor huddled masses, let\u2019s club them to death.</p> \n<p>But it was all just water off Jakey and Boris\u2019s back: Jakey even joked about the similarities to Alton Towers by telling MPs he had taken his sister Stigmata to the theme park. An opportunity for a cynical erosion of parliamentary democracy had been there for the taking and they hadn\u2019t been able to refuse a gift horse. There had to be an upside of the coronavirus somewhere and it could make Brexit a little less hassle. And the donkeys had just gone along with it. From now on, every vote will be a 45-minute conga, with at least a hundred or more MPs effectively excluded. The Tories have effectively taken us from a modern voting system to one that would have been rejected in the Middle Ages.</p> \n<p>If I was an opposition MP, I\u2019d tell any Tory asking for a pair to sod off. Make them all turn up and pray for the wettest June on record.&nbsp;Let it rain. Let them get soaked three times a day as the rest of the world sniggers at us. We used to pride ourselves on having the Mother of Parliaments. We\u2019ve now just voted for the Mother of all Fuck-Ups.</p>",
  "<p>On the morning after the general election, Boris Johnson told the country that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50777071\" title=\"\">parliament must change</a>\u201d. No legislature can be expected to be preserved in aspic. There is a need for our systems of governance to be made more pluralistic and representative. However, Mr Johnson has seized an opportunity in a crisis to concentrate power rather than diffuse it. The end of online voting and the quelling of parliamentary debate will reduce the Commons to a rubber stamp for whatever Mr Johnson wants.</p> <p>What is being done away with for the next month is effectively the pivotal role assigned to parliament: the scrutiny that improves the quality of government, which, given <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a803fd4-a3e6-11ea-81ac-4854aed294e5\" title=\"\">the economic and public health emergencies</a> facing the country, has never been needed more. Since early May, a hybrid parliament has been operating. MPs debated proposed laws and voted in virtual divisions. This was considered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-hybrid-parliament-unfinished-business\" title=\"\">imperfect</a> but makeshift arrangement necessary to observe the social distancing guidelines. These rules, instituted to save lives, have not changed.</p> <p>Yet the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/mps-back-westminster-government-parliament\" title=\"\">decided</a> to end remote voting and online interventions in debates. Ministers want only a few dozen MPs in the parliamentary chamber to ask questions, and those who wish to vote must queue up to cast their vote in person at the dispatch box. MPs who have been advised to stay home and shield can no longer take part in debates or votes and will have to rely on their whips to find opponents to pair with. It is wrong that parliament should proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person.</p> <p>The system was given a dry run on Tuesday \u2013 and was <a href=\"https://news.trust.org/item/20200602163908-rfo4w/\" title=\"\">hardly an advert</a> for parliamentary oversight. Instead of a digital voting system in which all MPs could be involved, we have a ludicrous queueing system in which only two-thirds of parliamentarians can participate. Online voting took 15 minutes, its replacement three times as long. That the new system is slower, more dangerous and less inclusive undermines ministers\u2019 argument that the previous one was not fast enough to deal with the volume of legislation.</p> <p>One suspects that there will now be fewer votes scheduled, which is a step back for democracy. Ministers evidently see no loss in the absent MPs unable to participate in debates on legislation. The message is very clear: we are dealing with a cabinet that is responsive at a stretch to the ruling party, but not to the Commons. Parliamentary democracy is fragile and can easily be disrupted if a powerful group of its members does not accept its rules.</p> <p>A government that controls parliament can suppress information or inquiries which are to its disadvantage, sometimes by refusing to supply information. Team Johnson appears to be both scornful and fearful of scrutiny \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-sacrifices-top-scientific-advisers-on-altar-of-classic-dom\" title=\"\">silencing</a> scientists who might depart from the script during the damaging Dominic Cummings affair and delaying the publication of the last intelligence and security committee report on Russia.

A system was in place that allowed MPs to vote, speak and represent their constituents. In rescinding that, the government has left many voters unrepresented. Mr Johnson betrays a view of the lower chamber as a bystander in governance. A vigilant, inquiring and effective Commons is essential to prevent the misuse of formidable powers in a pandemic. It is extremely bad news for the country that Mr Johnson does not want such a parliament.</p>",
  "<p>The publication of Public Health England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\" title=\"\">report</a> on the impact of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic Britons gave us further confirmation of what has become increasingly obvious. Throughout the epidemic, as the faces of black and Asian doctors, nurses and transport workers have regularly appeared on the pages of newspapers and on our television screens, it has been clear that a disproportionate death toll is being exacted among Britain\u2019s ethnic minorities.</p> <p>The PHE inquiry provides the statistics behind that impression: black and Asian ethnic groups, it found, were all significantly more likely to die with Covid-19 than those from a white British background. People from the Bangladeshi community face twice the risk of dying from Covid-19. One of the earliest tropes to be discarded during this crisis was the notion that the virus \u201cdid not discriminate\u201d. In the wake of this report, it is now incumbent on the government to reflect and act on the evidence that it does \u2013 and to a large degree.</p> <p>We still do not know all the reasons for the disparities uncovered by the report, and it comes with caveats. Strangely, the study failed to take into account occupation, comorbidities or obesity levels. Other research has shown that this significantly reduces the difference in risks and outcomes between ethnic groups. A number of complex and interlocking factors are in play here. But over the past three months, there is no doubt that we have collectively witnessed a graphic real-time illustration of the potentially lethal impact of social inequality. BAME Britons, who are more likely to be lower-paid, live in poorer accommodation and be employed in public-facing jobs, are running the greatest risk during this crisis.</p> <p>On Tuesday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, denied that publication of the report had been held back because of sensitivities surrounding the death of George Floyd in America. But the timing inescapably foregrounds wider issues that require a proper response from the government. Hours before Mr Hancock spoke to MPs, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, issued a <a href=\"https://www.wionews.com/world/us-protests-highlight-inequalities-and-endemic-racial-discrimination-un-rights-chief-michelle-bachelet-302667\" title=\"\">damning statement</a> in which she said the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities, in the US, the UK and elsewhere, shone a light on \u201calarming\u201d levels of inequality that have been ignored for too long.</p> <p>Ms Bachelet called for urgent steps to be taken to prioritise monitoring and testing, and to give targeted information to minority communities. The Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, has repeatedly called for similar action in Britain. New practical guidance is now urgently required, as the British Medical Association made clear in its response to the report.</p> <p>Public health is not merely a scientific affair to be left to epidemiologists and virologists; it is undermined by the marginalisation, stress and poverty that often come with racial discrimination. Addressing this must be part of any post-pandemic social settlement, as the country draws appropriate lessons from a time that has exposed fault lines in a way which must not be forgotten. But more immediately, Mr Hancock must do more than tell the House of Commons, as <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/coronavirus-matt-hancock-echoes-activist-slogan-whilst-discussing-bame-covid-deaths-11999215\" title=\"\">he did</a> on Tuesday, that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d. He must act on those words.</p>",
  "<p>Civil rights leaders have criticised Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to take no action against a Facebook post from Donald Trump appearing to threaten to start shooting \u201clooters\u201d, after a Monday night meeting with the company\u2019s executives ended in acrimony.</p> <p>\u201cWe are disappointed and stunned by Mark\u2019s incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,\u201d Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robison said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump\u2019s call for violence against protesters.</p> <p>\u201cMark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>The three activist leaders \u2013 the heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Color of Change \u2013 met Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, on Monday night. They discussed Trump\u2019s Thursday night post, which urged the military to intervene in Minneapolis with the words \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The message, originally sent by Trump as a tweet before being cross-posted to Facebook, was restricted on Twitter after the platform decided it broke rules about glorifying violence. On Facebook, Zuckerberg&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">personally intervened to leave the message up</a>, arguing that the company has a policy to allow warnings of the use of force by state actors.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s decision led to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/01/facebook-workers-rebel-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump\">virtual walkout</a>\u201c of Facebook staff on Monday, with hundreds of employees downing tools in protest. A number of Facebook employees publicly expressed their dissent on rival social networks such as Twitter, and were quickly supported by senior managers at the company.</p> <p>At least one employee has quit over the decision. Timothy J Aveni, a software engineer who worked on misinformation, said on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/timothy.j.aveni/posts/3006224359465567\">Facebook</a> that he had resigned on Monday. \u201cMark told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,\u201d Aveni wrote. \u201cHe showed us on Friday that was a lie ... Facebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponized hatred, is on the wrong side of history.\u201d</p> <p>A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe recognise the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership.\u201d </p> <p>The company would not require walkout participants to take paid time off, Facebook said.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Monday night, fresh detail about those internal discussions emerged, after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/1/21276969/facebook-walkout-mark-zuckerberg-audio-trump-disgust-twitter\">the Verge obtained recordings</a>&nbsp;of Zuckerberg speaking at an internal meeting on Friday night.</p> <p>\u201cHow to handle this post from the president has been very tough,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve been struggling with basically all day, ever since I woke up \u2026 This has been personally pretty wrenching for me.</p> <p>\u201cMy first reaction [to Trump\u2019s post] was just disgust,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not how I think we want our leaders to show up during this time. This is a moment that calls for unity and calmness and empathy for people who are struggling.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg also told employees Facebook would review the policies that allowed Trump\u2019s post to stay up. \u201cThere is a real question coming out of this, which is whether we want to evolve our policy around the discussion of state use of force. Over the coming days, as the National Guard is now deployed, probably the largest one that I would worry about would be excessive use of police or military force. I think there\u2019s a good argument that there should be more bounds around the discussion around that.\u201d</p> <p>The Facebook walkout was followed by sanctioned events at other technology companies. A number of YouTube executives, including the company\u2019s chief business officer and its global head of music, told their teams they could take Tuesday off to participate in the protests,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">according to </a><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">the Information</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-06-01/spotify-stands-with-the-black-community-in-the-fight-against-racism-and-injustice/\">Spotify followed suit</a>, encouraging employees to join the day of action \u201cby taking time to reflect and educate themselves\u201d.</p> <p>The decision on whether to allow Trump\u2019s posts to remain on Facebook could be one of the final major calls made solely by Zuckerberg. The company recently confirmed the creation of an independent Oversight Board of academics, politicians and former journalists from around the world who will act as as a \u201csupreme court\u201d deciding what content should be allowed on Facebook, while providing guidance on policy.</p> <p>Members of the Oversight Board met on Tuesday afternoon and discussed the issue but the organisation is reluctant to start wading in to debates before it is up-and-running. It is due to be fully functional by the autumn - towards the end of the current US presidential election campaign.</p> <p>Members declined to give any detail what was discussed on&nbsp;Tuesday, although a spokesperson for the Oversight Board suggested Trump\u2019s posts are the sort of issue they will rule on in the future: \u201cThere are many significant issues relating to online content that we recognise people want the board to consider. We\u2019re working hard to set the board up to begin operating later this year so it can start considering cases referred by users and Facebook. We will make decisions without regard to Facebook\u2019s economic, political or reputational interests, in a fair, transparent and politically neutral manner.\u201d</p> <p>Twitter\u2019s decision to restrict the Trump tweet \u2013 which was followed by a Trump executive order aimed at reducing the platform\u2019s protections against civil claims \u2013 won the backing of the European commission.</p> <p>The EU executive branch\u2019s vice-president, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, said in her response to the dispute that politicians should answer \u201ccriticism with facts, not with threats and attacks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI support Twitter in their efforts to develop and implement a transparent, clear and consistent moderation policy,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said. \u201cThis is not about censorship. This is about flagging verifiably false or misleading information that may cause public harm, linking to reliable information, or flagging content violating their policies.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels</em></p>",

The Conservatives made a clear commitment to address this in their election manifesto, he said. And he said that work on this issue had continued during the coronavirus crisis. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the positive things amid the terrible things that have happened during this crisis is that people have recognised social care and just how important it is.</p> <p>We need to follow that up with reforms to the way social care is supported and make sure more people get that dignity in their older age, and that people of working age get the support they need \u2026<br></p> <p>I am determined to push forward the social care reforms that I know so many [people] are interested in.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when pressed as to when the plans would appear, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the timeframe has been clear, which is that we have got to get these reforms done in this parliament and the prime minister has previously said we will get them set out this year.</p> <p>That was before coronavirus. We will still try to do that but it is not straightforward.</p> </blockquote> <p>A delay until 2021 would be hugely embarrassing for Boris Johnson. On the day he became prime minister in July last year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019\">in his speech in Downing Street,</a> he implied he had a policy that was all set to be implemented (\u201coven-ready\u201d, to use the phrase he applied in a different context). He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock declared that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d as he stressed the importance of addressing why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus - while failing to announce any concrete proposals.</strong> Earlier, the government published the Public Health England report into why BAME people and other demographic groups are more at risk from coronavirus. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033#block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033\">12.56pm.)</a> Referring to the report, Hancock used the slogan championed by the eponymous US-based human rights group. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice. And I get that. Black lives matter.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2#block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2\">2.04pm.)</a> The actual regulations have only received minimal parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpO7XzpNa8DyxZsWNgckexHeezN1PYR1/view\">a letter (pdf)</a> to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, the <strong>Good Law Project </strong>claims this is illegal. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the emergency procedure under section 45R of the 1984 act to be used, a minister must declare that s/he \u201cof the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved\u201d. This provision must be interpreted in the light of the authorities referred to above which confirm parliamentary accountability as a fundamental constitutional principle ...</p> <p>We simply do not understand how the amendment regulations were so urgent that it was not possible to put them to votes in both houses. There was no justification for parliamentary accountability to be jettisoned. It is inconceivable that parliament, when passing the 1984 act, would have conceived that the emergency procedure would be used repeatedly in order to avoid parliamentary accountability over the course of months.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is not unusual to hear lawyers make arguments like this, but Hancock might be advised to take it seriously. It is run by <strong>Jolyon Maugham</strong> QC and it was one of the parties involved in the successful attempt to get the supreme court last year to rule Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation illegal.</p> <p>Maugham is not taking Hancock to court - yet. But <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/news/it-is-not-good-enough/\">he reserves the right to do so.</a> In its letter the Good Law Project says it supports the aim of the lockdown. But it says that restrictions as sweeping as this should not be introduced via a mechanism that does not allow full parliamentary scrutiny, and it says it might launch a legal challenge using judicial review if Hancock tries to amend the lockdown again using the 1984 act.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T16:15:17.168Z\">at 5.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed671728f08f5e3730132b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:39:46.079Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Further 324 Covid-19 deaths in UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 324 people have died after contracting Covid-19, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed, taking the UK\u2019s official coronavirus death toll across all settings to 39,369.</p> <p>Another 1,653 people have tested positive for the virus, with 277,985 people having now tested positive since the start of the outbreak. </p> <p>A total of 135,643 tests were carried out yesterday, 7,000 more than the previous day.

People of BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad, which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services that are created by, for example, cultural and language differences.</p> <p>Secondly, people of BAME communities are also likely to be at increased risk of poorer outcomes once they acquire the infection. For example, some comorbidities which increase the risk of poorer outcomes from Covid-19 are more common among certain ethnic groups. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani background have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than people from White British ethnicity, and people of black Caribbean and black African ethnicity have higher rates of hypertension compared with other ethnic groups. Data from the National Diabetes Audit suggests that type II diabetes prevalence is higher in people from BAME communities.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:10:28.610Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63e498f084df971c8e304\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/haroonsiddique\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:56:57.797Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The delayed report into into why black, Asian and minority ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">has just been published.</a></p> <p>It says, after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region: \u201cPeople of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death when compared to people of white British ethnicity.

It examines how coronavirus affects different demographic groups. It runs to 89 pages and it is<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\"> here (pdf).</a></p> <p>There has been particular focus on what it will say about why BAME people are so much more at risk. This is what it says on this in the summary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People from black ethnic groups were most likely to be diagnosed. Death rates from Covid-19 were highest among people of black and Asian ethnic groups. This is the opposite of what is seen in previous years, when the mortality rates were lower in Asian and black ethnic groups than white ethnic groups. Therefore, the disparity in Covid-19 mortality between ethnic groups is the opposite of that seen in previous years. </p> <p>An analysis of survival among confirmed Covid-19 cases and using more detailed ethnic groups, shows that after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black ethnicity had between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British. </p> <p>These analyses did not account for the effect of occupation, comorbidities or obesity. These are important factors because they are associated with the risk of acquiring Covid-19, the risk of dying, or both. Other evidence has shown that when comorbidities are included, the difference in risk of death among hospitalised patients is greatly reduced.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what the summary says about comorbidities (underlying health conditions).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Among deaths with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, a higher percentage mentioned diabetes, hypertensive diseases, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia than all cause death certificates. </p> <p>Diabetes was mentioned on 21% of death certificates where Covid-19 was also mentioned. This finding is consistent with other studies that have reported a higher risk of death from Covid-19 among patients with diabetes. This proportion was higher in all BAME groups when compared to white ethnic groups and was 43% in the Asian group and 45% in the black group. The same disparities were seen for hypertensive disease. </p> <p>Several studies, although measuring the different outcomes from Covid-19, report an increased risk of adverse outcomes in obese or morbidly obese people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:28:57.268Z\">at 1.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63d5a8f087122eca5408f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:55:31.889Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sturgeon concluded her speech by rejecting suggestions one-metre distancing is enough to stop the spread of Covid-19. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might be reading or hearing in the media today some voices saying that one metre is sufficient, so I want to take the opportunity today to say the clear and strong advice from the Scottish government is to stay two metres apart from those in other households. </p> </blockquote> <p>She reiterated that people shouldn\u2019t meet up with more than one household, only once a day, and there should never be more than eight people in a group. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63c0d8f084df971c8e2ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:51:15.153Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>During her speech today, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> paid tribute to unpaid carers and volunteers.</p> <p>She said that an additional \u00a3230 payment to those eligible for the <strong>carer\u2019s allowance supplement</strong> - to help cover the strain of the coronavirus pandemic - will be paid automatically at the end of this month.</p> <p>The carer\u2019s allowance supplement, worth \u00a3460 a year, is paid to 83,000 people in Scotland.</p> <p>She also acknowledged that it is Volunteers\u2019 Week and said the efforts of volunteers are more important than ever during this period.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:53:23.293Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed638dc8f084df971c8e2b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:39:16.345Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest coronavirus numbers from <strong>Scotland</strong> as the first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> begins her daily press conference.</p> <p>As of 9am this morning:</p> <ul> <li>There have been a 53 further confirmed cases, taking the total to 15,471 positive cases.

Ferguson was appearing with three other academics. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05#block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05\">10.10am.)</a> At no point was he asked, or did he allude to, the circumstances that led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">his resignation from Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a>, although at one point in his evidence, when speaking about care homes, he did sound like someone holding back strong views about government ministers. (When Ferguson resigned from Sage, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/government-scientists-lockdown-breach-a-matter-for-the-police-says-speechless-matt-hancock\">seemed to relish denouncing him.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Ferguson said that he expected coronavirus levels to remain \u201crelatively flat\u201d as the lockdown was gradually eased over the summer but that it was \u201cvery unclear\u201d what would happen in September, when a fuller relaxation is expected.</strong> He implied a second spike was a real possibility. Asked what would happen, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the key issues is how much will relaxation of current controls lead to potential increases in transmission. I should say that it is not clear that it automatically will do so. But most of the modelling would suggest that we might get a small increase, but it\u2019s very unclear whether that will lead to the reproduction number being [above 1] ....</p> <p>I suspect, though, under any scenario that levels of transmission, and numbers of cases, will remain relatively flat between now and September - short of very big policy changes, or behavioural changes in the community.</p> <p>The real uncertainty is if there are larger policy changes in September, as we move into the time of year when respiratory viruses tend to transmit slightly better, what will happen then? And that remains very unclear. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that experts underestimated the extent of coronavirus in the UK in February, and that helped to explain why the death rate was higher than hoped</strong>. He said the experts had not realised how much infection was coming from Spain. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing the genetic data is showing us now is most chains of transmission still existing in the UK originated from Spain, to some extent Italy. We have been worrying about importations, infections from China - we\u2019re a very well connected country in the world, other Asian countries, the US - but it is clear that before we were even in a position to measure it, before surveillance systems were even set up, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals coming into the country in late February and early March from that area. And that meant that the epidemic was further ahead than we had anticipated.</p> <p>That explains some of the acceleration of policy then. It also explains, to some extent, why mortality figures ended up being higher than we had hoped.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was \u201cshocked\u201d at how bad countries around the world had been at protecting people in care homes.</strong> He was not talking specifically about the UK, but he was not omitting it either.

</p> <p>Flights will be at a lower frequency than normal, meaning the airline will operate at around 30% of its normal capacity between July and September. </p> <p>EasyJet previously announced it would resume operations on 15 June, but flights will mainly be restricted to domestic routes in the UK and France. </p> <p>A series of new safety measures will be introduced by the airline, including

Opposition parties want to retain electronic voting. But the vote on this issue will be resolved this afternoon by an \u201cin person\u201d vote. Social distancing rules do not allow MPs to congregate in the division lobbies, as they used to do pre-Covid, and instead they will have to form a long, socially-distanced queue.

MPs who are able to go in and vote will be able to show off to their constituents, like Giant Haystacks in the wrestling ring, yet those MPs who genuinely cannot come back to Westminster, will face questions from local residents why they are not voting, have to explain their personal circumstances, which may be uncomfortable for them to do, and, see their voting record trashed in the internet league tables.

  "<p>Run the Jewels have enjoyed one of the more improbable rises to fame in recent hip-hop history. Two figures nearing 40, from the genre\u2019s margins \u2013 Killer Mike on the fringes of Outkast\u2019s Atlanta-based circle of rappers and producers, his partner El-P a founder member of Company Flow and longstanding critical darling of east coast underground rap \u2013 who pooled their resources to record a mixtape. They gave it away and watched, astonished, as it and its two successors became runaway successes.</p> \n<p>It happened despite the fact that their music \u2013 political, angry, more about lyrics than hooks \u2013 is grounded in the golden age hip-hop of Public Enemy and EPMD, and swims against the genre\u2019s prevalent trends. Yet for all they profess a certain mystification over Run the Jewels\u2019 success, it\u2019s hard to avoid the feeling that they\u2019re the right band for the moment: an alternately surreal and furious response to a world spinning bizarrely, horribly out of control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1b0a8c5c-44b0-420c-914e-ff68aaace720\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKc1o5mJVnQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The key moment in their history may have been the night in 2014 they played St Louis hours after the announcement that the police officer Darren Wilson would not face charges after shooting an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Every other gig in the city was cancelled, but Run the Jewels performed. Mike addressed the audience beforehand, his voice breaking with emotion as he talked about his fears for his children.</p> \n<p>Footage of his speech went viral.<strong> </strong>Now, another of his speeches, made in horrifyingly similar circumstances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/killer-mike-you-have-a-duty-not-to-burn-your-own-house-down-video\">has gone viral again</a>.<strong> </strong>I speak to the pair two days after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-chief-medaria-arradondo-officers-complicit\">Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for nine minutes</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-chief-medaria-arradondo-officers-complicit\"> as he complained he could not breathe</a>. Rioting had yet to spread from Minneapolis across the US, but the lyrics of Walking in the Snow \u2013 a track from their forthcoming album, RTJ4, that references the 2014 death of Eric Garner \u2013 have already taken on a terrible new currency: \u201cAnd you so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me / Till my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 / And you sit there in the house on the couch and watch it on TV / The most you give\u2019s a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy.\u201d</p> \n<p>After our meeting, Mike\u2019s op-ed for the daily news website Colorlines is published, under his real name, Mike Render,&nbsp;encouraging \u201cpeople who look like me\u201d to \u201ctake seriously their second amendment rights \u2026 The only person you can count on to protect yourself and your family is you \u2026 I encourage gun ownership to my wife, my son and daughters, your sons and daughters and all black people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/atlanta-police-chief-erika-shields-george-floyd-protest\">rioting spreads to Atlanta</a>, he appears at a press conference with the city\u2019s mayor, fighting back tears as he gives an extraordinary, eloquent speech. \u201cIt is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with the enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is your duty to fortify your own house so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organisation. Now is the time to plot, plan, strategise, organise and mobilise \u2026 we don\u2019t want to see Targets burning, we want to see the system that sets up for systemic racism burnt to the ground.\u201d The speech struck such a chord that there are calls for Mike to run for office: \u201cKiller Mike is a leader I hope to vote for one day,\u201d offers the comedian Sarah Silverman.</p> \n<p>All that is to come, but the sentiment is mirrored in our interview. On rioting, he says: \u201cIt feels like nobody gives a shit when you\u2019re black. That\u2019s why you burn down your own community, not because you want to burn down your own community, but because you feel like nobody gives a shit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5990bf87e1bc7cb0e51aad417d8ff143847714ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5990bf87e1bc7cb0e51aad417d8ff143847714ea/0_0_2604_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Killer Mike and El-P on stage in London in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Killer Mike and El-P on stage in London in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katja Ogrin/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cYou know, I used to wonder: why did rock\u2019n\u2019roll guys tear up their hotel room? Well, you\u2019ve never had the exhilaration of entertaining thousands of people, then going back to your room alone, away from your wife and children and family \u2013 coupled with drugs and anxiety; you might tear up a room. Now that we\u2019ve had to sit in our houses for 60 days, I think people can kind of understand that. Doesn\u2019t make it right. Doesn\u2019t make rioting right.\u201d</p> \n<p>The media reporting on protests doesn\u2019t help this feeling that the killing of black people doesn\u2019t trouble the majority, he says. \u201cIt really does feel like nobody gives a shit, even when they do, because the media is \u2026 not going to tell you that there were white people on the ground and black people on the ground, different races and sexes. </p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to preach separation, they\u2019re going to preach fear, conservatism v liberalism \u2013 they\u2019re going to keep stoking those fires. So, we have some action to do now. Giving a shit is the first phase: now let\u2019s progress it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, El-P, real name Jaime Meline, is optimistic that this could be time of real change \u2013 and that the status quo may be tilting. \u201cI want the oppressors, the enemy, to know that they haven\u2019t created complete hopelessness yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI want motherfuckers to know that there are people from every cultural line that are ultimately not going to accept this.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them to think they are off the hook. I look at these riots and I see white people, black people, Asians, women and men \u2013 and I know this shit is coming to a head. It\u2019s getting to the point where your whole system of racism does not apply any more to the spiritual and mental mindset of the new generation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have outgrown you, despite your best efforts to keep us in the same place. You are in power, but you are outmoded. You\u2019re the old form of human. And the new form is coming for your neck.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking over Zoom \u2013 Mike at home in Atlanta, El-P in New York \u2013 the pair say the way the coronavirus pandemic has been handled in the US is shocking, if not surprising. El-P offers up a customarily colourful analogy to explain the way it has been politicised and used to stoke division. \u201cI\u2019ve had this conversation with Mike a bunch of times. Mike has said to me: \u2018I just want aliens to advance so we can all bond together,\u2019 and I\u2019m here to tell you, Mike, that\u2019s not going to happen! The aliens have invaded, and guess what? We didn\u2019t come together!</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably depressing. I\u2019ve never thought in my life that I&nbsp;would see someone politicise a virus. But I should have known, because I saw Aids ravage the gay community and my friends, my parents, lost dozens and dozens of good friends. The same lineage of politician was in office and they completely ignored the people they considered to be the fringes of society.\u201d</p> \n<p> In 2018, Run the Jewels had elected to take a sabbatical after, as Mike puts it, \u201ceight years on the road\u201d. The pair were \u201cexhausted, not only as performers, but a little bit as friends, too,\u201d says El-P, a striking admission given their celebrated bromance. Interviewing them over Zoom, you notice how the pair finish each other\u2019s sentences, and frequently seem to be addressing each other as much as me. \u201cWell, whatever minuscule issues that might have been there are magnified,\u201d El-P nods, \u201cbecause you\u2019re living together on a bus for a year and a half, so you end up wanting to strangle your friend. You wake up and think: \u2018How can I kill you and get away with it? How can I kill you, but still be in the group?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b699f49e978ae6dac7b6b2ccfc366f4b5d25a370\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b699f49e978ae6dac7b6b2ccfc366f4b5d25a370/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike campaigning with Bernie Sanders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike (left) campaigning with Bernie Sanders.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mike became a political pundit, activist, TV star and a loud advocate for the presidential candidacy of Bernie Sanders (who was photographed making Run the Jewels\u2019 signature hand gesture \u2013 one hand cocked in imitation of a pistol, the other clenched in a fist).</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I learned from [campaigning with Sanders] is that it\u2019s all about money,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMoney has totally rotted and corrupted our system, and, more than that, we\u2019ve grown so apathetic that we are not beating their heads on a local level to change that. I\u2019m hoping that, within my lifetime, we\u2019ll see a change in that.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also pursued a TV career. His hilarious and thought-provoking Netflix show, Trigger Warning, saw him attempting to get members of the Crips and Bloods gangs to market their own brand of soda and to start a new religion based around worshipping a friend of his, nicknamed Sleep.</p> \n<p>El-P, meanwhile, wrote the soundtrack for Capone, the acclaimed Tom Hardy movie about the gangster\u2019s decline into dementia. When they reconvened, in the hallowed environs of New York\u2019s Electric Ladyland and Miami\u2019s Shangri-La studios, \u201cwith Bruce Springsteen sauntering by to take a leak and being nice to us, and Rick Rubin coming in and doing yoga and giving us comments\u201d, they found themselves making a noticeably different album.</p> \n<p>Their previous record, RTJ3, was completed before Trump\u2019s presidency began, and was, says Mike, \u201ca blue record, like Picasso mourning the death of a friend \u2026 There were times in the last record when I was set to go to the studio and record, and I would turn on the news and see another black man has been murdered on our streets and I\u2019d just break: \u2018El, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t come today.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Its successor has a less elegiac energy. \u201cWith this record, you know how life pushes you on your hands the first time, you sit there for a minute like, \u2018Goddamn, what the fuck?\u2019 You\u2019re fearful of living? Then you get up and you run. You run towards the anger and the danger and the wild frenetic good times that is hip-hop.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was the spirit of this record: we\u2019re going to tighten up, we\u2019re going to hardcore, people will think we\u2019re going to become some emo band but that\u2019s not what we are. We\u2019re Run the Jewels \u2026 we\u2019ll punch you in the face.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If anything, it\u2019s a source of mild discomfort to us that our music is seemingly relevant</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>And so the beats are markedly harder, the contrast between the righteous fury of their sociopolitical rhymes and those that deal with goofy \u201cstupid shit\u201d \u2013 which is as much a part of their appeal as their more serious side \u2013<strong> </strong>more starkly pronounced.</p> \n<p>\u201cLiterally, we were looking up from the table,\u201d says El-P, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, here I\u2019m talking about a cat shitting on my carpet and Mike\u2019s talking about shooting a poodle, and then in the next song we\u2019ve got [Rage Against the Machine\u2019s vocalist] Zack de la Rocha talking about police brutality.\u2019 You\u2019re hearing who we really are.

We agree that it\u2019s funny to talk wildly about obviously ridiculous over-the-top violence towards a poodle.\u201d</p> \n<p>For their music\u2019s apparent currency, Mike says he isn\u2019t sure about the \u201cright band for the times\u201d line. \u201cWhen I rap, I\u2019m not reacting to the time, I\u2019m just rapping about the societal conditions.

But his route was very different and went through Lafayette Square</a>. Moments before, peaceful protesters, priests and families among them, had been assaulted by national guardsmen and federal officers: gassed, shot with rubber bullets, forcefully cleared from the president\u2019s path.</p> \n<p>With a small group of aides, his daughter Ivanka among them, the president walked to St John\u2019s, the so-called Church of the Presidents, to be photographed by the press, holding aloft a Bible.</p> \n<p>The president had ordered an assault on his own citizens, in order to stage a PR stunt. Like many momentous decisions in an extraordinary presidency, it was a call made on the hoof.</p> \n<p>George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">killed by police in Minneapolis</a> on Memorial Day, 25 May, just a week before.

Trump used it to taunt political opponents, rant about the need to dominate protesters, call for mass arrests and threaten to call in the army. Tellingly, he said: \u201cWashington was under good control, but we\u2019re gonna have it under much more control \u2026 we\u2019re gonna clamp down very, very strong.\u201d</p> \n<p>The call promptly leaked to media outlets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">the Guardian among them</a>.</p> \n<p>As controversy spread, according to the Axios website, advisers \u201chotly debated\u201d whether Trump should finally address the nation.

Finally, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267580557141184513\">tweeted</a> that he would speak in the White House Rose Garden.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am your president&nbsp;of law and order,\u201d he&nbsp;said at the podium, striking a firmly Nixonian note, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/donald-trump-1968-election-violence-chicago-richard-nixon\">as he has on the campaign trail</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country.

FUCK YOU @lorealparis. You dropped me from a campaign in 2017 and threw me to the wolves for speaking out about racism and white supremacy. With no duty of care, without a second thought. I had to fend for myself being torn apart by the world&#39;s press because YOU didn&#39;t want to talk about racism. You even tried to get me to incriminate myself with pairing me up with your shady lawyers, when I had done NOTHING wrong. THAT is what you get for &#39;speaking out&#39; when employed by @lorealparis. Racist snakes. You do NOT get to do this. This is NOT okay, not even in the slightest. I said just yesterday that it would only be a matter of time before RACIST AF brands saw a window of PR opportunity to jump on the bandwagon. Fuck you. Fuck your &#39;solidarity&#39;. Where was my support when I spoke out? Where was my apology? I&#39;m disgusted and writing this in floods of tears and shaking. This is gaslighting. If you care about me or #blacklivesmatter, don&#39;t let @lorealparis get away with this.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/munroebergdorf/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> \uff2d\uff35\uff2e\uff32\uff2f\uff25</a> (@munroebergdorf) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-01T14:12:44+00:00\">Jun 1, 2020 at 7:12am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>In August 2017, Bergdorf was announced as one of the faces of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BYSwkyRnJ5Y/?utm_source=ig_embed\">True Match</a> diversity campaign to launch a range of foundations for a variety of skin tones.

She was meeting with the archives director general, David Fricker, at the time it was released, and the pair were discussing the timing of her access. </p> <p>She says there are serious questions about its assertion of a 90-day declassification period, and says it may not properly reflect the high court\u2019s order.</p> <p>The archives was ordered by the high court to \u201creconsider\u201d Hocking\u2019s application to access the letters.</p> <p>Under <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019C00179\">the archives act</a>, reconsiderations are to be processed within 30 business days, not 90.</p> <p>The act says applications for reconsideration must be processed \u201cas soon as practicable, and within 30 business days, after the day the application for the reconsideration is received by the Archives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNow this is a pretty significant difference,\u201d Hocking told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThat is one of the reasons that I am extremely disappointed that this statement, saying [90 days] so definitively, has gone out at the same time that I was meeting David Fricker, while we were actually discussing this very point.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/palace-letters-high-court-rules-queen-secret-correspondence-whitlam-dismissal-are-commonwealth-records\">high court ruled last week</a> that the letters were commonwealth records, dismantling the central argument that had previously been used to block their release: that they were personal or private letters between the Queen and her representatives.</p> <p>The decision paved the way for the letters\u2019 release and was a remarkable win for Hocking, who believes the documents will shed light on the extent of royal involvement in the Whitlam dismissal.</p> <p>The archives said on Tuesday it would also need to determine whether any exemptions applied to the release of the letters.</p> <p>Those exemptions, set out in <a href=\"https://www.naa.gov.au/help-your-research/using-collection/access-records-under-archives-act/why-we-refuse-access\">section 33 of the Archives Act 1983</a>, prevent the release of information for a variety of reasons, including where it would damage Australia\u2019s security, defence or international relations, reveal confidential information provided to the Australian government by a foreign government or an international organisation, be a breach of confidence, interfere with law, or unreasonably disclose information about someone\u2019s personal affairs.</p> <p>\u201cAs a pro-disclosure organisation the National Archives is working hard to ensure this process is undertaken as quickly as possible,\u201d the archives said in its statement.</p> <p>\u201cThis requires a thorough examination of the records in consultation with relevant government agencies, to ready them for public release.</p> <p>\u201cThe National Archives takes the responsible release of records seriously. We set out to release all Commonwealth records that are in the open access period however exemptions under section 33 of the Act may apply.\u201d</p> <p>In the vast majority of cases, the archives tends to release records in full.

The historian has been attempting to access the records for more than 10 years.</p> <p>The archives\u2019 refusal to give Hocking access prompted a four-year-long legal battle through the federal and high courts.</p> <p>The documents were subject to an embargo by the Queen, which, potentially, could have lasted indefinitely.</p> <p>The archives argued they were not commonwealth records, but instead personal and private correspondence between the Queen and her representatives, meaning it could not release the documents.

  "<p>My mother, Jenny Chapman, who has died of cancer aged 78, began her working life as a secretary before moving into the legal profession, where she became an expert on teaching lawyers how to deal more empathetically and professionally with their clients.</p> <p>Jenny was born in Burma (now Myanmar) during the second world war to Carl Rosner, a timber specialist, and his Anglo-Burmese wife, Stella (nee Maitland). A few months after Jenny\u2019s birth the Japanese invaded, forcing her family to flee to India. When India gained independence in 1947 the family settled in Britain, where Jenny, aged six, found life in Croydon, Surrey, a sharp contrast to her colourful previous life.</p> <p>After attending St Anne\u2019s college in Sanderstead, Surrey, she went to secretarial college in London, after which she took up a job as secretary to the news desk at the Observer newspaper, where she met a cast of interesting figures that included Kim Philby, Don McCullin and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/dec/07/pressandpublishing2\">David Astor</a>. In London she also met Cary Chapman, a GP; they married in 1964 and moved to live in Maldon, Essex, in 1968.</p> <p>As her children grew up, Jenny went back to studying, and she gained a linguistics degree with the Open University followed by a law degree from the Chelmer Institute (now Anglia Ruskin University). She then became a law lecturer at the Chelmer Institute and later obtained a master\u2019s in medical ethics at King\u2019s College London, which led to her sitting on the ethics committee of the Royal Brompton hospital in London.</p> <p>In the 1980s Jenny developed an interest in teaching would-be lawyers not just knowledge of law but soft skills such as interviewing and negotiation techniques that would make them more client-orientated. Her work caught the attention of the London law firm Jacques and Lewis, which headhunted her in 1990 to become director of training and education. After the company merged with Eversheds in 1995, she moved to carry out similar work for Nicholson, Graham &amp; Jones until she retired in 2002.</p> <p>Following separation from Cary in 1991, Jenny moved back to London from Essex and, having been chair of the magistrates\u2019 bench in Maldon, transferred to the City of London bench.</p> <p>In 1999 she went on a skiing holiday and met an old friend, Richard Bryson. They fell in love and married the following year; she became Jenny Bryson but kept the surname Chapman for her working life. Jenny and Richard travelled widely and also became regular attendees and supporters of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, splitting their time between living in London and Liverpool. Music was a major part of Jenny\u2019s life and continued to be a comfort to her when she became ill earlier this year.</p> <p>She is survived by Richard, her children, Rebecca, Barnaby and me, and 11 grandchildren.</p>",

  "<p>When Larry Hamm, a veteran activist with People\u2019s Organization for Progress, kicked off last weekend\u2019s protest in Newark, New Jersey, he asked the crowd what they wanted.

A century later, it's still failing | Carol Anderson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so it was. Hamm, alongside Mayor Ras Baraka, and a few thousand people from the city and neighboring suburbs, marched through Newark. There were tense moments, and people throwing things at a police precinct, but \u2013 unlike many other protests across the US last weekend \u2013 there was no violence and no arrests.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing that made [Saturday] turn out the way it did,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cIt\u2019s the history, it\u2019s all the things that happened, here, the people, all of this work.\u201d</p> <p>As images of police ramming their cars into protesters and beating people with clubs were shared thousands of times this weekend, a few videos of law enforcement marching or kneeling with protesters also appeared.</p> <p>These videos \u2013 some from majority black cities like Newark, New Jersey, and Flint, Michigan \u2013 were shared with messages about how police reform and police actions could de-escalate situations and lead to peaceful protests.</p> <p>But the images were also loaded with much more complex histories through which last weekend was a peek into the window.</p> <p>Newark residents like Hamm, for example, had been fighting this kind of violence for decades, including the 1967 riots, when thousands of residents took to the streets to protest about white police using excessive force and killing black civilians.</p> <p>When he became mayor in 2014,&nbsp;Baraka made police reform a priority. He worked with activists lawmakers to form an independent citizen review board of police activities. Newark hired more local and minority police, and trained them to American Civil Liberties Union standards, which limit use of force. Baraka pushed back against the city\u2019s powerful police union.</p> <p>Last year, Newark\u2019s crime rates dropped to an <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/newark-crime-rates-continue-drop-its-much-about-perception-reality/\">unprecedented</a> low.</p> <p>\u201cThis relationship has been a nurtured one,\u201d Baraka said of bridging the communication gap between police and the Newark community, and that paid off last weekend when the tense protest ended without any arrests. \u201cThe police showed an uncanny level of restraint. They did not come downtown with tanks and body armor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday.

The county has introduced some of the strictest policies in the country regarding how police use force \u2013 strangling and suffocating, the way that police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, are not tolerated.</p> <p>In Camden, police officers train in simulators that include racial bias testing, and commanders watch body-camera footage regularly and analyze officer behavior. Last year, the Minneapolis commissioner, John Harrington, who oversees community policing, even consulted with the Camden police to learn their protocols.</p> <p>But truly reforming the police often takes more than training, said Sam Sinyangwe, a data scientist and activist who co-founded Campaign Zero, a platform which<a href=\"https://www.joincampaignzero.org/\"> tracks</a> the impact of police violence and possible solutions. \u201cEven if you have a police chief or mayor who cares, they don\u2019t always have the power to hold the officers accountable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are a few policies that Sinyangwe said the evidence supports. There is not enough data, Sinyangwe said, to say that anti-bias training and classes are a solution. Instead, he points to strong restrictions on how police can use force, curbing the military-grade weapons distributed to the police and cracking down on police union contracts.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is also an increasingly important conversation about defunding the police, which lawmakers such as Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez have resurfaced this week. The $6bn New York police department, for example, is bigger than the city\u2019s budget for many housing, education and health initiatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08/0_159_591_739/400.jpg\" alt=\"New York police officers kneel along with protesters after protesters said they asked them to do so, in this still frame obtained from social media video in Queens, New York, on Sunday.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York police officers kneel along with protesters in Queens, New York, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleeia Abraham/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of police violence is policing of things that shouldn\u2019t be policed,\u201d Sinyangwe said, such as sending police to people having mental health crises. \u201cTo do that we have to make a divestment from policing and shift those resources.\u201d</p> <p>Without a cocktail of comprehensive policies and accountability, some of the police efforts to express solidarity have been less effective. When New York police kneeled at a protest on Sunday, some pointed out that they went on to use brutal force against residents an hour later.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Flint, Michigan, Sheriff Chris Swanson joined the protest last weekend, saying he wanted it to be a \u201cparade not a protest\u201d. The video went viral, and residents were relieved that nobody in the city, which is still dealing with a water and economic crisis, got hurt. But some said that the message felt like it only took away from the focus of the protest on George Floyd, especially since the community\u2019s relationship with the police was not strong.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people know that Flint has an understaffed police force. They\u2019re not really present,\u201d said Anthony Fisher, a 21-year-old student and native of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good gesture, but some people get carried away.\u201d</p> <p>For Hamm, in Newark, it was clear the uprising and unrest happening across the country is a culmination of years of police brutality against black communities. He said his group, which has held weekly protests on the issue for years, and its relationship with city leaders and clergy, set the stage for a demonstration that represented Newark.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhen we marched there was already a kind of set of conditions in existence that would help prevent some sort of disturbance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the power of George Floyd. The way he died has had a tremendous impact on people\u2019s consciousness.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The virtual parliament is no more. The government has whipped its MPs to junk a series of innovations introduced in April to allow MPs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/20/mps-expected-approve-plans-virtual-parliament\">work remotely</a> in favour of socially distant business as usual. Instead of virtual voting, MPs will be summoned back to Westminster.</p> <p>Colleagues who are shielding or unable to travel to London will now be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">excluded from participating</a> in parliamentary proceedings. As many as 250 MPs who are vulnerable or who have caring responsibilities face a stark choice \u2013 between risking their lives or those of their loved ones and being unable to represent their constituents. The main justification given by the government for abolishing hybrid sittings was that MPs could not do their job from their constituencies because they were not able to spontaneously intervene in their colleagues\u2019 speeches. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, argued this meant the quality of debate was reduced. While it is true that interventions enliven debate in the Commons in a way that sets it apart from other legislatures, their absence seems a small price to pay for enabling all elected members to participate.</p> <p>Before the May bank holiday recess, the government decided to reinstate the requirement of MPs to be physically present in parliament, and bring to an end the new ways of working that house authorities had moved heaven and earth to put in place in just a few weeks.&nbsp;At the time the government hoped that MPs would be able to return to voting in person by walking into the aye and no lobbies in the usual way.</p> <p>But last week the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, acting on advice from Public Health England, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/jacob-rees-mogg-accused-of-bungling-plans-for-commons-return\">he would not allow</a> voting in the lobbies and asked the government to find a new solution. That was when the government came up with the idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/01/rees-moggs-plans-for-mps-to-vote-in-person-branded-beyond-a-farce\">conga</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/01/rees-moggs-plans-for-mps-to-vote-in-person-branded-beyond-a-farce\"> line of socially distanced MPs</a> stretching through the Palace of Westminster, waiting to walk through the chamber to vote. This is a solution that has none of the supposed advantages of voting in person<strong> </strong>\u2013 such as being able to catch a minister for a word on behalf of a constituent. And many disadvantages, which were painfully apparent in today\u2019s first new-style votes \u2013 as the conga line of MPs snaked for miles through the parliamentary estate making social distancing impossible.</p> <p>For many MPs, standing in line for hours waiting to vote will be their main experience of participating in the restored in-person Commons, because of all the MPs who can travel to Westminster, only 50 will be able to participate at any one time in the chamber. In order to maintain social distancing, the rest will have to watch from their offices until a vote is called. Each vote will take <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52876395\">around half an hour</a> \u2013 twice as long as a remote division used to take.</p> <p>It may be that MPs get so tired of the palaver of queuing to cast their votes that they do all they can to minimise the number of votes that are held. A backbencher deciding whether to push an amendment to a vote will weigh carefully whether to incur the ire of her colleagues by making them traipse around the palace again. Of course fewer votes will not trouble the government but reducing opportunities to test the will of the house will be bad for scrutiny.</p> <p>Another reason that the government wanted the virtual parliament abolished was that it feared it would restrict its ability to pass as much legislation as it wanted. Early hybrid sittings in the chamber were limited in duration because of the requirements of the broadcasting technology, and there were concerns about whether there would be sufficient capacity to hold public bill committees&nbsp;online. The government rejected solutions to both these issues offered by the house authorities before it took the decision to abolish virtual sittings.</p> <p>Many MPs did not back the move. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/mps-furious-about-forced-return-of-physical-voting-to-commons\">procedure </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/mps-furious-about-forced-return-of-physical-voting-to-commons\">committe</a>e \u2013 the normal origin of sound and sensible proposals about how the Commons should run itself \u2013 put forward amendments to the government\u2019s proposals that would have seen virtual participation and remote voting continue. These were backed by 16 select committee chairs, but rejected by the government.</p> <p>The government betrays its narrow and expedient view of the role of parliament when it seeks to reassure those MPs unable to travel to Westminster that it is working to find a way that their votes can be counted. Not only would proxy voting or mass pairing (where one MP abstains to cancel out the absent vote of another who would have voted the opposite way) hand significant power to the party whips, but also absent MPs would be unable to participate in debates on legislation.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/the-virtual-parliament-is-no-longer-necessary-we-can-do-so-much-better\">wrote yesterday</a> that \u201cWestminster has been the seat of our democracy for centuries. It will take more than coronavirus to change that.\u201d Apparently a government careless of the right of all MPs to vote on behalf of their constituents is sufficient.</p> <p>\u2022 Hannah White is deputy director of the Institute for Government and was a House of Commons clerk between 2004 and 2014</p>",

  "<p>The inquiry into disparities in the risk and outcomes of Covid-19 commissioned by the Department of Health identifies major inequalities, confirming that \u2013 contrary to the popular refrain \u2013 we are not all in this together.</p> <h2>Mortality risk from Covid-19 is higher among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people</h2> <p><a href=\"Covid-19%20death%20rate%20in%20England%20higher%20among%20BAME%20people\">The Public Health England (PHE) review confirms</a> that the risk of dying among those diagnosed with Covid-19 is higher in those in BAME groups than in white ethnic groups.</p> <p>After accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, it found that people of Bangladeshi ethnicity were at most risk, with around twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black ethnicity had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British. The risk of mortality for people of Bangladeshi ethnicity was in line with other research, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/inequality/chapter/are-some-ethnic-groups-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19-than-others/\">Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)</a>, but for other ethnicities it was generally lower.</p> <p>In previous years, all-cause mortality rates were lower in Asian and black ethnic groups than in white ethnic groups, PHE said, meaning that mortality risk for Covid-19 was a reversal of what had been seen in the past.</p> <h2>Diagnosis of Covid-19 among BAME people is also greater</h2> <p>When adjusted for age the highest diagnosis rates (which does not necessarily correlate with incidence) of Covid-19 were in people of Black ethnic groups (486 in females and 649 in males) and the lowest were in people of white ethnic groups (220 in females and 224 in males).</p> <h2>All cause deaths of BAME people during the Covid crisis have also gone up relative to white people</h2> <p>Unsurprisingly, compared with previous years, death rates were higher for white British people as well as BAME people for this period, although the increases were steeper in the latter group.</p> <p>All-cause mortality was almost four times higher than expected among black males for this period, almost three times higher in Asian males and almost two times higher in white males. Deaths were almost three times higher in this period in black, mixed and other females and 2.4 times higher in Asian females compared with 1.6 times in white females.</p> <h2>Combination of factors likely be to explain disproportionate effect on BAME people</h2> <p>Ahead of the review, many BAME campaigners and leaders were concerned that the review would give insufficient weight to socioeconomic inequalities&nbsp;or structural racism&nbsp;and stress genetic factors, for political convenience.</p> <p>The report does not seek to reach a definitive conclusion on the cause, describing the relationship between ethnicity and health as \u201ccomplex and likely to be the result of a combination of factors\u201d. But it does say that BAME communities are likely to be at increased risk of infection because they are more likely to live in urban areas, in overcrowded households, in deprived areas and have jobs that expose them to higher risk.</p> <p>It also stresses that people from BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services because of cultural and language differences. Compared with previous years, PHE found a particularly high increase in all-cause deaths among those born outside the UK and Ireland.</p> <p>It also \u2013 without pinpointing why \u2013 says that comorbidities which increase the risk of poorer outcomes from Covid-19 are more common among certain ethnic groups. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani background have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than people from white British ethnicity and people of black Caribbean and black African ethnicity have higher rates of hypertension compared with other ethnic groups. Further it references data from the National Diabetes Audit which suggests that type 2 diabetes prevalence is higher in people from BAME communities.</p> <p>Crucially, PHE says the analyses on death and diagnosis were unable to account for the effect of occupation, comorbidities or obesity \u2013 all significant risk factors in themselves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">The IFS previously found</a> that a third of all working-age black Africans are employed in key worker roles, 50% more than the share of the white British population. Additionally it said that Pakistani, Indian and black African men are respectively 90%, 150% and 310% more likely to work in healthcare than white British men.</p> <h2>Mortality rates in most deprived areas twice those in least deprived</h2> <p>The review looked at other risk factors aside from ethnicity. The mortality rates from Covid-19 in the most deprived areas were found to be more than double the least deprived areas, for both males and females, similar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales\">previous ONS findings</a>. This was greater than the inequality seen in mortality rates in previous years, indicating coronavirus is exacerbating mortality inequality.</p> <h2>Diabetes mentioned on significant number of death certificates, particularly for BAME people</h2> <p>In the comorbidities section, PHE says diabetes was mentioned on 21% of death certificates where Covid-19 was also mentioned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/one-in-four-people-who-died-in-uk-hospitals-with-covid-19-had-diabetes\">consistent with other studies</a>. This proportion was 43% in the Asian group, 45% in the black group and higher in all BAME groups than for the white British population. Diabetes was more likely to be mentioned on the death certificate in more deprived areas. The same ethnic disparities were seen for hypertensive disease.</p> <h2>Nursing assistants, security guards and cab drivers have experienced bigger increase in deaths than other occupations</h2> <p>Nursing auxiliaries and assistants, security guards and related occupations, and taxi and cab drivers and chauffeurs were found to have experienced a relative increase in deaths in 2020 significantly higher than the average of 1.5 among people of working age (20-64). The ONS has previously reported male bus and coach drivers, chefs, sales and retail assistants, lower-skilled workers in construction and processing plants, and both sexes working in social care as having significantly high rates of death from Covid-19.</p> <p>An analysis of 10,841 Covid-19 cases in nurses, midwives and nursing associates found that those from Asian ethnic groups were overrepresented but the analysis did not look at the possible reasons behind these differences, which PHE said \u201cmay be driven by factors like geography or nature of individuals\u2019 roles\u201d.</p> <h2>Greatest disparity found for age, with male sex also significant risk factor</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-coronavirus-study-reveals-increased-risks-from-middle-age\">Age</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-coronavirus-study-reveals-increased-risks-from-middle-age\">male sex</a> were identified as risk factors for Covid-19 early on in the pandemic among patients in Wuhan, China, the centre of the outbreak. PHE found the largest disparity to be age-related. Among people already diagnosed with coronavirus, people who were 80 or older were seventy times more likely to die than those under 40.</p> <p>Working-age males diagnosed with Covid-19 were twice as likely to die as females. Men made up 46% of diagnosed cases but almost 60% of deaths and 70% of admissions to intensive care units. These disparities exist after taking ethnicity, deprivation and region into account. PHE says it remains unclear what drives the difference in outcomes between the sexes but they \u201ccould be driven by different risks of acquiring the infection \u2013 for example due to behavioural and occupational factors \u2013 and by differences in how women and men develop symptoms, access care and are diagnosed, or by biological and immune differences that put men at greater risk\u201d.</p>",

The sceptics among us smell a rat \u2013 with the alert level the same and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/england-risks-covid-19-surge-without-test-and-trace-safety-net-sage-boris-johnson\">government\u2019s five tests unmet</a>, track-and-trace not ready and a government desperate to deflect attention from its shortcomings \u2013 is this easing really for our benefit, or just a way to kick responsibility back on to the population?&nbsp;</p> <p>However, rejecting the new guidelines altogether and maintaining your own, personal lockdown may not necessarily be the most socially responsible thing either. Prof Carl Heneghan, the director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford, says: \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in lockdown for ever. It\u2019s too easy to make this about one disease. You\u2019ve got to look at the wide spectrum of health issues, the backlog of other [medical] appointments, the impact of more austerity on people\u2019s lives, the closure of schools and the effect on educational attainment, which we know is linked to health outcomes.\u201d We won\u2019t understand the dynamics of transmission \u2013 we won\u2019t even understand how effective lockdown has been \u2013 unless we start to come out of it. It would be stretching a point to say that it\u2019s your duty to attend a small and socially distanced barbecue, but for the sake of a Co-op burger and some coleslaw, I\u2019m prepared to stretch that point.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the flip side, as the major restrictions lift, it\u2019s easy to forget the minor ones, but they should not be underestimated. Heneghan points out: \u201cThere was a 50% drop in acute respiratory infection in the week before lockdown, so social distancing and handwashing were having a significant impact.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, we are living in one giant grey area, where judgment, common sense, good faith and, most of all, manners are going to be doing a hell of a lot of heavy lifting. So what advice do the etiquette experts \u2013 and the boffins \u2013 offer?&nbsp;</p> <h2>How do you make sure that the garden party to which you have been invited will definitely have no more than six people?</h2> <p>William Hanson, an etiquette coach and host of the podcast Help I Sexted My Boss, was born to answer this question. \u201cThere was an awful tendency, before all this, to respond to an invitation with: \u2018Who else is going to be there?\u2019\u201d (This implies you are checking that it will be cool enough, and is beyond rude.) \u201cNow it is permissible, even healthy, to ask that. But you may still want to disguise the question, so if you\u2019re bringing a cake or a homemade cordial, say: \u2018Let me know how many it will be for.\u2019\u201d </p> <h2>If you know a gathering will end up huge, how do you politely refuse?</h2> <p>No manners specialist in town has given me an acceptable get-out for turning up only to find a packed party. Talk numbers before you arrive and then, as Debora Robertson, the co-author of Manners: A Modern Field Guide (out next spring), says: \u201cIt\u2019s your job to express clearly what you need in a social situation, so just say: \u2018I\u2019m not ready yet for that.\u2019\u201d After that, it\u2019s all in the tone and the intention. \u201cIf it\u2019s not your intention to make people feel like they\u2019re reckless or stupid, then that won\u2019t come across in your tone.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <h2>What if you want to bring your own cutlery or glassware? And do you need to?</h2> <p>Again, if you explain yourself plainly and make it a boundary of yours, a decent friend will accept that even if they think you are extremely cautious. Adam Collins, a doctor of emergency medicine, says: \u201cIf everything is washed and clean, and everyone, while they\u2019re there, has their own individual set of plates and cups, that should be fine.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81d1e1f51b7da64985d1eb091c74e6d13b861eed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d1e1f51b7da64985d1eb091c74e6d13b861eed/0_5_1811_1086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BYO - take your own cutlery and glasses to the social distancing barbecue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BYO - take your own cutlery and glasses to the social distancing barbecue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Spencer Wilson at Synergy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Can a friendship survive you wiping down their toilet?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/uk-lockdown-rules-what-are-the-key-changes\">You are now allowed to use someone else\u2019s toilet if you wipe down surfaces afterwards</a>. If you don\u2019t want people to use your loo, tell them before they arrive. Regardless, Diana Mather, the author of The Good Manners Bears and host of the Granny Manners YouTube channel, has this timeless piece of advice: \u201cMake sure you go before you leave.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re happy for people to use your loo, Hanson says: \u201cI would, as a host, put Dettol wipes out. I would hope that people got what I was trying to imply.\u201d As a guest, you don\u2019t then need to be sheepish about having cleaned the toilet, because they in effect told you to do that. I know. This is all getting pretty intense.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How long should you stay at a gathering?</h2> <p>According to Mather, absolutely not as long as you would normally. The longer you are there, the more some of you will drink, the less observant of social distancing you will become, the more of an awkward spot you will put anxious friends and relatives in. It\u2019s not a four-hour gig. It would be polite, as a host, to set the terms \u2013 shall we have a drink between six and seven? \u2013 \u201cAnd if it gets to seven and people are still chatting,\u201d Mather says, \u201cyou can push it to half past seven.\u201d How do you make people leave, though? This bit is easy, apparently. \u201cYou stand up,\u201d Mather says authoritatively. \u201cEveryone should take that hint.\u201d</p> <h2>Can you share food? What, not even crisps?</h2> <p>There is no way to not offer these around, yet I\u2019m struggling to see how you would get a Quaver off someone without coming closer than two metres, so it\u2019s sort of a pass-agg move. You\u2019re asking them to either break the rules or make a big deal out of not breaking them. I think you just have to eat these things privately, or buy more than one bag of Quavers.</p> <p>At a whole population level, public health agencies are trying to move people away from buffet-style eating, where you are all digging in to the same bowl, and a large number of people are using the same serving spoon. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t safely cut a cake for six people or prepare salads for people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5a131a4254e5413470499f35269a82d516a0c93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a131a4254e5413470499f35269a82d516a0c93/0_5_1811_1086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharing food is a no no.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharing food is a no no.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Spencer Wilson at Synergy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Should you grass on friends if you know they are breaking the rules?</h2> <p>Hanson says: \u201cIf it\u2019s a serious breach that is breaking the rules, then fine. But be prepared, if it becomes known who reported them, that is a serious breach of friendship and you probably won\u2019t be friends with them going forward.\u201d Robertson is more trenchant: \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to stop the grassing-up thing. It came too easily to some people.\u201d I think, from both a moral and manners perspective, no.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>If you haven\u2019t spoken to a friend throughout lockdown, are they still a friend?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s really up to you, but don\u2019t leave things because you feel embarrassed or awkward. Robertson says: \u201cPhone them up, or email, or send a postcard to re-establish connection. Just be normal, don\u2019t be weird.\u201d</p> <p>Remember, too, that it\u2019s not all about you. We all have a tendency to blame ourselves when communication breaks down, but it takes two not to tango. \u201cThere\u2019s this brilliant story in the Duchess of Devonshire\u2019s autobiography,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs on her wedding day, and she\u2019s waiting to come down, and 85 million people are waiting to see her. And she says to her mother: \u2018I feel a bit shy.\u2019 And her mother says: \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, nobody\u2019s looking at you.\u2019\u201d I mean, it is brilliant. But mothers are also weird.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How do you say \u2018no\u2019 to a Zoom because you have nothing to say and you hate Zoom?</h2> <p>I am currently going with: \u201cI have nothing to say and I hate Zoom.\u201d</p> <h2>What if your friends break rules on purpose because that\u2019s just the way they are?</h2> <p>Collins takes the point: \u201cGiven that you\u2019re allowed to have as many different sets of six people as you want, to me, that\u2019s no different to having a barbecue of 12.\u201d This is the moment at which you berate them with science. The magic number is because any group larger than six finds it hard to stay in the same conversation, at two metres apart, so will naturally start to cluster together. Just be reasonable, is the overall medical message here.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How do you tell a friend that they are too close?</h2> <p>Someone doing it by accident can be repelled by a light remark. With a deliberate offender, Hanson says, you have to be firm. \u201cYou have got to step in and say: \u2018It\u2019s two metres, I\u2019d appreciate if you would respect that.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t say sorry, necessarily. Keep it short. If you soften it too much, it will weaken the impact. I know some of my friends probably would transgress, and I just won\u2019t meet up with them until this is over.\u201d</p> <h2>Given that some schools are now back, is it OK for kids to play?</h2> <p>Children are relatively unaffected by Covid and yet Covid&nbsp;is all we think about. But there\u2019s a danger that because of this we might forget about their other needs altogether. Heneghan counsels strongly against this. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lack of thinking about our younger generation, right across the board up to university age. They are at such low risk, them going back to school is no more risky than it is after Christmas, when there\u2019s been an outbreak of influenza.\u201d They need education, but they also need fellowship, play, fresh air and normality. So yes, they should be allowed to play with one another. If they are too young to observe any meaningful social distance, you just have to chase them apart (try not to be terrifying).</p> <h2>Can you get into a car with a friend?</h2> <p>Heneghan says: \u201cI got into a car with a person on Saturday. I\u2019m also an urgent care GP, he had to drive me around. The important point here is that we\u2019ve come through an era where, if you\u2019re ill, you take a paracetamol and carry on. That has to end. The important alertness is that if you feel unwell, you have to take it seriously and get yourself a test.\u201d</p> <p>Collins gives something close to a definitive answer on this, and all things: \u201cWhat people should focus on is not: \u2018Can I do this specific thing?\u2019 It\u2019s: \u2018What am I doing here that is genuinely beneficial or genuinely necessary?\u2019 Lockdown is driving us all a little bit crazy and it affects some people\u2019s mental health in really serious ways.\u201d It\u2019s really not as simple as: \u201cResponsible people stay locked down for ever\u201d and very few rules are absolute. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, honestly, whether you\u2019re doing everything you can to protect yourself and protect others.\u201d</p> <h2>What about if you\u2019re commuting by bike for the first time?</h2> <p>Oh, hello fresh minefield. Alan Redman is an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London, with a sideline in the psychology of commuter cycling. His top manners tips are: \u201cOne, wave/smile at other riders. Always. Two, don\u2019t shout at drivers or pedestrians. Three, don\u2019t overtake and then immediately slow down.\u201d More broadly, he says, there is too much focus on commuting being terrifying \u2013 it is at the start, but people overcome that fairly fast and afterwards get a huge sense of zeal from their sense of legitimacy on the road and their feeling of having sailed over the fear barrier.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Is it safe to start dating? How far can you go?</h2> <p>As it is allowed for two people to meet, there is no reason you can\u2019t go out on a date, so long as you can cope with pubs not being open. Given the two-metre distance, however, you probably can\u2019t do much else. There is a hilarious legal loophole, here \u2013 as of this week it is illegal for two people <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-sex-lockdown-law-couples-indoors-england-a9542171.html\">from different households to meet indoors and have sex</a>. The rules around outdoor gatherings, however, are guidance not law, so in theory you could breach your two-metre rule and have sex in the garden without getting arrested. So long as you weren\u2019t overlooked, which would of course breach another law. And so long as there were six of you. No, wait \u2026&nbsp;</p> <h2>Who can I hug?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6027ddc4026ddc21696ac5608e3cda7cdddc696b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6027ddc4026ddc21696ac5608e3cda7cdddc696b/0_5_1811_1086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sex in the garden - yes!

You can definitely hug any of the six people you have just had outdoor sex with, in for a penny etc (joke! This is a joke). People I\u2019ve been extremely tempted to hug include those who have definitely had the virus already, with the antibody test to prove it, and those who are at the end of their lives and claim not to care whether they get it or not. The expert advice remains: do not hug any of these people.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Every few years, being black becomes a macabre spectacle. What is usually a complicated private identity becomes a public one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">A black man is killed</a> by a white police officer in the United States, and suddenly the world is attuned to your race.</p> <p>Suddenly, the world is trying to help. It\u2019s trying to amplify black voices. It\u2019s posting Martin Luther King and Malcolm X quotes and videos. It\u2019s donating money. It\u2019s circulating videos of black protesters and black media voices.</p> <p>And it\u2019s being humbled. It\u2019s trying to learn. It\u2019s ashamed that it wasn\u2019t educated enough before about racism, and it is here to take a cue from black people \u2013 your book recommendations, your understanding, your absolution. And it\u2019s also here a little bit for the righteous feeling of proximity to you, to your virtuous victimhood, to your moment in history.</p> <p>I can almost feel the blackness tingle on my skin as it is stripped off, posted, projected and explained over a billion social media posts. It is uncomfortable. It feels unnerving. Is it unkind? It feels like spending your life asking for solidarity from others, then saying, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>During the Arab spring, one of the favourite lines of commentary was that it was the world\u2019s first \u201csocial media revolution\u201d. An image of graffiti painted on the shuttered gates of a travel agency <a href=\"https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/latest-updates-on-day-10-of-egypt-protests/\">in Cairo</a> went viral. It read: \u201cTwitter, al-Jazeera, Facebook.\u201d It was a neat little story about the virtues of globalisation, technology and the promise of youth: just a few apps and websites had helped to bring down outdated regimes that had not kept up with the times.</p> <p>The events after George Floyd\u2019s death feel like they\u2019ve also hit a new social media nerve. Today, that graffiti would say: \u201cTikTok, Instagram, Twitter.\u201d&nbsp;But it feels as though there is no promise here. The explosion of support around black lives just means that there is a new racial divide opening up. Black people are on the ground risking their lives and livelihoods, and white people are mostly online, where there is only upside.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because this is the easy part: no matter how much effort has gone in to making sure you are the right sort of ally, no matter how much money you have donated or supportive feeds you have curated. For white people in America, there is no solidarity that is not received without a heavy dose of scepticism. The frequency of black men and women dying at the hands of white police officers tars a whole nation, not just a police force \u2013 one that is so empowered only because of the systemic complacency and normalisation of black murder. Those officers who kill are not all flukes, they\u2019re not all \u201cbad apples\u201d. A black man would not end up under the knee of a white officer for almost nine minutes if a black life mattered. </p> <p>For white people outside America, the solidarity is simpler. You don\u2019t have to reckon with your role in this. You don\u2019t have to grapple with guilt as black people are handcuffed and pepper-sprayed. If the riots were on your doorstep in the UK, for example \u2013 in Hackney or Handsworth or Moss Side \u2013 you\u2019d have to balance any conflict about really totally seeing where the protesters are coming from with worrying about your daughter walking home from the bus stop, or the integrity of your windows.</p> <p>So while&nbsp;the action is happening far away in the US, you won\u2019t find yourself tempted to equivocate because the thought of a black man being murdered on your patch is too uncomfortable and taints you with a sense of complicity. You won\u2019t have to come up with excuses: perhaps he had a gun; perhaps he was drunk; perhaps he was threatening. You won\u2019t find yourself, as your neighbourhood is destabilised, instinctively feeling more empathy with the police, with whom you\u2019ve never had a bad experience; that yes, they are doing a tough job and have to make split-second decisions.</p> <p>Solidarity in the absence of proximity is a clean hit. America can be viewed as a uniquely violent place, cursed with a uniquely tragic racial history. It\u2019s an even more satisfying perspective when the voices and scenes emanating from the riots are so high-octane. With the heavy curation, editing and production quality of new social media channels, America\u2019s race riots already feel, even as they are still playing out, like a historical showreel montage. The impromptu speeches of African Americans, either pleading for restraint or choking back tears of anger, provide a lyrical and emotional soundtrack to the burning cars and buildings.</p> <p>The legacy of years of pain, of exhaustion, of retreading the same ground, have morphed into a sort of modern-day blues: a newly forming tradition of oratory that narrates the experience of being black in America. Giving it weight is decades of activism, literature, film and music that have made African American history vivid and intimate \u2013 so much so that outsiders feel an ownership and familiarity with the texture of race relations in America in ways they do not about their country\u2019s own.&nbsp;Racism becomes reduced to the US version, to its most dramatic transgressions. A tragedy for Americans, a break for everyone else, who&nbsp;can fret about how singularly awful it is over there.</p> <p>This mass global support cannot be separated from American cultural hegemony, from its power as exporter of its story. From its glamour. Hip-hop, the popular culture of African American distress \u2013 one that came into being to come to terms with death and dispossession \u2013 has been merely entertainment for everyone else. When the real thing happens, consumers treat it like just more celluloid, sharing it as an aesthetic and artistic arms-length experience, rather than the visceral expression of anguish that it is. It is not blackness that is being elevated here \u2013 an experience that is jagged, diverse and unbranded \u2013 it is African Americanism, sold as a consumer product.</p> <p>This is why the \u201cwhite ally\u201d support is uncomfortable. It kicks in only when black people conform to an image and live up to a single moment. It raises them at this point, but the rest of the time black voices are not fashionable, their grievances not dramatic&nbsp;or simple enough, or caught on camera. True solidarity, the one that helps in the long term rather than merely buys a sticking plaster for the short term, is in those moments. It is in the daily discomfort of taking risks, of challenging a&nbsp;&nbsp;system that subtly but emphatically excludes black people, when there is no reward for doing so, and of making way and giving up space where it counts \u2013 at the table where power sits \u2013 and when no one can see you do it.</p> <p>Parting with money and sharing on social media is the easy bit. And thank you, I guess. But the moments in between are the only ones that really matter.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>The actor Michelle Collins has warned that the screen and stage industries risk losing a generation of working-class talent if they are not offered further support during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Collins, who played Cindy Beale over 10 years on EastEnders, said she feared \u201cyoung working-class actors, who don\u2019t come from privileged backgrounds\u201d would \u201cbecome disillusioned and leave the industry\u201d. Collins and fellow actors have raised the alarm about how many freelancers have fallen between the cracks in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme#check\">self-employment income support scheme (SEISS)</a>, mainly because they have a second income stream from often temporary PAYE work.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of actors rely on [work in] hospitality to supplement their income and they can no longer do that,\u201d said Collins. \u201cI want people to know that it is a misconception that all actors are wealthy. They certainly are not.\u201d Many, she said, have \u201cslipped through the net\u201d of the government schemes. Last Friday, the Treasury announced that 2.3m claims worth \u00a36.8bn had been made through SEISS&nbsp;and that chancellor Rishi Sunak is extending the scheme, with those eligible able to claim a second and final grant in August, capped at \u00a36,570. But many have pointed out gaps in the system, including for those who have been self-employed for less than a year. Last week, Chester Storyhouse artistic director Alex Clifton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/27/thousands-are-in-jeopardy-freelance-theatre-makers-count-cost-of-crisis-covid-lockdown\">told the Guardian</a> that he was shocked by the situation for freelancers in the arts: \u201cIf we get this moment wrong, these people will drain away from our industry.\u201d &nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFa926_7-pI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RFa926_7-pI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>To raise money for creatives affected by the coronavirus crisis, Collins teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.genesiuspictures.com/\">Genesius Pictures</a> and with the actors\u2019 union Equity whose benevolent fund provides members with financial assistance. She organised an ambitious video project, #FortheLoveofArts, and invited actors to perform a series of 50 short monologues to raise awareness of the appeal. She ended up with a dream cast including Ian McKellen, Pearl Mackie, Derek Jacobi, Lennie James, Lesley Manville, Adjoa Andoh and Layton Williams. Their performances can be viewed on the Equity Benevolent Fund\u2019s <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3cZMh6s\">YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;Some actors penned their own monologues; others perform famous speeches. Hugh Dennis wrote a piece for his Outnumbered co-star <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeOP9apQm7Q\">Claire Skinner</a>. Collins, who performs a monologue by Chloe Moss, also matched particular writers and actors. Tony Grounds wrote a speech for McKellen and Coronation Street writer Susan Oudot created a piece for Manville. \u201cI also gave a new writer, Tyler Rigby, who is only 21 and just out of uni, the chance to write for Danny Miller, a big Emmerdale actor,\u201d said Collins.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Hv4kL6D4I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u3Hv4kL6D4I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So far the appeal has raised about a third of its \u00a3100,000 target. The Equity Benevolent Fund has been giving out \u00a386,000 a week to support those who cannot afford to pay for food, utilities or other essentials. The union says there is no sign that applications are dying down and is appealing for donations from the public.</p> <p>Collins hopes to secure a TV broadcast for the monologues and to publish a collection of them, with proceeds going to Equity. The book, she points out, will have many pieces suitable for future auditions for actors.</p> <p>Maureen Beattie, Equity president, said: \u201cWe are particularly grateful to Michelle Collins for her generosity and commitment to the welfare of her fellow workers in the entertainment industry. The money raised will make a crucial difference to the thousands of performers and creatives that the Equity Benevolent Fund helps in this crisis.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Collins, who has had prominent television roles in Two Thousand Acres of Sky and Coronation Street, was due to appear in a national tour of Harold Pinter\u2019s The Birthday Party this spring. That production has now been postponed, along with a solo show that she planned to take to the Edinburgh festival. Early in her theatre career Collins performed at the Nuffield in Southampton, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/06/nuffield-southampton-theatres-administration-coronavirus\">went into administration</a> last month.

  "<p>The murder of a 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kurds\">Kurdish</a> man in Ankara has launched a wave of accusations of discrimination in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> over the mistreatment of the ethnic minority.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bar\u0131\u015f \u00c7akan was visiting a park with a friend in Ankara\u2019s Etimesgut neighbourhood on Sunday night when he asked three men to turn down the volume of the music playing from their car during the evening call to prayer.&nbsp;The friend told police that an argument ensued and \u00c7akan was stabbed in the heart and killed, according to a statement from the Ankara governor\u2019s office on Monday. Three suspects were arrested.</p> <p>Initial news reports quoted a family member as saying that \u00c7akan had been attacked because he had been listening to Kurdish-language music. While \u00c7akan\u2019s father said in later interviews that the assault was not triggered by Kurdish music, the racial overtones of the killing have led to an outpouring of anger on social media, particuarly after a friend and another relative stepped forward on Tuesday to say the family had been pressured to cover up the reason for the fight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nujenari/status/1267305642911465472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tr\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cK\u00fcrt halen bu \u00fclkenin zencisidir. &quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bar%C4%B1%C5%9F%C3%87akan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bar\u0131\u015f\u00c7akan</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MliTXDzhVX\">pic.twitter.com/MliTXDzhVX</a></p>&mdash; Nujen \ud83c\udf49 (@nujenari) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nujenari/status/1267305642911465472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Hundreds of messages of solidarity have appeared under the hashtag #BarisCakan, as well as comparisons with the killing of African American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> at the hands of US police, which sparked the protests currently raging across the US over institutional racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThose who plant the seeds of hatred and enmity in the public and those who ban even the discourse on peace, this is the result,\u201d pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democracy party (HDP) official Meral Dan\u0131\u015f Be\u015fta\u015f said in a tweet, referring to the policies of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP).&nbsp;</p> <p>The HDP says 45 mayors out of a total of 65 municipalities that the party won in local elections in March 2019 have been removed from office to date, with at least 21 imprisoned over accusations of links to the outlawed militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK).</p> <p>In reaction to \u00c7akan\u2019s death, Giran Ozcan, another HDP official, quoted Martin Luther King Jr with the words \u201cinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\u201d referencing the killing of both Floyd and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/israeli-minister-benny-gantz-apologises-for-police-shooting-of-palestinian-man-iyad-halak\">Iyad Halak</a>, a Palestinian man with autism who was shot and killed by Israeli police in Jerusalem last week.&nbsp;</p> <p>Comments from Interior Ministry spokesperson, \u0130smail \u00c7atakl\u0131, who said that the crime was not racially motivated, and that focusing on the racial dynamic is the work of \u201cprovocateurs\u201d, have also led to allegations of state hypocrisy over the treatment of Turkey\u2019s Kurdish population.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several high-level Turkish officials, including President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, have issued statements condemning racist violence in the US in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Around one fifth of Turkey\u2019s 80 million-strong population is Kurdish.

  "<p>Good wifi makes all the difference at even the best of times. Right now, it\u2019s absolutely vital. It\u2019s your office, your children\u2019s teacher, your portal to friends and family. For the sake of your household\u2019s sanity, you really cannot have it functioning at anything less than 100%. Fortunately, there are some little-known tips and tricks to help improve your wifi\u2019s performance, and keep it quick and reliable. Here\u2019s how you can get the best from your invisible friend ...</p> <p><strong>1. Send clear signals<br></strong>Few things are as frustrating as when slow wifi turns you into a malfunctioning Dalek just as you make an insightful point to colleagues on a video call. Why does that keep happening? \u201cMicrowaves, underfloor heating controllers and gaming controllers create electromagnetic fields that interfere with your wifi signal,\u201d says Charlie McKenzie, technical adviser for Vodafone. One solution is to check the frequency that your router operates at. Most modern routers send out signals at 2.4GHz and 5GHz, but as the 2.4GHz frequency is used by lots of devices around the home there\u2019s intense competition for bandwidth. \u201cFor video calls, try changing to the higher frequency by going into the wifi settings on your browser and selecting 5GHz,\u201d advises McKenzie.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2. Position is everything<br></strong>Your router may well be plugged into a phone socket in the hall but that might not be the best place for it. All sorts of things can block wifi signals and affect your network\u2019s performance: brick walls, pipes and household appliances. \u201cTo get the best from your wifi, you need to give your router pride of place in an area with minimal electronics present,\u201d says McKenzie. Just make sure it\u2019s not bang next to your TV, smart speaker or other devices. If playing around with the position of your router doesn\u2019t help, try using a router with beamforming technology. \u201cThis technology can focus the wifi straight at your device.\u201d That\u2019ll help keep your kids entertained with back-to-back episodes of Peppa Pig while you\u2019re tied up on business calls.</p> <p><strong>3. Slow devices are your enemy<br></strong>If wifi networks operate at speeds that are too high for older pieces of equipment, these devices won\u2019t be able to connect. Thus wifi networks automatically slow down to run at the pace of the slowest device connected to them. Unfortunately, this means that every other device on the network also operates at that speed. \u201cSo, go to the admin settings of your broadband provider\u2019s app to discover which devices are connecting,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cYou may be surprised to find you have 20 devices connected, and you may only need four of them.\u201d Once you see what\u2019s connected, you can also disconnect older devices when speed is at a premium.</p> <p><strong>4. Stop channel surfing<br></strong>Live in a built-up area? You\u2019ll be surrounded by lots of other wifi routers competing to find the quietest channel to operate on. But this can mean your router flitting from channel to channel, occasionally dropping the wifi altogether. \u201cTo avoid this happening right in the middle of a work task or at a crucial moment in the film you\u2019re streaming, try manually setting your router to operate only on one channel,\u201d says McKenzie. Erm, how? Simple: \u201cLog into your router, which usually has instructions on how to do so on the back.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/may/18/let-your-kids-gatecrash-the-video-meeting-six-ways-to-master-home-working\">Let your kids gatecrash the video meeting: six ways to master home working</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>5. Be wary of extenders<br></strong>Is your wifi brilliant in the living room but a bit patchy in the kitchen? You might think wifi extenders are the answer \u2013 but hold fire because there\u2019s a new kid on the block. Wifi mesh is the up-to-the minute solution for efficiently boosting wifi right through your home. \u201cIt\u2019s a series of modules that can be placed around your house,\u201d says Vodafone\u2019s McKenzie. \u201cWifi mesh is a lot stronger than putting wifi extenders in different rooms. It\u2019s very effective if you\u2019re working in a corner of the house, or even out in the garden.\u201d The garden, huh? Working from home just got a whole lot more relaxing.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>6. Take the lead<br></strong>In a typical home there are any number of devices competing for wifi, so it\u2019s worth asking yourself whether you could lighten the load by using a lead to connect to your broadband. \u201cPlugging a cable directly into your laptop will help when you need a lot of speed for a video call and can\u2019t afford for your connection to drop out,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cThe wifi router sends a signal that\u2019s subject to interference, but a lead provides a secure connection.\u201d So whether you\u2019re working or, better still, streaming Little Fires Everywhere, if you\u2019re plugged in, the kids should be able to play Minecraft using the wifi, and household harmony will be ensured.</p> <p><em><strong>Vodafone</strong> <strong>#KeepingTheUKConnected </strong></em><strong><br></strong><em>With the demands placed on your wifi from home working, online lessons for children and entertainment in free time, getting the most from your internet access has never been more important.</em></p> <p><em>That\u2019s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>So even when we\u2019re apart, nothing can stop us being together.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>Stay up to date with the latest information on what we\u2019re doing to keep the UK connected. <a href=\"https://track.adform.net/C/?bn=36685608\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find out more</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Britain has vowed to build an international alliance of democracies going beyond \u201cthe usual suspects\u201d to force China to step back from the brink over its plans for a new national security law in Hong Kong.</p> <p>In a statement to MPs, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said that by threatening Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, China \u201cwas inexplicably putting at risk what has long been regarded as one of [its] economic jewels\u201d.</p> <p>He also accused Beijing of intimidation in building a pro-China global alliance, saying Britain was trying to build its own counter-alliance of democracies to defend Hong Kong freedoms. He said the alliance needed to stretch beyond \u2018the usual suspects\u201d in Europe and the Five Eyes alliance to include countries in Africa and Latin America so drawing together countries with \u201ca likeminded attachment to the rule of law\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jun/02/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">Hong Kong: the end of one country, two systems?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>&nbsp;Raab also clarified his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/three-million-hong-kong-residents-eligible-for-uk-citizenship\">offer last week of a path to citizenship</a> through an extendable right to stay for periods of 12 months was applicable at this stage only to the existing 300,000 Hong Kong British Nationals Overseas (BNO) passport holders. The offer, including a right to work and study, will extend the right to stay from six months to an extendable 12 months. He said the offer would be formally made only if China wentahead with its as-yet-unpublished security laws.</p> <p>He told MPs the UK offer was confined to the existing 300,000 BNO passport holders and their dependents in Hong Kong, and not to those eligible for a BNO passport but who do not currently hold one. He said the UK government had to be realistic about the numbers Britain could credibly and responsibly absorb.</p> <p>If the offer was extended to all those eligible for the BNO passport, as many as 2.5 million people would be entitled to come to the UK. On Friday, there had been suggestions that the offer would definitely to be extended to all those eligible to apply for a BNO.</p> <p>Raab also ruled out calls from some MPs to offer a UK visa to those not eligible to apply for the BNO. Many of the younger Hong Kong citizens at the centre of the protests against Chinese rule have never been eligible for BNO status as it is only available to those born before 1997.</p> <p>Revealing he had been looking at the BNO issue with the Home Office since September, he said the UK\u2019s offer met UK\u2019s moral responsibilities as a former colonial power. \u201cWe, as the UK, have historic responsibilities, a duty I would say, to the people of Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will stand by them, we will live up to our responsibilities,\u201d and added: \u201dWe have a proud tradition for standing up as a haven for those fleeing persecution\u201d,</p> <p>Raab told MPs: \u201cThere is time for China to reconsider. There is a moment for China to step back from the brink and respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and respect China\u2019s own international obligations.</p> <p>\u201cIf China continues down this current path, if it enacts this national security law, we will consider what further response we make, working with those international partners and others,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can cross the Rubicon and violate the rights of the people of Hong Kong, or it can step back and understand the widespread concern of the international community\u201d.</p> <p>He insisted the proposed new law breached Beijing\u2019s international commitments to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle in the former colony.</p> <p>A number of Conservative MPs demanded that the UK reset its relations with China, but Raab said he wanted to continue to cooperate with China on issues such as trade and climate change. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, called for the UK government to \u201cstep up\u201d its response. She told MPs: \u201cIt is time for an international democratic alliance to come together and speak with one voice.\u201d</p>",

He normally lives in a stock photo about online banking. Unfortunately, that environment seems not to have prepared Robert for questions about why the government is easing lockdown when they themselves said they would not do so until the official alert level was 3. \u201cThe alert level is changing,\u201d Jenrick handwaved. \u201cWe are still at level 4 but we are transitioning to 3.\u201d Is this like when I still haven\u2019t done the ironing but I am transitioning to having done it? Have I, at that moment, done the ironing? No. Of course I haven\u2019t. But I WILL have. Scientifically, it\u2019s a hugely interesting space to be in.

You don\u2019t like to see that, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Occupying a similarly liminal space is the new joint biosecurity centre, which is supposed to assess the alert level, and for which Matt Hancock raised his bullshit category to 5 on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re getting it stood up,\u201d the health secretary blustered, as though it were an Ikea bookshelf, or a news story that 250,000 tests had been conducted, as long as you count cake tests, smoke alarm tests, pregnancy tests and online personality tests. \u201cIt\u2019s being formulated,\u201d Hancock went on of the biosecurity centre. \u201cIt\u2019s being pulled together.\u201d Sounds like it. Let us know if you need an Allen key. (Speaking of the ironing, these days my system is to do it during the 5pm Downing Street briefing. I find it helps to press down on something.)</p> <p>Staying with the good news, Priti Patel and Alok Sharma have reportedly been drafted in to \u201cbeef up\u201d the virus war cabinet. So this brains trust now comprises Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Hancock, Patel, Dominic Raab and Sharma. If you had to compare it to Harold Wilson\u2019s kitchen cabinet, I guess you\u2019d say it would be outperformed by the table. If they wanted to beef it up further they could buy 500g of mince.

Darren\u2019s a Conservative and Brexit campaigner, and the third brother Jedward refuse to talk about. In April, he endorsed Dominic Raab\u2019s view of Boris Johnson as a fighter. \u201cRaab would know this,\u201d he judged. \u201cHe\u2019s a karate black belt that trained and fought so hard he had to have a hip replaced.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster\">UK coronavirus live: Hancock announces further review into why BAME people more likely to die from coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moving on to middle-class etiquette black belt Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader has pushed for the full return of MPs to Westminster today and beyond.

He is assisted by the likes of Tory backbencher Christopher Chope, whose chief claim to fame is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-44524611/sir-christopher-chope-defends-blocking-upskirting-bill\">blocking a bill to criminalise upskirt photographs</a>, apparently to make some philosophical point about something or other. What an out-and-out Cnut. On Monday, Chope could be found dismissing the 2-metre social distancing rules as mere \u201cguidance\u201d, and suggesting that MPs were some kind of exception to them. Can he not he just use a 2-metre selfie stick like any normal committed pervert?</p> <p>As for the ongoing deceit over the alert level, it has now emerged that chief medical officer Chris Whitty refused to lower it, and thus allow his science to be led by the government. But by now you\u2019ll already be working on the principle that there\u2019s one elite threat level, and another one for the rest of us. All-powerful strategist Dominic Cummings is currently operating on an alert level of minus 5, connoting that he denies the existence not simply of the virus, but of China itself, and has powers to make you lick the railings outside a primary school if you wonder if no-deal Brexit is still the genius idea it once was.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s great news that Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t had to lose this Carnival Richelieu, this Otto von Jizzmark. I don\u2019t want you to read anything into the fact that alongside Cummings, last week\u2019s other highest-profile person to break the local lockdown rules was a 28-year-old Belgian princeling.

  "<p>Coronavirus infections in hospitals and care homes are spilling into the community and sustaining the outbreak to the point that cases will remain steady until September, a leading scientist has warned.</p> \n<p>Prof Neil Ferguson, the head of the outbreak modelling group at Imperial College London, said he was shocked at how poorly care homes had been protected from the virus and that infections in UK care homes and hospitals were now feeding into the epidemic in the wider community.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ferguson, who quit as a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) after breaking social-distancing rules, said that infected staff carrying the virus out of the workplace explained why the R value, the average number of people infected by a case, remained only marginally below one.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI, like many people, am shocked about how badly European \u2013 or countries around the world \u2013 have protected care home populations,\u201d Ferguson told a hearing of the Lords science committee. About 16,000 UK care home residents are believed to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/government-rejected-radical-lockdown-england-care-homes-coronavirus\">died from Covid-19</a> in outbreaks that have struck 38% of care homes in England and 59% in Scotland.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe infections in care homes and hospitals spill back into the community, more commonly through people who work in those institutions. If you can drive the infection rates low in those institutional settings, you drive the infection low in the community as a whole,\u201d Ferguson said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With the virus still circulating widely and restrictions being eased, Ferguson said there was \u201climited room for manoeuvre.\u201d Lockdown reduced the spread of infection by about 80%, he said, \u201cbut to maintain control, we need to keep that transmission suppressed by about 65% so we have a little bit of wriggle room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Matt Keeling from Warwick University, whose modelling group is now providing the government\u2019s \u201cworst case scenario\u201d, suggested that researchers might have done more to understand the risks to care homes in particular.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf the lockdown had been very strict, if we\u2019d have thought more about what was happening in care homes and hospitals early on, maybe that was one of the areas where modellers did drop the ball,\u201d Keeling told the hearing. \u201cWith hindsight, it\u2019s very easy to say we know care homes and hospitals are these huge collections of very vulnerable individuals, so maybe with hindsight we could have modelled those early on and thought about the impacts there.\u201d</p> \n<p>The researchers said it is still unclear what impact the recent easing of restrictions will have on the spread of the virus, but Ferguson dampened any expectations that the epidemic might peter out any time soon. \u201cI suspect that under any scenario, the level of transmission and number of cases will remain relatively flat between now and September, short of very big policy changes or behaviour changes in the community,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe real uncertainty is if there are larger policy changes in September, as we move into the time of year when respiratory viruses tend to transmit slightly better, what will happen then? And that remains very unclear,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Under further questioning about the outbreak, Ferguson described how scientists realised in early March that the UK had been much more heavily infected than anticipated, and that this was one of the reasons the country now has if not the largest, then one of the largest, epidemics in Europe.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOne thing the genetic data is showing us now is most chains of transmission still existing in the UK originated from Spain, to some extent Italy,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cIt is clear that before we were even in a position to measure it, before surveillance systems were even set up, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals coming into the country in late February and early March from that area. And that meant that the epidemic was further ahead than we had anticipated.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThat explains some of the acceleration of policy then. It also explains, to some extent, why mortality figures ended up being higher than we had hoped,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>As ministers ease restrictions in England, health officials will rely on the new test-and-trace system to identify and clamp down on new outbreaks. The tests would be offered to people with symptoms, but since many people were infectious before feeling ill, and many never show symptoms at all, the system would have only limited use, the committee heard.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cBy the time someone shows symptoms they have probably been infectious for a day or two,\u201d&nbsp;said Adam Kucharski, an associate professor and infectious disease modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cAs soon as someone becomes symptomatic, you have a very short time window before their contacts may become infectious and then you\u2019ve got another generation of transmission to deal with.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ferguson said the test-and-trace scheme \u201cwas not a panacea\u201d because it relied not only on what proportion of people developed symptoms, but what proportion could identify past contacts, how quickly they could be contacted, and how many then abided by the self-isolation rules. He told the hearing that if the system worked perfectly, it might at best reduce R by 0.2 to 0.25, describing that as \u201csignificant, but not huge\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Poachers have killed at least six elephants in a single day in Ethiopia, wildlife officials said on Tuesday, the largest such slaughter in memory in the east African nation.</p> <p>The elephants died last week, when they ventured out of the Mago National Park in the far south of Ethiopia to drink water, Ganabul Bulmi, the park\u2019s chief warden, told reporters.</p> <p>\u201cThe poachers then removed all the tusks from the elephants.

  "<p>An oil well in the Indian state of Assam is still leaking gas \u201cuncontrollably\u201d after a blowout a week ago that it is feared has killed endangered river dolphins and birds and forced 2,500 people to evacuate their homes.</p> <p>For days authorities have failed to plug the leak from the well in the village of Baghjan after the incident on 27 May. The blowout \u2013 an uncontrolled release of oil and gas due to the failure of pressure control systems \u2013 sent a fountain of crude oil into the air, \u201cunleashing a hell\u201d, according to local accounts.</p> <p>A continuous spray of cold water is being used to cool the leaking natural gas to prevent it igniting and causing an explosion.</p> <p>As the impact spread, the National Disaster Response Force was called in and about 2,500 people have been taken to relief camps.</p> <p>According to Oil India Limited&nbsp;(OIL), which operates the well, gas was still flowing uncontrollably from the leak on Tuesday. The company has called in foreign experts in an attempt to get the leak under control, but locals and environmental activists say that untold damage has already been done to the rare biodiversity of the area, as well as to essential local agriculture.</p> <p>Baghjan village, where the rig is located, sits next to the protected Dibru Saikhowa national park and Maguri Beel wetlands, which is home to dozens of species of migratory birds, rare wildlife and aquatic species. However, the rivers running into the wetlands are said to have become contaminated from the explosion, with the residue from the oil spill sitting on the surface of the water, leading to the poisoning and suffocation of aquatic species.</p> <p>At least one critically endangered Gangetic river dolphin has been found dead in the nearby river, its outer skin scaly and peeling, and locals fear there are other carcasses in less accessible locations. Several endangered birds and fish have also been found dead, and a sticky layer of oil has formed on the leaves of the trees in the national park.</p> <p>\u201cThe company [OIL] has failed in every aspect,\u201d said Niranta Gohain, an environmental activist from the area. Gohain accused the company of safety lapses and said the blowout had \u201cerased a humbly balanced rural economy\u201d.</p> <p>There has also been a high human cost. Locals have complained of headaches, burning eyes and nasal passages and respiratory problems since the rig blowout. Many families in the surrounding area also rely on fishing in the rivers, now feared contaminated, for their food and livelihoods, and livestock such as chickens have already been found dead.</p> <p>The Baghjan gas leak is the latest in a series of industrial disasters in India. Less than a month ago a factory in Andhra Pradesh state exploded, leaking toxic gas into the air and killing 12 people. India\u2019s top environmental court this week blamed \u201cgross human failure\u201d and lack of basic safety norms for the incident.</p> <p>Environmentalists said the oil rig explosion also exposed the environmental risk posed by allowing rigs to operate so close to protected areas of biodiversity. Just last month, OIL were given permission to drill in seven locations in Dibru Saikhowa national park.</p> <p>Following an inspection of the blowout site on Sunday, OIL\u2019s chairman and managing director Sushil Chandra Mishra told reporters: \u201cOur focus is on providing relief to the people affected by the accident at the time of Covid-19 while trying to bring the operations back to normal.\u201d</p> <p>A statement from OIL said the company was \u201cawaiting the observations and findings of the district administration, forest department, pollution control board so that all necessary steps can be taken\u201d.</p>",

Cities still have a future, but the specific kind of&nbsp;city&nbsp;that has become globally dominant today shouldn\u2019t have a place in it.</p> <p>In&nbsp;places&nbsp;like London and New York, the development model over the past few decades has catered to the needs of elite individuals, powerful corporations and wealthy investors.

A set of intersecting crises has made urban life increasingly difficult for all but the wealthy. Housing has become unaffordable and insecure. Work has become casualised and wages have stagnated, leaving many workers unable to sustain an adequate standard of living. Despite pretensions towards multiculturalism, a white power structure has maintained <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects-and-publications/equality-and-integration/london-ethnic-inequalities.html\">racialised inequalities</a> in nearly all aspects of economic and political life, including <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/the-london-clearances-a-background-paper-on-race-housing-and-policing/\">housing</a>, <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/article/med/26665383\">health</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/met-police-cressida-dick-no-longer-institutionally-racist-racism-black-officer-a9001176.html\">policing</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s this&nbsp;urban model&nbsp;that has&nbsp;proved&nbsp;highly vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The&nbsp;only&nbsp;solution to the urban crises we face is&nbsp;to establish a new direction for cities that reverses the inequities this pandemic has exposed.</p> <p>Emergency responses to coronavirus&nbsp;have shown that rapid change is possible. In neighbourhoods across the world, mutual aid networks have sprung up to coordinate everything from grocery shopping to rent strikes.&nbsp;Some cities acted swiftly to house the homeless, halt evictions,&nbsp;adjust traffic patterns&nbsp;and provide necessary health care. The reaction to the pandemic shows that the structures sustaining the unequal city are movable \u2013 and can be altered faster than had been assumed.</p> <p>As cities begin to change in response to the pandemic, it\u2019s crucial that they don\u2019t return to their previous trajectory.

  "<p>Look at America today and you see a land defined by death. People are dying alone in hospital beds and bedrooms. They\u2019re dying in the streets. They\u2019re dying inside as the economy collapses around them and their hopes for tomorrow evaporate. They\u2019re&nbsp;dying because they can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Try to explain it all \u2013 much less cope with it \u2013 and our powers fail us. The reasons are too numerous, the enemies too powerful. How does a nation deal, all at once, with a deadly pandemic which its government is incompetent to protect it from; with an economic collapse unlike anything in living memory \u2013 and perhaps anything in modern history; with an explosion of rage on the streets, the fire sparked by the murder of George Floyd and the kindling heaped generously on top by centuries \u2013 <em>centuries</em> \u2013 of white supremacy?&nbsp;</p> <p>Each of these tragedies affects black Americans uniquely, disproportionately. Any explanation has to begin there, with the racial disparities and oppressions which divide the nation \u2013 not only because they illustrate the failure of America to deliver on its promise, not just because they fuel the unrest in the streets today, but most of all because they sustain in power the forces which are continuing to tear America further apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>What many white Americans are experiencing as a moment of acute crisis is just a sampling of the chronic crisis of disease, economic hardship and state violence that shapes the black experience in America. Black Americans have higher rates of chronic illness, including <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/02/469186/eliminating-racial-disparities-maternal-infant-mortality/\">shockingly</a> high rates of infant mortality. The <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">median wealth</a> of a black household is just a tenth that of a white household. In Minneapolis, where the protests began, the median white family has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/30/minneapolis-racial-inequality/\">double</a> the income of the median black family. And statistics <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\">show</a> that nationwide, one in every thousand black men can expect to be killed by police over the course of their lifetime \u2013 a rate 2.5 times that of white men.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given this baseline, it is no surprise that today\u2019s problems also have an outsize impact on black Americans. Black Americans are dying of coronavirus at nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-coronavirus-death-toll-racial-disparity-inequality\">three times</a> the rate of white Americans. Although the economic impact of coronavirus for the poorest Americans has been blunted for now, expanded unemployment checks will stop coming at the end of July. When that happens, black Americans will suffer disproportionately. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1266952661791674370\">videos</a> circulating on social media of America\u2019s poorly trained and over-armed law enforcement agencies meting out violence show what happens whenever they attempt to protest their plight.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite his deep culpability, Donald Trump is, in a sense, incidental to this story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But to understand what has gone wrong with America, we have to widen the lens. It is fashionable to refer to racism as America\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d, a phrase which assigns culpability to previous generations while ignoring how decisions in the here and now perpetuate America\u2019s failure to live up to the promise of the founding. But racism doesn\u2019t just inflict specific blows, both physical and psychic, on black Americans and other Americans of color. It is used cynically as a means of maintaining power by the same leaders who are currently failing so disastrously to deal with economic and public health tragedies that are affecting all Americans, regardless of color.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite his deep culpability, Donald Trump is, in a sense, incidental to this story \u2013 a lucky opportunist who was in the right place at the right time. More significant are the forces which propelled him to power and stuck by him long past the time it became clear he had no business being there. Republicans have chosen to pin their own fate and that of the nation on a law-breaking, racist, corrupt ignoramus for so long as he embodies the white grievance which now defines their politics. Even with disease ravaging the land, public trust in the authorities collapsing and blood in the streets, what used to be called the conservative movement \u2013 but what we should now call the Trump movement \u2013 sticks by a president who has manifestly made each of these crises worse.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no way to escape the American carnage unfolding across the nation without tackling this truth head on. The last few years, then the last few days, have confirmed it. The forces of white rage and entitled grievance are willing to see America destroyed before they are willing to allow a dilution of their own power. America will still exist, of course, but only as a place rather than a promise. Every act of state violence, every deranged presidential tweet encouraging it, every act of disenfranchisement, every elected official who looks on and does nothing to stop it \u2013 they are all choking that promise away.

The unrest sweeping the country could be the undoing of Trump \u2013 or it could dramatically increase his power. Which will it be? Toss a coin. Heads means this is the beginning of the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, tails means we can expect another term.</p> <p>I am not being flippant; I am trying to be realistic. There has been a lot of speculation about how the protests will affect Trump\u2019s chance of re-election, but the truth is that none of us, not even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/jan/06/trump-tweets-i-am-a-stable-genius-video\">a very stable genius</a> such as me, know how this will play out. By rights, a million different crises \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\">the Russia investigation</a> to the disputed accusation that he raped the journalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/e-jean-carroll-trump-rape-accuser-dna-sample\">E Jean Carroll</a>&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">his handling of the pandemic</a> \u2013 should have sunk Trump by now. But when it comes to this president, the normal rules do not seem to apply. One week, Trump is suggesting that we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">inject bleach to ward off the coronavirus</a>, the next he is threatening martial law. Everyone is shocked for a second, then we move on to his next drama.</p> <p>There is a school of thought that argues the urban uprisings in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/opinions/carnage-trump-right-and-wrong-answers-avlon/index.html\">will help Trump</a>. There have been numerous <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-06-01/trump-riots-protests-military\">comparisons to&nbsp;1968</a>, when Richard Nixon exploited an anti-riot backlash and rode a law-and-order platform to electoral victory. Trump seems to be trying his best to pull a Nixon. Before his extraordinary speech on Monday, he held an equally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">extraordinary&nbsp;video conference</a>&nbsp;with governors and law enforcement officials. On the call, Trump told participants that they were \u201cweak\u201d and needed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you\u2019ll never see this stuff again,\u201d&nbsp;Trump said. In other words: lock up a lot of people who might not vote for him. That is one way to win an election.</p> <p>There is another school of thought, however, that reckons this moment will harm Trump more than it helps him. He may be trying to ape Nixon, but there are enormous differences between 1968 and 2020 \u2013 not least the fact that Nixon was not trying to win a second term. Trump is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-retweets-account-slamming-democrats-as-floyd-protests-erupt-2020-5\">doing his best to blame Democrats</a>&nbsp;for the unrest, but he can\u2019t get around the fact that he is the president. He is the one who is supposed to be in charge.</p> <p>Again, it is too early to say how the situation will play out for Trump. It is, however, fair to say that Trump is in trouble \u2013 and he knows it. The protests don\u2019t exist in a vacuum:&nbsp;the coronavirus&nbsp;crisis means&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html\">one in four American workers</a>&nbsp;has filed for unemployment benefits and some of the country\u2019s swing states are expected to see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-01/trump-faces-drag-of-job-losses-topping-16-in-vital-2020-states\">prolonged job losses</a>. Trump is also doing very badly in the polls: Joe Biden has a 10-point lead over him in an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/01/poll-biden-lead-over-trump-general-election-293550\">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a>&nbsp;from Sunday and the president\u2019s approval rating has <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?cid=rrpromo\">dipped </a><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?cid=rrpromo\">below 43%</a>. Trump is in trouble, which means trouble for the US. As the president made clear in his speech on Monday, he will not disappear without a fight \u2013 no matter how much collateral damage that causes.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist </p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The UK\u2019s fishing industry has accused the EU of using a \u201cnuclear option\u201d to secure a Brexit deal, warning that it is prepared for blockades by the French if trade talks collapse.</p> <p>Fishing leaders have also revealed they do not support an extension to the transition period despite being hit badly by the coronavirus pandemic, with the closure of restaurants and hotels affecting sales.</p> <p>Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations said the industry is relishing liberation from the common fisheries policy, claiming decades of&nbsp;injustices, such as French boats being allowed to catch 84% of the quota of cod in the Channel, for instance.</p> <p>Deas claims the EU\u2019s \u201chardline position\u201d involves zero compromise and \u201crequires capitulation\u201d by the UK over its demands for a fairer share of the catch from British waters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fishing makes up 0.1% of the UK economy but it has found itself at the centre of the trade row because it is so emblematic of Brexit, with communities demanding the government \u201ctakes back control\u201d of British waters.</p> <p>Talks are at a crunch stage, with the EU saying there can be no trade deal without an agreement on fisheries by the end of June to allow fresh quota levels to be set for January next year when the transition period is due to end.</p> <p>\u201cThis is something of a nuclear option \u2026 so far, there\u2019s no sign of compromise from the member states, particularly the member states that benefit from the current arrangements, and the EU mandate doesn\u2019t really provide any scope for compromise, what it requires is capitulation by the UK. My assessment is that that\u2019s not very likely \u2013 fishing remains an emblematic issue for the government,\u201d said Deas.&nbsp;</p> <p>His comments came as the fourth round of Brexit talks about trade and the future relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday.</p> <p>In the past week, both sides have lowered their expectations, saying they think it is unlikely the impasse on fisheries and other issues will be broken.&nbsp;</p> <p>At a press briefing, Deas said the industry did not support an extension to the transition period and that skirmishes between English and French fishing leaders would be almost inevitable.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cFrance benefits more than anybody else from relative stability from the current quota shares. If there\u2019s any change to that, those quota shares or any other aspect that affects French fishermen, as day follows night there will be blockades, they have done it for much less in the past,\u201d said Deas.</p> <p>He said other countries take \u201ca much more pragmatic\u201d view and recognise that \u201cquota shares will have to change\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be a reaction in France by the fishermen, that\u2019s just the nature of the beast,\u201d he said but added that that was not a reason \u201cnot to do what we\u2019re doing\u201d or to extend the transition period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"136c18344dd9a3211f981ae0e2b040ee2471402d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/136c18344dd9a3211f981ae0e2b040ee2471402d/158_72_3099_1861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French and British fishing boats collide in the Channel over scallop fishing rights in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French and British fishing boats collide in the Channel over scallop fishing rights in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters TV/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years ago, British and French boats clashed in the Channel in what became known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/17/france-and-uk-agree-new-deal-to-end-scallop-wars\">\u201cscallop wars\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Elspeth Macdonald, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation, warned that the French had much to lose if talks break down, with 5,000 jobs in Boulogne dependent on the business.</p> <p>She also pointed out that the fishing industry by value is worth \u201cabout \u00a31bn in each direction\u201d. However, this is split by 11 nations, with Ireland, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands being particularly hit by any reduced access to British waters.</p> <p>Last week, the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had spoken to 11 fishing ministers and there would be no change to his mandate.</p>",
  "<p>Labour has accused the government of attempting a power-grab for the executive by pushing through a bill which that strip parliament of its role in approving the imminent redrawing of UK parliamentary boundaries.</p> <p>The decision to base the new boundaries on the electoral register as it stands in December this year would also greatly skew the process, Labour is arguing, as the chaos caused by coronavirus will depress numbers on electoral rolls, and many students might not be registered.</p> <p>The parliamentary boundaries bill, which sets the process in motion, will be scrutinised on Tuesday by the Commons for the first time, as it receives its second reading.</p> <p>The initial plan had been for boundaries to be redrawn through reducing the size of the Commons from 650 seats to 600, but this element has been abandoned, in part due to unrest among Conservative MPs whose seats would have vanished.</p> <p>The revised plan will keep the 650-seat total, but there still could be considerable changes, with the boundary commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland making recommendations to even up the constituency populations, given demographic changes over time.</p> <p>Under previous plans, the commissions\u2019 plans would be scrutinised and voted on by the Commons and Lords. But in a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2020-03-24/HLWS179/\">government update in March</a>, titled Strengthening Democracy, the Cabinet Office said this would no longer be the case.</p> <p>Instead the changes would automatically become law. This would, the Cabinet Office said, \u201cprovide certainty that the recommendations of the independent boundary commissions \u2013 developed through a robust and impartial process that is open to extensive consultation \u2013 would then be implemented without interference\u201d.</p> <p>The only way MPs could stop this would be to amend the relevant laws to allow a vote.</p> <p>Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/10/uk-parliamentary-boundary-changes-final-plans-unveiled\">has previously accused the government</a> of seeking to use the constituency changes to its own advantage, and fears it could use the new power to change boundaries without a vote in the future.</p> <p>Analysis of the previous, 600-seat system showed that in the 2017 election it would have brought Theresa May an absolute majority, rather than a hung parliament.</p> <p>The party is also concerned at the use of&nbsp;1 December as the electoral register on which to gauge the boundaries. Aside from the impact of Covid, Labour says the lack of an election in 2020 would depress numbers.</p> <p>It is also possible students will not have returned to universities by then, meaning areas with high student populations, which are often strongly pro-Labour, might be under-represented in the new boundaries.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office is understood to still be examining whether a register from another date might work better, given the impact of coronavirus.</p> <p>Cat Smith, the shadow Cabinet Office minister whose brief covers voter engagement, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to end parliamentary oversight by denying MPs the chance to vote on the&nbsp;boundary&nbsp;review process is yet another attempt to diminish scrutiny and concentrate power in the hands of the executive.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cThe new&nbsp;boundaries&nbsp;will be dangerously unrepresentative of the current electorate. Choosing the electoral register of 1 December 2020 as the basis for drawing new&nbsp;boundaries&nbsp;is politically motivated. The December 2020 register will be heavily affected by Covid-19 as local councils will struggle to update electoral registers whilst dealing with this crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Chloe Smith, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for constitutional matters, said the bill \u201cwill strengthen the independence of the boundary review process, to prevent yet more delays and interference in updating our parliamentary constituencies - which are now 20 years old\u201d.</p> <p>She said:\u201cParliament still has the opportunity to scrutinise our plans and parliament must still collectively decide to approve them.<br><br>\u201cWe are, however, already considering potential alternatives to the data used for the next boundary review, to reflect the practical consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. We have and continue to engage with political parties and election administrators, and will update parliament in due course.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>If you had seen them, you might have thought they were ramblers or dog walkers \u2013 locals snatching some fresh air as the nation hunkered indoors during lockdown. Only their equipment would have given them away: metal detectors, a shovel and a spade, that they humped uncomfortably up a vertiginous path.</p> <p>They turned off the main road and drove a quarter of a mile down a single track dark with trees, past the occasional house and fields of rolling countryside. It was probably early morning when the car pulled up at a wooden fence, on which were carved the words \u201cGRAY HILL, COMPTON\u201d. From here, it is a stiff, scrambling climb up Gray Hill, towards a cluster of ancient standing stones that loom out of scrubland like broken teeth. Here, if the weather is clear, you can look out towards the Severn estuary.</p> <p>But these people \u2013 there was probably more than one of them \u2013 were not here to enjoy the view, but to commit a crime. Stealthily, they beep-beeped their way across the scrubland, metal detectors in hand. They dug four large holes, pocketing whatever they found, replaced the turf and disappeared. No one knows what they stole that day and no one knows how they came to be there; Gray Hill is not a place you happen upon by chance. But we know what they were doing: nighthawking, illegally metal-detecting for historic artefacts, to be kept for personal collections or sold on the black market for private gain.</p> <p>Even the coronavirus lockdown did not stop nighthawkers. The Gray Hill nighthawking was discovered by Gwent police on 6 May. A week earlier, on 20 April, PCSO Sarah Wilson of Cheshire police\u2019s rural crime team was on a routine patrol when she noticed two men metal-detecting in a stream in the village of Wildboarclough.</p> <p>Wilson asked the men if they had permission to metal-detect there and if they realised they were breaking the lockdown rules. The men claimed they thought metal-detecting was a form of permitted exercise (it was not), and said that they had been given permission by the landowner. Wilson took their details and went to check with the landowner. No consent had been given. Wilson had just caught two nighthawkers in the act \u2013 or she would have, had they not scarpered.</p> <p>No one knows the full extent of nighthawking in the UK, or whether it is increasing. There is no marker on the national police database for the crime, so police forces vary in how they record it (although there is one for nighthawking on scheduled monuments). Many simply mark it as theft, or trespass, while many cases are never reported because it is impossible to say what has been taken. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s just a hole in a field,\u201d says Dr Louise Nicholas, an expert on heritage crime at Loughborough University. A 2010 report from Historic England, however, hints at how widespread the crime may really be: 17% of the farmers it had surveyed had been afflicted by nighthawks. Nighthawkers have targeted some of our most famous historical sites, including Hadrian\u2019s Wall and Old Sarum in Dorset.</p> <p>Those tasked with fighting this crime also disagree on whether&nbsp;it is increasing. \u201cI think it is going up, as metal-detecting equipment becomes cheaper and more easily available, and more people take up the hobby,\u201d says Sgt Rob Simpson of Cheshire police\u2019s rural crime team. But Mark Harrison, who heads Historic England\u2019s nighthawking investigations, is not so sure. \u201cI am not seeing more cases in my in-tray,\u201d says the former policeman. According to Nicholas, \u201cThe data is really<em>&nbsp;</em>bad on it ... the data we have got suggests it is increasing, but that may be because more attention is paid to it now.\u201d In other words, we simply do not know, because most nighthawkers tend to get away with it. After all, who can police all the fields in the country?</p> <p>The law varies across the UK. In Northern Ireland, it is illegal to remove any archaeological items from the ground without the landowner\u2019s written consent. All objects found must be reported within two weeks. A similar law exists in Scotland. In England and Wales, you need permission from the landowner to go metal-detecting, unless the site is historically protected, in which case all metal-detecting is illegal. If you find treasure \u2013 gold or silver \u2013 you have to report it. Failure to do so is a crime. If your find is significant, you may be in line for financial compensation from the treasure valuation committee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59428cb2bc6b063d0eb8841fd62b5ca6f9bb477b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59428cb2bc6b063d0eb8841fd62b5ca6f9bb477b/0_105_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the treasures, believed to be Anglo-Saxon, that were discovered in the biggest nighthawking case in British history, involving George Powell and Layton Davies.

Privately, police officers express irritation that the show can be used as an idiot\u2019s guide to the choicest places to nighthawk. That, and a hi-vis vest: Harrison tells me that nighthawkers will don them in the middle of the day to give the impression of legitimacy.</p> <p>The biggest nighthawking case in British history took place in a field near Leominster in 2015. George Powell and Layton Davies found 300 Viking coins, as well as a ninth-century gold ring, dragon\u2019s head bracelet and crystal rock pendant, on land belonging to Lord Cawley of Leominster. The coins revealed an alliance between King Alfred and King Ceolwulf II that historians did not know existed \u2013 they literally rewrote history. The men did not hand in their find to the authorities, but sold almost all of it on the black market. In 2019, Powell and Davies were jailed for a combined 18 and a half years.</p> <p>Amanda Blakeman, the national police lead for heritage crime, tells me that the Leominster hoard was one of the most interesting cases of her career. \u201cIt would be a stretch to say they were organised criminals,\u201d she says of Powell and Davies. Their undoing, Blakeman says, came from their decision to take one of the coins to the National Museum of Wales. \u201cThey wanted to get an identification of what they had got, but they did not declare that they had recovered a significant amount of coins,\u201d she explains. Later, when Powell and Davies tried to offload the rest of the stash, a potential buyer became suspicious and contacted the police. \u201cDuring the subsequent investigation into how the coins came to be sold, we were able to find them, because they had made that initial visit to a museum,\u201d Blakeman says. (The museum had taken their details.)</p> <p>We may never know the true extent of what was lost. Apart from 31 coins and some jewellery, almost all of the Leominster hoard remains missing. \u201cThose coins dated from the Anglo-Saxon period, which is a relatively poorly understood period of history,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cBy removing the coins illegally, and not declaring the location they were found in, the context has been destroyed. We have lost the ability to learn more about the period they were from.\u201d</p> <p>Nighthawkers tend to offload their illicit gains through specialist dealers or online marketplaces such as eBay or Facebook. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any archaeological experts on staff at eBay UK who monitor sales to ensure that antiquities sourced from looting or nighthawking aren\u2019t being sold,\u201d says Dr Lauren Dundler of Macquarie University, an expert in stolen antiquities. \u201cThere are serious issues that need to be addressed in how Facebook Marketplace, and the wider platform, is regulated,\u201d she adds. \u201cExperts have been warning Facebook since 2014 that the platform could be utilised by illicit looters ... and yet nothing has been done.\u201d Some of these stolen antiquities are sold on private Facebook groups, but others are in plain sight.</p> <p>\u201cAll listings must comply with the law,\u201d an eBay spokesperson comments. \u201cOur listing policies are informed and influenced by experts from relevant organisations, including the British Museum and the International Council of Museums, and authorities including the Met Police. We also closely cooperate with these experts when enforcing our policies. We will remove any listings that do not comply, and take action against the sellers.\u201d</p> <p>At Facebook, meanwhile, a spokesperson says: \u201cCoordinating illegal activity is not allowed on Facebook. We are continuing to improve the methods we use to detect and remove posts and listings that involve the illegal sale of historical artefacts.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Powell and Davies are not the only nighthawkers to defraud us of our cultural history. In 2012, Peter Cox and Darren West looted artefacts from the site of a former Roman town in Northamptonshire. Mark Harrison of Historic England says that because Cox and West kept returning to the scene of the crime, they were caught red-handed. \u201cTheir holes were so big that we thought some form of archeological excavation had been going on,\u201d says Harrison, \u201cso we sent some inspectors to assess the damage. They caught them in the act \u2026 when we downloaded their cameras, we found that they had taken pictures of themselves digging the holes.\u201d</p> <p>Wait a minute, I say. They actually photographed themselves committing a crime? Harrison\u2019s stern mien slips for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fisherman,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to take a picture of the fish.\u201d</p> <p>Is there a profile of a typical nighthawker? Harrison says not. \u201cAnyone could be involved in it,\u201d he says darkly. Other experts agree. But reading through the list of nighthawking cases Harrison has worked on during his career \u2013 he helpfully sends it over \u2013 a few things stand out. Every case involved a white male, usually middle-aged, working alone or in a pair. One case even involved a former police officer.</p> <p>What makes someone wave a metal detector in a rainy, pockmarked field for hours on end? \u201cFor those who don\u2019t do it, metal-detecting is seen as a strange passion,\u201d says Professor Michael Lewis of the British Museum. Catherine Lange of the National Council for Metal Detecting attempts to explain its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2026 opening a Christmas present,\u201d Lange says. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way I can describe it. I bring things home and my husband rolls his eyes and I think, \u2018That\u2019s something we lost 700 years ago and it\u2019s still there.\u2019\u201d She exhales. \u201cI find that <em> </em>fascinating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9e2b85c0f1ef6d3578310f613679520fe26df5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e2b85c0f1ef6d3578310f613679520fe26df5e/0_306_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man with metal detector silhouetted against  blue sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Archaeologists rely on the goodwill of the metal-detecting community to record their finds.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Burt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police take nighthawking seriously. But there is a split over the best way to deal with metal detectorists who do not technically break the law, but hang on to items that they should be handing in. In England and Wales, treasure must be reported. But other archeological finds, such as belts, buckles, fragments of Anglo-Saxon pottery, you can keep. Metal detectorists are strongly encouraged to hand them in to the British Museum and the National Museum Wales\u2019s <a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/database\">portable </a><a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/database\">antiquities </a><a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/database\">scheme</a> (PAS), so that historians can document them for posterity. But it is not illegal if you do not. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, however, all archeological finds have to be reported.</p> <p>Not everyone thinks our leniency is a good thing. \u201cThe portable antiquities scheme tries to make it look like metal detectorists are helping archeology,\u201d says Paul Barford, an archeologist and blogger. \u201cThat would be true if the majority of stuff were being reported. But it\u2019s not! People are just walking off with objects.\u201d Barford would like to see metal-detecting become taboo to prevent this plundering. \u201cPeople need to start thinking, \u2018Is this right?\u2019\u201d Barford says. \u201cIt should be socially unacceptable. That\u2019s the way artefact-hunting should have been treated all along.\u201d</p> <p>Barford is a controversial figure \u2013 many in the archeological establishment do not agree with him, at least not publicly. Barford characterises himself as an outsider who can say what he is thinking without fear of losing funding: \u201cPeople are afraid to speak out.\u201d There may be some truth to his claim. One 2017 paper <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2017.1298397\">suggested</a> there could be between 14,419 and 27,897 metal detectorists in England and Wales, and that even if the lower estimate was accepted, only 30% of them were reporting any of their finds to the PAS. (These figures have been disputed.)</p> <p>Lewis heads the PAS, and accepts that the system is imperfect. \u201cThe problem we have is that we can\u2019t instruct people that they <em>have </em>to record their finds, we can only advise them that they should,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like a bit more of a stick to go with a carrot at times.\u201d</p> <p>He would like to see metal detectorists having to sign up to codes of practice and promising to register their finds. \u201cThe way I see it is that all these objects out there are like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand the more we have of them, the bigger our picture of the past. If people aren\u2019t reporting their finds, the picture isn\u2019t as big as it could be. It\u2019s a bigger picture than just nighthawking.\u201d But he believes that most metal detectorists are<em> </em>responsible and do hand things in.</p> <p>And Lewis is adamant that stigmatising detectorists is not the way to go. \u201cWe\u2019d lose a lot of information in this country if we banned metal-detecting,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of the most important archeological finds in Britain over the last 20 years have come through metal-detecting.\u201d The Staffordshire hoard, the Watlington hoard, the Frome hoard: all were found by metal detectorists who did the right thing. Because they were on private land, they could have been destroyed by agricultural ploughing, had they not been detected.</p> <p>Archaeologists rely on the goodwill of the metal-detecting community to record their finds and, at the moment, relations are good \u2013 but this wasn\u2019t always the case. In the 1980s, the Stop Taking Our Past campaign tried to have metal-detecting banned, but failed. The rift between archeologists and the metal-detecting community took decades to heal. \u201cHostility doesn\u2019t help anybody,\u201d says Lange. \u201cAll it does is drive it underground.\u201d</p> <p>She dislikes the term nighthawking. \u201cWe want it called what it is,\u201d Lange says, \u201cwhich is theft. There\u2019s almost a romanticism about the word nighthawking.\u201d She hates the way that responsible detectorists get lumped in with the criminals. \u201cPeople think that\u2019s what metal detectorists do, and that\u2019s not what we recognise among our members,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know the vast majority report their finds.\u201d</p> <p>Lange reports all her finds. Recently, she discovered a 14th-century brooch in the north Oxfordshire countryside. \u201cIt was bronze and had three lions on it with their tails wiggling around,\u201d she says reverentially. She gave it back to the landowner, who will donate it to the local village\u2019s archives for posterity.</p> <p>A lion\u2019s head brooch winking in the soil. A pot of gold buried by departing Viking invaders in the certainty that they would return. A bracelet warmed on the body of a woman now turned to dust, whose name has been forgotten. All these things and more, glinting relics of our common history, salvaged from the earth. Yours to find, if not to keep.</p> <p><br></p>",

You can\u2019t swim in a public pool, because they are closed. And you can\u2019t swim in a private pool, because you\u2019re not an ostentatious millionaire.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Wild swimming?</strong>&nbsp;No, because the law clearly states that every time you go wild swimming, you have to write a 2,000-word first-person piece about it for a broadsheet newspaper magazine supplement, and honestly, who has the time?</p> <p><strong>So, that leaves the sea.&nbsp;</strong>Yes. And even then, that\u2019s not really such a great idea. The sea, you see, is absolutely teeming with viruses.</p> <p><em><strong>The</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;virus?</strong>&nbsp;No, not&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;virus, but&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;virus where you get ear infections and diarrhoea from submerging your head in raw sewage.</p> <p><strong>Oh God.</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, but it\u2019s true. A new health survey by the University of Exeter has revealed that swimming in the sea makes you <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sea-bathers-three-times-as-likely-to-suffer-illness-chh7f0nnd\">three times more likely to report infections</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What sort of infections?</strong>&nbsp;Sea-bathers are four times as likely to report ear infections and twice as likely to visit their doctor with skin conditions as people who do not enter the sea. Plus they are at greater risk of respiratory illness and gastroenteritis, too, which is fun.</p> <p><strong>But why?</strong>&nbsp;Because the sea is awful, clearly. Everything about it is awful. It\u2019s full of animals that can eat you, you can drown in it and now it turns out that it\u2019s so dirty that you would be better off rolling around in a massive pile of bogies.</p> <p><strong>Is there anything that can be done?&nbsp;</strong>Sure. You could always check the <a href=\"https://www.sas.org.uk/map/\">Surfers Against Sewage real-time water quality map</a>, which lists all the dirtiest water that you should definitely not try swimming in. For example, right now you should avoid Whitby, Weston-Super-Mare, Scarborough and Clacton.</p> <p><strong>Because the quality of water is so bad there?&nbsp;</strong>Let\u2019s say yes.</p> <p><strong>So you\u2019re saying I should definitely not swim in the sea.</strong>&nbsp;Not at all. There are many health benefits to swimming. But at the same time, there are still risks attached, and you should be aware of them. Consider it the aquatic equivalent of not following the arrows around Tesco Express.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Fine then, I\u2019ll just go to the beach instead.</strong>&nbsp;DON\u2019T GO TO THE BEACH!

  "<p>Separating parents are fighting each other through the courts over whether their children should return to school as lockdown is eased, a leading family lawyer has revealed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/01/thousands-return-school-england-parents-phased-reopening-covid-19-lockdown-pupils\">The reopening of classrooms</a> in England is developing into a battleground for divorcing couples who disagree over whether their children should be allowed back to school or kept at home for safety reasons, according to Sarah Williams, legal director at the London family law firm Payne Hicks Beach.</p> <p>Williams is dealing with several cases where divorcing mothers and fathers are taking disagreements over what should happen to their child to the family courts. Her colleagues are dealing with similar disputes.</p> <p>\u201cThey are quite acrimonious,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere\u2019s a time pressure. It\u2019s difficult for parents to know which authorities they should be listening to. People are quoting regulations and government recommendations.</p> <p>\u201cIn one case, the mother is saying her daughters need social interaction after weeks inside the same four walls and that they are at low risk. The father is saying he can work flexibly at home and there\u2019s no need to subject them to any risk by sending them back to school.</p> <p>\u201cI have never been busier. There\u2019s more to argue about. There are disputes between ex-partners over whether children should wear face masks or carry hand gel.</p> <p>\u201cIt opens up a whole can of worms for parents. It\u2019s not clear what\u2019s right for the child. People feel very strongly about the risks of the virus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/more-cases-of-rare-syndrome-in-children-reported-globally\">Kawasaki syndrome</a> [the rare inflammatory condition that appears to be connected to coronavirus infection].\u201d</p> <p>Family courts have been dealing with urgent cases only throughout the pandemic crisis, some via remote video hearings. They can be difficult to organise with children present in the home.</p> <p>Early on in the lockdown, there were fears that court-sanctioned child custody arrangements would be disrupted by restrictions on leaving home.</p> <p>Williams said there was no consistent gender pattern as to whether it was the mother or father who was more protective or in favour of letting a child mingle with classmates. Some parents had been \u201cterrified\u201d about letting their children out.</p> <p>Previously disputes between separating couples were usually over which school a child should attend, Williams said.</p> <p>As debates over the coronavirus crisis have proliferated through thousands of articles about the necessity of lockdown and the severity of the danger to health, parents are being presented with a plethora of rival authorities and divergent views.</p> <p>\u201cWe are getting arguments about which expert is the most appropriate in their circumstances,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey are very genuine. There\u2019s a pressure to make a decision and there are all these conflicting messages. There\u2019s no real time in the court system at the moment [for disputes such as this] and you can\u2019t go to mediation over it [unless both parties agree to that route].\u201d</p> <p>Some of the disputes have focused on whether it is safe for children to go on the tube when travelling to school and whether schools can guarantee that classrooms are risk-free places for pupils. \u201cThe reality is that when you have primary school-age children how will you ensure that social distancing is followed,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for parents to know what\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2020 to amend a quote from Sarah Williams about the availability of court time, and to clarify her comment that mediation is only an option if both parties agree to that process.</p>",
  "<p>French flight crew have accused Ryanair of blackmailing them into taking pay cuts or losing their jobs.</p> <p>The Irish airline, which has warned it may cut up to 3,000 jobs in Europe, told staff in France it was imposing 20% salary cuts for flight crew and 10% for attendants.

The lower wages would be progressively increased over the five years so flight crew would be paid their full current salaries by July 2025. The loss of salary works out at an average 12% over five years for the pilots.&nbsp;Ryanair also proposed to pay new pilots and co-pilots the lower wages.</p> <p>The Syndicat National des Pilots de Ligne said it had been given a maximum of five days to respond to the ultimatum.&nbsp;If not, it said the company warned it would have \u201cno&nbsp;choice\u201d but to lay off 29% of its pilots and 27% of co-pilots in France.</p> <p>The airline also wrote to cabin crew representatives proposing a 10% salary cut during the same five-year period and reducing their paid working time from 2,000 hours a year to 1,600 hours, meaning a loss of \u20ac308 (\u00a3274) a month for those earning \u20ac1,539 a month.</p> <p>The flight attendants\u2019 union, SNPNC-FO, said pay cuts would take cabin crew below the minimum wage and demanded \u201cexplanations to justify the planned loss of income\u201d but said Ryanair had not responded.&nbsp;SNPNC-FO said it had also been given five days to agree or face having&nbsp;27 out of 160 France-based cabin staff laid off.</p> <p>Ryanair has confirmed it would have to lose up to 3,000 jobs and close certain bases in Europe until business recovers from the Covid-19 crisis.

  "<p>\u201cThere has never been a more exciting time for cricket,\u201d said Joe Root last October, when some of the stars and all of the franchise names for the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s new, most-exciting-ever format, The Hundred, were announced, promising that \u201cyou are pretty much guaranteed exciting cricket\u201d.</p> <p>It turned out that we were not guaranteed any cricket at all, and the search for cast-iron excitement in the sport goes on. The Hundred is just the latest in a long line of initiatives intended to make it more likely, and it could be that sometime in the distant, murky future, the sport\u2019s historians will write about it glowingly as a genuine attempt not just to make the game more popular and lucrative, but also in some way better. For now, though, they will just have to find something or someone else to praise, and in all of cricket\u2019s rich history there have not been many people more committed to making the game more interesting than Bev/Beverley/BH (take your pick) Lyon, the former Gloucestershire captain and pioneer of freak declarations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/joe-root-trent-bridge-training-former-england-head-coach-peter-moores\">Joe Root opts for Trent Bridge training with former England head coach Moores</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The outbreak of freak declarations in 1931, \u201ca product of BH Lyon\u2019s ingenious mind\u201d, the Guardian concluded, came after a run of tweaks intended to produce more excitement. These included shrinking the ball (only by three-sixteenths of an inch, or a little under half a centimetre). \u201cSpectators will no doubt be surprised that they notice no difference at all,\u201d wrote Jack Hobbs. \u201cTo the players only, and the bowlers especially, will the change mean anything, and even to them, I suspect, not very much.\u201d</p> <p>They also tried bigger wickets, and extending the lbw law to include nicks into the pads. For the 1931 season it was decided to award 15 points for a win in the county championship, incentivising teams to go for broke rather than pocket the bonus available for leading after the first innings and not worry unduly about whether the match ended with a result.</p> <p>Had the rule been in place the previous year, Lyon\u2019s Gloucestershire \u2013 having won five more games than the champions, Lancashire \u2013 would have won the division easily. \u201cThe team he captains always plays for victory and not for decimals,\u201d gushed the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News in its preview of the 1931 campaign. And in his very first, rain-affected match, Lyon proved them right, declaring his first innings at lunch on the final day when trailing Surrey by 83 runs and with a draw looming. His opposite number, Percy Fender, got into the mood, declaring Surrey\u2019s second innings at 60 for 6, leaving Gloucestershire to score 144 runs in 108 minutes. They did it with three minutes to spare.</p> <p>\u201cBH Lyon and PGH Fender, the boldest of the county captains, set a rare example of brighter cricket to the country yesterday, and, with their teams, there was no less honour for the losers than the victors,\u201d wrote the Guardian. \u201cFrom time to time cricket matches happen which outlast all statistical values, all the reckonings of championships,\u201d Neville Cardus wrote in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News. \u201cThey have reverberations which create traditions and new habits. I cannot help thinking that such a match was played at the Oval last week between Surrey and Gloucestershire.\u201d</p> <p>The following month saw Lyon\u2019s most outlandish moment, as Gloucestershire travelled to their title rivals Yorkshire. The first two days were washed and a draw seemed certain, but in the pavilion on the second afternoon, watching the rain fall, Lyon had an idea. He sought out his opposite number, Frank Greenwood, who agreed to play along. The following morning, both declared their first innings after a single ball, with four runs scored. Back then it was seen as the height of daring.</p> <p>\u201cA spectator arriving at Bramall Lane at 11.50am and being told by the gatekeeper that both Gloucestershire and Yorkshire had completed their first innings would conclude that he was in the presence of a singularly unfunny humorist,\u201d wrote the Guardian. \u201cThose who were responsible for the award of 15 points for a win may find their sleep disturbed by monstrous nightmares before the season is over. Where will this ingenuity of captains cease?\u201d</p> <p>Again Gloucestershire benefited from Lyon\u2019s bravery, winning the match. \u201cOne would not be surprised at any course adopted by Mr BH Lyon; he is a fanatic in this sense, and one to himself,\u201d W Peckett, a furious Yorkshire member, wrote in a letter to the Yorkshire Post. \u201cBut in Mr Greenwood we look to a calmer mind. For him to follow Mr Lyon\u2019s example was absurd and mere bravado.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eaee8431a25028edc20bfa6a8ed6cefe22d9565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eaee8431a25028edc20bfa6a8ed6cefe22d9565/172_1047_2427_1457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BH Lyon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under Bev Lyon Gloucestershire were runners-up in the Championship in 1930 and 1931.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TopFoto.co.uk/TopFoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lyon was forced to step away from the game for much of the rest of the summer for business reasons, but in his absence the trend continued. The following month Glamorgan and Northamptonshire both declared their first innings on 51, then in August, Glamorgan and Surrey, and a few days later Warwickshire and Leicestershire, all declared first innings at 0 for 0. On the same day as that last match, Greenwood was at it again, Yorkshire and Northamptonshire both ending their first innings on 4 for 0. The season ended with Yorkshire champions by 68 points, and Gloucestershire again second.</p> <p>This all caused quite the scandal, and an attempt to stamp it out was inevitable. For the following year\u2019s championship, captains were banned from declaring an innings until it had lasted at least an hour, and 10 points were made available for the side leading after the first innings of a match that remained unfinished. Freak declarations continued in various forms, but with less drama or surprise.</p> <p>Still, Lyon was always good for a bit of fun. In 1933, for example, he bowled all 11 players in a bid to curtail a Warwickshire innings, including his wicketkeeper. \u201cVan der Gucht sent down a weird kind of over while Baldwin, the umpire, stood and held his pads and gloves,\u201d wrote the Birmingham Daily Gazette. \u201cThis was a little burlesque which did not add to the lustre of first-class cricket.\u201d</p> <p>The previous year Lyon had argued, in an article in the Daily Mail, that no one wanted to see county cricket die. \u201cAnd yet it is ill. Very ill. In fact, so ill that without an injection of strychnine it will probably pass away,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy? Why should county cricket be in such a critical position? I will tell you. I have been trying to explain for three years, but no one would listen \u2013 no one will listen. The most important part of the revenue must come from the shillings taken at the gate. Therefore county cricket has to draw a public which now has innumerable other attractions within easy reach; a public which dashes to these attractions in high-powered motor-coaches and on motor-bicycles, and feasts it eyes on various forms of fast-moving objects and animals.\u201d</p> <p>Had the Hundred only been played this summer, cricket fans would have plenty of fast-moving objects and animals to cheer. In its absence, stories of the likes of Lyon will just have to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spin\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>\u2022&nbsp;<strong>This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

  "<p>Decades from now, when people ask how professional rugby union was decisively shaped, it will boil down to one simple question: did a forward or a back win the argument? In the northern hemisphere forwards have traditionally held sway for the most part, helped by the winter mud and rain that inevitably alters behaviour. But what if summer rugby becomes a regular occurrence? How might the game develop then?</p> <p>Dinosaurs did not respond hugely well when faced with sharply changing climatic conditions. It may yet be a similar story for a few lumbering club forwards if they are suddenly required to play the majority of their rugby on fast, firm surfaces in temperatures nudging 27C. It\u2019s rugby, Jim, but not as we know it.</p> <p>Which helps explain the contrasting reactions to reports that regular summer rugby union in the northern hemisphere may become a reality if a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/30/premiership-final-could-clash-six-nations-as-restart-further-delay\">summit meeting on 15 June</a> produces the holy grail of a synchronised global fixture schedule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/28/premiership-will-not-adopt-world-rugbys-law-trials-to-reduce-virus-risk-rugby-union\">Premiership will not adopt World Rugby\u2019s law trials to reduce virus risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI really hope we do get an aligned calendar,\u201d said the Scotland coach, Gregor Townsend. His one-time Lions captain Martin Johnson could scarcely have been less impressed. \u201cI hope they are not going to start playing rugby in the northern hemisphere summer,\u201d the former England lock told the Daily Mail. \u201cThat would be a disaster. It is not a summer game. People want to play rugby in the winter in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Guess what? Townsend was a ball-playing fly-half while Johnson was one of the finest second-row forwards the game has seen. Both of them know plenty about playing and managing at the highest level yet they are poles apart when it comes to one of the modern game\u2019s fundamental debates. If their diametrically opposing views are any guide, finding a consensus may be tough.</p> <p>In some ways it is becoming a redundant argument: as the past month and a half of gloriously sunny weather has underlined, a large chunk of the season already takes place in summery conditions. The Premiership final was to have taken place on 20 June. Assuming Covid-19 precautions permit, England\u2019s leading clubs will train and play through July and August without a murmur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac3f924479438db88dedffdc52ebdb35ed17328\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac3f924479438db88dedffdc52ebdb35ed17328/0_96_1936_1162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gregor Townsend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gregor Townsend, the Scotland coach, is among those who would welcome a unified calendar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the plus side, how many vehemently hate the idea of a dry ball, more scope for the speedsters to shine and a nice cool post-match drink in the early-evening sun? There is not an attacking playmaker in existence who would miss the freezing fingers, slippery ball and icy fields of winter if the chance materialised to make a living in more conducive conditions. Name the visiting spectator who would be more inclined to drive to Sale on a dark, cheerless Friday night in January than a pleasantly warm June evening.</p> <p>It is at this point, inevitably, that the cacophony of counter arguments kick in. There are a vast array of other things to do in Britain and Ireland in summer. As rugby league has already found, union would be required to take its place in a lengthy queue, not least in the newspapers.</p> <p>The offer of strawberries and cream and a glass of Pimms at Kingston Park is not going to divert the majority from Wimbledon and Lord\u2019s. What happens to those who love their cricket AND their rugby? What are people going to do with themselves once the clocks go back and there is no rugby to fill the wintry emptiness? Who would want to sign the potential death warrant of tight forward play and play a sweat-soaked version of basketball?</p> <p>Different strokes for different folks. Some may also contend that the decisive tug of war between forwards and backs has already been settled. When the monarch of the glen, Sir Bill Beaumont, narrowly beat off the challenge of the former Argentina scrum-half Agust\u00edn Pichot to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/07/bill-beaumont-world-rugby-re-election-risks-global-rift-south-the-breakdown\">remain as the chairman of World Rugby</a> it was not on a campaigning platform of pi\u00f1a coladas at Murrayfield or pitch-side hot tubs in Cardiff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>But might it yet be possible to deliver the best of both worlds? The community and schoolboy game would stay where it is, offering more chance to support local and schools rugby rather than it being endlessly overshadowed by the pros. Television will still want to screen the Six Nations championship in April and no one objects to October internationals when the Rugby World Cup is happening.</p> <p>The Premiership clubs, collectively losing millions even before the shutdown, would get the chance to see if the unthinkable is actually a better financial bet. They may find that early-evening kick-offs (to avoid the warmest parts of the day) increase the number of people who want to watch, both at home as well as live.</p> <p>With firmer pitches, a more positive spectacle and greater incentives for spectators to hang around, it would also be easier to play double- and triple-headers, with women\u2019s rugby and sevens literally enjoying their moment in the sun. There would be fewer clashes with the commercial leviathan that is the Premier League and between club games and Tests. Rugby would also suddenly look different, shorn of its occasionally drab winter plumage. There would be international matches with both sides at their peaks, rather than one or the other limping to the end of their seasons.</p> <p>Stick it all together and what have you got? A sport with a growing identity crisis, possibly, but also one with a perfect opportunity to pursue something different. Is there anything to be lost by giving it a go in 2021, with the post-Covid calendar requiring a radical redraw anyway? And then extending the experiment for the remainder of the 2023 World Cup cycle? It could just deliver collective benefits for backs and forwards alike.</p> <h2>Second chance?</h2> <p>These are not easy times for anyone, let alone someone who has had to do as much recent soul-searching as Rob Howley. The former Wales assistant coach\u2019s nine-month ban for betting on the outcome of rugby matches expires in mid-June and anyone who has read the harrowing account of the family pressures that drove him to seek a degree of solace in gambling will wish him well wherever life now takes him. If he can add a successful new chapter to his coaching career it will rank among the game\u2019s most emotional comebacks.</p> <h2>And another thing \u2026</h2> <p>If there is a significant spike in rugby\u2019s popularity when the sport resumes it will be partly down to one man and two dogs. Just now <a href=\"@MrAndrewCotter\">Andrew Cotter</a> could commentate on the journey of a pair of underpants from bedroom floor to washing machine and still stand a fair chance of going viral. If any television broadcaster can be guaranteed to enhance a blank behind-closed-doors canvas it is Cotter.</p>",
  "<p>With theatrical output moving online during lockdown, the distinction between theatre and interactive gaming is becoming increasingly blurred. Smoking Gun \u2013 created by Dan Barnard, Rachel Briscoe and Joe McAlister for the company <a href=\"https://fastfamiliar.com/smoking-gun/\">Fast Familiar</a> \u2013 is a clever combination of the two. The show plays out on an online chat app and runs in 30-minute instalments over five consecutive nights. As time ticks on, the participants must examine the evidence (provided by one seriously suspicious whistleblower), and decide whether or not to go public \u2013 and exactly who or what to trust along the way.</p> <p>Without giving too much away, I\u2019ll just say that the story involves a potentially dodgy Tory MP and a definitely dodgy big pharma company. The research poured into it is impressive and, at times, overwhelming. We\u2019re sent immaculate graphs, articles, video clips and stats, all of which demand careful attention. Much of it comes laden with sneakier evidence hidden underneath, if you\u2019re willing to put in the hours to dig it out.</p> <p>Certainly, this is a show for the tech-savvy and time-rich. During a post-show debrief, I discover that some participants spent two hours researching before each nightly chat. That\u2019s an awful lot to ask of an audience. For someone accustomed to being a little more led, and perhaps a little more explicitly entertained (there are only so many spreadsheets I can absorb), my energy and enthusiasm levels began to drop.</p> <p>The webchat app is persuasively self-contained but participants are required to carry out research online, too, and, after countless dead-end Google searches, it gets increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief. The lag time between the shows, and all the real life that flows in between, dilutes the experience. Yet there are moments when the real world and game world intersect to thrilling effect. At one point, I stumble across a phone number and begin to dial. My heart is racing and, for just a moment, I\u2019ve fallen completely for the fantasy.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://fastfamiliar.com/smoking-gun/\">Smoking Gun</a> is next available from 24-29 June.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>When Mexican news anchor Carmen Aristegui was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/mexican-journalist-carmen-aristegui-mvs-radio-president-enrique-pena-nieto\">fired from a popular radio show </a>after revealing a presidential scandal on air, it sparked an outpouring of anger and protests.</p> <p>For millions of listeners Aristegui is a trusted voice cutting through government spin and corruption, and her absence left a void.</p> <p>Now a <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London\">new documentary</a> charts the journey she made to overcome censorship and form a <a href=\"https://aristeguinoticias.com/\">new independent news platform</a> with a group of colleagues.</p> <p>In Radio Silence, filmmaker Juliana Fanjul follows Aristegui over the 22 months it took her to get back on air while continuing her investigative work amid a slew of lawsuits, death threats and the murder of another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/crusading-mexican-journalist-javier-valdez-shot-dead-in-sinaloa\">prominent journalist</a>.</p> <p>Aristegui\u2019s sacking in 2015 occurred against a backdrop of violence gripping Mexico and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/mexico-43-killed-students-\">disappearance of 43 students from the state of Guerrero</a>, explains Fanjul.</p> <p>\u201cWe were really concerned as a society to try and understand what was going on and her voice was very important. She was the first one to bring the families of those students on to the air and give them a voice.\u201d</p> <p>Aristegui was fired by her employer, the privately owned MVS Radio, over her demands that the company reinstate two colleagues who had been independently reporting on a scandal involving the then president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/enrique-pena-nieto\">Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a>, and his wife, and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/10/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-mansion-explain\">opulent villa to be built by a Mexican consortium</a> in exchange for a railway contract.</p> <p>The project involved Chinese capital and, in the face of what was called the Casa Blanca or White House scandal, Pe\u00f1a Nieto was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/mexico-president-apologizes-luxury-home-contractor\">cancel the contract and apologise to the Chinese government</a>. When Aristegui was sacked, thousands of people gathered outside the radio station to protest.</p> <p>Fanjul used to listen to Aristegui\u2019s programme to keep abreast of developments in her native Mexico from her home in Switzerland. \u201cWhen the mic was cut I was filled with rage,\u201d she says. \u201cJournalists were being killed and I thought if they are doing this to Carmen who is so well-known, things are really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought instead of being anguished I should make a film and I went to Mexico to find her.\u201d</p> <p>Fanjul spent four years filming Aristegui, providing a rare insight into the woman whose name has become synonymous with press freedom in Mexico.</p> <p>Her news programme had been a ratings hit. Yet no radio station offered her a job following her dismissal, such was the extent of government censorship. Instead, she set up on her own, and with the help of social media, continued to expose corruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Coeytaux/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her investigations continued to make headlines around the world including her report headlined \u201cFrom Plagiarist to President\u201d, which alleged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a Nieto had plagiarised almost a third of his law degree thesis</a>. Only one Mexican newspaper ran the story.</p> <p>It led to an increasingly hostile climate for Aristegui and her colleagues. One explains: \u201cWorking with Carmen Aristegui entails being constantly under surveillance \u2026 under fire \u2026 by journalists who are pro-government or close to power.\u201d Another reveals: \u201cI imagined they were going to make me disappear.\u201d</p> <p>Through behind-the-scenes footage at her office, Aristegui is portrayed as a passionate workaholic, fiercely determined, but with a warmth and generosity towards her colleagues. She has an impressive 8.6 million Twitter followers but Fanjul says her private life is strictly guarded.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of who she is, it is hard for her to trust people,\u201d explains Fanjul. \u201cIt took a long time for her to let me in.\u201d</p> <p>When the filmmaker got rare access to her home, Aristegui described how her teenage son had become a target of government surveillance.</p> <p>\u201cThe repression and scheming that took place to kick us off air, and later the constant legal attacks, led me to believe that it was much better for Emilio to leave Mexico, in a context in which his mum was publicly exposed to a scandal, where you never really know how it\u2019s going to end.\u201d</p> <p>She says they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/mexico-cellphone-software-spying-journalists-activists\">targeted by Pegasus spyware</a>. \u201cWhoever was behind the Pegasus attacks on a young teen\u2019s iPhone, who was studying in the United States, displays a great degree of perversity,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it was clearly his mum they wanted to hurt.\u201d</p> <p>After a break-in at her office, chilling CCTV footage shows men opening drawers and stealing a computer. It contained sensitive information about a powerful politician that Aristegui had previously implicated in a prostitution ring.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the office was broken into, more than one journalist resigned. Paradoxically, each obstacle that appeared in Carmen\u2019s way only strengthened her determination,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>By 16 January 2017, Aristegui was back on air \u2013 on the internet from a sound-proofed booth in her small office.</p> <p>The 2018 election saw the formation of a new government, and Aristegui received an offer from media company Grupo Radio Centro.</p> <p>\u201cIt confirms the pressure was coming from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a </a>administration to keep her off air,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>Her newscast is now broadcast across several radio stations but she retains editorial autonomy. Her investigations continue to make waves, including allegations of corruption in the government\u2019s national news agency.</p> <p>\u201cWe wished things would change with the new government but now it is attacking her and there are smear campaigns,\u201d Fanjul tells the Guardian. \u201cOnce more she has become the enemy.\u201d</p> <p><em>Radio Silence is streaming as part of the digital edition of the <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/london-digital-edition\">Human Rights Watch Film Festival</a>, and is <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London%20Digital%20Edition\">available to watch</a> in the UK and Ireland until 5 June.</em></p>",

  "<p>The air outside Bonneville primary school in Clapham, south London, is filled with the smell of freshly sprayed paint. Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school\u2019s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.</p> <p>These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville\u2019s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards \u2013 and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.</p> <p>\u201cFor every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities\u201d, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. \u201cWe began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.\u201d</p> <p>Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety \u2013 the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. \u201cWe\u2019ve been open every day during lockdown,\u201d says Parker. \u201cStaff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. \u201cOvernight, we\u2019ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can\u2019t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.</p> <p>\u201cReception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,\u201d she says. \u201cYounger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.</p> <p>\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It\u2019s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they\u2019ve achieved and worked hard for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afdd819a822eb68317e3e68b753143187f0f7453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afdd819a822eb68317e3e68b753143187f0f7453/0_367_8510_5107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Parker in one of Bonneville's classrooms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,\u2019 says Parker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jude Edginton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children\u2019s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.</p> <p>With only a fraction of the school\u2019s 420 pupils in attendance \u2013 including Parker\u2019s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker \u2013 the sound of children\u2019s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.</p> <p>\u201cOur teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.</p> <p>\u201cWith fewer children coming back to start with, we don\u2019t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they\u2019ll see how things are working and their confidence will build \u2013 some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.</p> <p>At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. \u201cBubbles\u201d of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated \u201cbubble lead\u201d \u2013 the class teacher \u2013 taking students into the building in shifts.</p> <p>Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children\u2019s individual groups.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough younger children will be in smaller groups, it\u2019s not just about the size of each bubble \u2013 it\u2019s about dynamics as well,\u201d says Parker. \u201cChildren are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fb2070b35ec8e25d8b2c4fb388f946f58dcf88d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fb2070b35ec8e25d8b2c4fb388f946f58dcf88d/0_356_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bonneville school hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Overnight, we\u2019ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis,\u2019 says Parker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jude Edginton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.</p> <p>For staff, these include having an awareness of each other \u2013 for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS\u2019s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.</p> <p>Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the diverse community the school serves. \u201cIn terms of the country Lambeth is hugely diverse\u201d, says Parker, citing the borough\u2019s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection\u201d, says Parker, explaining that the school\u2019s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.</p> <p>Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.</p> <p>As well as the children\u2019s emotional health, there are plans in place should a child show symptoms of the coronavirus. \u201cThe point of the bubbles is that if a child presents with any symptoms of illness, we\u2019ll know exactly who they\u2019ve been in contact with,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, if they test positive [for Covid-19], the whole bubble, including their teacher, will self-isolate.\u201d</p> <p>Parker\u2019s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to adapt, even though we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to be adapting for,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.</em></p> <p><strong>This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together\">All together</a> is a government-backed initiative tasked with informing the UK about the Covid-19 pandemic.</strong></p>",

They are the words of a dictator.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s speech sowed fear and uncertainty, not least because of its vagueness. Legally, he would have to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act for active-duty troops to conduct law enforcement on US soil, but he does not appear to have done so yet.</p> \n<p>It is possible that, for now, he is using it as a threat to force the hand of state governors to call up more troops from the national guard, just as he used the Defense Production Act to push companies to manufacture ventilators for people with coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Politically, he would face intense criticism from Democrats but he probably assumes that, as ever, Republicans will remain in lockstep with him.

On Sunday <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-sneak-peek-e897bc29-a518-44d6-be84-b2c85e05e68e.html?chunk=0&amp;utm_term=emshare#story0\">the Axios website reported</a> that advisers inside and outside the White House pleaded with him to curb divisive outbursts that threatened to hurt him at the ballot box with independent voters and suburban women.</p> \n<p>The Axios report named Hope Hicks, a longtime aide who returned to the White House in February from the Fox Corporation, as expressing concern about a tweet in the early hours of Friday in which Trump used a historically loaded phrase: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hicks reports to Jared Kushner, senior adviser to Trump and husband of his daughter Ivanka. The couple are thought to be among those urging the president to exercise restraint.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jared Kushner but probably it\u2019s Jared channelling his wife, who doesn\u2019t want to give her father bad news or challenge her father, so she\u2019s making Jared do it,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.mullings.com/\">Rich Galen,</a> former press secretary to Dan Quayle, an ex-vice-president.</p> \n<p>But there was a fundamental problem, Galen added. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell the president anything because he won\u2019t listen and, even if he pretends to listen, he\u2019ll just go off and do what he wants anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier in his presidency, Trump was surrounded by military figures, including chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser HR McMaster, who might have found ways to thwart his strongman posture. Now such guardrails are gone and the president\u2019s inner circle is compliant.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/outrageous-christian-leaders-reject-trump-use-of-church-as-prop-during-george-floyd-protests\">Bishop 'outraged' over Trump's church photo op during George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.chriswhipple.net/\">Chris Whipple,</a> author of The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency, said: \u201cThis is someone who has never empowered anyone to tell him what he does not want to hear and the result is a complete failure of leadership. It\u2019s clear that he no longer has a functioning White House chief of staff.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no one who can walk into the Oval Office, close the door and tell him hard truths \u2026 He has the presidency he\u2019s always wanted, which is a presidency of enablers and sycophants and people who will not dare to tell him what he needs to hear, and so we\u2019re seeing the results,\u201d Whipple said.</p> \n<p>Influenced by Fox News, Trump is free to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/03/donald-trump-gut-feeling-decision-making-white-house\">be himself purely</a> and, for many observers, there could be nothing more alarming in the current crisis.</p> \n<p>If he can go this far, how much further can he go?</p> \n<p>Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joelockhart/status/1267604023043072001?s=20\">tweeted on Monday night:</a> \u201cI lived through MLK and Bobby being assassinated, our cities burning, Watergate, 9/11 and other national tragedies. I\u2019ve never been so frightened for our country as I am tonight. Trump has to go now.\u201d</p>",

The call was about an invitation to attend the G7, but the PM later contacted the <strong>Australian embassy in Washington </strong>to ask how the country should lodge concern about a <strong>Channel 7 </strong>reporter and a cameraman who were attacked by police during protests in the US capital. </li> \n   <li> The<strong> NSW government </strong>will further ease lockdown restrictions to allow gyms to reopen from<strong> 13 June</strong>. Fitness centres, dance studios, indoor swimming and barre will also be allowed.</li> \n   <li>Hundreds of people have marched through Sydney in a <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protest against Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia and against the killing of George Floyd in the US. The event happened hours after a <strong>NSW police officer</strong> was placed on \u201crestricted duties\u201d and an investigation launched into footage that showed him slamming a 16-year-old Indigenous boy face-first onto pavement in Sydney on Monday. </li> \n   <li>The <strong>NSW upper house</strong> has reversed the state government\u2019s controversial 12-month <strong>pay freeze for public servants</strong>. MPs voted to disallow the pay pause for 400,000 workers in the state, which was introduced last week in response to the economic damage wrought by Covid-19.</li> \n   <li>The final two bidders for stricken airline <strong>Virgin Australia</strong> are <strong>Bain Capital </strong>and <strong>Cyrus Capital Partners</strong>, administrators Deloitte say.

the media at 3.45pm on Friday to announce the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and include recovery fee charges.</p> \n  <p>Watt asked Campbell whether in her current or former role she had advised ministers of concerns about the legality of the robodebt scheme prior to this calendar year. </p> \n  <p>She said that question went to the legal advice around which the

In April, total hours worked declined by an unprecedented 9% and more than 600,000 people lost their jobs, with many more people working zero hours. Household spending weakened very considerably and investment plans are being deferred or cancelled.</p> \n   <p>Notwithstanding these developments, it is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected. The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely. And there are signs that hours worked stabilised in early May, after the earlier very sharp decline. There has also been a pick-up in some forms of consumer spending.</p> \n   <p>However, the outlook, including the nature and speed of the expected recovery, remains highly uncertain and the pandemic is likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy. In the period immediately ahead, much will depend on the confidence that people and businesses have about the health situation and their own finances.</p> \n   <p>The substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy in Australia is helping the economy through this difficult period. It is likely that this fiscal and monetary support will be required for some time.</p> \n   <p>The board is committed to do what it can to support jobs, incomes and businesses and to make sure that Australia is well placed for the recovery. Its actions are keeping funding costs low and supporting the supply of credit to households and businesses. This accommodative approach will be maintained as long as it is required. </p> \n   <p>The board will not increase the cash rate target until progress is being made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2\u20133% target band.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T05:23:50.960Z\">at 6.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed5d5648f084df971c8df44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T04:28:38.245Z\">5.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the NSW parliament:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JodiMcKayMP/status/1267673896104296449\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At 2.25pm this afternoon, I have moved to disallow a pay cut for more than 400,000 workers in NSW.<br><br>This is about valuing people, supporting jobs, and supporting every business and every community in our state. <br><br>Amidst a recession and pandemic, this is about who we are. <a href=\"https://t.co/VtaeEe9gwn\">pic.twitter.com/VtaeEe9gwn</a></p>\u2014 Jodi McKay (@JodiMcKayMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JodiMcKayMP/status/1267673896104296449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed5d4c28f08f5e373012c9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T04:26:12.153Z\">5.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the Covid-19 committee, Labor\u2019s <strong>Pat Dodson</strong> has asked about measures to close remote Aboriginal communities to fight against Covid-19.<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Caroline Edwards</strong>, the health department secretary, explained that minister <strong>Greg Hunt</strong> made the decision to declare them designated areas on advice from state and territory leaders, Aboriginal groups and the chief medical officer as part of \u201cefforts to protect what is believed to be a more vulnerable group\u201d.<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Gavin Matthews </strong>said those returning to remote communities were required to self-isolate for 14 days, while <strong>Lucas De Toca </strong>rejected the suggestion any government decisions had \u201ctriggered\u201d people returning, saying state and territory governments were \u201cassisting people who wanted to return\u201d on a voluntary basis.</p> \n  <p>Dodson is concerned that more needs to be done to address \u201cfundamental causes\u201d of risk such as overcrowding, because \u201cwe are still in the threat of a pandemic\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Edwards says the government is aware of the impact a second wave would have on remote communities, and other officials point to $550m given by the federal government for a partnership with the Northern Territory to reduce overcrowding.</p> \n  <p>There\u2019s a brief consideration of <strong>Ken Wyatt\u2019s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/ken-wyatt-concedes-referendum-on-indigenous-recognition-unlikely-before-election\">announcement</a> that a referendum is \u201cunlikely\u201d on constitutional recognition in this term of parliament.</p> \n  <p>Officials respond that the $160m set aside will remain in the contingency reserve, rather than be reallocated.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T04:33:43.510Z\">at 5.33am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed5d3968f087122eca53cb3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T04:21:36.637Z\">5.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Don\u2019t for a second think Australia has been different.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/political_alert/status/1267672055857676289\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Change the Record calls on state, territory &amp;

This funding is about saving lives and protecting lives and it\u2019s part of our dual process of containment and flattening the curve and increase the ability of our health system to respond, in particular in relation to the containment. <br></p> \n   <p>Now, what we\u2019ve seen is that, overnight eight cases \u2013 and Australia is now at 7,203 cases and 102 lives, sadly, lost. <br></p> \n   <p>And of those eight cases in the last 24 hours, five came through the hotel quarantine system. In other words, what that shows is that our border controls remain absolutely vital to protecting Australia. In an earlier three-day period that the Department of Health\u2019s epidemiology unit has provided to me, 30 out of 43 cases came from overseas and have come through either the hotel quarantine or the navigation and shipping protections that have been put in place in this case in Western Australia.

  "<p>On 1 July 2003, in the middle of a sweltering Hong Kong summer, Mak Yin-Ting was among a crush of people trying to get into the tree-fringed Victoria Park.

Half a million people \u2013 a tenth of the population \u2013 had come to protest against an anti-subversion law they feared would make their city more like those over the border.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt was astonishing. The turnout was beyond my imagination,\u201d said Mak, now 59, who was chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association at the time.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was the largest protest since the 1997 handover and a shock to both the government and its citizens. Hong Kong\u2019s supposedly apolitical middle class \u2013 teachers, lawyers, business people, journalists such as Mak and others \u2013 streamed from the park to the seat of the government shouting: \u201cWe march for freedom\u201d and \u201cPower to the people!\u201d They held signs that said \u201cOppose Article 23\u201d, shorthand for the legislation, and pictures of the then chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, with pie on his face.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab74a50067a3f3bd157374f400a9f504c5bea7ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab74a50067a3f3bd157374f400a9f504c5bea7ea/0_356_1473_883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mock toilet with a picture of Tung Chee-hwa at a pro-democracy rally on 1 January 2004.

People in Hong Kong have completely lost trust in the People\u2019s Republic of China to honour its political promises,\u201d said Ming Sing, associate professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Beijing has repeatedly said the new law will not impinge on the \u201cone country two systems\u201d framework that promises Hong Kong a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/beijing-to-impose-hong-kong-security-laws-without-delay\">threaten the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents</a>.</p> <p>But few take comfort in those promises after watching the Chinese government under Xi Jinping tighten the already narrow space for Chinese civil society over the last few years. Threats to national security have been cited in many arrests of human rights lawyers, activists and other critics of the government.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese regime is very different now. It\u2019s very clear it is not tolerating civil society,\u201d said Chow.</p> <p>Today, critics say Hong Kong would have been better off approving the version of the law proposed in 2003. And some see the reintroduction of national security legislation as a major setback, a reversal of that victory 17 years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da5f3df034db4acfbffc4bfb16c0ddeaba63971b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da5f3df034db4acfbffc4bfb16c0ddeaba63971b/0_0_2212_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest on 13 July 2003 against the security bill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest on 13 July 2003 against the security bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But those who attended the protests disagree.

I think that is the characteristic of Hong Kong people. We will not accept things because of threats.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Chan, who was part of last year\u2019s protests, also said he will continue. \u201cIt is the only thing we can do. We have to put up a fight,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Others say China\u2019s plan carries its own risks, from damage to Beijing\u2019s reputation abroad to even more entrenched opposition inside and outside of Hong Kong over the long term.</p> <p>\u201cMany different rounds of battle have been waged. Along the way some have been won, some have been lost. The battle was won during that time but lost this time. History does not stop here,\u201d said Ming.&nbsp;\u201cIt is too premature to say that Hong Kong has lost entirely.\u201d</p>",

Evidence at the scene remained uncollected for days after the crime, said Akpobi.</p> <p>Priscilla Usiobaifo, who works to combat gender violence with the BraveHeart Initiative in Edo state, said it was common for police officers in Nigeria to not collect evidence or even visit crime scenes, undermining the chances of a successful prosecution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/25/nigeria-first-sex-offender-register\">Nigeria launches first sex offender register</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSuspects and victims are often taken to the crime scene together.

Not even so much food safety \u2013 that\u2019s taken a backseat to people\u2019s safety, to the safety of your staff and the safety of your guests.&nbsp;</p> <p>There\u2019s moving chairs around to create a floor plan that\u2019s safe. There\u2019s plastic barriers, creating one-lane aisles so that you minimize cross traffic. Limited seating and doing away with as many shared touch points \u2013 menus, getting your check, opening doors, the POS system, the salt and pepper shakers on the tables. Self-service? All gone. Pump ketchup and mustard, that\u2019s going to be all gone.</p> <p><strong>One restaurant <a href=\"https://apnews.com/6e6106c3e9c80234d355818a4a68ca10\">recently added</a> mannequins to their dining room to help space out their dining room. How might social distancing requirements affect a restaurant\u2019s bottom line?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>The number of seats in a restaurant is one of the most foundational, fundamental metrics that\u2019s used in determining how much money the restaurant is able to generate. Cutting the number of seats in a restaurant is devastating, and this is why restaurants are pivoting almost instantaneously to see if they can go to a delivery model and pick-up model to create another revenue stream.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Max Hardy:</strong> I\u2019m just always about what\u2019s beneficial for your bottom line. Mannequins don\u2019t really help the bottom line.&nbsp;[Instead] we\u2019ll rely heavily on reservations, so every two hours I\u2019m hitting that minimum capacity, that capacity to make it beneficial, and I know that I won\u2019t be over-prepping.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What will the restaurant experience be like as restrictions are eased?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kristel Arabian:</strong>&nbsp;What I\u2019ve been hearing is patrons will wear masks until they need to take them off to eat. Some of the more thoughtful operators are thinking of providing paper envelopes to keep them safe, because they don\u2019t want the mask touching the table. We will no longer be handing things to people, we will be putting things down on the table. The host is not going to be a host any more. There\u2019s going to be more of a \u201csafety captain\u201d position instead, someone who greets you at the door. There aren\u2019t going to be any walk-ins. You can\u2019t just show up. Some restaurants are even talking about locking the doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Could outdoor dining spaces be beneficial, especially with growing evidence that it is safer to not be in enclosed spaces?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Arabian: </strong>We\u2019re hearing that natural airflow really helps. Everyone is wanting to limit their time indoors in public places. Los Angeles is working on expanding outdoor eating on sidewalks. Other cities,&nbsp;like Washington DC, have shut down really popular streets, they\u2019ve turned them into a promenade, so that people can have distanced eating.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What are some of the changes in procedures being implemented for restaurant staff?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>Masks, mandatory hand-washing. We\u2019re seeing that in certain establishments&nbsp;every employee has their temperature taken and basically needs a daily health waiver thing, that basically states \u201cI have not traveled to any coronavirus hotspots in the last 14 days, I haven\u2019t been sick, nobody in my family is sick.\u201d You will also see the restaurant and food business start to talk about marketing their safety programs just as much as they market where their chicken comes from. There will also be new positions created, like the \u201chead of sanitation\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Hardy: </strong>Before I open I want to get all my staff tested to make sure they\u2019re good. We\u2019ve ordered sanitizer kits for every customer that comes in. I\u2019m turning my [point of sale] system to a handheld system, the customer gets handed the handheld system, they can do their own thing, versus the cashier touching it. We\u2019ve got masks, we\u2019re changing our aprons every 15 to 20 minutes, changing our gloves with every order.</p> <p><strong>Are you concerned that diners won\u2019t be ready to dine out even if restaurants are ready to open?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>You\u2019re going to see a lot of people that will want to gently tiptoe back into it, and you\u2019re going to see people who are dying to get out there and sit down at a bar. They\u2019re going to need to wear masks in the restaurants, take it off when their food and drink shows up, and then put the masks back on.&nbsp;If<strong> </strong>it<strong> </strong>allows us to slowly reintroduce one of the most enjoyable things in our lives, and that is dining at a restaurant, a little discomfort isn\u2019t too much to ask for.</p> <p>I hope society sees this and steps up and understands the pressure. When we do reopen at limited capacity with lots of new rules in place, people need to understand why they need to follow the rules. I hope that people do.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Max Hardy is a chef based in Detroit and founder of </em><em>the River Bistro and Coop</em><em> Detroit, a fast casual Caribbean fusion restaurant.

Baskin had also previously sued Maldonado-Passage for trademark and copyright infringement for use of her company\u2019s logo and images.</p> <p>According to court documents, Lowe has 120 days to vacate the zoo, which he had renamed Tiger King Park, and to remove all animals.</p> <p>Subtitled Murder, Mayhem and Madness, Tiger King has been a huge hit for Netflix since its release in March, with the notoriously cagey streaming giant revealing in April that the show had been watched by 64m households. The stranger-than-fiction series also made cult figures of Maldonado-Passage and Baskin, who has been subject to an array of unsubstantiated claims that she murdered her husband Jack \u201cDon\u201d Lewis, and fed him to her beloved big cats \u2013 accusations Baskin denied in the show. Such is the cultural impact of the series, Nicolas Cage has been signed up to portray Maldonado-Passage in an upcoming TV miniseries.</p> <p>While Maldonado-Passage is unlikely to be happy with the decision, Lowe remains nonplussed, with he and his wife Lauren telling <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2020/06/01/carole-baskin-taking-control-oklahoma-zoo-joe-exotic-lawsuit-jeff-lowe/\">US gossip site TMZ</a> that they had \u201clong anticipated that the judge would eventually undo the 2016 land transfer. We are thankful that he dragged out his decision this long and allowed us time to complete the new Tiger King Park in Thackerville, Oklahoma, behind the world\u2019s largest casino.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt. </p> <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.&nbsp;Instead, he sounds much like his ancient predecessor, A Mitchell Palmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Barr, like Palmer, has largely ignored the continued killing of black people by vigilantes and agents of the state. He has also ignored the root causes of the current uprisings, such as the flat-out refusal of American institutions to address the violence and conditions that create a life where black people cannot breathe. Instead Barr has chosen to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barrs-statement-riots-and-domestic-terrorism\">focus his attention</a> on what he characterizes as rioting and \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d. Mimicking <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blames-antifa-riots-minnesota-officials-point-fingers-white-supremacists-dueling-claims\">Donald Trump</a>, and without evidence, he has blamed the current eruption on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-s-statement-death-george-floyd-and-riots\">far-left extremists</a>, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence\u201d,&nbsp;and he has warned that he will prosecute these (mostly phantom) anti-fascists. Barr previously said that if communities had the audacity to protest police brutality, they might \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/barr-police.html\">find themselves without the police protection they need</a>\u201d.</p> <p>For his part, Trump has branded the protesters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/tech/trump-twitter-minneapolis/index.html\">thugs</a>\u201d and threatened to have American citizens shot and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/politics/trump-threatens-protesters-dogs-weapons.html\">vicious dogs</a>\u201d unleashed on them. On Sunday he tweeted that antifa would be labeled a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552\">terrorist organization</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Strangely, Barr and Trump did not apply the same threat to the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/michigan-gov-whitmer-wants-ban-guns-capitol-after-armed-anti-n1200296\">armed white men</a> who stormed the Michigan capitol, challenged law enforcement and shut down the government during a pandemic. Trump defined these gun-toting white men as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-protestors-with-guns-in-michigan-capitol-are-very-good-people-2020-5\">very good people</a>\u201d..</p> <p>Despite all the smoke and mirrors and blustering threats, it\u2019s obvious what Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has done \u2013 or not done \u2013 that helped bring us to this horrific moment.&nbsp;It abandoned enforcing <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/sherrilyn-ifill-in-cnn-op-ed-we-must-hold-police-departments-accountable-even-if-trump-administration-fails-to-do-so/\">consent decrees</a> with police departments that have a demonstrated history of brutality and discrimination. It refused to collect and monitor the data that would <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/the-doj-announces-details-of-the-presidents-law-enforcement-commission-reaffirming-the-civil-rights-concerns-around-its-establishment/\">identify patterns and hotspots of bad policing</a> so that safeguards could be put in place. Equally important, it didn\u2019t shore up the <a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/civil-rights-division-has-not-filed-a-single-voting-rights-act-case-under-trump-792914a2689a/\">voting rights</a> of American citizens, so they could elect representatives whose policies could protect their lives. Instead, the Department of Justice lent its heft to conservative forces, like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/justice-department-defends-alabama-absentee-ballot-rule/2020/05/26/5a0c525e-9f9e-11ea-be06-af5514ee0385_story.html\">in Alabama</a>, who were determined to block African Americans from the ballot box even during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>As in 1919, we are dealing with an America where black and brown people must go into the streets to demand their rights because the institutions of democracy have failed to protect them. In 2020, we have a nation where large swaths of the executive, legislative and judicial branches at the federal and state levels have virtually abandoned millions of American citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why, for instance, did <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/05/07/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-video-prosecutor-arrest-mcmichael/3089040001/\">two district attorneys</a> in Georgia see the video of Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s lynching and decide that there was no wrongdoing, even though the film contradicted and undermined the admitted killers\u2019 statements? Why did it take the snuff film of George Floyd\u2019s death to raise the question of how an officer with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/minneapolis-officer-complaints-george-floyd/index.html\">18 complaints against him</a> could still be on the police force to squat with his knee on a man\u2019s neck for eight minutes? Why did Christian Cooper know that if he didn\u2019t film his accuser delivering a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007159234/amy-cooper-dog-central-park-police-video.html\">Broadway-worthy audition for the 911 dispatcher</a>, his life would have been imperiled? Why after the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant killings of <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/kathryn-johnston-and-police-system-failure\">Kathryn Johnston</a> in Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/09/aiyana-stanley-jones-detroit/\">Aiyan</a><a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/09/aiyana-stanley-jones-detroit/\">a Stanley-Jones</a> in Detroit and now <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/breonna-taylor-was-murdered-for-sleeping-while-black/\">Breonna Taylor</a> in Louisville, did it take protests, mobilization, righteous anger and the media spotlight to even get an investigation?</p> <p>There is something so wounded in American society, in American institutions, that basic decency, basic commitments to justice, are simply not part of the operating code. Justice should not require a spotlight. Justice should not require an uprising.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, the standard response to the uproar about police killing African Americans is the retort about <a href=\"https://www.blackenterprise.com/candace-owens-twitter-rant-about-ahmaud-arbery-riles-fellow-black-conservatives/\">black-on-black crime</a>. That pre-packaged answer ignores that just as more than 80% of blacks are killed by blacks, so, too, are more than <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/race-and-homicide-in-america-by-the-numbers\">80% of whites killed by whites</a>.&nbsp;Yet we don\u2019t get angst or pathologizing about white-on-white crime. That\u2019s because the narrative about African Americans killing each other is not really motivated by concern about black life; it is a conjuror\u2019s trick to take our eyes off the institutionalized, state-sponsored violence that has rained down on black people. &nbsp;</p> <p>In their intonations about antifa instigators and leftwing radicals, that\u2019s what Barr and Trump \u2013 like Palmer and Wilson before them \u2013 are doing: trying to distract us from state-sponsored or -condoned violence. &nbsp;</p> <p>On the other hand, what blacks did in 1919 to deal with a political structure absolutely hostile to their very existence is exactly what we will and must do now. \u201cPlot, plan, strategize, organize, mobilize,\u201d as the rapper Killer Mike <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/30/21275632/killer-mike-george-floyd-press-conference\">put it</a> \u2013 and vote. That is how we get an attorney general appointed who is appalled at the desecration of Americans\u2019 basic rights and determined to end that unrequited violence. That is how we get policymakers, judges, senators, district attorneys, school boards, congressional and state representatives, mayors, city council members, governors, and yes, even a president, who know that #BlackLivesMatter. &nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Carol Anderson is the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Writing from a Birmingham jail, Martin Luther King Jr famously told his anxious fellow clergymen that his non-violent protests would force those in power to negotiate for racial justice. \u201cThe time is always ripe to do right,\u201d he wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On an early summer evening, two generations later, Donald Trump walked out of the White House, where he\u2019d been hiding in a bunker. Military police had just fired teargas and flash grenades at peaceful protesters to clear his path, so that he could wave a Bible in front of a boarded church.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For Trump, the time is always ripe to throw kerosene on his own dumpster fire.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the week since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers, Trump has watched and tweeted helplessly as the nation he pretends to lead has reached its breaking point. After decades of supposedly legal police beatings and murders, the protests have swept America\u2019s cities more quickly than even coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is no coincidence of timing. In other crises, in other eras, there have been presidents who understood their most basic duty: to calm the violence and protect the people. In this crisis, however, we have a president who built his entire political career as a gold-painted tower to incite violence.</p> \n<p>We were <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/peter-thiel-perfectly-summed-up-donald-trump-in-one-paragraph.html\">told</a>, by Trump\u2019s supporters four years ago, that we should have taken him seriously but not literally.

  "<p>Crystal Moselle has a knack for finding people. Her \u201cintuition\u201d first led her to run through the streets after the family of boys who would star in her 2015 Sundance Grand Jury prize-winning documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-the-wolfpack-documentary-brothers\">The Wolfpack</a>. The Californian film-maker followed the same instinct when she discovered the all-teen-girl New York skateboarding troupe called Skate Kitchen. She overheard the girls on the G train talking about tampons, so befriended them and cast them in a short film and again in 2018\u2019s semi-scripted drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/26/skate-kitchen-review-crystal-moselle-rachelle-vinberg-jaden-smith\">Skate Kitchen</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar feeling to when you\u2019re attracted to somebody,\u201d she says in a west coast drawl. \u201c\u2018OK, this is something that I am connected to.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/29/betty-review-hbo-female-skateboarders-freewheeling-comedy\">Betty review \u2013 female skateboarders cut loose in freewheeling comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their working relationship did not end there. Based on Skate Kitchen, new series Betty is Moselle\u2019s first foray into television. With the same girls cast as the same characters, the six episodes prioritise realism over plot points to create a subtle teen drama that focuses on the minutiae of their NYC subculture. It\u2019s all about how these girls live, love, hope and, crucially, what they think about the hypocrisy of the world outside the skate park. As is typical of Moselle\u2019s two empathetic full-length films, characters find joy in film-making: for this diverse gang of girls there\u2019s power in telling their own stories and capturing their own image.</p> <p>Case in point: the first episode opens on a bruised bottom, as mottled and broody as a raincloud, and the camera pans to show the ringleader Kirt (Nina Moran) proudly capture it on her phone. Scenes unfold as casually as Kirt\u2019s attitude to life: girls trip on a ziplock bag of mushrooms in the park; nurture painful crushes on noncommittal art bros and complicated ones on cute girls before they\u2019re \u201cout\u201d to their family. The show is a touching, frequently funny portrait of the exhilarating freedom of your late teens, when you delight in growing up at your own pace, rather than at the mercy of outside forces.

Despite finding its fans, it didn\u2019t \u201ccatch on\u201d with audiences, or receive the wide distribution she felt it deserved. \u201cI almost feel like society wasn\u2019t ready yet for that story,\u201d she says. So, when HBO approached her to turn it into a show, she realised: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not finished and we\u2019re supposed to keep going with this.\u201d</p> <p>Girl gangs are familiar territory for Moselle. \u201cI definitely had a big group of girlfriends growing up. All the complexities of being around a big group of women, I learned at a young age.\u201d Born in San Francisco to two inventive parents, her mother a clothing designer and father a musician, she absorbed creativity in their \u201ccrafty\u201d home. By her late teens, she\u2019d gravitated to film-making after her mother bought her a video camera.</p> <p>Unusually in creative fields that prioritise artistic clout and minimise talk of privilege, Moselle admits her strong desire for financial stability. She didn\u2019t want to be a struggling artist (\u201cI grew up witnessing that with a lot of people around me in my life\u201d). Instead, her 20s and early-30s were spent making polished commercial work. It was during that period she found the Wolfpack boys, six brothers who had spent their childhoods trapped in a Manhattan apartment by their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/04/i-used-to-be-silly-with-money-but-with-hare-krishna-ive-learned-self-control\">Hare Krishna</a> father. Moselle\u2019s coming-of-age film connected with audiences, not only for its gripping story but for the brothers\u2019 innocent passion for film.

She was given a full writers\u2019 room and a co-writer, Lesley Arfin (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/20/love-review-hilarious-annoying-addictive-judd-apatow-is-on-form\">Netflix\u2019s Love</a>). The Skate Kitchen girls also came in to consult on the project at every step, which lends Betty an authenticity lacking in other teen shows that claim to capture the Gen Z experience: the high-budget, hyper-sexualised Euphoria or the silly seductiveness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/10/schools-out-how-riverdale-went-from-teenage-frolics-to-serial-killer-nonsense\">Riverdale</a>. \u201cThey\u2019re always there to say: \u2018This makes sense\u2019 or, \u2018No, we would never talk like that\u2019, or \u2018I would never experience it like that, this is how I\u2019d deal with it.\u2019\u201d It helps that Moselle has spent years bonding with these girls, let them sleep on her couch and listened to their problems.</p> <p>This level of documentation is particularly brilliant when the show imagines how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> affects teenagers. Janay\u2019s (Dede Lovelace) best friend and ex-boyfriend is accused of assault. After she defends him, she learns the specifics of the scenario from the accusing girl and realises she has told the truth. In the writers\u2019 room, Moselle and the other female writers and producers discussed their experiences in which a friend had been accused of serious misconduct during the #MeToo movement. \u201cYou have to look at them in a different light and consider: did they do something that we have to address or not?\u201d Yet, it was striking that Moselle\u2019s experiences were more \u201cdisturbing\u201d than anything the girls had been through. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because it has to do with being passionate about something. Skateboarding is more important than getting themselves into weird situations with guys, or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, most of the girls are queer. Witty observations from their real-life dating experiences are threaded through the script \u2013 at a nail salon, Kirt makes a joke about keeping her \u201cworking fingers\u201d short \u2013 but Moselle doesn\u2019t consider the show sexual. \u201cI was more worried about it not being racy enough. I think the show is quite innocent.\u201d That innocence is found in its depiction of ride-or-die friendship. \u201cThey\u2019re not mean girls, they don\u2019t have this real negative point of view where they think that there\u2019s only a small space for women to step into. They\u2019re, like: \u2018Oh, let\u2019s make space for women.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwIGBQ5UTHw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dwIGBQ5UTHw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Skate Kitchen was about the girls carving out an existence for women in the male-dominated world of skateboarding. In Betty, the girls take their own right to be in these spaces for granted. Moselle claims to have learned a tenacity from the girls. \u201cI can take their point of view into the world of directing. For a long time I felt like I was one of the only women who was directing.\u201d Moselle recounts scenarios where she was treated like a novelty: she\u2019d go from a meeting with a client who wanted to add a female director to their roster to another who would say that unfortunately they already had a single woman on their books. \u201cThings are changing now,\u201d she says. \u201cYoung people are the ones who are like: \u2018We\u2019re not going to stand for this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her next project will transport viewers far from weed vapes and half-pipes. In 2021 (or this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/06/cinema-coronavirus-projected-5bn-loss\">if the pandemic allows</a>) she will shoot a scripted film based on a controversial music-therapy experiment her father was involved in when he worked at a psychiatric hospital. \u201cI enjoy working with the youth but I\u2019m very happy to move on from that.

  "<p>\u201cAs soon as the [coronavirus] crisis hit, we realised that this basic human need to connect with people we cared about was likely to be affected by restrictions,\u201d says Lisa Harker, director of the <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldfjo.org.uk/\">Nuffield Family Justice Observatory</a>, which aims to improve the evidence for decision-making in the family justice system.</p> <p>\u201cThe abrupt halt to face-to-face time with their families overnight will have had an immense psychological impact on vulnerable children,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Face-to-face contact between children in care and their families was the first thing to stop after lockdown, as well as final contact sessions between birth parents and young children about to be adopted. As family courts were closed, almost all cases were heard remotely, raising concerns that legal proceedings to take at-risk children into care would not be robust or fair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/19/right-open-family-courts-scrutiny-high-court\">Why I fought for the right to open up family courts to greater scrutiny | Louise Tickle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the whole system thrown into a state of barely controlled chaos, the president of the family division, Sir Andrew McFarlane, asked the observatory to conduct a rapid review of how all court users were experiencing family hearings held \u201cvirtually\u201d from the confines of their homes during lockdown.&nbsp;He wanted to ensure that only suitable cases would have to go ahead remotely.</p> <p>\u201cThe family justice system has never had any feedback \u2013 it\u2019s like a surgeon never finding out how the operation went,\u201d says Harker. Thousands of life-changing decisions are being made day in, day out by family judges with no idea whether they have led to an even halfway decent outcome for children, or if disaster has been the eventual result, she adds. It\u2019s a pretty devastating charge \u2013 but a concern that <a href=\"https://www.familylaw.co.uk/news_and_comment/feedback-for-judges-in-the-family-court\">family judges themselves</a> have also expressed. &nbsp;</p> <p>Harker\u2019s team surveyed more than 1,000 judges, lawyers, parents, social workers and other family court users. The <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldfjo.org.uk/app/nuffield/files-module/local/documents/nfjo_remote_hearings_20200507-2-.pdf\">report</a>, published in early May, uncovered \u201csome really eye-watering examples\u201d, says Harker, of cases heard in the early days of the crisis \u201cthat many felt should never have been conducted in the way they were\u201d.</p> <p>One mother, for example, said she \u201chad to give her evidence from her garden shed, because she could find nowhere else where her children couldn\u2019t hear her,\u201d Harker points out. Another woman, still in hospital after giving birth, had to attend a remote court hearing at which the local authority was applying to remove her newborn child. \u201cShe was in a side room, without legal representation,\u201d says Harker bleakly. \u201cShe missed hearing the outcome [that the newborn be taken into care] and had to be told later.\u201d</p> <p>There is \u201ca strong consensus\u201d from the findings of the report that when judges are asked to make drastic orders, which might end up with a child being taken permanently into care, or placed for adoption, or any situation where evidence was contested and cross-examination of witnesses would need to be done, that virtual hearings are \u201cnot justice, and not a humane approach that professionals want to take, she says.</p> <p>Harker is particularly concerned about \u201csituations when an infant may ultimately be removed from a parent\u2019s care on a permanent basis\u201d. With no contact, a mother cannot say at a final hearing that she has bonded with her baby \u2013 and one of her strongest arguments for retaining the care of her child is suddenly gone.</p> <p>The report highlighted that in the initial rush to remote hearings, technical unpreparedness had caused parents and professionals huge stress. But court users generally felt that for uncontested matters, or case management hearings \u2013 where judges and parties discuss how the main hearing will be conducted \u2013 remote courts can, in principle, operate fairly. Urgent applications for removal of&nbsp;children relating to immediate safeguarding concerns, while far from ideal, would also, it was felt, need to go ahead.&nbsp;In April there were <a href=\"https://www.cafcass.gov.uk/about-cafcass/research-and-data/public-law-data/\">1,374 applications to take children into care in England</a>, slightly down on the same month in 2019 and 2018.</p> <p>There are currently more than <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/850306/Children_looked_after_in_England_2019_Text.pdf\">78,000 children in state care</a>, living in residential care homes or with foster carers. Harker says some of her fears about those children\u2019s lack of physical contact time with birth families during lockdown have been somewhat eased. \u201cWith lockdown and contact centres closed, and complete chaos as professionals scrabbled around, our initial concern was that contact would stop completely,\u201d she says. \u201cSo what was encouraging was that our <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldfjo.org.uk/coronavirus-family-justice-system/managing-family-contact\">research</a> shows there have been attempts to keep children in touch with their families though digital means.\u201d</p> <p>And for teenagers, she points out, digital contact can be more natural and normal.&nbsp;\u201cSome social workers and foster carers have [perhaps] been too reticent about digital contact. That\u2019s not saying it should replace face-to-face [meetings], but children go through phases, and there is maybe something about the ease and the less intense sense of checking in on a more regular basis.\u201d</p> <p>However, Harker believes there needs to be an \u201curgent focus\u201d in government and among child protection professionals on the negative impact of lockdown on younger children and infants. \u201cIt needs to be a national conversation because digital contact for very young children \u2013 and particularly for babies \u2013 is not meaningful in any sense. So we have to think about balancing the health risks against the psychological risks for children who are not living with their families. How can we be more creative in managing socially distanced contact? And we need to give really urgent thought to \u2018Is physical contact possible?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Harker, improving the child protection and family justice system at all times is deeply personal. \u201cI\u2019m an adoptive mum. That\u2019s opened my eyes to the lifelong impact of a child being removed from a family,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/family-courts-biased-men-dangerous-fallacy-abuse\">The idea that family courts are biased against men is a dangerous fallacy | Sonia Sodha</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former child poverty tsar under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government, who subsequently worked on children\u2019s rights for charities and policy organisations, is the first director of the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory, which was set up just a year ago. </p> <p>Harker acknowledges that parents, children and their wider family who end up in the family justice system often feel as traumatised by the process they experience as they do about the final decision.</p> <p>The desire legal and social work professionals have to work in a humane way to deliver justice, she says, \u201cisn\u2019t always apparent to the children and families that experience the system first hand \u2013 and it\u2019s not much apparent to anyone outside the family justice system either, because it all operates so much in the dark\u201d.</p> <p>But she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a system full of people whose primary concern is for children and families.

  "<p>Last week, President Donald Trump announced measures that could rewrite Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with the US. The territory now appears to be on the cusp of having its status in the world change more fundamentally than it did with the handover from Britain in 1997.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Beijing announced it would legislate a new national security law and impose it on Hong Kong by decree, bypassing the city\u2019s duly elected legislature in flagrant disregard of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement under which Hong Kong has been governed.</p> <p>In response, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reported to Congress under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that Hong Kong no longer warranted treatment different from the rest of China, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">stating</a>: \u201cNo reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, last Friday, as a consequence of Pompeo\u2019s certification, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">announced</a> that he would be directing his administration \u201cto begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/hong-kong-officials-lash-out-at-trump-plan-to-strip-city-of-special-status\">Hong Kong officials lash out at Trump plan to strip city of special status</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As dramatic as the announcement was, Trump did not set out any specific measures: nothing has yet changed in the US-Hong Kong relationship. As such, there is still room for compromise, from both Beijing and Washington. However, the current environment does not suggest that compromise is in the air, and Trump\u2019s statement laid the groundwork and foreshadowed the White House\u2019s probable next steps.</p> <p>Many observers have wondered if the US might not end up hurting the very people they were supposedly trying to help: the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>Some of the potential US measures will not affect ordinary Hong Kong people or businesses. Certain bilateral agreements \u2013 such as those on extradition and mutual legal assistance \u2013 between Hong Kong and the US are likely to be the first casualties. This would end formal cooperation between Hong Kong and US authorities in criminal investigation and law enforcement, as well as remove the mechanism enabling the extradition of fugitives between the US and Hong Kong. Bringing Hong Kong within the scope of existing restrictions on exports of dual-use technologies is also a logical step, given Hong Kong\u2019s proximity, geographically and politically, to China. Hong Kong has allegedly been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/07/meng-wanzhou-huawei-cfo-court-bail-fraud-sanctions-breach-canada\">used to evade US sanctions</a> in the past.</p> <p>Sanctions are also on the cards for those Hong Kong and Beijing officials \u201cdirectly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d. This may include travel bans, or even extend to Treasury department sanctions over financial transactions and assets, and would cause pain for chief executive Carrie Lam and her ministers, but this would not affect ordinary Hong Kongers.</p> <p>However, the real challenge comes with Trump\u2019s threat to revoke Hong Kong\u2019s status as a separate customs and travel territory. This would mean the same tariffs, customs controls, quarantine and inspection standards, and visa rules would apply to Hong Kong as the rest of China, and would have serious adverse consequences for Hong Kong people and businesses. Many in Hong Kong are hoping that the US does not go that far. Pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/hong-kong-china-national-security-law.html\">argued in the New York Times</a> that \u201cremoving those privileges would only make Hong Kong more dependent on China\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps the most profound impact of the US action may be that Hong Kong, in the very near term, would become globally regarded to be part-and-parcel of China, and to carry with it China\u2019s reputation, for better or worse. In the past, Hong Kong has enjoyed its own, separate, global reputation. Hong Kong government leaders and trade delegations travelled the world meeting with foreign governments and advocating for Hong Kong in international business circles under the aegis of the \u201ctwo systems\u201d side of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. No matter what was happening in the rest of China, Hong Kong stood apart.</p> <p>Well, Hong Kong will stand apart no longer.</p> <p>It may be natural to blame the US for this, and some have already argued that the US measures are pushing Hong Kong closer to Beijing. Indeed, the changes in US policy towards Hong Kong are being driven by the bigger issue of a hardening US approach towards China, one of the&nbsp;few truly&nbsp;bipartisan issues remaining in US politics. In this sense, Hong Kong finds itself in the unfortunate position of&nbsp;being a pawn in an emerging cold war between the two superpowers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/beijing-hong-kong-beijing-china-uk-response\">Beijing has undermined the image of a stable Hong Kong | Isabel Hilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the sad reality is that Hong Kong government leaders have already been doing this themselves, all too willingly stepping into their role as proxies for Beijing, rather than standing up for the people of the city they are supposed to represent. This could not have been more evident than in the last week as Lam and many of her principal officials lined up to praise the new national security law, reciting from near-identical scripts that could have been drafted by the party central propaganda department.</p> <p>This is only the most recent example in a long-developing trend in which Hong Kong\u2019s leaders have gradually ceded its autonomy to Beijing. So, should there be any surprise when the Hong Kong they lead is finally treated accordingly?</p> <p>The reality is that Hong Kong\u2019s leaders have sacrificed the city\u2019s political neutrality: that special place Hong Kong held as a part of, yet at the same time apart from, the rest of China. The US measures are just the first international recognition of this process, and although they will also hasten its completion, it is hard not to conclude the process would have occurred in any event.</p> <p>The only hope for Hong Kong is that, with the advent of more enlightened leadership in Hong Kong or Beijing in the future, it might at some point be undone.</p> <p>\u2022 Antony Dapiran is the author of City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong</p> <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>",

At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/17/children-dont-get-presents-schools-open-over-christmas\">Parklands primary</a>, in Leeds, one of the most deprived schools in the country, fewer than 20% of children have access to a dedicated tablet, computer or smartphone. The headteacher, Chris Dyson, has been loaning textbooks and ensuring the worst-off families collect food parcels along with their books. \u201cThe best home schooling work these children can do is to read. When you read a book, you can get away from all this crisis and go to a new world.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping children will keep their love of learning going by doing bits and bobs, but our priority is their mental wellbeing so when they return to school, they come back safe and happy. Then we can start to pick up on the learning they\u2019ve missed.\u201d</p> <p>Maugham is sceptical about whether the government will be able to deliver on its promises and is concerned that, even when schools return, many children from poorer families may not. In a recent study by the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14848\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, higher-income parents were more willing for their child to go back to school than lower-income parents, despite the fact that children from better-off families were spending up to 75 more minutes a day \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/18/keeping-schools-closed-in-england-will-widen-educational-inequalities-study-ifs\">30% more time</a> \u2013 on home learning than poorer children.</p> <p>Rivers fears her daughters will not qualify for any government devices because they are not yet in year 10, and she is worried about them falling behind. \u201cThe most important thing I can do is to make sure they are happy and they\u2019re not stressed.

A typical day involves TV, board games, books, writing stories or comics, and arts and crafts activities. \u201cWe try and spend as much time as we can in the garden \u2013 it releases all the steam.\u201d </p> <p>But the pressure to teach them is taking its toll: \u201cSome days, I just don\u2019t know how I deal with it. I take my hat off to teachers. They need to be paid double.\u201d</p> <p>Rivers is also full of praise for School Home Support, a charity that works with schools to help families on low incomes and vulnerable children. Jaime McDonald from the charity, who is attached to Bethany\u2019s school, has been trying for weeks to get the family a laptop. \u201cShe\u2019s been absolutely brilliant, phoning up every day, asking how I am, even popping round to chat to me and the kids from a safe distance, bless her.\u201d</p> <p>School Home Support is rolling out a pilot that will give more than 120 families \u2013 including the Rivers family \u2013 access to technology and data over the next few weeks, thanks to donations from other charities and tech companies. \u201cWe knew that access to technology would be a real issue for the families we work with when the learning went online,\u201d said Jaine Stannard, the charity\u2019s chief executive. </p> <p>She says some families are facing financial ruin and so have more pressing problems to focus on than their children\u2019s schoolwork. Realistically, she thinks a lot of the children will not return to school until at least September: \u201cThat\u2019s a long gap to be missing school.\u201d</p> <p>The children who most need support from their teachers and the government are now further at risk, she says. \u201cThey will fall behind. The gap is going to widen.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Over the last half-century the world has been transformed by huge flows of trade and investment. The source of our food and the manufacture of everything from trainers to mobile phones has been revolutionised. Bank inquiries in Newcastle are handled in Bangalore. Secure industrial jobs have evaporated in Europe and North America and reappeared on the other side of the world. Exports, which amounted to less than 10% of global GDP in the 1970s, now stand at 25%.</p> <p>Globalisation has been a massive social and economic transformation. It has, by the same token, been hotly contentious, creating losers as well as winners. And this raised the question: would it be brought to an end by eruption of opposition? Again and again \u2013&nbsp;after the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-globalization-why-seattles-1999-protesters-were-right/282831/\">1999 Seattle WTO protests</a>, September 11, the financial crisis of 2008 and the election of Donald Trump \u2013 there have been predictions of globalisation\u2019s terminal crisis.&nbsp;In the background lurks the memory of the 1930s and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/04/2010s-like-1930s-look-facts-unemployment-healthcare\">Great Depression</a>, when trade and capital flows contracted, not to recover for the best part of half a century.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 shock has raised globalisation angst to a new pitch. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres20_e/pr855_e.htm\">predicting</a> that trade may fall by a record 32%. The lockdowns were disruptive enough. But as the economic crisis deepens, 2020 is beginning to look like something worse: a perfect disruptive storm.</p> <p>To see why, consider the range of factors that shape the international division of labour.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Start with politics.</p> <p>The pursuit of profit extends across national borders and lines of political conflict. But if you are going to set aside politics and diplomacy, you need to agree to differ. It helps if you have an arbiter, a global hegemon. It is no coincidence that the surge in global trade and investment coincided with what seemed like decisive American victory in the cold war.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to politics, the flow of goods is driven by technology. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century centred on cotton. A quarter of a millennium later the garment supply chain still spans the world, from the cotton farms of Australia to sweatshops in Bangladesh and big box malls in American suburbs, now empty of customers. Twenty-first century smartphones are produced by a hyper-sophisticated network linking labs and software coders in the west with chip foundries in South Korea and Vietnam and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract\">assembly lines</a> in China and Vietnam. The greatest single driver of globalisation in recent years has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/maersk-shipping-revolution-sustainability\">containeri</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/maersk-shipping-revolution-sustainability\">sation</a>, which slashed the cost of shipping.</p> <p>Apart from politics and technology, who makes what, and where, is decided by the terms of trade, which depend on the balance of costs and prices and the matrix of exchange rates. Sudden movements in currencies shift costs, disrupting existing patterns of demand and supply.</p> <p>Finally, whether we have the appetite to buy goods \u2013 made at home or abroad \u2013 depends on the overall state of the economy, on what economists call \u201caggregate demand\u201d, the sum of consumption, investment and government spending.</p> <p>Add together technology, price effects, macroeconomics and geopolitics and it becomes clear why, in 2020, we face a perfect storm.</p> <p>On the technological front, containerisation and the revolution in outsourcing have run their course. The car industry, which operates the most complex supply chains, is undergoing a technological revolution. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/25/2020-set-to-be-year-of-the-electric-car-say-industry-analysts\">advent of electric cars</a> (or what the industry calls \u201ce-mobility\u201d) will simplify and shrink production, cutting millions of jobs. Consultants like McKinsey\u2019s reckon that it will only be a matter of time before the armies of female <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/garment-workers-face-destitution-as-covid-19-closes-factories\">factory workers</a> currently employed in cutting and sewing clothes will be replaced by robots.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Covid-19 recession has slashed consumption and investment. The US is by far the largest importer, and its demand has been hammered. The current strength of the dollar will go some way towards offsetting the fall in American consumption. A more valuable dollar makes it more attractive to export to the US. But it may also trigger new trade wars.</p> <p>Particularly aggravating to the White House will be the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-forex/brazils-real-falls-to-a-record-low-of-5-3750-per-dollar-idUSS0N2BG02B\">fall in the Brazilian currency</a>, the real. Trump may regard the Brazilian president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/brazils-left-and-right-unite-to-back-pro-democracy-manifesto-bolsonaro\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> as a kindred spirit, but he will not like the huge surge in Brazilian exports as China\u2019s pig farmers opt for the cheapest source of animal feed.</p> <p>The promise of increased agricultural exports from the US to China was key to the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/13/china-confirms-phase-one-trade-deal-us-tariffs\">phase one trade deal</a>, solemnised in January. At least for a few weeks early this year Trump stuck to the phase one script. But that restraint has not lasted. Since April there has been a truly spectacular escalation in rhetoric between Washington and Beijing.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s nationalist bluster plays to his gallery. China makes a good stick with which to beat Joe Biden, who is reputed to favour a more cooperative line. Altogether more serious is the systematic reorientation in US strategy towards China that had already begun under Barack Obama, with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/obama-foreign-policy-pivots-asia\">pivot to Asia</a>\u201d in 2011, and culminated in May 2020 with the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/U.S.-Strategic-Approach-to-The-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Report-5.20.20.pdf\">release</a> by the Trump administration of a comprehensive new strategy document.</p> <p>The document ends any further discussion in Washington of the possible convergence of China with the western model. Instead, all branches of American government are sworn in on a posture of great power competition. Nor is this merely rhetoric. It goes hand in hand with a further round of sanctions against China\u2019s telecoms champion, Huawei. By refusing to allow <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-help-taiwan-firm-build-chip-plant-iarizona/\">chips for Huawei</a>, even chips of Huawei\u2019s own design, to be manufactured on ultra hi-tech equipment that Taiwanese chip foundries source from the US, the Trump administration has effectively declared a technological war.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK has announced its decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/22/boris-johnson-forced-to-reduce-huaweis-role-in-uks-5g-networks\">exclude Huawei</a> from its 5G network within three years. Australia and China are embroiled in a mini-trade war over barley and beef. Huawei executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition\">Meng Wanzhou</a> awaits her fate under house arrest in Canada. If she is extradited to the US, expect a storm to break loose.</p> <p>Of course, there are countervailing forces. Business, including American business, remains deeply committed to foreign investment and trade. Europe is reluctant to choose between the US and China. Angela Merkel has announced that she will make <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-china/news/china-one-of-germanys-eu-presidency-priorities/\">relations with China</a> one of the priorities of Germany\u2019s presidency of the European council.</p> <p>But, deal-making apart, the broader vision of the flat world of globalisation is dead. The institution that most clearly embodied that \u201cend of history\u201d vision, the WTO, was launched in January 1995. Today, the WTO is in tatters. Its dispute-processing procedures have been paralysed by deliberate American obstruction and its head, Brazilian Roberto Azev\u00eado, has announced that he is resigning a year ahead of time, which leaves the WTO leaderless in the face of the greatest shock to world trade since 1945.</p> <p>Comparisons with the 1930s should not be taken too far. We don\u2019t live under the shadow of total war, and there are good reasons to welcome the end of 1990s-style hyper-globalisation. But we should not underestimate the break with the recent past or kid ourselves that there is any obvious alternative on offer.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University</p>",
  "<p>My initial instinct on moving to Portugal a few years ago was to fill my bookshelf with non-fiction. There lay the path to the country\u2019s history, culture and politics, I figured. And, so it proved.

For a lighter and more uplifting read, however, my pick would be his 1982 historical romp, Baltasar and Blimunda. Framed by the construction of the Convent of Mafra, a modern-day tourist honeypot, it describes a heretical priest trying to escape the clutches of the Inquisition with the aid of a one-handed former solider (Baltasar) and his X-ray-eyed lover (Blimunda).</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\">Hunting Midnight by Richard Zimler</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"36ea466bb27c4785162aadcc39b8b4f287666448\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ea466bb27c4785162aadcc39b8b4f287666448/0_0_429_675/318.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Hunting Midnight by Richard Zimler.\" width=\"318\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Few non-native novelists know Portugal more intimately nor write about it more gracefully than the naturalised American Richard Zimler.

Set in and around the village of Mamarrosa, this series of gently unfolding vignettes transports readers into the lives \u2013 and minds \u2013 of a fictional populace: a disgruntled cafe owner, a wannabe <em>au pair</em>, a squalid English family, a gay pig farmer.

The protagonist, a Swiss classicist called Raimund Gregorius (played by Jeremy Irons in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/night-train-to-lisbon-review-jeremy-irons\">2013 film adaptation</a>), becomes intrigued by some notebooks he stumbles on by a Portuguese doctor called Amadeu de Prado. Amadeu has the misfortune of being obliged to treat the head of Salazar\u2019s secret police. By saving the man\u2019s life, the until-then popular doctor finds his own life upturned.

The ocean of his Booker-winning debut is swapped here for the terra firma of Portugal over a century-long timeframe.

Perhaps that\u2019s why the country appears to suffer so little post-colonial angst. Dulce Maria Cardoso\u2019s recent novel The Return shows another less celebrated side of the imperial narrative. After the independence wars in Lusophone Africa of the 1960s and early 1970s, Portuguese evacuees upped and went back to the \u201cmotherland\u201d in droves \u2013 an involuntary reverse migration that required adjustment on the part of both returnees and recipients.

Ostensibly, life has changed considerably since Torga\u2019s day, the dirt-poor villages of his youth are now blessed with electricity, the internet, running water and paved roads.

For a more positive spin on Portugal, try his posthumous romance The City and the Mountains, which is set between Paris (affluent, yet vacuous) and the Douro valley (impoverished, yet enchanting). That said, if your lockdown luggage allows for only one E\u00e7a de Queiroz title, then it has to be his 1888 masterpiece, The Maias.

  "<p>In April, almost 40 million children missed their polio drops in Pakistan after the cancellation of the nationwide vaccination campaign.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alongside Afghanistan, Pakistan is one of only two countries in the world where polio is still endemic. It was very close to&nbsp;becoming&nbsp; polio free, with only 12 cases in 2018, but last year the number of cases rose to 147. In the same year, Pakistan was &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/07/pakistan-accused-of-cover-up-over-fresh-polio-outbreak\">accused</a>&nbsp;of covering up&nbsp;the&nbsp;resurgence of the&nbsp;P2 strain of the virus, which was thought to have been eradicated in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last year had been a challenge as polio bounced back,&nbsp;Dr Rana Muhammad Safdar, national&nbsp; coordinator for&nbsp;polio eradication, told the Guardian.&nbsp;\u201cWe&nbsp;will&nbsp;plan a nationwide campaign as soon as we get an opportunity. But we are equally worried about routine immunisation campaigns as&nbsp;those&nbsp;are being missed due to Covid-19. I fear for the outbreak of vaccine drive diseases, such as measles.\u201d</p> <p>So far this year 47 cases have been reported. The Guardian talked to six Pakistani polio officials and scientific experts, who are not officially allowed to talk to the media. They fear that Pakistan is back to&nbsp;2014 levels, the&nbsp;worst&nbsp;year&nbsp;in recent records.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) recommended on 24 March that all vaccination programmes be paused until the second half of the year.&nbsp;\u201cWe did not want to have the programme be responsible for worsening the situation with Covid-19,\u201d&nbsp;said Michel Zaffran, director of the World Health Organization-led group.</p> <p>Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq,&nbsp; who received an award for her work against polio, told the Guardian&nbsp;the pause was dangerous.&nbsp;\u201cIf one programme was not effective, we would call it a disaster, but missing an entire national campaign would have unimaginable consequences.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Officials say&nbsp;the disease has spread beyond the&nbsp;three core areas&nbsp;of&nbsp;Karachi, Quetta&nbsp;and&nbsp;Peshawar,&nbsp;and is now present in&nbsp;central Pakistan.&nbsp;The&nbsp; virus spreads easily in summer&nbsp;and this year could see more than 200 cases.</p> <p>\u201cNothing can be worse than this situation. We have positive samples everywhere. It is strengthening and spreading,\u201d a scientific expert in the programme told the Guardian.</p> <p>Pakistan has&nbsp;received&nbsp;international funding for polio eradication&nbsp;since 1994, but Safdar said it was not possible to know the exact amount, as the aid&nbsp;has&nbsp;come from various groups.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe have a failure tag attached with us,\u201d an official who has worked with&nbsp;the&nbsp;polio programme&nbsp;for&nbsp; more than 15 years&nbsp; said. \u201cWe are the most funded polio programme&nbsp;[in the world]. India eradicated polio with lesser funding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile the increase in cases in 2019 was disappointing, we are confident Pakistan can stop polio,\u201d&nbsp;a spokesperson for&nbsp; the Gates Foundation told the Guardian.&nbsp;The foundation&nbsp;has contributed $3.7bn (\u00a33bn) to the global eradication initiative since 2007. The funding is disbursed to countries like Pakistan through the World Health Organization and Unicef.</p> <p>Donors may not say it openly, but \u201cdefinitely, they are worried and frustrated\u201d, Farooq said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df88065f9029c4f4788aa2aa5312a5c8514013be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df88065f9029c4f4788aa2aa5312a5c8514013be/0_0_4030_2686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump arrives in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington DC, US, 29 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump has announced that the US will be ending cooperation with the World Health Organization.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Gripas/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> President Trump\u2019s freeze on US funding for the WHO,&nbsp;along with the focus on Covid-19,&nbsp; has also made &nbsp;it hard&nbsp;to&nbsp;fund&nbsp;the&nbsp;polio programme.</p> <p>The US&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of the founding members&nbsp;of the GPEI, and&nbsp;also provides&nbsp;assistance and funds for&nbsp;the&nbsp;polio programme. \u201cCDC-supported programmes and activities&nbsp;will&nbsp;be put at risk the longer&nbsp;a&nbsp;funding halt continues,\u201d Benjamin Haynes, deputy branch chief&nbsp;of the&nbsp;CDC, told the Guardian.</p> <p>There is also a fear among Pakistani officials that the virus could spread to other parts of the world.</p> <p>\u201cIt would not take it a long time to spread. Everything depends on the gaps and the time the virus gets in Pakistan to spread to other parts of the world,\u201d Safdar said.</p> <p>\u201cSome people don\u2019t take polio seriously because there is no direct death involved in it, but it does have a huge human cost not only for Pakistanis but for the world too,\u201d a scientific expert said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/27/a-rise-in-deaths-from-preventable-diseases-must-not-be-part-of-covid-19s-legacy\">A rise in deaths from preventable diseases must not be part of Covid-19's legacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The International Monitoring Board in its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1517651\">report</a>&nbsp;last year said the polio programme had become \u201ca political football\u201d in Pakistan.

  "<p>European Union and British negotiators will face each other screen-to-screen as the latest round of Brexit talks get under way on Tuesday. During this four-day round, the most time has been allocated to one of the toughest issues: fishing rights.</p> <h2><strong>Why is such a small industry such a big problem?</strong></h2> <p>Fishing is a drop in the ocean of the UK economy (just 0.12% of economic output) but has become one of the most intractable issues of the Brexit talks. The reasons boil down to history, geography and politics. More than 100 categories of fish straddle EU-UK waters. Securing greater British control of these fish was a big promise of the 2016 Brexit campaign, one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1203981568055947264\">repeated by Boris Johnson </a>ahead of his 2019 election victory.</p> <p>But the EU has eight member states with a lot to lose, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-fish-eu-trawlers-set-new-course-post-brexit\">Belgium</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/18/denmark-to-contest-uk-efforts-to-take-back-control-of-fisheries\">Denmark</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/09/worst-case-scenario-britains-too-german-fears-fishing-industry-brexit\">Germany</a>, who say they can trace their exploits fishing in British waters back hundreds of years. </p> <h2><strong>What does the UK want?</strong></h2> <p>More fish is the short answer. The government believes the deal agreed on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jun/02/guardian190-britain-enters-eec-1973\">British entry</a> into the European Economic Community in 1973 was unfair and needs to be unpicked. That agreement \u2013 later enshrined in the common fisheries policy (CFP) \u2013 is based on historic catches. The result is that EU-based fleets land about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/04/uk-to-take-charge-of-its-fishing-waters-under-post-brexit-plan\">eight times as much fish</a> in UK waters as British fishermen do in EU waters, according to UK government data.&nbsp;</p> <p>The UK wants to agree annual quotas with the EU based on the principle of \u201czonal attachment\u201d, meaning agreeing shares based on the percentage of fish inside each side\u2019s exclusive economic zone (a 200-mile area round the shore). British officials argue that this system would be fairer, more scientific and is already used by the EU in its annual quota-setting talks with Norway.</p> <h2><strong>What does the EU want?</strong></h2> <p>The EU wants the status quo, which allows member states to fish in British waters, with the most lucrative harvests for France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark. The negotiating mandate drawn up by the 27 member states instructs the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier \u2013 a former French fisheries minister -&nbsp;to \u201cavoid economic dislocation\u201d for European fleets, which have traditionally fished in British waters. For the EU this means \u201cquota shares\u201d that could be in place for as long as 25 years. EU officials say an annual negotiation is doable with Norway, where only six categories of fish are at stake.</p> <h2><strong>What does the fishing industry say?</strong></h2> <p>British fishing fleets were some of the most vocal supporters of Brexit. The Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation is urging the government to stick to its guns and ensure \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sff.co.uk/no-brexit-betrayal-warns-sff/\">unfettered control over access</a>\u201d to UK waters, although it doesn\u2019t rule out allowing in EU vessels. The shellfish sector, which is not covered by the CFP, wants to maintain access to EU markets and has warned that no-deal tariffs could cost \u00a341m a year. </p> <h2>Are there enough fish in the sea?</h2> <p>Conservationists worry that Brexit is a big distraction from overfishing. Around 41% of commercial fish stocks in the north-east Atlantic, including the North Sea, are overfished, according to Oceana. The NGO thinks the British government\u2019s fisheries bill does not go as far as the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy in its<em> </em>intentions to prevent overfishing, although it and other conservationists have often criticised the EU for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/18/eu-ministers-opt-to-continue-overfishing-despite-2020-deadline\">failing to meet promises</a> to prevent the overexploitation of the seas.</p> <h2><strong>Who holds the cards?</strong></h2> <p>EU officials think that the UK probably has more leverage over fisheries than any other aspect of the Brexit talks. But the EU also has cards to play: 71% of British seafood exports go to the EU, while European fleets in UK waters often specialise in catching fish that are less popular with British consumers, such as herring. Former senior UK official <a href=\"https://infacts.org/better-deal-uk-fishermen-will-hard-catch/\">Andy Lebrecht</a> has warned that English fishing fleets risk losing access to French and Irish waters if talks sour.</p> <h2><strong>Will there be a deal?</strong></h2> <p>The two sides pledged to exert \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to agree a fishing deal by 1 July to give crews time to adjust to changes from 2021. But hopes of an imminent breakthrough are low, despite hints of progress. Barnier has described both sides positions as \u201cmaximalist\u201d and said fishing was \u201cperhaps the only positive\u201d outcome from the last round of negotiations. While the two sides are set to hold deeper technical discussions from Tuesday, the EU\u2019s fishing member states have made it clear to Barnier that they are in no mood for compromise.&nbsp;</p> <h2>What if there is no deal on fisheries?</h2> <p>If the EU lives up to its oft-repeated threat, no deal on fisheries means no deal on anything. British-EU relations would fall into a more antagonistic phase that would stunt trade and cooperation, with tariffs levied on British fish being sold into the EU and many other goods.&nbsp;</p> <p>No deal on fishing could also lead to skirmishes on the seas similar<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/05/france-and-uk-announce-agreement-to-end-scallop-wars\"> to the 2018 \u201cscallop wars\u201d</a>.&nbsp;Earlier this year, it emerged that the UK had been quietly increasing its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/05/uk-to-strengthen-sea-patrols-to-ward-off-post-brexit-fishing-wars\">maritime defences</a> to prevent a repeat of the 1970s cod wars.&nbsp;Navy boats are just a small part of the armoury, which includes satellite tracking, although British officials concede that they cannot control every square kilometre of British waters.</p> <p>For now, both sides say they want a deal.</p>",

I didn\u2019t know the song, and when I looked it up, I found a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHkQYDoVJ0\" title=\"\">glorious video</a> of 26,000 Hibernian fans singing it in a sun-drenched Hampden Park, after a long-hoped-for Scottish Cup win in 2016. Both teams had left the pitch, and the Rangers\u2019 half of the stadium was empty. It looked like a concert in which the fans were simultaneously the performer and the audience.</p> <p>I was entranced. I watched it again, and again. The sight and sound of this collective joy was transcendent: tens of thousands of green-and-white scarves held aloft, everyone belting out the song at the tops of their lungs. When the crowd hits the chorus, the volume levels on the shaky smartphone video blow their limit, exploding into a delirious roar of noise. I thought of something that one of the leaders of the nationwide \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tunelesschoir.com/\" title=\"\">Tuneless Choirs</a>\u201d \u2013 specifically for people who can\u2019t sing \u2013 once said: \u201cIf you get enough people singing together, with enough volume, it always sounds good.\u201d Our individual failings are submerged; we become greater than the sum of our meagre parts. Anthems sung alone sound thin and absurd \u2013 think of the spectacle of a pop star bellowing the Star-Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl. Anthems need the warmth of harmony, or even the chafing of dissonance. They need the full sound of bodies brushing up against each other in pride, joy or righteousness.</p> <p>Sunshine on Leith is ostensibly a love song, but in this instance, it wasn\u2019t being sung to a lover, or to the victorious Hibs players, or to the football club, or to Leith \u2013 the 26,000 singers seemed to be addressing each other. In their many and varied voices, they had transformed it into a love song to the crowd: \u201cWhile I\u2019m worth my room on this Earth, I will be with you / While the chief puts sunshine on Leith, I\u2019ll thank him for his work, and your birth and my birth.\u201d In the YouTube comments, fans of other clubs, from Millwall to Lyon \u2013 and even Hibs\u2019 arch-rivals Hearts \u2013 congratulate the Hibbies; not on the cup victory, not on the performance of the team, but that of the crowd. \u201cEven the riot police horses shedding tears there,\u201d observes one.</p> <p>As the lockdown commenced, I found myself cueing up other songs that reminded me of crowds. In the way a single snatch of melody can instantly remind you of an ex, or an old friend, I wanted songs that reminded me of what it\u2019s like to be with thousands of strangers. I listened to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BwWKXjVaI\" title=\"\">Drake\u2019s Nice for What</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8HoEvDh70Y\" title=\"\">Koffee\u2019s Toast</a>, which took me back to swaying tipsily in the crush of Notting Hill carnival, of being giddily overwhelmed, as the juddering sub-bass moved in waves through a million ribcages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1f4841c654ad29c6b6ac786970f3feca10dd5e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f4841c654ad29c6b6ac786970f3feca10dd5e4/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Notting Hill carnival in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Notting Hill carnival in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miles Davies/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I missed the disinhibition of dancing in a dark, low-ceilinged club. I missed screaming into the cold winter air of the AFC Wimbledon terraces about an outrageous refereeing decision. I missed the joy of chanting and feeling my own thin voice being made whole by others joining it in unison. I missed the tingling mixture of anxiety and vertigo of the moment you first step out into a festival or football or carnival or protest crowd, a feeling of over-stimulation, the ripples of noise and colour jostling for your attention, the anticipation of being subsumed in the crowd and yet powered up by it \u2013 of losing a part of yourself, and your independence, and being glad to. I missed the strange alchemy of congregation, when your brain pulses with the validation of being with so many people who have chosen the same path. <em>How could I be wrong? Look, all these people are here, too.</em></p> <p>While many of us were missing crowds, the realities of Covid-19 meant they had taken on a completely new meaning. Gathering with others was suddenly, paradoxically antisocial: it suggested you were careless about viral transmission of a deadly disease, more interested in your own short-term social needs than the lives of strangers. The very sight of a crowd suddenly seemed alarming. We shook our heads at rumours of parties, and shared pictures of Cheltenham festival or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stereophonics/status/1238944498006274048\" title=\"\">the Stereophonics\u2019 Cardiff gigs</a> as if they were clips from horror films. Festivals, congregations, assemblies, raves, processions, choirs, rallies, demonstrations, audiences in stadiums, halls, clubs, theatres and cinemas \u2013 gatherings of any kind became fatal. As lockdown begins to ease, people are again gathering to socialise in parks and on beaches, and to rail against injustice in Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/crowds-gather-in-britain-to-support-us-george-floyd-protests\" title=\"\">protests</a>, but crowds as we used to know them won\u2019t be coming back for many months to come.</p> <p>While the pandemic has made exceptional demands of us, even before the Covid-19 lockdown, crowds have been under threat. We were becoming ever more atomised, and pushed further into our homes, and crowds were becoming more domesticated, enclosed, surveilled and expensive to be a part of. Our opportunities to gather freely, in both senses of the word, have greatly diminished since the 90s. And yet, throughout human history, there has always been something pleasingly resilient about the crowd: however many new ways are found to disperse it, it will always find a way to reconvene.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Crowds have always had a bad rap: there is no gentle mob, no friendly pack. The same disinhibition that allows for moments of great joy can also enable grotesque crimes. The people who gathered to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/a-lynching-in-georgia-the-living-memorial-to-americas-history-of-racist-violence\" title=\"\">lynchings</a> in the US, or recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks\" title=\"\">attacks on Muslims</a> by groups of Hindu nationalists in India, were not just bystanders but participants. Their presence and acquiescence helped make the violence possible. And just as the people at the back of the crowd empower those at the front, the reverse can be true. The hooligan firm leader who throws the first cafe chair across a moonlit plaza on a balmy European away day makes it easier for more timid members of the crowd to cross their own \u201ccooperation threshold\u201d and join in.</p> <p>Even celebratory or worshipful crowds can go wrong, and when they do, they generate an unmatched horror. Few things strike fear like the the idea of mass panic, few words as chilling as \u201ccaught up in a stampede\u201d or \u201ctrampled to death\u201d. The horror of the 96 dead at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a> in 1989, or the 21 suffocated at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/31/germany-mourns-love-parade-dead\" title=\"\">2010 Berlin Love Parade</a>, or the 2,400 killed in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/2015-hajj-stampede-deadliest-ever-as-foreign-governments-put-toll-at-1849\" title=\"\">crowd collapse at the 2015 Hajj</a>, gnaws at something deep in our psyches. For some people, even a peaceful and orderly crowd can be scary, triggering intense anxiety or PTSD.</p> <p>Informed by tragedies, uprisings and protests alike, for a long time crowds were seen as inherently dangerous and lobotomising. But during the past couple of decades, thanks to work by social psychologists, behavioural scientists and anthropologists, a new understanding of the complexity of crowd behaviour has become increasingly influential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"571ae27664d666c868a877919fdc3db4cd1e66fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/571ae27664d666c868a877919fdc3db4cd1e66fc/0_0_3000_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A depiction of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819, when cavalry charged on a crowd at a political rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A depiction of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819, when cavalry charged on a crowd at a political rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For most of us, a crowd can be an alluring thing, because the desire to be among the throng seems to be innate. Gathering together for ritualistic celebrations \u2013 dancing, chanting, festivalling, costuming, singing, marching \u2013 goes back almost as far as we have any record of human behaviour. In 2003, 13,000-year-old cave paintings were discovered in Nottinghamshire that seemed to show \u201cconga lines\u201d of dancing women. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/15/highereducation.research\" title=\"\">According to</a> the archeologist Paul Pettitt, the paintings matched others across Europe, indicating that they were part of a continent-wide Paleolithic culture of collective singing and dancing.</p> <p>In Barbara Ehrenreich\u2019s 2007 book Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy, she draws on the work of anthropologists including Robin Dunbar to argue that dancing and music-making was a social glue that helped stone-age families join together in groups larger than the family unit, to hunt and protect themselves from predators. For Ehrenreich, rituals of collective joy are as intrinsic to human development as speech. More recent <a href=\"https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/news/the-power-of-singing-and-dancing-together\" title=\"\">experiments</a> by Dunbar and his colleagues have suggested that the capacity of singing together to bond groups of strangers shows it \u201cmay have played a role in the evolutionary success of modern humans over their early relatives\u201d.</p> <p>The power of crowds has long fixated religious and secular leaders alike, who have sought to harness communal energy for their own glorification, or to tame mass gatherings when they start to take on a momentum of their own. Ehrenreich records the medieval Christian church\u2019s long battle to eradicate unruly, ecstatic or immoderate dancing from the congregation. In later centuries, as the reformation and industrial revolution proceeded, festivals, feast days, sports, revels and ecstatic rituals of countless kinds were outlawed for their tendency to result in drunken, pagan or otherwise ungodly behaviour. Between the 17th and 20th centuries, there were \u201cliterally thousands of acts of legislation introduced which attempted to outlaw carnival and popular festivity from European life,\u201d wrote Peter Stallybrass and Allon White in The Politics and Poetics of Transgression.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the 19th century, as industrialising cities exploded in size, that the formal study of crowd psychology and herd behaviour emerged. Reflecting on the French Revolution a century earlier, thinkers such as Gustave Le Bon helped promote the idea that a crowd is always on the verge of becoming a mob. Stirred up by agitators, crowds could quickly turn to violence, sweeping up even good, upstanding citizens in their collective madness. \u201cBy the mere fact that he forms part of an organised crowd,\u201d Le Bon wrote, \u201ca man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation.\u201d</p> <p>While the discipline of crowd psychology has moved on considerably since the days of Le Bon, these early theories still retain their hold, says Clifford Stott, a professor of social psychology at Keele University. Much of the media coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\" title=\"\">riots</a> that broke out across England in 2011 echoed the explanations of the 19th-century pioneers of crowd psychology: they were a pathological intrusion into civilised society, a contagion, spread by agitators, of the normally stable and contented body politic. Focus fell, in particular, on ill-defined \u201ccriminal gangs\u201d stirring things up, possibly coordinating things via BlackBerry Messenger. The foot soldiers \u2013 30,000 people were thought to have participated \u2013 were depicted as feral thugs. Hordes. Animals. The frontpage <a href=\"https://www.thepaperboy.com/uk/2011/08/09/front-pages-archive.cfm\" title=\"\">headlines</a> were clear: \u201cRule of the mob\u201d, \u201cYob rule\u201d, \u201cFlaming morons\u201d. Purportedly liberal voices clamoured for David Cameron to send in the army. Shoot looters on sight. Wheel in the water cannon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0f0d1705e3c0f1f5c788b8810f53b3f953ff224\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0f0d1705e3c0f1f5c788b8810f53b3f953ff224/0_111_3200_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riots in Hackney, east London in August 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riots in Hackney, east London in August 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we need to recognise is that from a scientific perspective, classical [crowd] theory has no validity,\u201d says Stott. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t explain or predict the behaviours it purports to explain and predict. And yet everywhere you look, the narrative is still there.\u201d The reason, he argues, is straightforward: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very convenient for dominant and powerful groups,\u201d Stott says. \u201cIt pathologises, decontextualises and renders meaningless crowd violence, and therefore legitimises its repression.\u201d As Stott notes, by shifting the blame to the madness of crowds, it also conveniently allows the powerful to avoid scrutinising their own responsibility for the violence. Last week, when the US attorney general <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-minneapolis-police-protests-barr/us-attorney-general-says-outside-agitators-taking-over-anti-police-protests-idUKKBN2360PQ\" title=\"\">blamed</a> \u201coutside agitators\u201d for stirring up violence, and Donald Trump referred to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1266724553620930561\" title=\"\">professionally managed</a>\u201d \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1266231100780744704\" title=\"\">thugs</a>\u201d, they were drawing on exactly the ideas that Le Bon sketched out in the 19th century.</p> <p>In recent decades, detailed analytical research has produced ever-more sophisticated insights into crowd behaviour, many of which disprove these long-standing assumptions. \u201cCrowds have an amazing ability to police themselves, self-regulate, and actually display a lot of pro-social behaviour, supporting others in their group,\u201d says Anne Templeton, an academic at Edinburgh University who studies crowd psychology. She points to the 2017 Manchester Arena terrorist attack, in which CCTV footage showed members of the public performing first aid on the wounded before emergency services arrived, and Mancunians rushed to provide food, shelter, transport and emotional support for the victims. \u201cPeople provide an amazing amount of help in emergencies to people they don\u2019t know, especially when they\u2019re part of an in-group.\u201d</p> <p>Strange things happen to our brains when we\u2019re in a crowd we\u2019ve chosen to be part of, says Templeton. We don\u2019t just feel happier and more confident, we also have a lower threshold of disgust. This is why festivalgoers will happily share drinks (and by dint of their proximity, sweat) with strangers, or Hajj pilgrims will share the sometimes bloody razors used to shave their heads. In a crowd, we feel safer from harm.</p> <p>If we now have a better grasp of the complexity of crowd dynamics, the core truth about them is relatively simple: they have the potential to magnify both the good and bad in us. The loss of self in a crowd can lead to unthinkable violence, just as it can ecstatic transcendence. What is striking is that, in recent decades, the latter has troubled the British establishment every bit as much as the former.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u2018The open crowd is the true crowd,\u201d wrote Elias Canetti in his 1960 book Crowds and Power \u2013 \u201cthe crowd abandoning itself freely to its natural urge for growth\u201d, rather than those hemmed in by authorities, limited in shape and size. The Sermon on the Mount, he writes, was delivered to an open crowd. The obsequious flock, the brainwashed cult, the army marching in lock-step, is a world away from a fluid, democratic, sometimes anarchic congregation of the people. These open crowds have become harder to find, and harder to keep open.</p> <p>Contemporary Britain\u2019s idea of the crowd was formed by two explosions in unruly mass culture at the end of the last century. First, by 70s and 80s football fandom and its manifold sins, and the avoidable tragedy of Hillsborough \u2013 a tragedy created by the authorities\u2019 views of the crowd as animalistic thugs, a fear and loathing that permeated the media, police, political class and football authorities. And second, by the acid house explosion and rave scene of the late 80s and early 90s, a subcultural surge of illegal or at least illicit \u201cfree parties\u201d in fields and warehouses across the country. Both cultures flourished in spite of widespread media demonisation, both fought the law \u2013 and in both cases, the law won. Things have never been the same since for people who wish to assemble on their own terms.</p> <p>The policing, containment and enclosure of \u201cfree\u201d raves is particularly instructive, suggesting that the authorities fear a happy crowd as much as a pitchfork-carrying one. For the novelist Hari Kunzru, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/17/opinion/17iht-edkunzru.1.7534262.html\" title=\"\">reflecting on</a> his 90s youth a few years ago, approaching the site of a rave, feeling \u201cthe bass pulsing up ahead, the excitement was almost unbearable. A mass of dancers lifting up like a single body \u2026 [an] ecstatic fantasy of community, a zone where we were networked with each other, rather than with the office switchboard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30de306e340beeea56cedb538464374cb7202dea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30de306e340beeea56cedb538464374cb7202dea/0_0_2944_1976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An acid house rave in Berkshire, UK in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An acid house party in Berkshire in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The culmination of the rave era, and the beginning of its end, was the epochal 1992 Castlemorton Common festival, a week-long, outdoor free party in Worcestershire, with numbers in excess of 20,000. Writing about it in the Evening Standard, Anthony Burgess summed up the establishment mood, railing against \u201cthe megacrowd, reducing the individual intelligence to that of an amoeba\u201d. One man\u2019s escapist fantasy of community is another\u2019s vision of civilisational collapse, and the Thatcher-into-Major-era junta of the tabloid press, police, landowners and the Conservative party made it their business to disperse rave\u2019s congregation of squatters, dropouts, drug-takers, hippies, hunt saboteurs, anti-road protesters and travellers.</p> <p>In 1994, parliament passed the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/part/V/crossheading/powers-in-relation-to-raves\" title=\"\">outlawed</a> any open air, night-time public congregation around amplified music. \u201cFor this purpose,\u201d the act specified, \u201c\u2018music\u2019 includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.\u201d Any ambiguity about the target of the legislation was wiped away during the House of Lords debate on the bill. The Conservative deputy leader of the House, the hereditary peer Earl Ferrers, <a href=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1994/may/24/criminal-justice-and-public-order-bill\" title=\"\">suggested</a> an amendment \u201cwhich would catch a rave party but would not also catch a Pavarotti concert, a barbecue or people having a dance in the early hours of the evening\u201d. I do hope, replied another, that they would not risk jailing Pavarotti under the new legislation.</p> <p>For the ravers, what had begun as a transcendent celebration turned into a question of the right to assemble in the first place. Before the bill passed into law, three elegiac \u201cKill the Bill\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/vd8gbj/anti-rave-act-protests-20th-anniversary-204\" title=\"\">protest-parties</a> took place in 1994, drawing tens of thousands, and culminating in October when bare-chested, dreadlocked protesters shook the gates of Downing Street to a soundtrack of whistles, cheers and repetitive beats. In archival <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpJj4AjtOjw\" title=\"\">video</a> from that day, a protester clambers to the top of the gates and sits there nonchalantly smoking a fag, while police in short-sleeved shirts look on in horror. It is a telling time capsule, because it is hard to imagine any crowd of protesters getting this close to No 10 ever again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"94e2940fe8bb4dcc756cfb8c31df5d48ba26b7fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e2940fe8bb4dcc756cfb8c31df5d48ba26b7fa/0_0_5419_3568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police stand guard over the decks after busting an illegal warehouse party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police bust a warehouse party circa 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PYMCA/Universal Images Group/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Criminal Justice Act killed the free party scene, and like Hillsborough, its legacy is still felt to this day. In fact, it was only the beginning of a series of restrictions on free assembly. The past 25 years have been a challenging time for crowds, thanks to the rise of surveillance technology and privatisation of public space. During the 1990s, 78% of the Home Office crime prevention budget <a href=\"https://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/criminology/msc/unit8/page_09.htm\" title=\"\">was spent</a> on implementing CCTV \u2013 and a further \u00a3500m of public money was spent on it between 2000 and 2006. London became the most surveilled city in the world for a time, and even today <a href=\"https://www.securitymagazine.com/gdpr-policy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.securitymagazine.com%2Farticles%2F90759-what-are-the-worlds-most-heavily-surveilled-cities\" title=\"\">no city outside China</a> has more CCTV per head.</p> <p>The explosion of CCTV is just one way the 21st-century city hampers the freedom of the crowd. Urban regeneration programmes are designed to channel us efficiently towards work and the shops \u2013 spaces built for Homo economicus, human beings interacting transactionally, rather as social citizens. What look like potential meeting grounds for crowds in the modern British city are often mirages: regeneration zones such as Spinningfields in Manchester, Liverpool One and More London have replaced genuine public spaces with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/revealed-pseudo-public-space-pops-london-investigation-map\" title=\"\">privately owned public spaces</a>. These are patrolled by security guards and underwritten by private rules and regulations, whereby the owners are perfectly entitled to ban gatherings and political protests, and move along whoever they like, whenever they like.</p> <p>In 2011, when Occupy London attempted to set up camp in Paternoster Square, outside the London Stock Exchange, they were blocked by police barricades, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/26/private-spaces-protest-occupy-london\" title=\"\">enforcing</a> an emergency high court injunction that established that the land was indeed private property. This was odd, the Observer\u2019s architecture critic Rowan Moore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/13/london-river-park-floating-public-space\" title=\"\">wrote</a> at the time, \u201cas almost every architectural statement, planning application, and press release, in the protracted redevelopment of Paternoster Square, described this \u2018private land\u2019 as \u2018public space\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If the average British city has undergone huge transformations since the Criminal Justice Act, then so have the people in it. Crowd behaviour in the 21st century has been conditioned by the new devices at our fingertips as much as the changing ground beneath our feet, or the laws that govern their movement. In his prescient 2002 book Smart Mobs, the critic Harold Rheingold identified new types of crowds that were able to act in concert even before they had met. He predicted a \u201csocial tsunami\u201d to come from the next wave of mobile telecoms, pointing to the mass SMS chains in Manila that were used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/20/johnaglionby1\" title=\"\">coordinate the protests</a> that overthrew the Philippine president Joseph Estrada in 2001.</p> <p>While alienation and isolation are certainly hallmarks of modern life, when a crowd is needed, it springs into life. The 2009 Iran green revolution, the 2011 Arab Spring, the Occupy movement, the Spanish indignados and the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/16/gezi-park-hotbed-turks-make-stand\" title=\"\">Gezi Park protests</a> in Turkey \u2013 all of these \u201cmovements of the squares\u201d saw physical public space unexpectedly replenished with fresh, angry crowds that had established many of their initial networks and political education via the internet. \u201cOnline inspiration, offline perspiration\u201d, as one slogan of the time put it.</p> <p>These digitally enhanced tactics took over British streets in the winter of 2010, when student and anti-cuts protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/blog/2010/dec/09/student-protests-live-coverage\" title=\"\">came out</a> against the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition\u2019s austerity policies and tripling of tuition fees. The police responded with the controversial crowd-control tactic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/26/metropolitan-police-lawsuit-student-protest\" title=\"\">kettling</a> \u2013 essentially imprisoning people outdoors between lines of riot police, without access to food, water, toilets, warm clothing or medical assistance, for hours at a time.</p> <p>Kettling worked against the student protesters on several fronts, dampening their spirits, disincentivising future protests, riling up some to violence and thus delivering the government the PR victory they needed. \u201cIs not the point of a kettle that it brings things to the boil?\u201d David Lammy MP asked Theresa May, then the home secretary, at the time. But it also radicalised many of them, precisely because they had had their freedom to move restricted, pushing them to direct action tactics in defiance of the tactics proposed by the leaders of the National Union of Students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73735aa19e7f13cec2f36426dfa3e1c5b1f75b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73735aa19e7f13cec2f36426dfa3e1c5b1f75b06/43_0_2914_1749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mounted police drive their horses into protesters during student demonstrations in London in December 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mounted police drive their horses into protesters during student demonstrations in London in December 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Academic Hannah Awcock attended the 2010 protests as a student, and now lectures on the history of protest at the University of Edinburgh. She explained that <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/754776\" title=\"\">throughout history</a>, from the 1866 Hyde Park suffrage riots to the student demos, protest crowds have often pushed to go further than their organisers, or the authorities, will allow for. And yet, as febrile as the atmosphere around Brexit and austerity has been in the nine years since the student protests and London riots, large protests have appeared calmer, on the face of it at least. In the UK, \u201cthat really aggressive and confrontational policing that emerged post-9/11 seems to have diminished now,\u201d Awcock said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the protests themselves are less radical, but it\u2019s also because there\u2019s also been a turn towards more subtle methods of policing crowds, techniques like increased surveillance and intelligence gathering.\u201d</p> <p>The changes to crowd policing in the past decade owe a great deal to behind-the-scenes policy work by crowd psychologists. Clifford Stott has worked with police and football authorities for many years to discourage heavy-handed policing. One turning point, he told me, was the 2011 Liberal Democrat conference in Sheffield, where South Yorkshire police trialled Stott\u2019s recommendations. Unlike Brighton, Liverpool, Birmingham or Manchester, the city was not used to hosting conferences for a party of government, and substantial student and anti-austerity protests were expected. In preparation, police established a new \u201cdialogue unit\u201d of Police Liaison Teams (PLTs) in blue tabards, recruiting individuals to move among the crowd talking to them, rather than policing in numbers from the outside.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we found was that these dialogue units were policing the police,\u201d said Stott. \u201cThey were stopping unnecessary interventions. The PLTs were reassuring the commanders that an intervention wasn\u2019t needed.\u201d Instead of riot cops wading in, de-escalation and crowd self-regulation took over. Since then, Stott said, this approach has become more common. \u201cWhere the police have these capacities for dialogue and communication, there\u2019s less disorder. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p> <p>According to Ch Insp Melita Worswick of Greater Manchester police, this is part of a broader shift in crowd policing in the UK \u2013 away from the notion of enforcing \u201cpublic order\u201d towards an emphasis on public safety. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have the right people communicating with crowds,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is about building on policing with consent, and knowing that if we don\u2019t manage that right, it could result in disorder.\u201d It\u2019s also about learning to step back, rather than aggressively intervening at the first opportunity. \u201cSometimes taking no action is the right way,\u201d says Worswick. It\u2019s an approach that police in Glasgow have put into action for recent matches between Rangers and Celtic. Following advice from academics, they will now allow fans to jeer at each other for a while, because they know that\u2019s part of the ritual, and won\u2019t intervene unless it starts to get violent. Up to a point, at least, they trust the crowd members to self-regulate.</p> <p>While this sounds like progress, the reality does not always match the rhetoric. Even Extinction Rebellion, which initially attempted to cultivate a friendly relationship with the police, and sought mass arrest as a tactic \u2013 later <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/2019/11/20/come-hell-or-high-water-extinction-rebellion-welcomes-netpol-report-into-the-mets-policing-of-its-october-protests/\" title=\"\">decried</a> the Met\u2019s \u201cover-reach characterised by systematic discrimination, routine use of force, intimidation and physical harm\u201d in hundreds of cases last year. Even more recently, the Met\u2019s use of Covid-19 social-distancing legislation to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52868465\" title=\"\">make arrests</a> at Sunday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest in London suggests that many elements in the police remain unwilling to step back from the crowd.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In place of the open crowd, nowadays we have come to understand a congregation of people primarily as a money-making opportunity. There is no greater evidence of the attenuated, monetised nature of the 21st-century crowd than the rise of the events industry. Events, in themselves, are of course not new inventions. But there are events, dear boy, and then there are Events: usually sponsored, probably with an admission fee, probably with a range of media partners, good for city-branding, good for tourism, orderly, pre-agreed, surveilled and dispersed at the agreed time. They have become an integral part of the contemporary city, and the reimagining of its citizens as income-generating instruments.</p> <p>London &amp; Partners, the public-private partnership set up by Boris Johnson in 2011 to promote the capital, <a href=\"https://files.londonandpartners.com/l-and-p/assets/events/event_tourism_report_2016.pdf\" title=\"\">estimates</a> that event leisure tourism contributed \u00a32.8bn to the city\u2019s economy in 2015 alone, \u00a3644m of which was from overseas \u201cevents tourists\u201d. Increasingly, people come not for the UK per se, but the things happening in it. Chief among these are sporting events, which generate more than 70% of major events-related spending in London (music is some way behind). Amid huge fanfare in the past few years, a growing number of major international NBA, NFL and MLB games have come to London. According to London &amp; Partners, 250,000 people <a href=\"https://www.londonandpartners.com/events/case-studies/major-events-case-study-nfl\" title=\"\">have attended</a> \u201cNFL on Regent Street\u201d, which isn\u2019t even an American Football game, just a promotional event for the idea of one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57af23c16f3bb85fdb443609fdc527bbe461f54f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57af23c16f3bb85fdb443609fdc527bbe461f54f/0_0_1776_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The plaza in front of City Hall in London, a privately owned and carefully controlled public space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The plaza in front of City Hall in London, a privately owned and carefully controlled public space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Watt/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where there are crowds, there are consumers, and in the absence of state support, commercial sponsorship (itself rebranded as \u201cpartnership\u201d) tracks the events industry\u2019s every move. Last year, the capital played host to the Virgin Money London Marathon, the Prudential RideLondon, the Guinness Six Nations and the EFG London Jazz Festival. Meanwhile, Pride in London somehow managed to rack up 73 \u201cpartners\u201d in 2019, from headline sponsors <a href=\"https://prideinlondon.org/news-and-views/pride-in-london-announces-tesco-as-new-headline-partner/\" title=\"\">Tesco</a> to PlayStation, the Scouts, the London Stock Exchange, Revlon and Foxtons, amid criticisms that the politics has been drained out of it in favour of corporate \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/06/pride-in-london-organisers-fend-off-pinkwashing-claims\" title=\"\">pinkwashing</a>\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to refute the argument that the more carefully planned and managed a large event is, the safer it is for those inside it, and the more the crowd will enjoy it. Not only do you minimise the risk of injury or potential trouble, but everyone \u2013 not least the most vulnerable \u2013 benefits when you have accessibility for people with mobility issues, the right number of toilets, the right number of exits, the right transport access, good sightlines, food and water and childcare facilities. And a reasonable argument is often made by organisers of cultural festivals that sponsors pay for these things, and pay for events such as Notting Hill Carnival, Pride and Mela to stay free, and accessible to all. But it\u2019s hard not to wonder if something is being lost along the way, in an era when venture capital-backed music video platform Boiler Room <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/599qdz/why-there-was-anti-boiler-room-graffiti-at-carnival\" title=\"\">receives</a> Arts Council funding to broker Notting Hill Carnival sponsorship deals and live-stream its intimate hedonism to the world; or popular, long-standing free community festivals such as south London\u2019s Lambeth Country Show suddenly have a heavy security presence, prompting outrage and <a href=\"http://www.brixtonbuzz.com/2018/07/locals-pledge-to-boycott-the-lambeth-country-show-2018-in-response-to-the-great-brockwell-wall-booze-ban-body-and-bag-searches/\" title=\"\">boycotts</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">'The way we get through this is together': mutual aid under coronavirus | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps this is too pessimistic. The 21st-century domestication of the crowd does not in itself snuff out its power. The experience of being part of a crowd can still change us in all manner of unexpected ways. If one thing should be retained from academics\u2019 debunking of the myth of the crowd as a single beast with one brain and a thousand limbs, it is precisely that the diversity of the individuals within the crowd is what makes it so vital.</p> <p>Far from behaving as one, everyone has different cooperation thresholds for participation, and there are some who by their nature will always be the first in the pool. For better or worse, crowds empower more shy or conservative people to do what they might not have done otherwise: to pronounce their political beliefs or proclaim their sexual orientation in public, to sing about their heartfelt feelings for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, to occupy a bank, to throw a brick, to fight with strangers, to dance to Abba in the concourse of a major intercity railway station.</p> <p>Being a crowd member is not a muscle that will atrophy through lack of use \u2013 our knack for it, and need for it, has a much longer history than the months we will be required to keep our physical distance. The desire to be part of the crowd is a part of who we are, and it will not be dispersed so easily. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">weekly email here</a></p>",

  "<p>Nobody seems to know quite how the sloth became the rock star of the animal kingdom. From high in the Latin American rainforest, the absurd mammal is the focus of a frenzied obsession that shows no sign of abating. Sloths are on bank notes, adverts, T-shirts, internet memes and Instagram fan pages.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are obsessed,\u201d says Costa Rica\u2019s president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, when asked why people have fallen in love with the creature. \u201cThe sloth is quite a unique animal. It\u2019s also very related to the forest. I believe it\u2019s the elegance of the movement.\u201d</p> <p>But as with many examples of anthropomorphised wildlife, the trappings of fame have started to cause problems for the humble sloth. They are among the most \u201cselfied\u201d animals on the planet, according to wildlife charity <a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.us/\">World Animal Protection</a>. An analysis of Instagram images by the organisation found that <a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/close-up-on-cruelty\">70% of selfies with</a><a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/close-up-on-cruelty\"> sloths</a> \u2013 from the Brazilian Amazon to Central America \u2013 involve hugging, holding or using them as props. </p> <p>The stress of constant handling and noise for a creature that spends most of the day asleep in the wild can have damaging consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bce41f8702fd2bc17d3ebf31f23f02defcb69f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bce41f8702fd2bc17d3ebf31f23f02defcb69f9/0_0_3500_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sloth selfie Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tourist snaps a picture of a sloth being cuddled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Carniel Machado/World Animal Protection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf people are just seeing their images but not really thinking of them as wild creatures, then it could do more harm than good because it\u2019s feeding the frenzy,\u201d says Sam Trull, who runs <a href=\"http://www.theslothinstitutecostarica.org/\">the Sloth Institute</a>, an organisation that rehabilitates the animals and reintroduces them into the wild in Manuel Antonio, on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.</p> <p>The brown-throated three-toed sloths and Hoffmann\u2019s two-toed sloths that hang from the rainforest in Manuel Antonio are a reassuring part of life in the national park area. The sight of a grey ball of fur clutching a cecropia tree lifts the darkest of moods. Yet the urge to climb into the canopy and give the dozing mammal a cuddle has gone too far. Adoring tourists have become a threat.</p> <p>\u201cThe photo-prop trade is a really big problem, where people take sloths out of the forest and charge money for people to hold them and take pictures with them. That\u2019s the negative side of them being popular. Anything that increases their popularity in a shallow way could be dangerous,\u201d Trull says during a virtual tour of the sanctuary, where sloths are recovering from car accidents, dog attacks and exhaustion from the heat of the dry season.</p> <p>In response to the problem, the Costa Rican government has launched the <a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\">#stopanimalselfies</a> campaign to crack down on the practice. Although human and wildlife interaction has been illegal in the country for more than a decade, the 2017 World Animal Protection report said Costa Rica <a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\">ranked seventh</a><a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\"> </a>in the world for \u201ccruel\u201d animal selfies.</p> <p>\u201cThese interactions don\u2019t just put wild animals at risk, they put tourists at risk too. Animals can transmit zoonotic illnesses through biting and scratching,\u201d says Shirley Ram\u00edrez Carvajal, a wildlife biologist who works on the campaign.</p> <p>The problem with wildlife selfies is not limited to sloths. Instagram has also been alert to the issue and has introduced warnings about the abuse of wild animals on popular hashtags such as #koalaselfie, #elephantride and #monkeyselfie, which are often filled with beaming images of tourists and wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a323fd6539d5de65316a6748ca2535ec21d97c49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a323fd6539d5de65316a6748ca2535ec21d97c49/0_0_6969_4648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tourist takes a selfie with a ring-tailed lemur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tourist takes a selfie with a ring-tailed lemur. Critics say such actions put both animals and humans at risk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have a law that bans direct contact with fauna and feeding wildlife. In this way, animals maintain wild behaviour in the best possible way. Almost always, when animals get used to being fed or become comfortable around humans, there are accidents which can be quite serious,\u201d Ram\u00edrez Carvajal adds.</p> <p>Alongside the <a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\">eight-point code</a> on ethical wildlife selfies, the Costa Rican government is encouraging tourists to report illegal behaviour. The consumption of food meant for humans by monkeys and racoons in some national parks has caused issues with tooth decay, obesity and bone problems. It is hoped the campaign will raise awareness and reduce the number of such interactions.</p> <p>Once Covid-19 travel restrictions are lifted, thousands of tourists are expected once again to travel to Costa Rica, many of them hoping to catch sight of a sloth clinging to a tree in the rainforest. It is an unlikely turnaround from the reaction of Spanish colonists, who dismissed them as ugly and useless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12940330de50b5e1e39ca807321ecc8f1741b9d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12940330de50b5e1e39ca807321ecc8f1741b9d5/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sloths Amy and Aretha, currently in rehab at the Sloth Institute, Costa Rica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy and Aretha, currently in rehab at the Sloth Institute, Costa Rica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Trull/The Sloth Institute Costa Rica</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think that they are a really good example of balance.

She was smart, kind, provocative and a rare leader who could listen, negotiate and bring people together. She was killed less than a year after winning the prestigious Goldman environmental prize for leading a campaign to stop construction of an internationally funded hydroelectric dam on a river considered sacred by the indigenous Lenca people.</p> <p>She died way too young, at only 44, at a time when our world\u2019s indigenous peoples and natural resources are under sustained attack from unsustainable greed and consumption. The race to save the planet is on, but radical changes are needed and time is running out. Her death was a crime against her family, the Lenca people, Honduran society and humanity. Fifty-one months ago today, the world lost a rare leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/who-killed-berta-caceres-behind-the-brutal-of-an-environment-crusader\">Who killed Berta Ca\u0301ceres? Behind the brutal murder of an environment crusader</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ca\u0301ceres was exceptional, but her murder was not. Honduras is one of the most violent countries in the world; in 2009, a military-backed coup ushered in an authoritarian pro-business political party, which has since been accused by Honduran prosecutors of<a href=\"https://theglobalamericans.org/2020/01/honduras-is-losing-the-fight-against-corruption/\"> deep-seated corruption,</a> and implicated by <a href=\"https://www.univision.com/univision-news/latin-america/president-of-honduras-implicated-in-1-5-million-drug-money-conspiracy-by-new-york-prosecutor\">American prosecutors in drug trafficking and money laundering</a>. The nightmare which has unfolded over the past 11 years has forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/central-america-violence-refugee-crisis-gangs-murder\">hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to flee</a> a toxic mix of poverty, dire public services, corruption, gang- and state-sponsored violence.</p> <p>They risk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/21/mexico-kidnappings-refugees-central-america-immigration\">kidnap, extortion, rape and even death</a> at the hands of criminal gangs and corrupt state forces as they travel 1,500 or so miles overland through Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States. Like migrants and refugees from neighbouring Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico, those fleeing Honduras are looking for safety, prosperity and dignity, but what they find is an increasingly hostile country willing to violate international and national laws to keep them out.</p> <p>The Trump administration has used the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to issue a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-asylum-seekers-coronavirus-law-un\">legally sketchy total ban</a> on migrants and refugees at US land borders. The one thing the US does not seem willing to do is withdraw economic and political support from the post-coup ruling political party in Honduras. US policies for Central America have long been contradictory, and that\u2019s certainly true today. Meanwhile, in Honduras, the pandemic has been used to crack down on civil liberties, with reports that indigenous and rural communities considered hostile to the government are being denied basic food aid.</p> <p>Ca\u0301ceres\u2019s murder triggered international condemnation but failed to stop the bloodshed. At least&nbsp;25&nbsp;land and environmental defenders have been murdered in Honduras since&nbsp;2&nbsp;March 2016. Latin America remains the most dangerous region in the world to defend land and rivers from megaprojects like mines, dams, fracking, logging and biofuel cash crops, which are almost always licensed without proper consultation or compensation. Between March 2016 and November 2019, 340 defenders were killed in the Americas, according to Global Witness,&nbsp;a not-for-profit group. These high-impact, targeted assassinations&nbsp;go largely unpunished. Impunity breeds more violence.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We cannot talk about\u00a0'clean' energy\u00a0while communities\u00a0like those C\u00e1ceres defended\u00a0are\u00a0militarised and displaced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Generally, assassination is the macabre finale in a campaign that also includes intimidation, defamation, threats, attempted bribes, assault and, increasingly, judicial persecution.

  "<p>The amount of pristine tropical rainforest lost across the globe increased last year, as the equivalent of a football pitch disappeared every six seconds, a satellite-based analysis has found.</p> <p>Nearly 12m hectares of tree cover was lost across the tropics, including nearly 4m hectares of dense, old rainforest that held significant stores of carbon and had been home to a vast array of wildlife, according to data from the University of Maryland.</p> <p>Beyond the tropics, Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bushfires\">devastating bushfires</a> led to a sixfold increase in tree cover loss across the continent in 2019 compared with the previous year. Rod Taylor, from the World Resources Institute, part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch</a>&nbsp;network that released the analysis, said as the unprecedented fires continued into 2020, this was only a partial picture of the area affected in the southern fire season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/counting-the-cost-of-australias-summer-of-dread\">Counting the cost of the bushfires: Australia's summer of dread</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Australia\u2019s eucalyptus trees are generally well adapted to respond to fire, Taylor said this year\u2019s blazes burned more intensely, having followed a severe drought, and spread rapidly due to high winds. The fires killed 33 people directly, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/australias-summer-bushfire-smoke-killed-445-and-put-thousands-in-hospital-inquiry-hears\">445 more through smoke inhalation</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/14/a-billion-animals-the-australian-species-most-at-risk-from-the-bushfire-crisis\">hundreds of millions of animals</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhereas a normal fire might char the bark of a tree, this year\u2019s fires turned many trees into charcoal sticks,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAustralia can expect more extreme fire seasons as fire risk increases due to climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The loss of trees in the tropics was the third worst recorded since data was first collected in 2002, trailing behind only 2016 and 2017. The heaviest reduction continues to be in Brazil, which accounted for more than a third of all humid tropical forest loss. Government data shows that deforestation for agriculture and other new land uses increased rapidly in the Brazilian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/amazon-rainforest\">Amazon</a> over the past year.</p> <p>The biggest surge in forest loss was in Bolivia, where fires led to an 80% greater reduction in tree cover than in any previous year on record. The institute said many of the fires were probably deliberately lit to clear farming land for planting and spread into forests due to strong winds and drought exacerbated by the climate crisis. It follows the Bolivian government making regulatory changes to encourage the expansion of agriculture.</p> <p>There was a slight decrease in forest loss in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but it was still the third highest year on record, largely due to cyclical agricultural operations, though the institute said there was emerging evidence that commercial logging, mining and clearing for plantations was having an impact.</p> <p>Primary forest loss was down about 50% in both Ghana and Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and reduced for a third straight year in Indonesia, where it fell back to a level not seen for more than 15 years. This follows Jakarta introducing a permanent moratorium on clearing for oil palm plantations and increased efforts to ensure that laws were enforced.</p> <p>Frances Seymour, a senior fellow with the institute, said the level of global forest loss was unacceptable and that it was clear what was needed to reverse the trend. \u201cIf governments put into place good policies and enforce the law, forest loss goes down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if governments relax restrictions on burning, or signal an intent to open up indigenous territories for commercial exploitation, forest loss goes up.\u201d</p> <p>Seymour said the international community could help address the problem by introducing economic or market incentives for protecting forests. She called for governments to embrace four steps: preventing forest burning; increasing monitoring and enforcement to stop breaches; providing the poor and hungry with alternatives to forest exploitation; and not reducing protections to aid the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>",

Those sons of bitches are going to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>Berta was involved in numerous land and water struggles alongside indigenous Lenca communities across western Honduras. But the battle to stop construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, in the community of Ri\u0301o Blanco, had her more worried than usual. Berta told her children she was scared, and that they should take the threats seriously. \u201cMum said there was a group of dangerous <em>sicarios </em>[hitmen] attacking the Ri\u0301o Blanco community and asking about us, her daughters,\u201d said Laura, 23, the youngest, home from midwifery college for the Christmas break. \u201cI knew the threats were serious because she wouldn\u2019t leave me alone in the house, not even for a night.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/berta-caceres-was-exceptional-her-was-all-too-commonplace\">Berta C\u00e1ceres was exceptional. Her murder was all too commonplace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berta had reasons to suspect the hitmen were hired by Desa, the dam construction company. Desa\u2019s trumped-up criminal charges against her and other leaders of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) had failed to silence them. Was it now it pursuing other means to stop the opposition?</p> <p>Her sense of unease intensified on 12 February 2016. Douglas Bustillo, a thuggish former army lieutenant and Desa\u2019s ex-security chief, messaged her Copinh deputy, Toma\u0301s Go\u0301mez, out of the blue, accusing Berta of cashing in on the Ri\u0301o Blanco struggle to win the prestigious Goldman environmental prize.</p> <p>Four days later, driving out of Ri\u0301o Blanco, Berta\u2019s car was shadowed by two SUVs carrying armed locals she knew were linked to Desa.</p> <p>On 20 February, Berta led a convoy to the Gualcarque, a river considered sacred by the Lenca people, to make a stand against the company\u2019s attempt to circumvent indigenous land rights by moving the dam across the shore. Desa was warned about the demonstration via its network of paid informants, and summoned its political and security allies to wreck the event. First, Copinh\u2019s buses and cars were detained at a checkpoint where everyone was forced out, registered and photographed by police and military officers. Then, a small crowd threw stones and insults. \u201cYou old witch, you\u2019ll never come back here!\u201d screamed the pro-dam deputy mayor at Berta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f7b2024115045043ebe379e2cea7581ef46683b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7b2024115045043ebe379e2cea7581ef46683b/0_0_800_1208/662.jpg\" alt=\"Who Killed Berta C\u00e1ceres?

Waiting along the gruelling unshaded track were hired thugs and armed security guards and police officers, including some Tigres \u2013 an elite US-backed special weapons and tactics (Swat) team trained for urban combat.</p> <p>A drone buzzed overhead taking photographs as Copinh protesters threw rocks at the company machinery. Desa\u2019s security chief, former police major Jorge A\u0301vila, appeared with a grisly warning: \u201cIn a few days, you\u2019ll be eating someone\u2019s liver,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still undeterred, Berta continued with the exhausted group to the river, where they sat on the shady bank to rest and connect with the Gualcarque\u2019s sacred spirit. When they finally left it was dark, and Berta\u2019s car was pelted with beer bottles and rocks, smashing the rear window.</p> <p>Less than a week later, around midday on 26 February, a double-cabin pickup truck with polarized windows drove up the narrow dead-end street leading to the Copinh head office in the city of La Esperanza. A tall man with a military-style haircut got out and asked for Berta, while the driver kept the engine running. When asked to identify himself, he jumped into the car and sped off.</p> <p>These incidents made Berta even more nervous, and she arranged to stay at Utopi\u0301a, Copinh\u2019s bustling training centre in La Esperanza, so as not to be at home alone when Laura returned to university in Buenos Aires.</p> <p>She also contacted her friend Brigitte Gynther, a researcher at the School of Americas Watch (SOAW), who catalogued threats against Copinh. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d she wrote in a text message on 29 February. \u201cI have news.\u201d Brigitte was working in Colombia, but they agreed to speak later.</p> <p>On the morning of 1 March, Berta drove Laura to Tonconti\u0301n airport on the outskirts of the capital, Tegucigalpa. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d she said. \u201cEnjoy life, make the most of it, but remember this is where you belong, in Honduras, fighting to make this a better place.\u201d</p> <p>Just before Laura went through security Berta hugged her youngest child one more time. \u201cThis country is fucked, but if anything happens to me, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Laura assumed she was worried about being arrested again. \u201cMy mum was so well known that I really doubted anything serious would happen to her. I thought meeting the pope and winning the Goldman prize would protect her.\u201d</p> <p>At 2.08pm, Sergio Rodri\u0301guez sent a WhatsApp message to Desa shareholders and senior managers, among them company president David Castillo, a US-trained former military intelligence officer, confirming that Berta would be in La Esperanza the following day.</p> <p>Laura\u2019s plane took off just as Berta\u2019s old friend Gustavo Castro, a politically astute Mexican environmentalist, was landing at San Pedro Sula international airport on the other side of the country. Berta had invited Gustavo to give a workshop on alternative energy for Copinh members. The pair hadn\u2019t seen each other in several years and spent the evening catching up at Berta\u2019s new house in Colonia Li\u0301bano, a gated community on the southern edge of La Esperanza.</p> <p>Berta told him about the turmoil generated by the campaign to stop the dam, a construction project backed by members of one of the country\u2019s most powerful clans, the Atala Zablah family, as well as international banks. \u201cI had no idea how much pressure she was under,\u201d Gustavo would recall.</p> <p>They were both tired, so Berta suggested calling it a night and offered to take Gustavo to his lodgings, but he was worried about her safety. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark and isolated here, will you be alright driving back alone so late?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. But why don\u2019t you come and stay here with me from tomorrow night?\u201d</p> <p>The next day, Tuesday 2 March, Berta opened the workshop in Utopi\u0301a before heading to the outdoor kitchen area, carrying her three constantly chiming mobile phones and customary notebook and pen. She messaged Laura, telling her not to worry as Gustavo would be staying at the house. She also called her close colleague Sotero Chavarri\u0301a, who was in Tegucigalpa for medical treatment. \u201c<em>Hermano</em>, I need you back here, come soon, I have to tell you something, it\u2019s important,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Shortly after, Sotero received another call: security chief A\u0301vila and a dozen Ri\u0301o Blanco locals aligned with Desa were approaching La Esperanza in a Toyota pickup truck.</p> <p>What business did they have that day, were they coming to keep tabs on Berta? On his way back to La Esperanza, Sotero noticed the police checkpoint at the city entrance was unmanned. This was so unusual that he mentioned it to colleagues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86406eb1167f84b0515f3cc653bbab12418e3774\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86406eb1167f84b0515f3cc653bbab12418e3774/0_0_5591_3354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman places flowers on an altar set up in honor of Berta C\u00e1ceres during a demonstration outside Honduras\u2019 embassy in Mexico City on 15 June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman places flowers on an altar set up in honor of Berta C\u00e1ceres during a demonstration outside Honduras\u2019s embassy in Mexico City on 15 June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Verdugo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that morning, Lilian Esperanza, the Copinh finance coordinator, arrived at Utopi\u0301a with a handful of cheques and a donor letter that needed Berta\u2019s signature. \u201cWe need to change the signature,\u201d Berta said. \u201cWhat if something happens to me? I could be jailed or killed. If you have problems accessing money, then what would happen to Copinh? I keep on reporting the threats, but no one takes any notice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Nothing\u2019s going to happen to you,\u201d Lilian insisted.</p> <p>Why was Berta acting as if time was running out?</p> <p>It was late morning when she left the workshop with Gaspar Sa\u0301nchez, Copinh\u2019s young sexual diversity coordinator, heading for the central market where Berta was helping vendors oppose the mayor\u2019s plan to replace it with a shopping mall. Later, in the car on their way back to the workshop, Gaspar interviewed Berta for Copinh\u2019s community radio station. \u201cEnergy is not just a technical issue, it\u2019s a political issue to do with life, territories, sovereignty and the right to community self-determination. We believe this is the moment to profoundly debate capitalism and how energy is part of the domination of indigenous communities and violation of their rights \u2026 That\u2019s what Lenca communities like Ri\u0301o Blanco are living through right now.\u201d</p> <p>It would be her last interview.</p> <p>Berta then called her friend Ismael Moreno, a Jesuit priest known as Padre Melo. \u201cShe was scared, but it was Camilito she was most worried about,\u201d Melo said: Berta had recently received an anonymous message threatening to chop her only grandchild into pieces.</p> <p>Back at the workshop, Berta messaged SOAW\u2019s Brigitte Gynther at 4.44pm, asking when she\u2019d be back from Colombia. \u201cI never found out what she wanted to tell me,\u201d said Brigitte. \u201cBut she only contacted me when something was seriously wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Berta and Gustavo then left Utopi\u0301a, popping in to visit her mother before heading to her favourite downtown eatery, El Fogo\u0301n, for dinner and a beer. Just before 9.30pm, a black double-cabin Toyota Hilux with polarized windows and no number plates was seen by a neighbour outside her mother\u2019s house. Soon after, Berta and Gustavo arrived back at her place.</p> <p>Berta\u2019s green and gold bungalow stands amid a scattering of garishly painted houses enclosed by a mishmash of wire and white wooden fencing, with views of a lake and distant pine-forested hills. The bungalow is on a dirt road about 150 metres from the security gate, which is operated by two guards working in 12-hour shifts.</p> <p>The layout is unusual, with the front door leading into the open-plan lounge and a flimsy wooden back door leading into the kitchen. She and Gustavo sat on the front patio talking for half an hour or so, enjoying the breeze. Then he smoked a cigarette, while Berta finished working on a document.</p> <p>Gustavo retired to the guest bedroom nearest the lounge. Berta\u2019s room was at the other end of the narrow hallway. After changing into an olive-green T-shirt and black shorts, she sat on her bed and kept working. At 11.25 she sent a message to Juan Carlos Jua\u0301rez, a police liaison officer charged with overseeing her protection. \u201cWherever you are, I wish you well. Please be careful. <em>Besos </em>[kisses].\u201d</p> <p>At around 11.35, Gustavo heard a noise. Tap! Tap! Tap! He thought it was Berta cleaning or fetching something from the kitchen, and barely looked up from his laptop. A minute or less later there was a louder, duller sound. Thud! Gustavo assumed Berta had dropped something in the kitchen. Then he heard her call out: \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was then I realized that someone was in the house and something bad was going to happen,\u201d Gustavo recalled. Seconds later, a tall, dark-skinned youth with cropped hair, wearing a black top and white scarf, kicked open the bedroom door and aimed a gun at his head from about two metres away. He heard the fuzzy sound of a walkie-talkie. Seated on the bed, Gustavo was looking straight at the gunman, when he heard Berta\u2019s bedroom door being forced open. It sounded as if she was struggling to push someone away. Then he heard three shots. Bang! Bang! Bang! Berta\u2019s legs gave way and she fell backwards. She tried to defend herself and scratched at the gunman as he bent over her. But she was weak, and the killer stamped on her bleeding body until she could no longer resist.</p> <p>Gustavo jumped up off the bed and in a split second lifted his left hand to protect his face as the gunman fired a single shot. Bang! The bullet grazed the back of his left hand and the top of his left ear. Gustavo lay completely still on the floor as blood oozed from the wounds. The gunman was convinced and left, but still Gustavo dared not move. Moments later he heard Berta\u2019s voice. \u201cGustavo! Gustavo!\u201d</p> <p>He ran to her and saw his friend sprawled on her back between the bedroom door and the wooden closet, struggling to breathe. Her curly black hair was sticky with the blood from three bullet wounds, spreading across her shorts and T-shirt.</p> <p>Gustavo squeezed through the small gap between the door and her shivering body. He knelt down and wrapped his arms around her, trying to keep her warm and alive. \u201cDon\u2019t go, Berta! Don\u2019t die! Stay with me,\u201d he begged. But Berta Ca\u0301ceres was bleeding to death.</p> <p>\u201cGet my phone,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOn the table.\u201d At around a quarter to midnight Berta uttered her last words. \u201cCall Salvador! Call Salvador!\u201d</p> <p>Then she was gone.</p> <p>Berta Ca\u0301ceres had been murdered. Killed in her bedroom less than a year after winning the foremost prize for environmental defenders.</p> <p>Gustavo survived. But would his eyewitness evidence be enough to identify the gunmen? And who was behind this bold execution? Could there ever be justice for someone like Berta in a country like Honduras, where impunity reigns supreme?</p> <p>Would we ever know who killed Berta Ca\u0301ceres?</p> <ul> <li><p>&nbsp;This is an extract from Who Killed Berta C\u00e1ceres?

The commonwealth has agreed to meet any costs or damages for which the minister is found liable.</p> <p>The case has been before the federal court for six years, and awaiting judgment for 18 months.</p> <p>In a judgment handed down on Tuesday, federal court justice Steven Rares said the order Ludwig made on 7 June 2011 was invalid because it failed to include any exemptions for exporters who had already established a closed loop system.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSuch a total prohibition was capricious and unreasonable and made the ban order invalid,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rares said Ludwig knew when he made the ban order that Australia had exported more than 500,000 live cattle to Indonesia the year before, worth about $400m, and had been told by the live export industry that there were supply chains in Indonesia that had a closed loop system with animal welfare standards compliant with the international code, or that could be readily adjusted to have one.</p> <p>Rares said Ludwig made no attempt to explore negotiating a solution with the Indonesian government before making the ban order, and did not talk to his Indonesian counterpart until after the order was made.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ludwig&nbsp;had no legal advice that he could lawfully make the order in such form, but had sought legal advice about the government\u2019s potential exposure to compensation claims if he made a temporary ban.</p> <p>\u201cYet, with that knowledge the minister plunged ahead regardless,\u201d Rares said. \u201cHe made the ban order shutting his eyes to the risk that it might be invalid and to the damage that it was calculated to cause persons in the position of Brett Cattle.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:

without providing any power of exception\u201d and also the financial impact of such an order.</p> <p>\u201cAccordingly, the minister committed misfeasance in public office when he made the ban order on 7 June 2011,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rares said that instead of a ban order, the minister should have made another control order, similar to that made on 2 June 2011, which allowed him to make exceptions for exporters working in closed loop systems if he was satisfied animal welfare standards had been met.</p> <p>The ban was repealed on 7 July 2011, after the introduction on 27 June of the Export Supply Chain Assurance System, which is intended to ensure animals exported live from Australia are slaughtered only in approved facilities.</p> <p>Had Ludwig introduced another control order instead of a ban, Rares said, Elders and Santori \u2013 two of the largest cattle exporters in Australia \u2013 would have been able to obtain approvals to keep exporting, and \u201csignificantly more\u201d cattle would have been exported.</p> <p>Damages will be decided following a hearing later this month.</p> <p>Tracey Hayes, the former chief executive of the Northern Territory Cattlemen\u2019s&nbsp;Association, said the ruling should make \u201cgovernment and decision-makers more&nbsp;accountable and highlights the&nbsp;dangers of knee-jerk reactions and&nbsp;political

and regional Australia&nbsp;has when it unites for a common&nbsp;cause\u201d.</p> <p>Animals Australia, which conducted the undercover investigation that produced the footage used by Four Corners,

Australia\u2019s Lyn White said had the trade suspension not been imposed, the change in practices at Indonesian slaughterhouses that now mean the majority of Australian cattle are stunned before

And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p> <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering. </p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/covid-low-carbon-future-lockdown-pandemic-green-economy\">Covid-19 has given us the chance to build a low-carbon future | Christiana Figueres</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4be468f084df971c8d581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:45:59.424Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other things reopening today include: cinemas in Thailand:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at a cinema in Bangkok, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear face mask to help curb the spread of the coronavirus during a movie at the Paragon Cineplex cinema in Bangkok, Thailand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ikea stores in Britain:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30/0_250_4929_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham before it reopens, after the British government relaxed lockdown measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington as it re-opens following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And amusement parks in Japan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dolphin performs at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise near Tokyo, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks enjoy a dolphin performance as the Hakkeijima Sea Paradise amusement park opens after a two-month closure due to the preventative measures to help curb the spread of the coronavirus in Yokohama near Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4bced8f08f5e3730122e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:34:57.780Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trains are running today in Manila for the first time in two months, as the lockdown is eased in the <strong>Philippines</strong>.

Thank you for following along. My colleague Simon Burnton will be taking on the blog now to continue our round-the-clock coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>A reminder that we have a blog dedicated to the George Floyd protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live\">here</a>. </p> <p>Below are the latest developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Manila eases lockdown. </strong>Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</li> <li><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries. </strong>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</li> <li><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks. </strong>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</li> <li><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases. </strong>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. </li> <li><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases. </strong>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday, he rode a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him. </li> <li><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload. </strong>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country. </li> <li><strong>North Korea to reopen schools. </strong>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said on Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation.

Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to conduct an autopsy of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe.</p> <p>Baden&nbsp;and Wilson&nbsp;found that weight being applied to Floyd\u2019s back, his hands being cuffed behind his back and the position of his body, where he was also at times being restrained by other officers as he lay on the ground, \u201cwere contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr Floyd\u2019s diaphragm to function\u201d.</p> <p>Baden said: \u201cWhat we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death.\u201d</p> <p>The pathologists believe Floyd died at the scene. Crump said: \u201cFor&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, the ambulance was his hearse.\u201d</p> <p>In numerous high-profile cases of killings by police, charges were not filed even after the government autopsy reports have ruled the deaths a homicide. Floyd\u2019s family and people across the US have urged prosecutors in Minnesota to file charges against the three other officers who were present for the killing.</p> <p>A public memorial is planned for Floyd in Minneapolis on&nbsp;Thursday. He was originally from Houston, Texas, and there are plans for that city to be his final resting place, with details to be confirmed.</p> <p><em>Agencies contributed reporting</em></p>"
