  "<p>\u201cWhat did you do in the war, Mr Bukovi?\u201d \u201cI invented the false 9. What did you do?\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t all Marton Bukovi did during the second world war. The Hungarian coach \u2013 quite possibly the greatest tactical mind football has known \u2013 found himself in Zagreb, coaching Gradjanski, when the conflict began. When the Ustashe seized power and began enacting antisemitic legislation, his position became insecure, given he was the son of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. He, in as much as religion bothered him at all, seems to have identified as Christian, and there is a cross on his gravestone in the Rakoskeresztur cemetery in Budapest, but his wife, Aranka Klein, was Jewish and at least one of his sisters was a practising Jew.</p> <p>Bukovi not only kept working but also helped protect the club\u2019s groundsman, a Jewish refugee called Max Reisfeld who had fled Nazi Vienna, taking food and provisions to him and his family as they hid under a stand at the stadium where, for four years, they remained undetected and survived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7a97f9c5cf8f5ea526b4dfd230d4a68dd73f8c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7a97f9c5cf8f5ea526b4dfd230d4a68dd73f8c9/105_68_979_587/500.jpg\" alt=\"Marton Bukovi with some of his MTK players in 1949\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marton Bukovi with some of his MTK players in 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fortepan/Kov\u00e1cs M\u00e1rton Ern\u0151</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bukovi was courageous and a man of firm principle but he was also notoriously difficult. He had his habits and was rarely minded to change them. He loved the cinema and would go every day after training, but he hated being distracted so would turn up at the box office, ask if his wife were there and, if she were, he would go on to a different cinema.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a hard man,\u201d said Marika Lantos, whose husband, Mihaly, later worked as Bukovi\u2019s assistant at Olympiakos. \u201cPrecise, strict and consistent. He demanded order and discipline. It didn\u2019t matter who a player was; he would always tell him what he thought of him. That might be why many didn\u2019t love him. He could be reserved and grumpy but he had a heart of gold. He was like a bad mother-in-law: he commented on everything and always found fault. He meant well, but he couldn\u2019t understand that he needed to make distinctions between people. He just said what he wanted to say.\u201d</p> <p>But then he was a genius, and geniuses perhaps are allowed some leeway with the social graces. When the war in Yugoslavia was over and the Communists were in control, the clubs who had played in the fascist league were disbanded and, in many cases, had their archives destroyed. Gradjanski, eventually, were reborn as Dinamo and Bukovi was persuaded to become manager.</p> <p>The interim had given him time to think. He had already overseen Gradjanski\u2019s transition from a 2-3-5 to the W-M formation but what, he wondered, if you went further? What if you withdrew the centre-forward so deep he was almost a midfielder, gave your inside-forwards licence and pulled one of the wing-halves so deep he was in effect a second central defender, turning the 3-2-2-3 of W-M into something very close to 4-2-4?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bed3b8896383215417a88c394c8ff062aa5c2d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bed3b8896383215417a88c394c8ff062aa5c2d6/0_375_4866_2921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ferenc Puskas scores Hungary\u2019s second goal in their 7-1 win against England in Budapest in 1954\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferenc Puskas (second right) scores Hungary\u2019s second goal in their 7-1 win against England in Budapest in 1954, using tactics Marton Bukovi developed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so, in 1946, in the game against Lokomotiva that would decide the Zagreb championship, Bukovi put his theory into practice.</p> <p>Gradjanski won and Bukovi was vindicated \u2013 not that he was entirely happy. \u201cDragutin Hripko played the role,\u201d he said. \u201cHe played it closer to well than to poorly, but far from ideally. As a footballer he never achieved great quality, but I always spoke about him when asked about a withdrawn striker. He was my lab rat \u2026 I can clearly remember how the Lokomotiva players didn\u2019t know how to handle him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A team is successful playing in a particular way, and so a means must be found to interrupt that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bukovi took the system with him when he returned to Budapest and by 1952 Hungary were using it to win Olympic gold, part of a four-year unbeaten run \u2013 in which they twice hammered a befuddled England \u2013 that ended with defeat by West Germany in the 1954 World Cup final.</p> <p>Managers rarely get time to think. The churn of games, the routine of training, of the day-to-day dealing with players is too much. But now, during a shutdown that will last at least a couple of months, managers do have time. Football is a mature game now: huge developmental steps such as Bukovi\u2019s are unlikely. Everything happens by increments. But what is possible? What might an enlightened manager do having been given this long period without the immediate pressure of games?</p> <p>Elite-level football tends to move forward by solutions. A team is successful playing in a particular way and so a means must be found to interrupt that. The possession-heavy game of Pep Guardiola and his imitators was eventually overcome by the high-energy, highly focused press and transition game of J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 to the extent that Guardiola has begun to change.</p> <p>That makes sense: the way to defeat possession football is to work out a way of disrupting those patterns of passing and regaining the ball better.</p> <p>So what comes next? How do you disrupt a pressing game? One way is simply to pass the ball better, in less predictable patterns. Perhaps if Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona of 2008-11 were still around, still at their peak and still with the dribbling potency of Lionel Messi, that would be possible (it may be that what passed was less their stylistic hegemony than simply the peak of that side). But given it is not, and given the seeming impossibility of that aim, how else could hard-pressing football be circumvented?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An obvious way, which Guardiola briefly took against Klopp\u2019s Borussia Dortmund in a German cup game, is to go over the press. Guardiola used Javi Mart\u00ednez as his target man, but perhaps target men in general are due a comeback. What better way to thwart a well-deployed pressing line than by whacking it long and early at a Niall Quinn or a Joe Jordan or a Nat Lofthouse, particularly if they could be supported by a rapid poacher? How better to unsettle two central defenders picked less for their marking and battling qualities than their positioning and passing than by making them defend against a pair?</p> <p>Or perhaps not. But in this time of enforced inaction, it\u2019s perhaps worth managers asking, what would Marton Bukovi do?</p>",

  "<p>The medieval square outside our apartment in Ronda was always quiet, but last Saturday morning even the birds seemed silent. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d misunderstood when the only woman in the square said: \u201cYou are right to go. You must. Spain is closing.\u201d The whole country? My Spanish must have got worse.</p> <p>For over a year, the British author Jill Dawson and I had planned a retreat for a group of writers we\u2019d been mentoring, a retreat to focus on creative resilience, hopeful imagination, the skills of making something from nothing. The things we artists have to offer the world.</p> <p>After leading retreats in Bali, this was to be our first in Spain, and we were deliriously excited. When the coronavirus first hit I watched the news carefully, checking the government travel site daily. I\u2019d planned to take an extra few days ahead of the retreat with my husband to walk and acclimatise. As we heard of the virus spreading in Italy, I checked the site again. \u201cLevel 1: exercise normal safety precautions.\u201d Richard considered cancelling. I shook my head: \u201cEveryone\u2019s booked their flights. The warning is normal. We\u2019re not cancelling the retreat, so I\u2019m going with or without you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/19/from-hemingway-to-haruki-murakami-great-writers-tips-about-working-from-home\">From Hemingway to Haruki Murakami \u2013 great writers\u2019 tips about working from home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We spent four days hiking in the spring air of the Sierra de Grazalema, vultures gliding far overhead. Everything seemed possible. And then on Friday morning: \u201cLevel 3: reconsider your need to travel.\u201d In less than an hour everything had changed. We booked the first flights that would get us home.</p> <p>I\u2019d heard correctly: the entire country was closing, doors slamming like a wave behind us as we drove to Malaga airport. Waiting nervously for check-in, we reviewed the news. A flight on its way to Spain was turned back. The Spanish passengers on that flight were now, presumably, stranded in London. We huddled in a corner, hands in pockets, focusing on the cancellations listed on the departure board.</p> <p>In the queue, a toddler was licking a metal pole. His father glanced down and chuckled affectionately. To a person, we all shuffled away, averting our eyes, disconnecting. It\u2019s uncomfortable, moving through the world like this. On board another toddler \u2013 this one with a mother travelling alone \u2013 turned on his seat to sing, inviting praise. Normally I\u2019d engage, offer the parent a moment\u2019s pause. But mindful now of everyone\u2019s risk, I kept my eyes on my book.</p> <p>The air stewards, at work since dawn, remained calm. Everyone was buckled up, ready \u2013 we hoped\u2013 for take-off, when a new group of passengers boarded, flustered, without boarding passes. Trying to keep our sticky breath to ourselves, we waited, everything strangely quiet. A series of historical events played in my mind, moments when everything changed rapidly. I wondered if now would be a good time to re-establish my old belief in interventionist prayer.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been on many delayed flights with angry passengers demanding that the flight move, that people take action, dammit. This time someone shouted thank you to the crew, and it echoed along the seats like a song. The pilot emerged from the cockpit.</p> <p>\u201cFolks, we are doing our best to get you home. In Paris this morning we didn\u2019t think we would get here. But we\u2019re here now and we\u2019ll get you to London as soon as we can.\u201d Applause rippled through the cabin. Against the stories of antisocial hoarding, the quiet courtesy of my fellow travellers gave me hope.</p> <p>Two days of moving in a contained bubble, avoiding contact, standing away from people, was unnatural, impossible. Social distancing will never be my key strength. At dinner in the Gatwick airport hotel, desperate for connection, we struck up a safe-distance conversation with Jade and Liz, smart, energetic women about to holiday in Egypt. Richard cleared his throat: \u201cFlights may be grounded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou might get stuck overseas like we nearly did,\u201d I added. The women insisted. They\u2019d got the kids sorted, meals in the freezer. A bit of sun, just what the doctor ordered. I was terrified for them and told them so, but they were going. When Liz, in a natural moment of connection, put her hand on my wrist, I recoiled and reached for my hand sanitiser.</p> <p>In the morning a pilot stepped into the lift with us. We asked him how his company was doing. \u201cAll our flights are grounded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just off to rescue some passengers.\u201d I thought of Liz and Jade and asked where he was due to fly. \u201cEgypt,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>It\u2019s true everything has changed, more rapidly than we could have imagined. But these things do remain: resilience, imagination, hope. The things we\u2019ve always called on to find solutions to the impossible.</p> <p>We arrived home to a kitchen full of groceries left by a dear friend, a series of text messages from neighbours, doorstep gifts of eggs and chocolate. In the end, we are each other. Not individuals, travelling through the world in isolated bubbles, but community.</p> <p>This is how we will make it through these next months and years: together. Courteously, calmly, at a slightly greater physical distance, but with continuing gratitude and, whenever we can, with applause.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kathryn Heyman is a Sydney author</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>On the east side of my apartment block is a large fig tree. In its halcyon days, its canopy stretched the length of the balcony, providing shade from the morning sun. From the base of the trunk, an extensive buttress root system had pushed up and cracked the concrete driveway. This made the fig unpopular with the body corporate, but it is a protected species in Brisbane under the Natural Assets Local Law of 2003.</p> <p>For a long time, that law protected the fig, and much else besides. Every spring, the fruit of the tree provided food for mobs of grey-headed and black flying foxes that chattered and bickered among themselves all night as they gorged themselves. Brush-tailed possums ran riot. During the day, orioles and koels were regular visitors. The koels would shriek their heads off at 4am almost every morning through October and November.</p> <p>There were butterflies, too. When I started taking a serious interest in them, most of my early observations were from the balcony. I identified species from almost all the Australian families: swallowtails (blue triangles), whites and yellows (lemon migrants), nymphs (evening browns), skippers and blues (most thrillingly, a bright cornelian, which has vivid spots of orange, instead of blue, on the upperwings).</p> <p>Then, in the month of May 2016 \u2013 right after my marriage broke down \u2013 the tree was lopped. Not a branch, nor a leaf remained: just the trunk, which was left to protrude a few metres above ground like a raw and exposed nerve that had been brutally hacked off. It looked how I felt. Sunlight flooded into my apartment. The sudden burst of natural light may have been welcome in other circumstances, but at the time I wanted only the cover of night.</p> <p>There was no question about why the tree had been lopped. It had a habit of dropping large branches on my neighbours\u2019 roof, particularly during Brisbane\u2019s regular thunderstorms, not to mention large quantities of leaf litter, which the local brush turkeys would determinedly rake through. It would take only one stray spark for that house \u2013 a decaying weatherboard which was nearly entirely submerged in the 2011 floods \u2013 to go up in a big woof of smoke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email\">Saved for Later: sign-up for Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Things were quiet around here for a long time after that. I was pole-axed by grief and associated feelings of shame, failure and loss. Mostly, I isolated myself, but I also felt abandoned. I missed the thump of possums on the roof and the constant squabbling of flying foxes, which had one less mature tree to feed on and, later, disperse the seeds of. Birds and butterflies stayed away. The whole block felt radioactive. So did I.</p> <p>Thankfully, they didn\u2019t kill the tree, much less uproot it. That would have meant cutting through a forest of green tape, and cost far more besides. They were doing the minimum that needed to be done for the sake of civic virtue and safety. But it stood outside my flat, crippled, like a metaphor for my life circa 2016. Still standing, but with no foliage for either decoration or camouflage, much less invite company.</p> <p>After a while, regrowth began to appear. It was pathetic at first: a few thin branches growing out of the top of the stump, sprouting rebellious leaves. Eventually, they spread around the tree, not enough to attract much that I could see, but enough to provide shelter for the things I couldn\u2019t. I accepted that if ever the fig tree was to return to its former glory, it would be in decades to come, long after I\u2019d left the building, and possibly in a box.</p> <p>Then, on Christmas Eve of 2018 \u2013 another Christmas by myself \u2013 a pair of bright cornelians appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped a couple of quick shots. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but within a fortnight everything, in Helen Garner\u2019s words from Monkey Grip, would begin to heave and change again. I\u2019d awoken from my coma, blinking in the fresh sunlight, and an old friend was about to walk back into my life in a new way.</p> <p>This summer, at last, the fig began to bear fruit again. I can no longer see the trunk for the leaves, and the flying foxes are swinging. A koel found enough cover to hide (and scream) in. A couple of weeks ago, I was drawn out to the balcony by a gaggle of squawking honeyeaters and butcherbirds, and saw a young carpet python snaking its way up the tree. Judging by the occasional racket since, it\u2019s still there, waiting.</p> <p>Today I stood on the balcony having a long conversation on the phone with my brother. While we were talking, I watched. A migration of blue tiger butterflies was in full swing, and another species, a varied eggfly, danced in the understory below. I suddenly became curious about the identity of the fig. I\u2019d never paid much attention to botanical matters, despite by mother having been an obsessive gardener.</p> <p>The leaves were now just close enough to the balcony for me to reach through the louvres and pull one from its stem. It immediately extruded a thick white sap. The leaf was glossy and smooth and very dark green; rounded at the base, tapering to a fine tip. It was a weeping fig. I had taken it for granted, and much else besides. The creatures I loved were coming back, but there was more going on outside my window than I ever realised.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This piece was previously published via <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/andrewstafford\">Andrew Stafford\u2019s Patreon page</a>, where you can find more of his writing<br></em></p>",
  "<p>If there is a message that has united Australians since the Covid-19 epidemic began, it is that we must \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. It\u2019s a mantra being shared by politicians, doctors, nurses and members of the public.</p> <p>What is more contentious, though, is how to flatten the curve. There has been a proliferation of graphs on social media and in news reports containing all kinds of data, predicting deaths, projecting infection rates and intensive care cases, and estimating the impact of school closures and other containment measures on slowing spread. Some of these models come from peer-reviewed papers, others from individuals \u2013 including respected doctors, journalists and health workers \u2013 doing back-of-the envelope calculations.</p> <p>Dr Kathryn Snow is an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, working in health services research for vulnerable populations, and says it\u2019s important to remember a lot of models, for example those that predict deaths, make assumptions about the health system or the behaviour of a population. But even small changes to these elements could drastically change the projections.

What if a model on the impact of closing schools assumes children will stay at home for six months, but people get complacent after four weeks and children begin to mingle in shopping centres and parks, or with vulnerable people such as grandparents?

She has also been advising the government almost every day on Covid-19. She is well aware of all of the evidence about flattening the curve,<a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\"> including widely shared modelling from Imperial College London</a> on interventions to reduce Covid-19 deaths. The modelling assumes closing schools in the case of influenza reduces further infections. It also shows that for Covid-19, closing schools needs to be combined with other measures to be effective.</p> <p>McVernon says in Hong Kong school closures are commonly employed for influenza control and can<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034660v1\"> reduce the spread of infection</a> by as much as 15%. \u201cChildren are known to be highly susceptible to and infectious with influenza, so this is the best school closures might do,\u201d she says. \u201cChildren appear to play a much lesser role in transmission of Covid-19, emerging evidence indicates that they are less susceptible and infectious than adults and very rarely have severe infections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/health-minister-says-australia-cannot-predict-how-many-will-die-from-coronavirus\">Health minister says Australia cannot predict how many will die from coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But surely even a moderate effect on infections means closing schools and businesses down is better than not doing so at all? The answer to this can also depend on your value systems. For some, economic considerations are important because of the devastation that occurs when people are in long-term unemployment and lose their homes and livelihood. Others are willing to brace for widespread economic harm and close every business and school right away for months on end, if it means even a small amount of infection and death is prevented. Others will say economic and health impacts are inextricably linked, and it\u2019s too hard to separate the two out so simplistically.</p> <p>There are unique considerations in overseas examples of school and business closures too that may not apply to Australia, such as population density and unique population demographics. Adding to complexity is that this is a novel virus. We have good data for other disease because they have been around a long time, but data for Covid-19 is evolving.</p> <p>McVernon says consistent evidence shows ongoing efforts to find and isolate cases, and trace and quarantine close contacts of those cases, is critical in flattening the curve, having significantly greater impact than school closures. And Australia is undertaking both.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/drbrigidmlynch/status/1241300305947414529\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People don\u2019t seem to realise that infectious disease epidemiologists have been working on pandemic models - specific to Australian population - for decades.

If the chief medical officer says something is dangerous but something you read online says it\u2019s fine, go with the chief medical officer.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Newell, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of New South Wales, says we should always check the sources of information, \u201cand check the intention of the person that puts it there\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should stop and wonder why we have been sent something, and the impact of sending that information on to others.\u201d</p> <p>Newell said Australians rightly had a \u201chealthy scepticism\u201d for people in authority, and events like the sports rorts scandal were likely to have eroded trust.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to now recalibrate and say to themselves, this is now a situation where I should listen to the people who are in positions of authority,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should, and for good reason.\u201d</p> <p>Public health authorities, the World Health Organization and national science academies are reliable sources of information.

Be wary of preliminary scientific findings</h2> <p>Under normal circumstances, new findings in science come at us through a long process of research, peer review and academic publishing that can take years to develop.</p> <p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus was only defined in January and, while some assumptions can be made about how its close relatives have behaved, what\u2019s known about the virus and the illness is still a work in progress.</p> <p>Byford says scientists are sharing information with each other as quickly as they can.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/20/pharmacists-abused-by-customers-who-have-turned-into-animals-over-medicine-limits\">Pharmacists abused by customers who have 'turned into animals' over medicine limits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is vital to ensure there are no delays in moving towards treatments or vaccines. But it also means that lots of the information reaching the public hasn\u2019t been through the usual science \u2018quality check\u2019 that is peer review.\u201d</p> <p>Findings from research that\u2019s made public without being checked by other experts could \u201cchange dramatically\u201d after peer review has been carried out, Byford says, and she would \u201cdiscourage the public from sharing this sort of information\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you do want to share it, perhaps include a note that it is preliminary work and has not been reviewed and scrutinised by independent experts.\u201d</p> <p>All of this also means that what may have been good information a few days or weeks ago may become out of date.</p> <h2>3. Remember that stress affects decision making </h2> <p>We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 a situation few of us have experienced \u2013 and our screens are filled with frightening content.</p> <p>Newell says when we have \u201cadditional cognitive load\u201d, this creates inconsistency in our decision making. \u201cThat means we should push that pause button and then ask ourselves about the basis for the decision we are about to make.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Mike Kyrios, director of \u00d3rama Institute of Mental Health, Wellbeing and Neuroscience at Flinders University, says it\u2019s very important for people to \u201cswitch off\u201d from the \u201coverwhelming emotional content\u201d of the crisis each day.</p> <p>Giving ourselves a break will reduce the tendency to panic and make rash decisions, he says. The development of apps or websites that centralise key information and advice will also help.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a lot of positive thinking, but having a positive attitude if you\u2019re quarantined is important \u2013 we do need a more positive attitude instead of putting our internal resources into our fears. Fear is natural but we have to accept that fear is there and then move through it.\u201d</p> <p>Look for people who are responding positively, he says, and what\u2019s needed is \u201cactually physical distancing, not social distancing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should use social media sites to connect with friends.\u201d</p> <h2>4. Think about the consequences before taking action</h2> <p>Grant says he would \u201cnever argue against critical thinking\u201d but says our own simple actions \u2013 \u201cwash your hands, increase social distance, isolate and test if you\u2019re sick\u201d \u2013 what\u2019s important.</p> <p>Newell says we should generally be thinking about the knock-on effects of our actions \u2013 whether that is simply coughing in a public place or deciding to clear out a supermarket when other community members may be in greater need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/so-you-think-you-have-coronavirus-what-australians-should-do-if-they-are-unwell\">So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Byford says there are lots of factchecking sites that are debunking particular claims regularly: \u201cA simple google of the claim and the word factcheck can do a lot of the work for you. Snopes is usually a good place to start, but <a href=\"https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer\">Google also as has a factcheck explorer</a>.\u201d</p> <p>She says people should also be aware that some conclusions may be based on a correlation, which may turn out to be irrelevant after scientists have examined it further.</p> <p> \u201cThere are lots of situations where two things seem to change at the same time but it turns out that there is not real link \u2013 for example you can find a correlation between the number of <a href=\"https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations\">films starring Nicolas Cage and the number of swimming pool drownings</a>.\u201d</p> <h2>5. Remember that information and assumptions can change</h2> <p>All modelling comes with uncertainties and is loaded with assumptions that may change, be wrong or be incomplete.</p> <p>Often models are designed not to accurately predict the future but rather to show what might happen if different decisions are made.</p> <p>\u201cUncertainty is the mind-killer,\u201d Grant says. \u201cIt\u2019s the real big issue here, and it\u2019s why our sociological behaviours have become part of the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re far more reasonable in the face of crises we\u2019ve seen recently before \u2013 cyclones and bushfires \u2013 because we\u2019ve seen lots of them before. Sure, they\u2019re changing now, but they\u2019re changing within bounds we can extrapolate to based on recent history.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us have experienced a threat like this personally before, and we don\u2019t know how long this will last. Any panic-buying behaviours are rational in this sense.\u201d</p> <p>Kyrios\u2019s institute at Flinders University has <a href=\"https://news.flinders.edu.au/blog/2020/03/16/mental-health-advice-amid-covid-19-concerns/\">developed a set of strategies</a> to help people manage their mental health if they\u2019re forced to stay home.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstand that uncertainty and novelty will lead to heightened tension and stress \u2013 Question yourself if you\u2019re angry,\u201d the advice says.</p> <p>\u201cAre your fears likely to eventuate? What does science tell us about the most likely outcomes? Is your response reasonable?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The one welcome casualty of the coronavirus pandemic ought to be the culture wars. If it achieves nothing else, the health crisis has revealed the emptiness of leaders who manufacture nationalist fears to maintain their power. Boris Johnson now looks as out of place as a clown in a morgue. Donald Trump looks as out of luck as a cornered conman.</p> <p>Nothing is inevitable, however. To see how a pandemic can be used to ensure that supplies of politically useful rage keep flowing, look at how US Republicans are constructing a cover story. They have plenty to cover up. The gaps in safety nets that the virus is revealing everywhere gape in the United States. That the world\u2019s richest country somehow never got round to providing universal healthcare is bad enough, but the incompetence of Trump\u2019s White House and the wider US right has been close to criminal.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">We have it under control</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-donald-trump-timeline\" title=\"\">It\u2019s going to be just fine</a>,\u201d Trump bragged on 22 January. He has never managed to rise from that low point. All Americans have had is bluff and bombast intended to make the virus seem a minor nuisance, and then, as reality dawned on the president\u2019s narrow mind, to ensure blame went to anyone but himself. He was not alone. Fox News, which acts as a front for his administration and as the respectable face of crackpot politics, has been engaged in an equally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thefix/status/1240041548672380931?s=20\" title=\"\">clanking gearshift</a>. At the beginning of March, liberal criticisms of Trump\u2019s inability to see a national emergency when it was staring him in the face were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/10/fox-news-coronavirus-tucker-carlson-trish-regan\" title=\"\">just another attempt to impeach the president</a>\u201d, according to one presenter. At worst, the virus \u201ccould be the flu\u201d, added a second. Not even so bad a flu, opined a third. The U-turn in mid-March was so fast you could smell the burning rubber on the road. Overnight, coronavirus became a \u201chealth crisis\u201d and an \u201cincredibly dangerous and contagious virus\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The honourable course, of admitting a mistake and expressing determination to do better, was unavailable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How do you recover from an error of such magnitude? The honourable course, of admitting a mistake and expressing a determination to do better in future, was unavailable \u2013 and not only because fighting in a culture war means never having to say you\u2019re sorry. Honesty might be fatal to Trump\u2019s hopes of re-election.</p> <p>Instead, an escape attempt began with the right-wing deploying the language policing it so often deplores on the politically correct left. Trump is now insisting that coronavirus should not be called coronavirus but \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html\" title=\"\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The side benefits he could expect to bank ought to be obvious. Trump could count on US liberals playing his game by accusing him of being an anti-Chinese racist. Liberals duly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html\" title=\"\">walked into the trap</a> and Trump\u2019s supporters were transported from the fear of living in an unprepared country with a demonstrably inadequate leader to the familiar ground of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\" title=\"\">culture war</a>. They could mutter: \u201cOh, these people call everything they don\u2019t like racist; they\u2019ll be saying it\u2019s racist to call <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/oan-reporter-chanel-rion-asks-incredibly-bonkers-softball-question-at-trump-coronavirus-presser\" title=\"\">Chinese food \u2018Chinese\u2019</a> next.\u201d</p> <p>Trump could also count on the academically minded, saying scientists might once have named the coronavirus the \u201cChina virus\u201d or \u201cWuhan virus\u201d \u2013 as the Spanish flu and Ebola were named after the places where they were thought to originate. But the World Health Organization decided in 2015 that it wanted <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trump-coronavirus-racist-virus-names_n_5e727ecdc5b6f5b7c53d5c48?ri18n=true\" title=\"\">medically useful names</a>. Trump\u2019s supporters could shrug aside the WHO\u2019s fancy talk and say that everyone knows the outbreak started because of China\u2019s appalling treatment of animals, and the Chinese Communist party then added the suppression of news to its list of crimes by hiding the outbreak\u2019s existence.</p> <p>However much critics may want to say Trump is a semi-senile fool \u2013 and I do \u2013 it is worth remembering that he remains a brilliant political operator, who has destroyed all opponents within and without the Republican party who made the mistake of underestimating him. In this instance his cleverness, and the major benefit he expects to enjoy, lies in shifting the blame for his folly on to the Chinese.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the virus is China's fault, then domestic critics of Trump's administration are traitors aiding Chinese communists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It does not stop there. If the virus is China\u2019s fault, then domestic critics of his administration are traitors aiding the Chinese communists. You think I\u2019m exaggerating? On 16 March, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marklevinshow/status/1239529127415291904?s=20\" title=\"\">tweeted a link</a> to an article on the paranoid <em><a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/16/the-atlantic-must-stop-covering-for-the-chinese-communist-party/\" title=\"\">Federalist</a></em><a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/16/the-atlantic-must-stop-covering-for-the-chinese-communist-party/\" title=\"\"> site</a>. The author, one Madeline Osburn, was explicit. <em>The</em> <em>Atlantic</em>, a serious American magazine, had joined \u201cChina\u2019s anti-American disinformation efforts\u201d, she said. Osburn, who would have had a glittering career on the <em>People\u2019s Daily</em> if she had been born Chinese, cited the work of <em>The</em> <em>Atlantic</em>\u2019s Anne Applebaum, without appearing to know that Applebaum has written <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anne-Applebaum/e/B001IQULQS\" title=\"\">two devastating histories</a> of the atrocities of communism. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-showed-america-wasnt-task/608023/\" title=\"\">Describing</a> how the pandemic has exposed America\u2019s weaknesses in general, and its president\u2019s weaknesses in particular, made Applebaum a useful idiot at best and traitor at worst, Osburn said.</p> <p>The presidential retweet was not a one-off. By 19 March, Trump was saying in public that journalists who asked hard questions were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/oan-reporter-chanel-rion-asks-incredibly-bonkers-softball-question-at-trump-coronavirus-presser\" title=\"\">siding with China</a>\u201d. On 31 January, Trump had boasted: \u201cWe pretty much shut it down coming in from China. We have a tremendous relationship with China, which is a very positive thing.\u201d By last week, he was counting on his supporters to have forgotten all that. This is how a failed presidency and failed political movement fights when it is in a corner.</p> <p>The hope that events will justify your beliefs is an ineradicable delusion. Surely, now the British will see through Johnson, liberals say, rather than blindly rally to his government in a time of crisis. Surely, the Americans will toss Trump on the scrap heap in November. But political battles do not win themselves. Democrats still have to unseat a sitting president \u2013 a feat they have not managed since 1992. Labour still has to turn itself from a serial election-loser into an election-winning machine. As the US shows, coronavirus can become the \u201cChina virus\u201d. And what seems an irrefutable argument for a comprehensive welfare state can become an excuse for nationalist tricksters to wrap themselves in their tattered flags. </p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

But this one won\u2019t count. Osgood runs the length of the pitch, a straight-line dribble down the middle. Leeds are light at the back, Charlton out of position having been thrown up front. Only Madeley and Hunter are on point. Osgood drifts a little to the left, drawing Madeley and slipping a diagonal pass between the split defenders to Hutchinson, who taps home.

Osgood, who had turned and kept on running, ghosts in and flicks a fine diving header past the outrushing Harvey and into the bottom left!

Hutchinson spins through 180 degrees on the floor and swings a wild boot at the now retreating Bremner.

Then there\u2019s another phase of Leeds attack as Cooper reaches the byline on left and crosses to Jones, who tees up Giles to shoot inches wide right from the edge of the box.

And it\u2019s got nothing whatsoever to do with Bonetti\u2019s injury. Facing his own goal and in his own half down the left, Clarke picks the ball up and turns. He evades three tackles, making it into the Chelsea half and eventually poking the ball forward to Jones just to the left of the centre circle. The striker heads off at high speed, drifts inside past Hollins, and evades the desperate slide tackle of McCreadie as the defender bumbles back from his position on the left. Once Jones reaches the right-hand side of the D, he cocks his leg back and unleashes an unstoppable rising drive into the top left. The keeper had no chance, gammy knee or no! Nor did the five \u2013 <em>five</em> \u2013 Chelsea players eviscerated by a sudden turn of pace from two Leeds men. Jones races off leaping and punching the air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f31c130f23c0bc3694796023ad1485e3af19633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f31c130f23c0bc3694796023ad1485e3af19633/0_0_2450_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Jones opens the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mick Jones opens the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T15:46:54.323Z\">at 3.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e76341c8f08dcc95cc20a9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T15:35:38.635Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>35 min:</strong> The game eventually restarts, Bonetti having washed his face with water and hobbled back to his station.

A fixture pile-up cost them their championship crown, the First Division title gifted to Everton, while Jock Stein\u2019s Celtic bossed them in the semi-finals of the European Cup. Now this is all that\u2019s left. Don Revie\u2019s sensational side couldn\u2019t end up completely empty handed, could they?</p> <p><strong>But never mind the overall context of their Homeric season; Leeds won\u2019t be happy to be contesting this replay on the merits of the first match alone. </strong>They were the better side two weeks ago, on a quagmire of a pitch at Wembley. (The pitch at the home of English football had been churned up days before its showpiece by <em>the Horse of the Year show.)</em> Leeds took the lead twice. On 20 minutes, Jack Charlton flapped his scrapeover at a cross; his header trickled over the goalline, half-turn by half-turn. Eddie McCreadie tried to kick it away, but took a fresh-air swipe and fell on his arse, like a drunk in a Frank Randle film. Peter Houseman equalised just before the break, his speculative long-range shot creeping into the bottom right corner under the body of Gary Sprake (who was sporting the sort of huge blond quiff not seen since ABC Television stopped making Oh Boy). Houseman celebrated by accidentally spitting all over his shirt.</p> <p><strong>Six minutes from time, Leeds looked to have won their first FA Cup, Mick Jones lashing into the bottom-left corner after Allan Clarke had hit the right-hand post with a header.</strong> But only two minutes later, Ian Hutchinson flashed home a near-post header from a left-wing John Hollins cross. Extra time produced no more goals, and with the rutted, muddy pitch now a complete joke, the FA decided to bundle everyone up to Old Trafford for the replay. And so here we are.</p> <p><strong>Can Leeds salvage their season by winning their first FA Cup? </strong>Or can Dave Sexton\u2019s men lift Chelsea\u2019s first FA Cup instead? It\u2019s a summit meeting between two of the best teams in football right now, Revie\u2019s men having finished second in the First Division behind Everton, Chelsea just behind them in third. Ancient history favours Chelsea, who have beaten Leeds on all four previous occasions they\u2019ve met in the cup; this season\u2019s league results point to a Leeds win, their having won 2-0 at Elland Road and 5-2 at Stamford Bridge. It\u2019s Leeds\u2019 63rd match of the season. It\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s 54th.

The Hundred offered English cricketers \u2013 and quite a few Kolpaks \u2013 an irresistible windfall. Famous coaches were hired from afar with no expense spared. By the standards of the past, the game was awash with money and a player could plot his own unique career path, which need not be so dependent on the old county system.</p> <p>But now the corridors are packed with uncertainty. Pay cuts are on the horizon, as has been the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/premiership-rugby-clubs-players-pay-cut-coronavirus\">among Premiership rugby union clubs</a>, and the T20 gigs are in doubt. So too are the international matches that have always been the lifeblood of the game.</p> <p>Cricketers, we discover, are not key workers. In fact there has been an interesting recalibration of what constitutes a key worker. For some reason this does not extend to hedge fund managers, Premier League footballers, estate agents or even sports journalists.</p> <p>For the moment our cricketers are in limbo, at least until 28 May, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/ecb-no-cricket-may-battles-save-season\">Friday\u2019s England and Wales Cricket Board announcement</a>. The ECB must try to salvage something from the 2020 season, although it is a task way beyond its control. Yet the sport\u2019s governing body is attempting to outline a variety of options that are dependent upon when the playing of cricket becomes a safe and acceptable activity again.</p> <p>One option is to play county games \u2013 and Test matches, which are so much more important in terms of income \u2013 behind closed doors. This is not the time for wisecracks along the lines of: \u201cDon\u2019t they do that already?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3fa4463c28c98400675c58cc85702995fce8e3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3fa4463c28c98400675c58cc85702995fce8e3f/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Essex Eagles lift the T20 Blast trophy last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Essex Eagles celebrate winning last year\u2019s T20 Blast, a competition that generates significant income for counties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The situation is too grave and in any case that cliche of sparse crowds is not universally true. Going behind closed doors is a horrible option but in these times that does not necessarily mean it should be ruled out immediately.</p> <p>How many people would have to be in the ground to allow such a match to proceed? At least 100 perhaps, even if we expel the annoying camera operator whose job is to follow the dismissed batsman off the field at close quarters? Would that figure be acceptable to the experts \u2013 or the players?</p> <p>There may well be no red-ball cricket this summer at domestic level, such is the understandable eagerness to satisfy the TV companies. The grounds could be empty for months. Even if no cricket is permitted, might it be possible in our towns and cities for the open spaces of some of our grounds to be available as exercise areas, provided a safe distance is kept?</p> <p>In fine weather could the big screens be used to provide open-air cinemas? It will be important for the clubs to remain relevant by engaging with their local communities. And they will want to generate some income.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ECB may tacitly welcome an inbuilt excuse for a lukewarm start to The Hundred</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the counties the T20 Blast fills this function better than anything else and there is surely every chance this competition will be switched to the later part of the season. If there is no red-ball cricket it may be possible to experiment \u2013 or revert to \u2013 a knockout 50-over competition that would give county members something more substantial to watch.</p> <p>And then, of course, there isthe Hundred. As the overseas players become more hesitant or just more unavailable \u2013 the withdrawal of David Warner from Southern Brave (the team based in Southampton) may not be the last absentee among the Australians \u2013 there may be a case to postpone it until 2021, though some may prefer a permanent abandonment. A postponement will not happen unless the virus demolishes the entire season. The ECB has invested so much in this competition, which helps to explain why its reserves to deal with unforeseen events have slumped from \u00a370m to around \u00a310m, that it will be determined to proceed with it come what may. The TV deal dictates this is the case.</p> <p>However, the ECB may tacitly welcome an inbuilt excuse for a lukewarm start to its new competition. It can blame it on the pandemic. If the Hundred does take place, there will at least be an insatiable hunger for some live sport on our TV screens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The challenges, as in every walk of life, are immense and it may be that cricket in England uses the hiatus to seek reform. Some may pursue a reduction in the number of first-class counties and a restructuring of championship cricket. Others may argue for a serious rethink of the Hundred; it may even be the 12-month contracts for county cricketers will be reconsidered. Amid the enforced pause there will be plenty of time for plotting a way forward in the next few months even if finding a consensus is tortuous.</p> <p>Beyond the professional game we should spare a thought for all those recreational cricketers, the true devotees of the game, who will be denied their afternoons and evenings of competition and camaraderie. There is barely a silver lining in sight except that in the barren, stressful months ahead we may all come to appreciate with fresh clarity what we are missing.</p>",

  "<p>On 27 June 2019, the energy and clean growth minister Chris Skidmore signed papers that committed the UK to reduce carbon emissions to effectively <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law\">nothing by 2050</a>. If we are to stand any chance of meeting this target, known as \u201cnet zero\u201d, there is one enormous challenge that we will have to tackle: home heating.</p> <p>Warming our homes is responsible for between a quarter and a third of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s more than 10 times the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> created by the aviation industry. Around 85% of homes now use gas-fired central heating, and a large proportion of gas cooking still takes place. Greening this system is a huge challenge by any measure. But if recent reports are to be believed, there could be a simple and efficient way to do it: change from using natural gas to hydrogen gas.</p> <p>Hydrogen is abundant in the natural world and according to its advocates could power the next generation of gas appliances cleanly and efficiently.</p> <p>\u201cThe attraction of hydrogen is that for a lot of consumers, they wouldn\u2019t notice any difference. Customers would continue to use a boiler to heat their homes in a similar manner to natural gas,\u201d says Robert Sansom of the Institution of Engineering and Technology\u2019s energy policy panel. He is the lead author on a study conducted by the institute called <a href=\"https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/sectors/energy/energy-news/transitioning-to-hydrogen-assessing-the-engineering-risks-and-uncertainties/\">Transitioning to Hydrogen</a>.</p> <p>Together with colleagues, Sansom assessed the engineering risks and uncertainties associated with swapping our gas network to hydrogen. Their conclusion is that there is no reason why repurposing the gas network to hydrogen cannot be achieved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/hydrogen-uk-gas-grid-keele-university\">Zero-carbon hydrogen injected into gas grid for first time in groundbreaking UK trial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say it would be easy, though. Technological and practical hurdles exist because there is no blueprint for such a conversion: there is nowhere in the world that supplies pure hydrogen to homes and businesses. The UK would have to pioneer everything.</p> <p>Interest in hydrogen as a way to heat homes began in 2016 with a report called H21. It was conducted by Northern Gas Networks, the gas distributor for the north of England, and looked at whether it was technically possible and economically viable to convert Leeds to 100% hydrogen instead of natural gas.</p> <p>\u201cThey went into a lot of detail, from the hydrogen production plants right the way down to people\u2019s homes,\u201d says Sansom.</p> <p>The report drew a parallel to the way the gas industry converted from town gas to natural gas in the 1960s and 70s. Town gas was a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. It was mostly produced from the distillation of coal and oil and had been used for the first 150 years of the UK\u2019s gas industry. With the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, which is predominantly methane, the UK undertook a nationwide programme to convert 40m appliances over a decade.</p> <p>Whole streets would be converted at a time. Engineers would inspect the gas appliances, and then convert them. Simultaneously, the town gas was disconnected and the pipelines were purged with an inert gas. Finally, the natural gas was pumped into the system and the engineers would make sure each appliance worked correctly before moving to the next street along.</p> <p>Some manufacturers are now so convinced that a similar thing can happen with hydrogen that they have already begun to develop new household appliances. In February, <a href=\"https://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/img/documents/hydrogen/The_Future_of_Fuel.pdf\">Worcester Bosch</a> unveiled the prototype of its hydrogen-ready boiler. It would run first on natural gas and then, after a servicing visit, hydrogen.</p> <p>Also working in hydrogen\u2019s favour is that for the past 20 years, the gas industry has been systematically replacing the metal pipes in its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/domestic/gasmain.pdf\">iron mains</a>\u201d network with yellow polyethylene ones. Around 90% of the pipes will have been replaced by 2030. This is good news for hydrogen because the gas reacts with the old metal pipes, making them brittle. But the polyethylene is safe.</p> <p>\u201cEffectively we started a programme of hydrogen-proofing our gas network without knowing we were doing it,\u201d says Sansom, who found himself becoming more and more impressed by the concept. \u201cFrom a personal point of view, I was very much on the fence when I kicked off with this work. But I found myself slipping down on the hydrogen side in terms of its viability as a low carbon alternative to natural gas,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83cf920fe00a530005a17cefdc3c86a97ba969b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83cf920fe00a530005a17cefdc3c86a97ba969b8/0_0_6000_3368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Worcester Bosch\u2019s hydrogen-fired boiler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worcester Bosch\u2019s hydrogen-fired boiler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Worcester Bosch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not everyone is convinced by this sudden interest in hydrogen. Richard Lowes of the University of Exeter Energy Policy Group says that until recently the received wisdom had been that heating would have to be electrified in some way to meet our climate-crisis commitments. \u201cThat has basically come out of years and years of technical and economic modelling to look at how you get to fully decarbonised heating in the UK,\u201d says Lowes.</p> <p>Switching heating from gas to electricity would mean relying on heat pumps. These use electricity to extract heat from either the air or the ground. In the case of an air source heat pump, it works like a fridge but instead of sucking heat out of a food compartment, it pulls it out of the air and channels it into the home, where it is used to heat water, which is piped to radiators for central heating, and stored in a tank for hot water.</p> <p>But because this technology works at a lower temperature than existing boilers, it requires many homes to be much better insulated, or to have larger radiators, capable of delivering more heating power. For those who have switched to heat-as-you-go combi boilers, it will necessitate the reinstallation of a hot water tank.</p> <p>It\u2019s extensive work but worth it, according to Lowes, who has removed his own gas boiler and is now using an air source heat pump to heat his home. \u201cIt was a lot of work but my home and heating system are now a lot more efficient. It\u2019s always warm, there\u2019s always hot water and it\u2019s basically the same cost to run as gas,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can\u2019t dig up the roads when they\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Lowes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The third approach is called district heating. It envisages water being heated at a central facility using waste heat from industry or green sources such as solar power. The hot water is then delivered to many homes simultaneously through a network of heavily insulated underground pipes. Both methods can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of home heating but the downside is that they require extensive work to roll them out on a national scale.</p> <p>District heating would require water pipes to be laid under homes, and the widespread use of heat pumps would necessitate the National Grid\u2019s electricity circuits being upgraded. It is this kind of disruption that hydrogen\u2019s advocates say could be avoided because much of the national infrastructure has already been upgraded. That argument cuts no ice with Lowes. \u201cIt seems a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can\u2019t dig up the roads when they\u2019ve been doing it for the past 20 years,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He points out that although the consumer may not experience so much disruption, significant challenges for the gas industry remain. For example, the National Transmission System, which is the network of pipes that supplies gas from the coastal terminals to the gas distribution companies and other major users, is made of metal. This would need to be protected from embrittlement in some way before any switch to hydrogen could take place.</p> <p>\u201cHydrogen is certainly not a silver bullet,\u201d says Lowes. And if we get distracted by it, we could be getting ourselves into more trouble, missing the 2050 energy target altogether.</p> <p>But if there is so much uncertainty with hydrogen, why is the gas industry, which funds many of the studies, pushing it so hard? According to Chris Goodall, energy economist and author of <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50345546-what-we-need-to-do-now\">What We Need to Do Now for a Zero Carbon Future</a></em>, it is a matter of survival.</p> <p>\u201cThey do not wish for their industry to be eaten up by a switch to electricity for heating. So they are moving as fast as they can to persuade us about hydrogen,\u201d he says. And it all comes down to how the gas is produced.</p> <p>Hydrogen is not found on Earth in a pure state. Instead, it has to be extracted from other substances, and the best one to extract it from is methane \u2013 in other words natural gas. Hence, the gas companies could effectively keep their current operations running.</p> <p>But the extra steps involved in extracting the hydrogen would push the price up. Additionally, the extraction creates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so large scale carbon capture technology would need to be developed to prevent it escaping into the atmosphere. Although this is a technology that the UK will have to develop anyway in order to reach net zero by 2050, it will add to the cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94bea20a7ad39a7b8b1e81ae3254694474ab0782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94bea20a7ad39a7b8b1e81ae3254694474ab0782/0_208_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Northern Ireland\u2019s first sustainable hydrogen fuel cell bus, the Wrightbus, unveiled in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Northern Ireland\u2019s first sustainable hydrogen fuel cell bus, the Wrightbus, unveiled in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But natural gas is not the only substance that contains hydrogen. Water does too, and the hydrogen can be freed by a process called electrolysis, which doesn\u2019t create any carbon dioxide. To make it totally green, which is the ultimate hope, electrolysis could be powered by wind farms. At the moment, however, the price of such electricity is expensive, and that would push the price of hydrogen up still further.</p> <p>Goodall hopes that the cost will decrease as technology improves, but warns: \u201cYou can be accused of mindless optimism just by saying this.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s future energy landscape is without doubt a difficult realm to navigate. Perhaps the best route will be revealed by not pitting the various solutions against one another. \u201cAll three have strengths and weaknesses and I expect that there\u2019ll be a major role for each as a replacement for natural gas,\u201d says Sansom. Even hydrogen\u2019s detractors acknowledge this. \u201cAs a niche technology it can have real value,\u201d says Lowes. He goes on to paraphrase the Heineken lager adverts of the 70s and 80s, saying that hydrogen could potentially reach the parts of the country that other energy solutions can\u2019t.</p> <p>Goodall also sees a role for hydrogen to \u201cstore\u201d energy generated from renewable resources such as wind and solar power. The idea is that in windy months, any extra electricity generated from renewables will be used to make hydrogen, which would then be stored. When there is extra demand on the National Grid, or a seasonal drop in the power produced from renewables, the hydrogen can be burned to produce electricity.</p> <p>The truth is that all options for us to decarbonise our heating systems will require significant disruption and cost. And while government continues to deliberate, the clock ticks towards 2050.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need to wait. We can deploy stuff now that works fine,\u201d says Lowes, referring to his own experience of changing his gas boiler for a heat pump. \u201cThe urgency of climate change means there really isn\u2019t any reason to delay.\u201d</p> <p>Others believe that there is a role for hydrogen and think it is worth taking a little more time to consider. But there is one truth that everyone agrees upon. \u201cNone of this is easy. If anyone is saying to you this is easy, they are misleading you,\u201d says Lowes.</p> <h2>Hydrogen-powered cars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f857b4c9eb391db5e6b71d3512f4d2566abf3cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f857b4c9eb391db5e6b71d3512f4d2566abf3cb/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hydrogen filling station in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hydrogen filling station in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hydrogen can also power vehicles, but in a different way than it would heat houses. Instead of being burned, the hydrogen reacts with oxygen inside a device called a fuel cell. Electricity and water are produced. The electricity runs the car, the water drips from the exhaust pipe.<br><br>An attempt to switch to hydrogen vehicles in the 1990s was thwarted byelectric cars, which store their energy in an onboard battery. But a new push for hydrogen vehicles is coming from Asia. China, Japan and South Korea have all set ambitious goals to have millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by 2030.<br><br>Toyota and Hyundai are both offering hydrogen vehicles in the UK, but there are currently less than 20 hydrogen filling stations across the UK, mostly clustered around the M25.<br><br>\u201cIt will be really interesting to see what happens,\u201d says Lowes. But he himself is not convinced: \u201cHydrogen is much more expensive than electricity, and the car is more expensive than the electric vehicle.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A new body promised by Theresa May to tackle \u201cdeep-seated societal injustices\u201d has never been convened and never will be, the <em>Observer</em> has been told.</p> <p>The former prime minister\u2019s pledge to create the Office for Tackling Injustices (OfTI) won praise from inequality campaigners, who said it was an important part of the battle to reduce opportunity disparities over race, gender, deprivation, sexuality and disability. The chair of the new office was also announced when May<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/social-justice-not-brexit-theresa-may-races-to-secure-her-legacy\" title=\"\"> unveiled the plan last summer</a>.

Some said they had not received any contact about it since its unveiling. No budget or remit has ever been published or agreed. One of those hoping to work with the office said the lack of progress was \u201cvery frustrating\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 it is never going to exist,\u201d said one person involved. \u201cIt has been thrown into the long grass. This was a big opportunity to find the evidence and act on it, but it is not being used. People involved in it have never even been told what the plan was. They have heard nothing. It is a shame because this agenda is important \u2013 there are huge issues around race, disability and gender that this would have helped.\u201d</p> <p>The OfTI was intended to work independently of the government, but with resources supplied by the Cabinet Office. It was to bring together the latest research and data to give a clear picture of the inequalities faced by different groups. It is a similar approach to the Race Disparity Audit, which highlighted the huge differences in life experiences and outcomes that ethnic minorities face compared with their white British counterparts.</p> <p>However, the new office was always derided by many Tories and Whitehall insiders, who regarded it as nothing more than a desperate attempt by May to preserve any kind of legacy after a premiership dominated by a failure to break the Brexit gridlock.</p> <p>Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith, the former business executive who was to chair the new office, said she was not surprised that the office had not yet been formed. She said that the coronavirus crisis meant it was right that resources were directed elsewhere, but urged the government to return to the idea at the right time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m passionate about equality in the UK and I\u2019m really keen for OfTI to go ahead. It isn\u2019t surprising because of the demands around Europe, and now Covid-19, that this hasn\u2019t kicked off. After Covid-19 has passed, we should look at picking it back up, but not until then. Being equal, and having no disadvantage because of your background, is important to anybody. After Covid-19 has passed, this agenda will matter more than ever.\u201d</p> <p>The office won significant backing at the time of its launch.

We are absolutely committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless of their backgrounds, has the support they need.</p> <p>\u201cWe will tackle prejudice, racism and discrimination and address the complex reasons why some groups do less well at school, earn less at work, or are more likely to be victims of crime and have committed to investing at least \u00a390m to reduce youth employment disparities.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who has continued to play video games beyond childhood is used to the name-calling. Yes, in 2020, millions of thoughtful, otherwise usefully employed people enjoy video games (as well as a fair few thoughtless wastrels too, if Twitter is anything to go by). But away from the golf course or bridge club, adult play is still viewed, culturally speaking, with suspicion, pity or disdain. As a reporter for the <em>Washington Post</em> tweeted in 2017, in reference to the American chatshow host Jimmy Fallon, a keen fan of the medium: \u201cAt the heart of any banality is an adult male who plays video games.\u201d</p> <p>Still, personally speaking, it took a pandemic to appreciate that the video game reviewer is truly the cockroach of arts and entertainment criticism. As cinemas, theatres, restaurants and concert venues close, and their remaining staff begin the sorrowful work of disinfection and grant application, writers who cover their industries are forced to glumly twirl their pens, waiting. The video game critic (and, breathe easy, the literary critic), by contrast, suddenly finds a near-captive audience that is, once Netflix has been plundered at least, just maybe willing to give video games a try.</p> <p>For the next who-knows-how-long, this monthly look at the medium will move to a weekly slot. For those readers who consider games to be at the \u201cheart of any banality\u201d (yikes), I can only apologise.

  "<p>As we confront the pandemic, we\u2019re flying blind, like pilots in 1930s aeroplanes flying through fog. That, at any rate, is what I take away from reading John Ioannidis, a Stanford professor who is an expert in epidemiology, population health, biomedical data science and statistics. Covid-19, he writes, in a <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/\" title=\"\">startling article</a>, \u201chas been called a once-in-a-century pandemic. But it may also be a once-in-a-century evidence fiasco. At a time when everyone needs better information, from disease modellers and governments to people quarantined or just social distancing, we lack reliable evidence on how many people have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 [the official name for the virus] or who continue to become infected\u201d.</p> <p>Draconian countermeasures are being implemented all over the place. If the pandemic dissipates \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 such extreme short-term measures may be bearable. But what if the thing just keeps going? And how can policymakers know they\u2019re doing more good than harm?</p> <p>A key principle of control engineering is that you have to be able to measure the variable you\u2019re trying to control. In the case of Covid-19, we currently have no way of accurately measuring how we\u2019re doing, because we\u2019re not able to do enough testing of the population. Dammit, we\u2019re still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/there-is-a-policy-of-surrender-doctor-on-uks-covid-19-failures\" title=\"\">not even testing frontline medical staff</a>.</p> <p>I know, I know: this is hard; this thing came out of the blue; we can\u2019t just magic up the resources needed to do extensive public testing out of thin air; etc. But at the same time, every sentient being in the government must know by now that we <em>must</em> find some way of measuring the thing we\u2019re trying to control. How else will we know \u2013 other than by counting the number of desperate cases who show up needing intensive care \u2013 whether that curve is being flattened or not?</p> <p>We need a magic bullet. And, miraculously, we seem to have one. It\u2019s called a smartphone. Almost everybody has one nowadays. And \u2013 as security agencies, internet companies and mobile network owners know \u2013 these devices track your every movement, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. They\u2019re a bit like those electronic tags we put on some criminals to make sure they stick to the terms of their parole conditions. Except that the phones are smarter than tags. We can run apps on them that make them serve our public health purposes.</p> <p>Interestingly, we were doing this in the UK way back in 2011 \u2013 in the <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/fluphone-disease-tracking-by-app\" title=\"\">\u201cFluPhone\u201d project</a>, run by Prof Jon Crowcroft and Dr Eiko Yoneki of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory. They created an app that monitored flu-like symptoms by questioning the phones\u2019 owners and then subsequently logged their physical proximity to other people they met. The pilot study, conducted by volunteers over a few months \u2013 which in an odd twist of fate coincided with the outbreak of swine flu \u2013 demonstrated convincingly how smartphones can provide data that would otherwise be unavailable to public health authorities.</p> <p>So, in a way, this approach to monitoring behaviour during an epidemic is old hat, technically speaking. Not surprisingly, the Covid-19 crisis has led people in a number of countries to develop similar tools. In early February, for example, South Korean geeks wrote <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/tech/korea-coronavirus-tracking-apps/index.html\" title=\"\">\u201cCorona 100m\u201d</a>, an app that allows people to see the date a coronavirus patient was confirmed to have the disease, along with that patient\u2019s nationality, gender, age and the places the patient visited. The person using the app can also see how close they are to coronavirus patients. It was launched on 11 February and had a million downloads in the first 17 days.</p> <p>It looks as though the Chinese authorities have been using similar approaches almost from the outset of the pandemic. And the Israeli government authorised the country\u2019s internal security agency to use mobile phone location data to help combat the virus. According to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/middleeast/israel-coronavirus-cellphone-tracking.html\" title=\"\"><em>New York Times</em> report</a>, the data will be used to retrace the movements of individuals who test positive for the virus, and identify others who should be quarantined. And I bet there are people in 10 Downing Street (and not just Dominic Cummings) who are actively thinking along those lines.</p> <p>You can now see the quandary heading our way. We have a terrifying emergency on our hands. There\u2019s a technology that could be really useful in providing a real-time measure of the effectiveness (or otherwise) of public policy. But it\u2019s so intrusive that in \u201cnormal\u201d times we would be very hesitant to adopt it. Present times are not normal, though, so we will probably adopt it \u2013 perhaps sensibly \u2013 \u201cjust for the duration of the crisis\u201d. And then?</p> <p>You know the answer because we\u2019ve been here before \u2013 with 9/11. That emergency led a panicked US into building the surveillance state that Edward Snowden eventually exposed in 2013. Once a government commits to this stuff, it seems that there\u2019s no going back.

  "<p>If you\u2019re lucky enough still to have her around, there\u2019s no one on earth you go back further with than your mother. The bond between a mother and her adult child can be frenzied and fraught, loaded and exasperating, undermining and energy-sapping. As with all family relationships, so much of what\u2019s going on is unsaid or coded. An outsider can only sense the ripples, while you are only too aware of the tsunami. But whatever it\u2019s like, two things are true. First, this is a relationship that always matters; and second, it can always be improved. Here\u2019s how.</p> <p><strong>1. Accept that you can\u2019t change her.</strong> \u201cYou can\u2019t change anyone else,\u201d says Philippa Perry, psychotherapist and author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/10/the-book-you-wish-your-parents-had-read-philippa-perry-review\" title=\"\">The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read</a></em>. \u201cBut sometimes, if you change yourself, the other person will change as well. If you decide to be kind towards your mother, and accepting of her, that may shift your relationship. It\u2019s not guaranteed, but it\u2019s a possibility.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. Ask her about her childhood. </strong>Because you know all those times when she\u2019s being ridiculous, or uptight, or controlling, or seeming to pass judgement? They almost certainly relate to something that happened to her. \u201cGrayson [Perry\u2019s husband, the artist] once gave me a pair of orange plastic clogs and my mother said, \u2018You can\u2019t go out in them,\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Do you think it\u2019s like when you were young and women went around in hats and with outfits pinched in at the waist, and when wearing clogs brought shame on the house?\u2019 And she said: \u2018Yes \u2013 exactly!\u2019 I\u2019d understood that she was coming from a different time and place, and it helped me to see that often, when a mother seems to be nagging, it\u2019s coming from a place of concern and love rather than a need to control.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3. Recognise that what most bugs you about her is yourself.</strong> \u201cWhat most angers us about our mothers is the traits we share with them,\u201d says psychotherapist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/01/becoming-a-grandmother-at-47-led-me-as-a-therapist-to-rethink-my-response-to-change\" title=\"\">Julia Samuel</a>, author of <em>This Too Shall Pass: Stories of Change, Crisis and Hopeful Beginnings</em>. \u201cSo it annoys you that she\u2019s stingy, or impatient? That\u2019s because you know deep down that you are, too. Be more compassionate \u2013 to your mother, but also to yourself.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4. Be sensitive to generational differences \u2013 but don\u2019t put up with prejudice.</strong> \u201cOur parents lived in a world with many different constructs,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/kevin.browne\" title=\"\">Professor Kevin Browne</a>, director of the Centre for Forensic and Family Psychology at Nottingham University. The media reflected behaviour that would quite rightly not be tolerated today \u2013 so it\u2019s not surprising, he says, if your mum isn\u2019t as politically correct as you\u2019d like her to be. What\u2019s important is keeping the conversation going \u2013 and if you see where she\u2019s coming from, she can hopefully see your point of view as well.</p> <p><strong>5. Ask her about her life now.</strong> \u201cDon\u2019t assume that all she\u2019s interested in is planting bulbs and watching telly,\u201d says Perry. \u201cAnd even if she is, hear her out. She might have some very interesting things to say about them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6. Find time to be together. </strong>\u201cMy daughter has a new partner, and it\u2019s ages since we saw one another on our own,\u201d says a friend. \u201cThe other day she called me and said, \u2018Mum, we need some hunkering-down time, just us two.\u2019 We had a night in with a takeaway and a movie, and it was heaven.\u201d \u201cYou have a different kind of conversation one-on-one,\u201d says Samuel. \u201cIt reignites the bond.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nagging often comes from concern rather than a need to control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>7. Accept the limitations ageing puts on her.</strong> It\u2019s about accepting that you\u2019re ageing, too. \u201cBut don\u2019t let your fear for yourself stop you from empathising with how your mum feels as she tackles the issues of being a few decades ahead of you,\u201d says Samuel.</p> <p><strong>8. Walk and talk. </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s the most therapeutic way to have a conversation,\u201d says Samuel. \u201cThat way you are not eyeballing one another, you are side by side and your bodies are in rhythm, you can have silences, you can be upset. Afterwards have a treat: tea and cake, or a pub lunch.\u201d If your mum isn\u2019t up to walking, a chat in the car works, too.</p> <p><strong>9. Don\u2019t put it off.</strong> \u201cPeople go years and years intending to have a better relationship with their mum,\u201d says Browne. \u201cThen suddenly she\u2019s dead, and coping with bereavement is much harder if you have guilt and regret.\u201d</p> <p><strong>10. Don\u2019t moan to her about your siblings. </strong>\u201cMy sister and I used to have a row, and then we\u2019d each reach for the phone to call our mother,\u201d says a friend. That\u2019s not fair: you\u2019re out of the playpen now. \u201cYou\u2019re putting her in an impossible situation,\u201d says Browne. \u201cIt creates conflict and conflict creates anxiety, and it\u2019s not fair to make your mother feel anxious.\u201d</p> <p><strong>11. Don\u2019t blame her. </strong>\u201cI spent years blaming my mother for more or less everything,\u201d says forensic psychologist Judith Wenban-Smith. \u201cEventually I realised she was as much a victim of her circumstances as I felt she\u2019d made me of mine.\u201d Working that out early goes a long way.</p> <p><strong>12. Choose activities with her, not you, in mind. </strong>\u201cThink about things she might not feel up to on her own,\u201d says Wenban-Smith. \u201cMy own mother loved trips to National Trust properties, and I\u2019d make sure I got her to them.\u201d Taking your mum on holiday (and not because you want her to do the childcare!) can be a great treat in a lovely setting, and underlines how much you value her.</p> <p><strong>13. Forgive her. </strong>We all make mistakes, and your mother\u2019s mistakes have had huge repercussions across your life. But unless she had truly serious issues, your mother wanted to do her best by you. \u201cFinding it in your heart to forgive her will transform your life, as well as your relationship with her,\u201d says Samuel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Do things with her that she might not be up to on her own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>14. Don\u2019t put her on a pedestal. </strong>\u201cFor years I did that,\u201d says Rakhi Chand, psychotherapist and counsellor. \u201cThen I realised she was a person just like me, with faults and failings and issues she struggled with. I had to acknowledge the loss, but it allowed me to deal with the reality of my mother, rather than the fantasy version.\u201d</p> <p><strong>15. Press pause. </strong>\u201cWe often react in a knee-jerk way,\u201d says Chand. Instead, when your mother says that maddening thing, step away. Take yourself off somewhere and take time to think about why it makes you feel as you do.</p> <p><strong>16. Aspire to an authentic relationship with her.</strong> \u201cWith mothers it\u2019s a relationship fraught with obligation and expectation, and there\u2019s the need for approval that we carry from childhood,\u201d says Chand. So it\u2019s a tough one, but the first step is being aware of what matters to you. And what helps you work that out is to\u2026</p> <p><strong>17. Call her when you want to, rather than out of obligation.</strong> \u201cI was stuck in a cycle of guilt and frustration, and feeling obliged to call her and meet up with her,\u201d says Chand. \u201cBut then I talked it through with her, and now I call her when I want to talk. It\u2019s got us out of a rut.\u201d</p> <p><strong>18. Talk to someone about her</strong><strong> \u2013 a friend, or </strong><strong>a therapist. </strong>\u201cDon\u2019t bottle up your feelings about your mother \u2013 share them with a person you trust,\u201d says Browne. It will help you work out what you feel, and why.</p> <p><strong>19. Be grateful for the small things. </strong>She looked after your kids when you were sick; she paid for your new cooker when your bank account was empty. \u201cOften at the time you\u2019re not properly grateful because you\u2019ve got so much else on your plate,\u201d says Wenban-Smith. \u201cBut later \u2013 maybe years later \u2013 it\u2019s good to acknowledge what a difference it made, and to thank her.\u201d</p> <p><strong>20. And the big ones. </strong>\u201cShe brought you into the world, made sacrifices for you. She\u2019s had her own crosses to bear and you\u2019ll never fully know what they were,\u201d says Samuel. \u201cNo one has the perfect mother, but she\u2019s the only one you\u2019ll ever have \u2013 and life is better if you can love her.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Rebecca Solnit is one of America\u2019s leading writers on art, culture and politics. She\u2019s been called \u201cthe voice of the resistance\u201d by the <em>New York Times,</em> and her 23 previous books include <em>Wanderlust,</em> <em>Hope </em><em>in </em><em>the Dark</em> and the 2008 essay Men Explain Things to Me, which gave rise to the term \u201cmansplaining\u201d. Her new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/recollections-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review\" title=\"\">Recollections of </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/recollections-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review\" title=\"\">My Non-Existence</a>,</em> is a memoir of her early life as a writer in San Francisco, where she has lived for four decades.</p> <p><strong>Your writing has always drawn on personal experience; why did you decide this was the time to write a proper memoir?</strong><br>I felt that after years and years of writing feminist essays about violence against women and the suppression of women\u2019s voices, there was something essential I hadn\u2019t gotten at yet, which is: what is the real psychological effect on you, even if you\u2019re not a victim of the very worst things that can happen, but you still live in a regime where violence against women is so common that it impacts you daily? I wanted to use myself as a case study to say, even as somebody who escaped the worst things that can happen to women, I was still so profoundly impacted and here\u2019s what it looked like.</p> <p><strong>You felt that the threat of male violence was so pervasive that at times you wanted to become invisible</strong><strong>: is that what the title is about?</strong><br>I think there\u2019s a dread and a constant presence in your imagination if you\u2019re a young woman, of: \u201cI can\u2019t wear this, I can\u2019t go here, I can\u2019t be out at this hour, I can\u2019t trust this person, I have to watch whether this will lead to something uncomfortable or dangerous.\u201d I wanted to connect that to the broader question of how this particular form of assault on women\u2019s agency and choice also takes place in other more polite arenas, like publishing. So it felt like this was a very particular story of how I found a voice, and also a very generic story of what it means to be a woman in a society that doesn\u2019t want women to have a voice.</p> <p><strong>Was it harder or more painful to write than your previous books?</strong><br>It wasn\u2019t the painfulness so much, it was more that it felt like a very artless book. And it felt ugly in a way, because I was talking about some of the worst things that had happened to me and my natural impulse is to want to give people something beautiful. It was interesting because this was so personal that it felt like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and whether it was any good.</p> <p><strong>You grew up with a family background of domestic violence but you don\u2019t talk about that in great detail here \u2013 why not?</strong><br>I feel that we as a culture have talked about domestic violence and there have been lots of memoirs of childhood abuse. It\u2019s not very interesting to me, in that I feel there\u2019s no new light to be shed. I feel like we haven\u2019t talked about what I really wanted to talk about in this book, which is this ambient threat of harassment, so I chose to begin it with me at 19.</p> <p><strong>Were you prepared for the way your essay </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/mansplaining-explained-expert-women\" title=\"\">Men Explain Things </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/mansplaining-explained-expert-women\" title=\"\">to Me</a></strong><strong> reached such a huge audience?</strong><br>Absolutely not. I had no idea it would resonate with so many people because that experience was so ordinary and so infuriating. More than infuriating, it was really interfering with women being able to testify to what happened in a personal situation, or being able to be respected in their professional capacity. In relating my own perception of a really common experience, I stumbled on something that was really significant in a lot of women\u2019s lives.</p> <p><strong>That piece went viral; do you feel that social media has been a force for good in giving people a voice?</strong><br>I\u2019ve never felt like I can weigh up the two sides. I think the people who own Google and Twitter and Facebook have chosen to violate our privacy, monetise our personal data, they\u2019ve chosen to tolerate propaganda, disinformation, corruption of elections. A lot of really good people have used these technologies for good, back to the Arab spring and Occupy Wall Street, but the people who own them and profit from them don\u2019t give a damn about human rights and democracy, or equality of voice and accuracy of information. There are so many reasons why Donald Trump is president but I think a large part of it is social media and the vulnerabilities they created for all sorts of forms of misinformation.</p> <p><strong>Your 2016 book </strong><em><strong>Hope </strong></em><em><strong>in </strong></em><em><strong>the Dark</strong></em><strong> gave encouragement to progressives during the Iraq war and again after the Trump election. Have you always been an optimist?</strong><br>I was a pretty depressed young person. I came to the idea of hope as an activist and a writer of history, seeing that things were better than we were often told, that actually ordinary people can have a great deal of power and often succeed in using it in ways that change the world for the better. I have to say the last few years have dampened my hopefulness a bit, not just because of runaway climate change and Donald Trump, but because the kind of collective madness that allowed Donald Trump to happen.</p> <p><strong>Your UK tour has been cancelled because of the pandemic. Are there writers or artists </strong><strong>whom you turn to when things are bleak</strong><strong>?</strong><br>There are specific writers and poets I find encouraging \u2013 I read Jack Gilbert, Robert Hass, Philip Levine. But I\u2019m also always looking out for what\u2019s happening around me that contains some sense of possibility, or where something positive is taking place. For example, how do we come together in mutual aid in a time of quarantine? But I was so looking forward to coming to the UK and I was agog at the idea of being in conversation with Mary Beard.

  "<p>New Jersey on Saturday <a href=\"v\">ordered its citizens</a> to stay at home meaning that almost one in four Americans are now under orders to only leave their residences to run essential errands and maintain a six-foot separation from others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-new-york-disaster-ventilators\">Covid-19: disaster declared in New York as fears grow over lack of ventilators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New Jersey joins New York, Connecticut, Illinois and California as states who have now asked residents to stay at their places of residence, representing about 85 million people out of a total US population of about 327 million.</p> <p>It is an unprecedented closure of vast parts of the country as the US seeks to get a grip on the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak and is dealing a devastating blow to the largest economy in the world by threatening millions of Americans with unemployment.</p> <p>It is also wreaking havoc on social and cultural life. Americans have shut themselves indoors and businesses, restaurants and cultural institutions like cinemas, theaters and sports events have come to a shuddering halt.</p> <p>New Jersey governor Phil Murphy signed an executive order for New Jerseyans to stay indoors. Murphy also ordered all gatherings to be canceled and that all non-essential retail businesses must indefinitely close their physical locations from tonight.</p> <p>\u201cLife in New Jersey does not have to come to a complete standstill. We want people to stay healthy, both physically and mentally,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf you head outside to take a walk or go for a run or go to the grocery store, please continue practicing social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>The directives come as an increasing number of states issue disaster declarations that allow for military to be called in and to gain access to more than $50bn in federal relief funds.</p> <p>Under the declarations, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) will be authorized to send its personnel and resources to set up mobile coronavirus testing centers, disinfect public facilities, and distribute medical supplies including face masks, gloves and surgical gowns.</p> <p>House-quarantining, or stay-at-home orders, are scheduled to take effect on Sunday evening in New York. The Army Corps of Engineers has said it plans to take over hotels, sports arenas, college dorms and other buildings to cope with the growing number or residents requiring medical care.</p> <p>Growing alarm over the fast spread of the virus in US population centers comes as the American Red Cross announced it is facing a shortage of blood donations drop by 150,000 as centers close across the US.</p> <p>The warning comes as researchers at Columbia University said even if the US cuts its rate of transmission in half, 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.</p> <p>The study is based on a New York Times database of known infections to model how <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-model-us-outbreak.html\" title=\"\">coronavirus transmission could </a>develop.</p> <p>Health authorities, meanwhile, have announced a worsening shortage of masks and gowns need by health workers as thousands flood hospitals and testing stations. Panic buying at supermarkets is accompanied by other efforts to stock up: gun shops in upstate New York and elsewhere have been flood with customers.</p> <p>In Illinois, Governor Jay Pritzker announced on Friday asked all 12 million residents to leave the house only when necessary, starting Saturday. The Connecticut order came on Friday also.</p> <p>Other orders have been issued at the city level.</p> <p>New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell issued a similar order, asking the city\u2019s 390,000 residents to go out for \u201ccritical needs only.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/business/coronavirus-trump-stock-market.html\" title=\"\">Wall Street ended its worst week</a> since the 2008 financial crisis with the Dow below where it stood on the day before Donald Trump was inaugurated.

  "<p>As the pop landscape becomes progressively bolder and more crowded, it becomes more difficult for any new artist to make an impact. The bandwidth is saturated. Billie Eilish is a hard act to follow; she has rewritten a lot of rules. \u201cAttitude\u201d is standard among R&amp;B singers, and is just as often a pose. Shock value depreciates. But on her debut album, the breakup-fuelled <em>Before Love Came </em><em>to Kill Us</em>, Toronto\u2019s R&amp;B star-in-waiting Jessie Reyez makes herself unforgettable pretty much from the word go.</p> <p>Her album, out on 27 March, opens with a toss of her mane. \u201cI should have fucked your friends, it would have been the best revenge,\u201d Reyez seethes \u2013 you can hear her eyes are narrowed. A little later in the song, Reyez imagines shooting that cheating ex. \u201cIf I blow your brains out I can guarantee that you\u2019d forget her, if I blow your brains out, I can kiss it better.\u201d</p> <p>All this is delivered in a swaggering, kittenish R&amp;B tone that catches and swoops \u2013 a voice that\u2019s not a million miles from singers like Kehlani or Ariana Grande, but distinctive enough to skewer at 100 paces. That first song, Do You Love Her, is the kind of track that might serve as the climax of most albums. Here, it\u2019s just how Reyez says hello.</p> <p>Throughout the course of 14 tracks, this 28-year-old singer, a second-generation Colombian-Canadian initially nurtured by Toronto\u2019s Remix Project incubator, cements the reputation she has established over a pair of EPs as a raw and heartfelt talent. Yes she can sing, but Reyez can also deliver lines that drip with character. Her out-of-the-ordinary credentials are best expressed by 2017\u2019s landmark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0G2TmuDjL8\" title=\"\">Gatekeeper</a>, a coruscating song about being propositioned by a record producer that prefigured the #MeToo tsunami, while a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi0Jgtg6SfI\" title=\"\">short film</a> dramatised the song\u2019s circumstances.</p> <p>But Reyez has a wicked sense of humour too. \u201cI dodge dick on the daily! I know it\u2019s funny but it\u2019s true,\u201d she sang on 2018\u2019s lilting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--YgtVuvWGo\" title=\"\">Body Count</a>, a song that took issue with slut-shaming.</p> <p>Body Count was about listing previous lovers. Reyez\u2019s full-length album is, by contrast, borderline homicidal, racking up another kind of body count. On Intruders, a deceptively mellow, bossa-nova-ish guitar track, Reyez imagines loading a weapon and killing again. On the striking <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjGCp1C9cY%0D\" title=\"\">Ankles</a>, where she measures her man\u2019s \u201cother bitches\u201d against herself (\u201cLevels? Ankles!\u201d), she\u2019d \u201ckill for a mute button in my head\u201d to tune out his open philandering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjGCp1C9cY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPjGCp1C9cY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjGCp1C9cY\">Watch the lyric video for Ankles by Jessie Reyez</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By the fourth track, Eminem is throwing down a strong verse on a doo-wop song called Coffin, and Reyez is getting, if anything, even more emo. \u201cI\u2019d rather a coffin hand-made for two, cos I love you to death,\u201d she sings. (The album cover art features that very coffin made for two.) Eminem originally sought Reyez for an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-TkrWpO75k\" title=\"\">appearance on his 2018 album, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-TkrWpO75k\" title=\"\">Kamikaze</a></em>. Another fairy godmother in Reyez\u2019s grind-to-grandeur tale was Calvin Harris, who catapulted Reyez to a massive audience with a rare sweet-natured tune, 2018\u2019s Hard to Love.</p> <p>The remainder of these largely excellent 14 songs pay close attention to everything that has happened in the past few years of pop: Ariana Grande\u2019s radical candour, the entertainingly foul mouth of Cardi B, the Latin pop boom, the so-wrong-they\u2019re-right soundbeds made for Billie Eilish by her producer brother Finneas. (Reyez was scheduled to open on Eilish\u2019s world tour).</p> <p>But there is no sense that Reyez is making anything other than her own record, serving the tired trope of heartbreak up in a most engaging way. One song, La Memoria, is sung entirely in Spanish but doesn\u2019t sound anything like Camila Cabello, with Reyez referring to herself as \u201cuna perra\u201d (a bitch).</p> <p>The magnificently furious Deaf, by contrast, is virtually rapped, throwing all sorts of sonic detritus around a production that the Eilish siblings would appreciate. Reyez herself snarls, pouts and sings the sort-of hook \u2013 \u201cI never listen, no, I never listen, so, I never hear yo\u2019 ass anyway\u201d \u2013 in a way that Cardi B might envy.</p> <p>A few choices puzzle. The album closes with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxLUj1Mrars\" title=\"\">Figures</a>, a track that dates from long-ago 2016. It suits the thematic suite of breakup songs that constitute <em>Before Love Came </em><em>to Kill Us</em>. But crazily, the album doesn\u2019t have room for No Sweat, an all-out feminist party banger that came out in January disguised as a Secret <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200103005056/en/Secret-Deodorant-Casts-Power-Line-Up-New-%E2%80%9CAll\" title=\"\">deodorant advert</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOYj7WfJQD8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uOYj7WfJQD8?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOYj7WfJQD8\">Watch the video for Imported</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There are so many good tracks on here \u2013 the breezy trap-pop of Roof, in which Reyez declares: \u201cI might be petite but I\u2019m a fucking monster\u201d; the hyper-processed bop that is Dope, the co-sign with Atlanta-based rapper 6lack, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOYj7WfJQD8\" title=\"\">Imported</a>, which finds two artists contemplating <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUaIVc7mULg\" title=\"\">\u201cgetting over\u201d someone by \u201cgetting under\u201d someone else</a> \u2013 that you want to say there is not a bad track on this outrageously fine pop record.</p> <p>But there is. Love in the Dark is a flaccid ballad, the most anodyne and conventional tune Reyez has done by far. It features by-numbers piano chords, namby-pamby violins and a soaring nice-lady vocal that almost undoes all the powerful work Reyez has done thus far.

  "<p><strong>My kids watch </strong>my old pop videos and say, \u201cNow you\u2019re 45, you\u2019ll have to keep your clothes on.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cIn the next one, I\u2019m going to have five male models and wear less!\u201d They think it\u2019s disgusting. My 15-year-old refuses to tell me what his friends say. He\u2019s very protective. He\u2019s begun to play the role of my husband.</p> <p><strong>I didn\u2019t come</strong> from a privileged background. I came from a one-parent family in Lewisham with my mum. I won a scholarship to stage school and fell into Eternal. Suddenly we were selling millions of records, touring the world, and I was just miserable. Everyone thinks it\u2019s all showbiz parties, but I was 20, sitting in hotel rooms on my own. All I knew was that I couldn\u2019t carry on being so unhappy and homesick. My passion for singing and music was dying. So I left.</p> <p><strong>I had no idea </strong>who Jamie [Redknapp] was when I met him. A few weeks later, I was watching England on TV and I said to my friends: \u201cI know that guy! He asked me out!\u201d They said: \u201cDon\u2019t you know who he is?\u201d I just thought every man you meet says they play football.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m the shabbiest mum</strong> on the school run. When I\u2019m not working, I love not making an effort. So I turn up in tracksuit bottoms and an over-sized sweatshirt, my hair in a pony.</p> <p><strong>I was well aware </strong>it wasn\u2019t true when I was voted Sexiest Woman of the Decade by <em>FHM</em>. Thank God they don\u2019t still do polls like that. Do you think my 15-year-old would allow me to put my old <em>FHM</em> covers on the wall? No. They\u2019re all in a box in the garage.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m tired of </strong>getting asked about <em>Strictly</em>. It was years ago. I do think it\u2019s a weird programme \u2013 it\u2019s all-engulfing, and I hate the circus that comes with it. But I don\u2019t regret it. I think it was good for me on a personal level, getting back out there and working.</p> <p><strong>Some days, </strong>fame is great. I\u2019ve made a new album. How great is that? If people weren\u2019t interested, I wouldn\u2019t be doing what I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m still doing what I love. But other days, it\u2019s really tough. You don\u2019t feel like wanting to defend yourself and your choices.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m quite private,</strong> but I suppose I come with quite a lot of baggage. Any future boyfriend is going to get their life pulled apart. I think it would take someone pretty strong and together. I\u2019d love for no one to ask me about divorce and my relationships. It\u2019s just unrealistic.</p> <p><em>Louise Redknapp is on tour and this week plays Glasgow, Newcastle and Cambridge, finishing in London at the Shepherds Bush Empire</em><em> (</em><a href=\"https://louiseofficial.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>louiseofficial.co.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p>",

However, for people experiencing domestic violence, social distancing means being trapped inside with an abuser. As more cities go under lockdown, activists are worried that attempts to curb the coronavirus will inadvertently lead to an increase in domestic violence.</p> <p>Domestic violence is already a deadly epidemic. One in three women around the world experience physical or sexual violence, mostly from an intimate partner, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/violence-against-women\">according to the World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/violence-against-women\">zation</a> (WHO). As the WHO notes: \u201cThis makes it the most widespread, but among the least reported human rights abuses.\u201d Gender-based violence tends to increase during humanitarian emergencies and conflicts; \u201cwomen\u2019s bodies too often become battlefields\u201d.</p> <p>Reports from China suggest the coronavirus has already caused a significant spike in domestic violence. Local police stations saw a threefold increase in cases reported in February compared with the previous year, according to Wan Fei, the founder of an anti-domestic violence not-forprofit. \u201cAccording to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence are related to the Covid-19 epidemic,\u201d Wan <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005253/domestic-violence-cases-surge-during-covid-19-epidemic\">told Sixth Tone</a>, an English-language magazine based in China.</p> <p>A similar story is playing out in America. A <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/03/calls-to-oregons-domestic-violence-crisis-lines-spike-amid-coronavirus-crisis.html\">domestic violence hotline in Portland, Oregon</a>, says calls doubled last week. And the national domestic violence hotline is hearing from a growing number of callers whose abusers are using Covid-19 to further control and isolate them. \u201cPerpetrators are threatening to throw their victims out on the street so they get sick,\u201d the hotline\u2019s CEO <a href=\"https://time.com/5803887/coronavirus-domestic-violence-victims/\">told Time</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of some withholding financial resources or medical assistance.\u201d</p> <p>With all attention focused on curbing a public health crisis, the problem of private violence risks being overlooked or deprioritized by authorities. In the UK, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/key-worker-official-list-of-uk-personnel-who-can-still-send-children-to-school\">schools are now closed</a> to everyone except for the children of key workers performing essential services. Domestic violence professionals have been left off this list; apparently preventing abuse at home isn\u2019t an essential service. Dawn Butler, Labour\u2019s women and equalities spokeswoman, has asked the prime minister to \u201curgently reconsider\u201d this classification and consider implementing emergency funding to help people in danger escape domestic abuse during the crisis. \u201c[T]wo women are killed every week by a partner or former partner,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DawnButlerBrent/status/1240997135073652736?s=20\">Butler tweeted</a>. \u201cIf the Govt fails to prepare and plan more people will die.\u201d</p> <p>Now more than ever we need to look out for the most vulnerable in our society; activists are <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-fears-of-domestic-violence-child-abuse-rise/a-52847759\">calling on neighbors</a> to be extra aware and vigilant of possible cases of domestic violence. Retreating into our homes doesn\u2019t mean cutting ourselves off from our communities. We\u2019re all in this together.</p> <h2>Harvey Weinstein begins his 23-year sentence</h2> <p>The convicted rapist was transferred to a maximum-security prison in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/harvey-weinstein-new-york-state-prison-maximum-s\">New York on Wednesday</a>.

  "<p>In many ways, Fennville, Michigan, represents the changing face of rural America. The small coffee shop, antique mall and mechanic in its quaint, four-block downtown are neighbors with a tortilla factory and Mexican supermarket. A mix of Hispanic and white people went about their business on a recent afternoon.</p> <p>Just outside of town, several churches offer service in Spanish. The community center has soccer fields to go with its basketball courts. The school district developed a program to accommodate the children of hundreds of Mexican migrant workers who earn their keep in the corn, soybean and blueberry fields surrounding Fennville.</p> <p>It\u2019s a picture of integration that\u2019s essential to America\u2019s agricultural industry, but Fennville\u2019s story also includes a darker part of the larger narrative.</p> <p>The seemingly benign appointment of Morgan Bolles to the Fennville city commission in December exploded in controversy when days later it was revealed the 32-year-old is part of the Proud Boys, a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys\">hate group</a> whose nationalistic members have pushed anti-immigrant views.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/america-far-right-coronavirus-outbreak-trump-alex-jones\">Disinformation and scapegoating: how America's far right is responding to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bolles didn\u2019t disclose his affiliation with the Proud Boys ahead of the appointment, and Fennville\u2019s commissioners say they were duped. In the intense and emotional discussion that followed, a picture of a racially divided town emerged. Many view Bolles\u2019s presence as a stain on the Hispanic-majority city of about 1,800 in western Michigan. Many others support him.</p> <p>Fennville\u2019s Hispanic residents account for about 51% of the city\u2019s population, and they are left to figure out how to respond to having a Proud Boy on the governing body. Those who spoke with the Guardian, however, say they are not afraid or angry. They are vigilant and watching, and they are also unsurprised.</p> <p>\u201cRacism is part of America \u2013 it\u2019s just who we are,\u201d said Sergio Reyes, a Fennville resident who moved to the US from Mexico about 40 years ago and describes himself as \u201cAmerican to the bone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good is that we know him, this is all out in the open, and you got people like myself who are willing to speak up on the problem,\u201d Reyes added. \u201cIf he does something racist in the open, now we can deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>Several Hispanic employees of a Fennville business who declined to give their name echoed that sentiment.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s America,\u201d one said. Another added that they were not particularly concerned as long as Bolles (pronounced \u201cbowls\u201d) wasn\u2019t pushing his views on the commission. \u201cWe just have to keep working and making a better life and not let it affect us.\u201d</p> <p>Fennville\u2019s Hispanic population grew in recent decades as migrants arrived for jobs in nearby fields, as well as those at a large facility owned by the food processing giant ConAgra.

One shows Bolles flashing the \u201cOK\u201d symbol with his hand, which is a gesture used to convey support for white supremacy. Another shows Bolles in a T-shirt with a <a href=\"https://www.hollandsentinel.com/news/20191209/new-fennville-commissioner-defends-controversial-shirt\">picture</a> of a limp-wristed Che Guevara above the words \u201cSocialism Is For F-gs\u201d.

Fennville\u2019s city commissioner, Jim Hayden, said he \u201cfelt terrible\u201d when he learned of Bolles\u2019s membership . He and other commissioners said they were deceived by Bolles, who didn\u2019t mention the Proud Boys affiliation in interviews or his application.</p> <p>Bolles has previously said he didn\u2019t offer the information because no one asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just childish to say \u2018Nobody asked me\u2019,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cIf you have honor, dignity, respect and care about the job, then you tell the people interviewing you \u2018I\u2019ve got some things to tell you about\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Bolles isn\u2019t alone in his political ambitions on the far right. Though there\u2019s no clear data available on how many far-right extremists are running for local offices around the country, anecdotal evidence suggests more are doing so, said Cassie Miller, a research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p> <p>Leaked chats from the white nationalist group White Evropa showed the group\u2019s leadership <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/the-leaked-chats-that-show-how-a-far-right-group-is-try-1833068732\">urging its members</a> to infiltrate the GOP and run for local office, and at least eight white nationalists <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/at-least-8-white-nationalists-running-for-state-or-federal-office-1245779011829\">ran for state office</a> in 2018.</p> <p>Another was appointed precinct captain for the Republican party in Washington, while Matt Shea, a Washington state representative, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/03/matt-shea-washington-republican-biblical-basis-for-war\">has said</a> that males who support abortion and same-sex marriage should be killed. He was later found to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/20/matt-shea-rightwing-messages-chat-records\">planning</a> surveillance of and violence against perceived political enemies on the left, and has been labeled a domestic terrorist in a report by independent investigators commissioned by the Washington legislature.</p> <p>\u201cAnecdotally, we\u2019re seeing more extremist candidates running for office who are galvanized by Trump\u2019s rhetoric and use his model \u2013 if you vilify immigrants and Muslims, that will rile up people and get them to vote, so we\u2019re seeing more people parroting him,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe model of the organized right has been to get people in at the local level and move up the ranks.\u201d</p> <p>Fennville\u2019s city charter and state law doesn\u2019t offer any remedy except a recall, and that process can\u2019t be started for a year. Bolles\u2019s appointment is for two years, so it\u2019s likely that he will serve the term and voters can decide his fate in November 2021, Hayden said.</p> <p>It\u2019s also unclear that a recall would be successful. Many citizens on social media and in public meetings expressed a \u201cgive him a chance\u201d attitude. Reyes said that was \u201cproblematic\u201d and questioned if those residents would feel the same if a Latin Kings gang member were appointed to the commission.</p> <p>In the meantime, Bolles is helping make decisions about the minutiae that are part of running a small town. Fennville will soon need to replace its aerator, and it\u2019s considering selling a city-owned building to a medical marijuana company. At a recent meeting, Bolles suggested the city consider live-streaming commission meetings as a measure to promote open government.</p> <p>Though Fennville\u2019s Latino population isn\u2019t regularly politically active, it can be mobilized when there\u2019s an issue that affects it, and Bolles is one of those, Reyes said. He expects that Fennville will \u201cget him out\u201d of office in 2021.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a silver lining to the controversy, it\u2019s that residents have gotten to know each other as they discuss it, Reyes said, and that\u2019s \u201cthe only way that racism goes away\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten people together because we don\u2019t want that in our town, we have to live with each other, and we have to learn that we aren\u2019t bad people, \u201c he said.</p>",
  "<p>Before there was ever Serena Williams, there was Venus. These days it can be easy to forget that, removed as we are 12 years from Venus\u2019s seventh and last slam triumph, at Wimbledon in 2008. As Serena has risen from star to cultural icon, Venus continues to compete but she is nearly 40 now. She is almost at her end.<br><br>Fifteen years ago, many concluded she was already there. Venus arrived at Wimbledon in 2005 having suffered the embarrassment of being outplayed at Roland Garros by a 15-year-old from Bulgaria named Sesil Karatantcheva. The American had tumbled from the top 10. She was struggling. People argued her outside interests were eating her game from within, pointing out she had reached her first slam final aged only 17. Perhaps it made sense she was done at 25.<br><br>After starting timidly at Wimbledon, Williams\u2019s level hit the stratosphere. She marched to the final by sidestepping the defending champion, Maria Sharapova, in a loud, combative, unforgettable classic. At the final hurdle stood the world No 1, Lindsay Davenport, perhaps the cleanest ball-striker the sport has ever seen. As the contest unfolded, Davenport took control, easily matching her opponent\u2019s power and with added, vicious precision. Davenport served for the title at 6-4, 6-5.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"My favourite game\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">My favourite game</a> </figure>  <p><br><br>Of all the predictions Richard Williams made about his daughters, his most perceptive one came before Serena\u2019s emergence, when Venus broke into her stride as a precocious teenager. As the tennis world was floored by the years of insufferable hype actually coming true, he calmly pointed out that Venus\u2019s younger sister was \u201cmeaner\u201d and so she would be greater.<br><br>Venus\u2019s killer instinct was frequently lacking, but something different stirred in her that day at Wimbledon. A game from defeat, she responded with three winners in a row before breaking to love, then stealing the set with a resolute 7-4 tie-break.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e867a786d39cbee2a94e9cbd499c0822774ebc6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e867a786d39cbee2a94e9cbd499c0822774ebc6d/0_270_2367_2955/801.jpg\" alt=\"Venus Williams jumps for joy\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venus Williams jumps for joy after completing victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Davenport broke in the third set, Williams broke back. But the writing finally seemed to be on the wall as Williams double-faulted at 5-4, 30-30 to stand a point from defeat. Instead, she stepped up to the baseline and crunched a full-blooded backhand down-the-line winner, baring her teeth as she scuppered the championship point before marching back into the match and surviving after two hours and 46 minutes to win 4-6, 7-6 (4), 9-7.<br><br>When I think of this match, I think of the breathless quality and tension between two giants of the game and the continued hallucinatory sight of a black woman from Compton stepping on to the lawns of the most exclusive club in the sport and making it her own. But most of all, I think of Williams\u2019s reaction: the way the camera slowly zoomed in on her disbelieving face, then her jumping into the air tens of times, falling to her knees and screaming to the skies. The way she just could not believe she was back and she had won again.</p> <p>Venus was a barrier-breaker, and so she could never show too much of her emotions. She always had to be stoic and she used her swagger to shield herself from vulnerability. After falling from the top of the game and the world counting her out, this was the moment she finally showed how she really felt.<br><br>Hindsight has shone an even greater light on this contest. Most players spend the day before a slam final embedded in the routines that drove them to that position. Williams spent her Friday afternoon meeting with the suits of Wimbledon behind closed doors and pushing them to finally adopt equal prize money.<br><br>Like Billie Jean King before her, she recognised she could use her stature to push hard for change. A year later, she penned an article for the Times entitled \u201cWimbledon has sent me a message: I\u2019m only a second-class champion\u201d. Wimbledon finally announced equal prize money in 2007; Williams returned that year and won it all again.</p>",

Fundamentally, nothing at all should be decided in the context of Ryder Cup selection more than six months in advance of an event due to tee off on 25 September. In these uncertain times, however, we have swiftly become accustomed to pondering imponderables.</p> <p>Ryder Cup organisers were quick to dismiss a midweek report that cited potential postponement until 2021 of the biennial joust. There are a litany of reasons as to why this would not be favourable, including the knock-on effect on the Solheim Cup and the absence of a Ryder Cup in Europe until 2023.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/16/us-pga-championship-masters-postponed-golf\">Golf's US PGA Championship follows Masters in being postponed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, it would be a brave individual to rule out upheaval for the Ryder Cup proving necessary, as global sporting events drop from the schedules daily.</p> <p>The Ryder Cup implemented a switch from odd years to even ones in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 atrocity in 2001, which took place less than three weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/sep/17/golf.theguardian\">before Europe were due to play host</a> at the Belfry. As of now, the golf world can only hope that Whistling Straits will stage their show on schedule.</p> <p>The wildcard picks element grabs the most attention of each respective captaincy. Padraig Harrington has three for Europe. Steve Stricker, who heads the US side, will make four. These calls to supplement teams can define captaincies and Ryder Cup careers. They have done for decades.</p> <p>If the European Tour and the PGA of America remain adamant Project 2021 is not on their agenda, it can be guaranteed the compilation of teams for 2020 has been. It would add excitement, pressure and drama should the Ryder Cup reach the enforced scenario where Harrington and Stricker have to select 12 players each.

On the basis of golf being limited, picking an entire quota of Ryder Cup players would become the ultimate captaincy test. Youth or experience? Captaincy instinct or feel?

The choices would be endless, the public \u2013 doubtless grasping every piece of sporting theatre they can catch sight of \u2013 captivated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/masters-golf-tournament-becomes-the-latest-event-to-be-postponed-augusta-coronavirus\">Autumn Masters in Augusta\u2019s sights after coronavirus forces postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harrington has spoken about the necessary balance between Ryder Cup veterans and debutants. \u201cWe won\u2019t be going in with 12 rookies,\u201d said the three-times major winner. \u201cBut you want a nice mixture because the rookies have really made it for Europe over the years. Those are the guys that come out and they shine. I\u2019m hoping for a nice balance on the team.\u201d</p> <p>Automatic qualifying can, in fact, skew the balance Harrington desires. So can the enhanced points that are available through the European Tour\u2019s Rolex Series, where routinely the continent\u2019s best golfers do not appear.</p> <p>Through horrible reality rather than design, the Ryder Cup has the power to deliver something both fresh and fascinating. It would also take the Ryder Cup back to its roots.</p> <p>In the early days, starting at Gleneagles in 1921, teams were entirely selected, initially by committee. Performance-based qualification emerged later, with the merging of the two concepts actually in place only since 1989.</p> <p>The alternatives are rather dreary. The US and Europe could, say, choose the highest placed players in the world rankings, with or without wildcards. Yet that system was officially \u201cpaused until further notice with professional golf currently inactive\u201d on Friday. Even if the Masters, US PGA Championship and even some of the other competitions on the PGA and European Tours are rescheduled to the point where the rankings could materially affect the Ryder Cup, there is the obvious chance of distortion. Applying world rankings without any major being played would also undermine any such policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f542f4001743b9ea4b94f31d46ce1159ea8c872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f542f4001743b9ea4b94f31d46ce1159ea8c872/295_636_4390_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Bj\u00f8rn lifts the Ryder Cup after Europe\u2019s victory at Le Golf National on 30 September 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Bj\u00f8rn lifts the Ryder Cup after Europe\u2019s victory at Le Golf National on 30 September 2018.

If a qualification process is butchered less than halfway through, or restarted at the last minute, it loses all validity.</p> <p>One caveat relates specifically to the European Tour, which has rules in place to essentially hold players to their home continent by featuring in a designated number of tournaments, thereby earning Ryder Cup eligibility. Otherwise, given the riches on offer, it is not inconceivable the leading lights would spend their entire schedules on the PGA Tour.</p> <p>Protection of the European Tour is admirable and Harrington is wise enough to acknowledge that, but in this case we are edging towards a position where player appearances are going to be so limited that they are irrelevant in discussion of the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>\u201cSeptember is a long way off,\u201d said Harrington. That\u2019s true, but it will not douse speculation. Having to hand-pick 12 players to control his Ryder Cup destiny would fill the Irishman\u2019s time. It would add sparkle to further engage an eager golfing public. Give Stricker and Harrington a dozen blank cards \u2013 let us see the purest form of captaincy.</p>",

By early afternoon, emerging scientific evidence made crisis planners believe it had to be a nationwide shutdown. </p> \n<p>Johnson said that with the agreement of the three devolved governments, \u201cwe are telling \u2013 telling \u2013 cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight, as soon as they reasonably can, and not open tomorrow\u201d. They would be allowed to sell takeaway food and drink, he added.</p> \n<p>The same instruction was being given to nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres, Johnson added. The new social distancing measures would be reviewed every month to see if any could be relaxed.</p> \n<p>The announcement came at 5pm, just as hundreds of thousands of people were enjoying post-work pints. Some pubs said they would close \u2013 but others showed no signs of heeding the instruction. </p> \n<p>Police who may have been expected to enforce a ban backed by law, merely said there would remind any businesses staying open of what the government had wanted.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, representing all forces in England and Wales, said: \u201cWe expect business owners will want to support the measures designed keep us all safe.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will police as normal. If officers see specified businesses open, they will remind them of the government advice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government is not planning to take specific action to enforce the closures initially, believing a direct instruction from the prime minister should be enough to convince almost all venues to shut their doors.</p> \n<p>But ministers are prepared to take more action next week through a crackdown on licensing conditions, if necessary.</p> \n<p>Johnson said the scientific advice suggested a 75% compliance rate with the social distancing measures was necessary to achieve the desired effect. He praised everyone who had heeded the government\u2019s advice but conceded not enough people had done so thus far.</p> \n<p>The UK death toll from coronavirus rose on Friday to 177, from 144 the previous day, with nearly 4,000 people testing positive.</p> \n<p>Johnson, addressing the daily Downing Street press conference, was flanked by Sunak, who said funds would be available to pay 80% of workers\u2019 wages up to a value of \u00a32,500 a month, and thereby prevent firms from having to make staff redundant.</p> \n<p>Since Monday\u2019s announcement, even many Conservative MPs, including the former business secretary Greg Clark, had complained that many companies had little choice but to lay off thousands of staff as their business dried up overnight.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Sunak announced a big-ticket package of loans and other business support measures, including \u00a3330m of taxpayer-backed loans, but Clark and others complained that they gave little disincentive for firms to lay off workers.</p> \n<p>Friday\u2019s announcement, which was negotiated with business groups and trades unions, and included increases in universal credit and other benefits, marked the third multibillion-pound financial commitment the chancellor has made in 10 days.</p> \n<p>The pubs closure appeared to be the latest example of the government scrambling to catch up with events. A ban on mass gatherings was announced last Friday after scores of fixtures and concerts had been cancelled; and nationwide schools closures were confirmed on Wednesday, after thousands of teachers and students had already taken the decision to remain at home.</p> \n<p>The shutdown of social venues had been expected to cover only London, and the fear of a \u201clockdown\u201d appears to have been fuelling panic-buying of food and other commodities in the capital.

  "<p>At the final debate of the Democratic presidential primary on Sunday, Senator Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden clashed on the coronavirus. Sanders <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2003/15/se.03.html\">contended</a> the pandemic laid bare \u201cthe incredible weakness and dysfunctionality\u201d of the US healthcare system, and called for single-payer reform. Biden countered that Italy\u2019s universal system had failed to protect the Mediterranean nation, and asserted that Covid-19 \u201chas nothing to do with Bernie\u2019s Medicare for All\u201d. At first glance, the ex-vice-president seems right: of course single-payer can\u2019t close the door to a novel virus, any more than it can forestall a deadly earthquake or fend off a zombie apocalypse. Nonetheless, a national health program with unified financing and governance \u2013 basically the opposite of what we have in America today \u2013 is a powerful tool in a health crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-italy-lessons-countries-crisis-information\">Coronavirus has taught Italy hard lessons. Other countries must learn from us | Maurizio Molinari</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The debate over Medicare for All in the age of Covid-19 is complicated by the fact that it is our public health agencies \u2013 and not the medical care system \u2013 that serve as our first line of defense against novel epidemics. In that regard, we\u2019ve shot ourselves in the foot with a 12-gauge shotgun: <a href=\"https://www.modernhealthcare.com/government/report-public-health-funding-falls-despite-increasing-threats\">year after year of underfunding of</a> our <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695931/?holding=hulib\">federal, state</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695931/?holding=hulib\"> and local public health agencies</a> has left us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/trump-sees-the-coronavirus-as-a-threat-to-his-self-interest-not-to-people\">ill-prepared</a> for the Covid-19 challenge (as evidenced by the testing fiasco). How we finance medical care, however, is also critical. On the most basic level, containing the coronavirus will require those infected to seek medical care, so that they can be diagnosed and isolated. Fear of devastating ER or hospital bills, however, could keep some home \u2013 or at work. As a Taiwan government spokeswoman, lauding her country\u2019s single-payer system for its successful containment of Covid-19, told <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/what-taiwan-can-teach-world-fighting-coronavirus-n1153826\">NBC News</a>, \u201cTaiwan\u2019s health insurance lets everyone not be afraid to go to the hospital. If you suspect you have coronavirus, you won\u2019t have to worry that you can\u2019t afford the hospital visit to get tested.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Trump signed into law a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818322136/heres-what-is-in-the-families-first-coronavirus-aid-package-trump-approved\">bill</a> that would make Covid-19 testing \u2013 but not treatment \u2013 free. It\u2019s hence inadequate, given the predicted looming surge in hospitalizations from Covid-19 pneumonia. After all, 30 million Americans are uninsured \u2013 a number that will surely grow as the economy tanks and millions or tens of millions of Americans lose their jobs. Even more are underinsured, and for these individuals, co-pays and deductibles will only become more unaffordable as disposable income falls and savings dwindle. For both groups, medical bills for an intensive care unit (ICU) stay for Covid-19 could be devastating. People, of course, will also not stop having heart attacks, cancer or traffic accidents during this outbreak \u2013 on the contrary, medical needs are likely to rise in the face of a recession, as unemployment and misery takes its toll on the nation\u2019s health. Financial ruin from medical costs \u2013 whether it stems from Covid-19 pneumonia or the looming Covid-19 recession \u2013 is financial ruin all the same, and will compound the harm of the epidemic.</p> <p>But there\u2019s more to it than that. We need single-payer not only to protect us from healthcare costs, but to transform our healthcare infrastructure. In recent weeks, you may have heard that the US, despite our high healthcare spending, has fewer hospital beds per capita than many other wealthy nations. You may have also heard in recent years about an epidemic of hospital closures in poorly served rural areas, or the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hahnemann-hospital-medicare-for-all/\">2019 closure</a> of a major academic safety-net hospital in Philadelphia. These hospitals closed not because they are unneeded, but because they are unprofitable. For the American hospital landscape is shaped by market forces, which largely determine where hospitals grow and where they wane.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Healthcare in America is uncoordinated \u2013 and ungoverned</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, while our hospital bed supply is relatively low, our ICU bed supply per capita is among the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777516\">highest in the world</a>. Yet those beds aren\u2019t necessarily where they need to be: a 2010 study in the Journal of American Medical Association, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20388892\">for instance</a>, found large regional disparities in the distribution of ICU beds; the researchers concluded that in the face of a major epidemic, some areas might have empty beds, while others would have too few. Again, this distribution, far too often, is driven by market logic \u2013 not health needs.</p> <p>Finally, healthcare in America is uncoordinated \u2013 and ungoverned. Since the epidemic\u2019s onset, hospital and city and state governments have waged \u201cbidding wars\u201d over crucial supplies and ventilators, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/war-crononavirus-trump-production.html\">noted</a>. It\u2019s every hospital for itself: some are resorting to <a href=\"https://komonews.com/news/coronavirus/seattle-childrens-hospital-asking-community-for-medical-mask-donations\">pleas to the community</a> for donations of masks; presumably, others are well-stocked \u2013 but who knows? \u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves,\u201d Trump suggested to state governors on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html\">quoted</a> by the New York Times. This is not a healthcare system \u2013 it is atomized chaos. For again, in the American way of paying for healthcare, our hospitals (or increasingly, our multi-hospital systems) are silos, some rich and some poor, each fending for themselves, locked in market competition.</p> <p>This is neither necessary nor rational, leading both to excess and shortfalls, to generous overall health system funding yet care that remains unaffordable for many. A single-payer national health program would allow us to move past the market-driven status quo to remake this chaotic healthcare landscape of simultaneous healthcare plenty and poverty. It would, in short, allow us to begin to plan \u2013 not merely for this epidemic, but for the one that follows.</p> <ul> <li><p>Adam Gaffney is an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a pulmonary and critical care doctor at the Cambridge Health Alliance.

  "<p>\u201cOh my God, look at you!\u201d Tyra Banks shouts from down the hallway. I\u2019m in the supermodel-turned-supermogul\u2019s office in Santa Monica, but I\u2019d been so distracted (looking at my phone, mortifyingly) that I hadn\u2019t noticed her approach. \u201cYou\u2019re like this!\u201d she hoots, imitating my exhausted jetlagged stance by assuming the pose of a marionette whose puppeteer has let go of the strings.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, being mocked by one of the world\u2019s most famous supermodels would feel close to bullying. But Banks \u2013 as she always does on her hugely successful TV show, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363307/\" title=\"\">America\u2019s Next Top Model</a> \u2013 makes herself the joke, tripping over (\u201cWhoops!\u201d) and commiserating about our mutual fatigue. \u201cI\u2019m like, just give me some snacks, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d she cackles. She\u2019s wearing a blazer over a dark T-shirt, a necklace with a big B dangling from it, dark trousers and boots. Her hair is long and auburn, and when I tell her how much I like the colour she makes a hearty laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s a wig! Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d We walk into a boardroom and sit opposite one another. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel very intimate,\u201d she says regretfully. In person, Banks exudes less of the uber-confident, camp big sister vibe that has made her such an endearing TV presenter, and is more like an eager-to-please friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6662e55e0ffe9b5a35990193b3fafd4e0a28a1ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6662e55e0ffe9b5a35990193b3fafd4e0a28a1ce/0_0_1999_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks, Linda Evangelista, George Michael and Eva Herzigova, Beverly Peele pose during the \u201cToo Funky\u201d video shoot circa 1992 in Paris, France.

But Banks really was one \u2013 and back in the 1990s, too, when the term had actual heft. Hell, she was even in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ2DVwSVIIo\" title=\"\">George Michael\u2019s Too Funky video</a>, alongside Linda Evangelista and Nadja Auermann, and you can\u2019t get more supermodel (or 1990s) than that. She had a long contract with Victoria\u2019s Secret and was, most famously, the first black woman to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s Swimsuit Issue and GQ. But Banks never saw any of that as the end goal.</p> <p>\u201cPlan for the end at the beginning,\u201d she tells me, solemnly. (Banks often talks in platitudes on America\u2019s Next Top Model \u2013 \u201cNever dull your shine for someone else\u201d; \u201cYour flaws are awesome: that\u2019s why they\u2019re flawsome\u201d \u2013 and this is no mere onscreen shtick.) She learned this particular slogan from her mother, Carolyn London. London, who accompanied her then teenage daughter on most of her fashion jobs, would point to the other models and say, \u201cLook around. Where\u2019s so-and-so? She was hot everywhere last year, and now? No one cares about her. That\u2019s gonna be you one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I would think, oh my God, that\u2019s so evil!\u201d says Banks. \u201cBut then I started to book less and less fashion shows and she\u2019d say, \u2018You see? But it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s your product, and now they\u2019re looking for a different product. So you can either figure out how to strategise and improve, or you can become a new product.\u2019\u201d (Perhaps the reason the rest of us don\u2019t have $90m in the bank, as Banks allegedly does, is because our mothers never taught us to strategise our product when we were young.)</p> <p>Banks strategised and lifted herself out of the cul-de-sac of modelling and on to the expansive global stage of celebrity, via the medium of TV. She hosted her own chatshow, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437758/\" title=\"\">The Tyra Banks Show</a> (five seasons, six Emmys, from 2005 to 2010), which sparked endless \u201cThe Next Oprah\u201d headlines. And, of course, she made America\u2019s Next Top Model (24 seasons and counting), the talent contest which she coined, produces and hosts, and which introduced the world to modelling tricks such as \u201csmize\u201d (smile with just your eyes) and \u201cbooty tooch\u201d (sticking your butt out). There was also an extremely brief pop career, which Banks describes, not entirely incorrectly, as \u201ca hot mess\u2026 I realised my gift was not my singing voice, but my talking voice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd0b5ec76466fa5793278a7f9638995e4ca4b357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0b5ec76466fa5793278a7f9638995e4ca4b357/0_725_5778_5711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with young model Scout Kingston,  photographed in Los Angeles, CA, Feb 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"988\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyra Banks wears <a href=\"https://www.houseofcb.com/\">House of CB</a> top, Vex skirt, <a href=\"https://www.sararose.shop/\">Sara Rose</a> mask and (top) <a href=\"https://www.balenciaga.com/gb#/women\">Balenciaga</a> outfit.

But some have pointed out that it hasn\u2019t, actually, produced any top models. Banks dismisses this, insisting that many former contestants are now appearing in fashion shows and, anyway, her \u201cgirls\u201d have had to overcome the industry\u2019s initial snobbery against reality TV. \u201cSo thank God for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner\" title=\"\">Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gigi-hadid\" title=\"\">Gigi Hadid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/bella-hadid\" title=\"\">Bella Hadid</a>, and all the other girls who came from reality television shows, because they\u2019ve now made it OK,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As with Heidi Klum \u2013 another model turned omnipresent TV star and judge of America\u2019s Got Talent \u2013 there is now a generation that has known Banks only as a TV celebrity, and that delights her: \u201cThank God they know me as more than just being a mannequin,\u201d she grins. But <a href=\"https://tyra.com/modelland/\" title=\"\">ModelLand</a>, her latest venture \u2013 currently on hold until the Covid-19 crisis has passed \u2013 is what she hopes will be her real legacy. \u201cI look at Walt Disney and what he\u2019s done with Disneyland and how it continues for ever and ever. And the next person like that is JK Rowling, what she\u2019s done in creating the Potter universe. I want that with ModelLand,\u201d Banks says solemnly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My objective is for people to come and their jaw to drop and say, \u2018Tyra has lost her goddamn mind. This bitch is crazy!'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She has been planning <a href=\"https://www.model-land.com/\" title=\"\">ModelLand</a>, which takes its name from the title of her decidedly weird 2011 young adult sci-fi-ish novel, for almost a decade. Reviewing the book for the feminist magazine <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/\" title=\"\">Bitch</a>, Ann-Derrick Gaillot wrote, \u201cThis book promotes self-esteem and confidence in girls, [but] it is less than empowering since it is all to a depressing consumerist end.\u201d Undaunted by the negative reviews, Banks has used the book as inspiration for what she is determined will be her greatest achievement, even if nobody else really understands what it is. Her explanations in previous interviews haven\u2019t helped: \u201cFrom the beginning, I wanted ModelLand to go beyond just a place to go to, but to be a place to feel emotion,\u201d she told Variety last year, prompting <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/tyra-banks-to-launch-modelland-whatever-the-hell-that-1832355423\" title=\"\">feminist website jezebel.com</a> to run a piece headlined \u201cTyra Banks to Launch ModelLand, Whatever the Hell That Means\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to give it away,\u201d she smiles now.</p> <p>Sure, but can she give some details?</p> <p>\u201cModelLand is kind of like Harry Potter meets America\u2019s Next Top Model meets Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory meets Disney \u2013 and you know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\" title=\"\">Black Panther</a>?\u201d she begins, and continues to talk about ModelLand without pause for \u2013 no exaggeration \u2013 14 minutes. Reader, I desperately tried to follow it, but you try making sense of sentences like, \u201cSo it\u2019s an alternate universe called Ozonia, which is comprised of six different provinces, and each province is demarcated by different weather, and each of them makes the fashion and beauty of the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11b96df5d105dfb3bcb482ddf10396ff5917612b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b96df5d105dfb3bcb482ddf10396ff5917612b/764_217_979_858/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with her Mother backstage before the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show 2002\" width=\"500\" height=\"438\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her mother in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Agostini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banks has long been an outspoken campaigner against the fashion industry\u2019s narrow idea of beauty, but at the point when she started to talk about \u201cthe uprise\u201d in ModelLand against fashion\u2019s tyranny, specifying that it was capitalised \u201cUpRiSe\u201d, I started to tune out. \u201cMy objective for ModelLand is for people to come in and their jaw to drop, and say, \u2018Tyra has lost her goddamn mind. This bitch is crazy!\u2019\u201d she concludes triumphantly.</p> <p>Beyond the bonkers storyline, ModelLand sounds like a giant mall (\u201can elevated integrated shopping experience,\u201d as Banks puts it) in Santa Monica, where people can live the modelling fantasy via personalised makeovers, fancy photoshoots and fashion shows. The intention, she says, is to teach people that the fashion industry wants \u201cto make us feel insecure and buy products, so it\u2019s really an economy type of thing\u201d. ModelLand, by contrast, celebrates all kinds of beauty: \u201cYou may be 50 years old, you may have cellulite, you may have a big forehead or you may have freckles all over your face. We will show that you can smize and you can slay that runway,\u201d she says. You won\u2019t, she says earnestly, be forced to buy any products the ModelLand team then recommends for your cellulite and freckles. \u201cBut if you do, it will heighten the experience.\u201d</p> <p>Well, I\u2019m sure ModelLand will shift some mascaras. But how about, instead of arguing that the industry should expand its beauty standards, which is never going to happen, Banks told girls that how they look isn\u2019t important? \u201cBut it is important, 100%,\u201d she interrupts before I finish. \u201cLike, right now, I\u2019m looking at things about you that my eyes are just naturally attracted to. I\u2019m looking at your hair, it\u2019s parted on the side, and it\u2019s beautiful because you have a high, square-shape forehead. There\u2019s a reason you chose that dress because you want to look in the mirror and say, \u2018You know what, this dress makes me feel nice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Actually, I chose it because I can\u2019t be bothered to lose my postpartum weight and this is one of the few dresses that fit, I say. \u201cBut you still chose that dress over another one,\u201d she says. \u201cI teach personal branding at Stanford, and one of the things I do with my students is I redo their LinkedIn photo, because research shows that certain things in that photo get you that interview. We say these things don\u2019t matter, but a lot of research shows that it does.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb35c0fec1746dfe419f7390559ea5c29d7bd205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb35c0fec1746dfe419f7390559ea5c29d7bd205/0_116_1324_1801/735.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks on location for America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">America\u2019s Next Top Model: on location\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CW Network/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3cf47fc62962dffa66f06a9b240042f02274c690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cf47fc62962dffa66f06a9b240042f02274c690/173_186_1475_1611/916.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with judge Nigel Barker on America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003\" width=\"916\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">with judge Nigel Barker\u2026<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Yarish/Cw Network/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb7d99d2487416b518a191c3f1ab2ecdf862e854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb7d99d2487416b518a191c3f1ab2ecdf862e854/219_244_692_1469/471.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with a contestant on America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003\" width=\"471\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">and with a contestant, all 2003.

When she was a couture model she was told she was too curvy and needed to lose 20lbs; instead, she took the lucrative route of becoming a Victoria\u2019s Secret model. When a tabloid published unflattering photos of her in a swimsuit in 2007, she appeared on her chatshow in the suit and, to the delight of her audience, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOQh3evqsI\" title=\"\">told her critics to \u201ckiss my fat ass\u201d</a>. Today she brings up, apropos of nothing, that she has put on 30lbs from the stress of working on ModelLand.</p> <p>\u201cI can hide it, because my neck is small, and my wrists and ankles are small. But I have some rolls on my back now \u2013 I\u2019m not used to that. And my ankles are hurting because I\u2019m carrying too much weight for my bones. Plus, I got grey hairs popping up under this wig. And look, I got my first wrinkle,\u201d she says, leaning across the table and scrunching up her face to produce one, barely visible, line at the top of her nose. Similarly, Banks talks about how \u201ccurvy\u201d she was as a model, when the truth is she was always incredibly thin: such chat might tick the \u201crelatable\u201d box, but it\u2019s a pretty relative field.</p> <p>How do these recent physical changes feel, given she has always made her livelihood from her looks? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me unhappy, but it makes me feel like I need to deal [with the weight] before I get unhealthy,\u201d she says.</p> <p>And is she reaching for the Botox to sort out her nonexistent wrinkle?</p> <p>\u201cNot yet! But you know, I haven\u2019t cracked a lot yet, so ask me again when it cracks.\u201d</p> <p>She has recently returned to modelling because she \u201cfelt like a hypocrite\u201d for having retired from Victoria\u2019s Secret in 2005. \u201cI wanted to leave before they kicked me out because of my age,\u201d she says (she was 32). \u201cBut now that I\u2019m older than ever, and thicker than ever, and I\u2019m saying beauty knows no age and size, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is.\u201d</p> <p>Banks talks proudly of her association with Victoria\u2019s Secret. \u201cThey never told me to lose weight,\u201d she says, describing it as a company that \u201chelps women feel more beautiful\u201d. And yet for years the brand was best known for its annual fashion show in which supermodels \u2013 including Banks \u2013 walked in their underwear down the runway to the delight of male celebrities in the audience, including the predictable likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber and Adam Levine. Banks says she found it \u201cempowering\u201d: \u201cMy ass was thicker [than other models\u2019] and I was the only black model [in the show], so I knew what that meant to my community and the world as a whole. So I had a whole different thing going on,\u201d she says.</p> <p>These days, the brand is very much on a downward trajectory, not helped by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/business/victorias-secret-razek-harassment.html\" title=\"\">reports </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/business/victorias-secret-razek-harassment.html\" title=\"\">that models were being sexually harassed</a> by former executive Ed Razek. Razek denies the allegations, but had already drawn fire after a <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/victorias-secret-ed-razek-monica-mitro-interview\" title=\"\">Vogue 2018 interview</a>, in which he said he wouldn\u2019t include plus-size or transgender models in Victoria\u2019s Secret campaigns. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddc3ae17406a9f21a93067154ee0c47cf93fae35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddc3ae17406a9f21a93067154ee0c47cf93fae35/0_668_5778_3467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks photographed in Los Angeles, CA, Feb 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Modelling can still be a stepping stone for everybody.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Rozzi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt makes me sad,\u201d Banks says now. \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret don\u2019t pay me any more, but I still feel an affinity to the company. The model I was back then could not work for them now, because [they would say] I was too thick [fat],\u201d she says, implying that Victoria\u2019s Secret has changed, when the truth is it hasn\u2019t, and the times have. Surely, I say, she must have seen the 2017 shows in which <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a13880726/victorias-secret-cultural-appropriation-native-american/\" title=\"\">the models wore</a><a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a13880726/victorias-secret-cultural-appropriation-native-american/\" title=\"\"> Native American headdresses</a>?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen the shows lately,\u201d she interrupts firmly. \u201cBut I think [the company] will change because they have to, and that will help a lot of people feel more accepted.\u201d</p> <p>With the launch of America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003, and again with ModelLand, Banks has been bringing the model experience to the masses, promising that anyone \u2013 even those of us with high, square-shaped foreheads \u2013 can be a model, if only in Banks\u2019s world. Although this has been very lucrative for her, it\u2019s never made much sense to me: Banks knows better than anyone that it\u2019s absurd for modelling to be seen as the supreme goal for women \u2013 after all, she used it as a stepping stone to something bigger (and better). \u201cIt can still be a stepping stone for everybody,\u201d she insists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"159ffb7b1c503cad94e286b6f3109c00f8d75bb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/159ffb7b1c503cad94e286b6f3109c00f8d75bb9/0_0_3857_4443/868.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks walks the runway at the Yves Saint Laurent Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 1992-1993 fashion show during the Paris Fashion Week in March, 1992 in Paris, France.\" width=\"868\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modelling for Yves Saint Laurent in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But ModelLand and Top Model pitch the job as a form of ultimate validation, I say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a realist, and I\u2019m not going to sit here and lie, and say that a young girl doesn\u2019t want to look in that mirror and feel good,\u201d she says, which is of course true, but it is also different from saying they should aspire to be a model. After all, empowering Victoria\u2019s Secret shows aside, Banks didn\u2019t have that great a time when she was a model.</p> <p>She started when she was 15, a skinny African American girl from a broken home, and was soon booked to walk for the highest of high fashion shows: Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Christian Dior. \u201cBack then I was very shy and all \u2018Thank you, OK.\u2019 I was a bit intimidated by the [fashion] world, where everything seemed very over-the-top and not based on truth. I thought, everyone\u2019s so fabulous, and I\u2019m just a girl from Inglewood, California,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Although she got jobs easily in Europe, US agencies and casting directors would look at her and say, \u201cWe already have a black girl.\u201d This attitude led to what is still one of the most notorious feuds in fashion. When Banks was starting out, she was often pitched as \u201cthe next Naomi Campbell\u201d, much to Campbell\u2019s displeasure: the British supermodel allegedly had Banks fired from shows and photo shoots. Banks eventually left the high fashion world, partly because of the weight issue, but also out of a desire to get away from this weird Mean Girls environment. In 2005, she somehow convinced Campbell to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=516JwxaFVy4\" title=\"\">appear on her talkshow</a> and the result was one of the most extraordinary onscreen encounters since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/19/feud-bette-and-joan-tv-drama-hollywood-sexism-in-spotlight\" title=\"\">Bette Davis squared up to Joan Crawford</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI was tired of having to deal with you.

Life means more to me than that,\u201d retorts an unflappably imperious Campbell.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened then, Naomi, is a big part of who I am today!\u201d Banks snaps back.</p> <p>I ask if they\u2019re in contact at all. \u201cOh no no no. It\u2019s funny, Naomi hasn\u2019t done anything bad to me, and that other stuff was decades and decades ago. But it was just such a painful time, it really did something to me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I tell her she seemed incredibly composed in the interview, given she was confronting someone who has since been convicted of assault four times.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, the most nervous shows I\u2019ve ever done have been interviewing all the presidential candidates, and interviewing her,\u201d Banks says.</p> <p>I ask if she ever watched The Face, the shortlived modelling show which Campbell hosted. She doesn\u2019t blink.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but I did see a clip online,\u201d she says.</p> <p>And what did she think?</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was fantastic,\u201d she deadpans, then bursts out laughing.</p> <p>So much of Banks\u2019s appeal relies on her audience believing they\u2019re seeing her true self. Instead of being an untouchable fashion queen like Campbell, she\u2019s the goofy, overemotional friend. Top Model\u2019s most iconic (and memed) moment came in 2005, when Banks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Shpn5WCFs\" title=\"\">lost her temper with contestant Tiffany Richardson</a>, because she felt Richardson hadn\u2019t tried hard enough, and wasn\u2019t upset enough when she was dropped from the show. \u201cI was rooting for you, we were all rooting for you, how dare you?!\u201d Banks screamed at the bemused teenager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fdaf147f45e5247f48499436f7bd0b3002fac52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fdaf147f45e5247f48499436f7bd0b3002fac52/0_113_2445_2441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell at the 10th Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show, in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"998\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Naomi Campbell at the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show in New York in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tell Banks that my friend Joe thinks Top Model is more camp than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/rupaul-s-drag-race-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race</a>, which is itself a kind of drag version of Banks\u2019s show.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes, we\u2019re very campy, that\u2019s deliberate. So thank you, Joe! Look, fashion can feel intimidating, so if you were to play it straight it wouldn\u2019t drive millions of people to watch it.\u201d</p> <p>So when she shouted at Richardson, was that her camping it up? She recoils in shock at the idea. \u201cOh, <em>hell</em> no. Camp is me fake fainting or jumping up and down, or talking about my weaves. But moments like that, I tap into pain, and that pain is real.\u201d</p> <p>In her encounter with Richardson, it was clear that what infuriated Banks was the thought that a working-class black girl was throwing away an amazing opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I was thinking about Tiffany earlier today, and yeah, I felt a personal connection to her. But it was also hearing her say, \u2018I\u2019m just not smart enough,\u2019 and then she brought race into it [as a reason for why she was dropped from the show]. I had to tell her and every girl in the room, \u2018It\u2019s not because you\u2019re black.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The fear of wasting opportunities is still what drives Banks today. Instead of slogging her guts out over this mall \u2013 I mean \u201celevated shopping experience\u201d \u2013 she could have married a rich man<strong> </strong>and spent her days shopping in Beverly Hills. \u201cOh my God, that is hell,\u201d she says. \u201cI see some models and it\u2019s like they cashed in their career. That\u2019s like selling your soul, to be with somebody because they have money. You can\u2019t be happy,\u201d she says in a doomy whisper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12245c61822e917709d5792583e6033b1f00477f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12245c61822e917709d5792583e6033b1f00477f/262_210_2119_1723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks and boyfriend Erik Asla out and about, Los Angeles, America - 07 Feb 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With partner Erik Asla in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banks and her long-term partner, the Norwegian photographer Erik Asla, had their son, York, by surrogacy four years ago. There were media reports that she and Asla broke up soon afterwards, but on these subjects \u2013 her relationship and her child \u2013 Banks slams shut like a clam. \u201cI\u2019m very protective of my personal life. So if you look at my social media, you don\u2019t see my child. I know my followers would quadruple if I posted pictures of him, but I don\u2019t want to use my child for my career,\u201d she says. She won\u2019t even confirm where she lives, shaking her head with sealed shut lips. And in that moment, the wacky, over-the-top goofball suddenly looks like a very cautious and thoughtful operator.</p> <p>Banks is a likable and shrewd woman, and it would take a gambler with stronger nerves than me to bet against her. Given that she is planning to start shooting her 25th season of America\u2019s Next Top Model, maybe ModelLand really will be, as she solemnly says, \u201cmy Steamboat Willie\u201d, the early Mickey Mouse cartoon that launched Disney\u2019s kingdom. But doesn\u2019t she find it all a bit, I don\u2019t know, tiring? All this work to be the next Oprah, the next Disney, the next JK Rowling?</p> <p>\u201cOh no, I love it! But I\u2019ll tell you what I do hate: I hate when people ask for a selfie. I\u2019m like, \u2018You just want to prove you were here. But can\u2019t I give you a hug and tell you how to smize, and it will be something that you\u2019ll remember for ever and ever?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And with that Banks gives me a hug goodbye. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll remember it for ever, but it was a pretty good hug.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",
  "<p>When you dry yourself off after a shower, how does the towel feel about it? Do your front teeth look forward to your lover kissing you? And does a balloon find joy in helping us celebrate, or is it consumed by a fear of bursting? If none of these questions has ever troubled you, prepare for your brain to be rewired by <a href=\"https://www.everythingisalive.com/\">Everything Is Alive</a>, a podcast from the Radiotopia stable that has found a loyal audience despite its outlandish premise. The host, Ian Chillag, interviews objects, and the objects talk back: the result is a ridiculous comedy with surprising philosophical chops.</p> <p>Everything Is Alive is peppered with funny moments, from <a href=\"https://www.everythingisalive.com/episodes/louis-can-of-cola\">a can of cola called Louis </a>recalling the traumatic experience of being part-frozen when he got pushed to the back of the fridge, to Sean the subway seat bitching furiously about the seat opposite. But it is all played straight. Chillag and his collaborators \u2013 usually actors or comedians with improv experience \u2013 never laugh, nor acknowledge the absurdity of what they\u2019re doing. What emerges is that most precious of things: a stupid idea that is made to work by the total conviction with which it\u2019s executed. \u201cI cut out things that I love, really funny jokes,\u201d Chillag says, down the line from New York. \u201cI\u2019ll sacrifice laughs to maintain that fragile suspension of disbelief. The flatness of the show is a big part of making it feel real. That\u2019s also why I produce it through improvisation rather than scripting it.\u201d</p> <p>Chillag\u2019s background is in writing and producing non-fiction for National Public Radio, but he used to struggle with the \u201cnon-fiction\u201d part. \u201cI found myself tempted to make things up to make the story better. I felt like, I need to stop doing journalism because that\u2019s the kind of thing that could get me fired. I had a fiction brain.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c1032abe7e5e2ba63a0dc466a4a55286d1293c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c1032abe7e5e2ba63a0dc466a4a55286d1293c3/0_181_1867_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Chillag, presenter of Everything Is Alive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s a living thing...

Fact and fiction blur thanks to a clever kink in the format: at some point, every object comes out with a piece of trivia that prompts Chillag to suspend the main interview and ring a relevant expert \u2013 a real, human one \u2013 to find out more. So when the balloon mentions that hedgehogs can suffer from \u201cballoon syndrome\u201d and fill with air, Chillag breaks off to talk to the boss of a hedgehog sanctuary. When <a href=\"https://www.everythingisalive.com/episodes/sean-subway-seat\">the subway seat</a> talks about passengers dropping their possessions on to the tracks, we hear from the guy who retrieves them.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted the show to flit between reality and fiction,\u201d says Chillag. \u201cNot being sure what something is makes you keep listening.\u201d</p> <p>There is a running joke in the show that you\u2019re not certain how much the objects know about human existence, or how they came to know it; what\u2019s for sure is that they can\u2019t join it. That yearning gives Everything Is Alive its profound emotional core. Take <a href=\"https://www.everythingisalive.com/episodes/maeve-lamppost-of-brooklyn\">Maeve, the Brooklyn lamp-post</a> who answers Chillag\u2019s question about where she would relocate herself if she could pick anywhere in the world by saying she would like to go round the corner, to the next street.

  "<p>As the Trump administration and lawmakers in Washington debate cash payments to support Americans during the coronavirus crisis, the mayor of one California city that has experimented with universal basic income has advice.</p> <p>Early findings from Stockton, California, which launched a basic income experiment last year, may offer American policymakers some reassurance \u2013 and a few notes of caution.</p> <p>It\u2019s \u201cheartening\u201d to see a national focus on providing direct cash assistance, said Michael Tubbs, Stockon\u2019s 29-year-old mayor, who championed the city\u2019s basic income experiment. But some choices in the current Republican plan make little sense to him, Tubbs said. \u201cIf someone was struggling more than others before a crisis, why should they get less help during a crisis that is going to hit them harder? It defies logic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, proposed legislation to give middle-income Americans a single, $1,200 payout for each adult, plus $500 for each child in a family. The payments decrease for Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year, and individuals who make more than $99,000 will get nothing. The lowest-income Americans also get less: the plan includes a smaller, $600 payment to adults in some of America\u2019s poorest families. Democratic lawmakers are calling for Americans to receive larger, recurring cash payments, with at least one plan calling for <a href=\"https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-reps-ryan-khanna-propose-cash-infusion-between-1000-6000-help-working\">a monthly check</a> of between $1,000 and $6,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this pandemic get help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this global pandemic get help and relief,\u201d Tubbs said.</p> <p>Stockton launched its guaranteed income experiment, the first in modern US history, in 2019. Since that February, 125 local residents in the economically challenged city have received $500 a month to spend on whatever they choose.</p> <p>The idea of providing a universal basic income to citizens is not new, but it has found new supporters in recent years, as some tech industry leaders have embraced \u201cUBI\u201d as a possible response to rising inequality and a growing number of American jobs lost to automation. The Facebook co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/20/america-guaranteed-income-chris-hughes\">Chris Hughes</a> is among the proponents of the policy; the Economic Security Project, which he co-chairs, is helping fund basic income experiments in Stockton and elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/andrew-yang-coronavirus-universal-basic-income-interview\">'$1,000 per person should be the baseline': Andrew Yang on direct payments during coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early data from the Stockton experiment is promising, according to the two researchers who are running the evaluation of the program.</p> <p>\u201cIf you give people free cash, how do they spend it? They\u2019re very rational about it, and they make great decisions,\u201d said Stacia Martin-West, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work and one of the lead researchers.</p> <p>Direct cash payments are more flexible than a one-size-fits-all government program, and they allow people to adapt to changing needs and new crises. \u201cEveryone we talked to, there was a different way they would use $500, and they all made sense,\u201d Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, said. \u201cThere was no way, as a government official, I would be smart enough to think of all that.\u201d</p> <p>One participant used the money to pay for dentures, Tubbs said. Another was able to take time off work to interview for a better job that paid more and had shorter hours. Participants have talked about finally having the money to buy their kid a sports uniform or a prom dress, or to move to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/156584/can-500-month-change-life\">a safer neighborhood.</a></p> <p>But the single largest category of spending among Stockton participants so far: food. Nearly 40% of tracked spending monthly went to feeding the recipients and their families.</p> <p>That number highlights the degree of basic \u201cfood insecurity\u201d that Americans have been living with since even before the current crisis, said Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the other lead researcher on the project.</p> <p>The Stockton researchers also found that participants were using their additional cash to invest in healthier food choices for themselves and their kids, additional evidence that the barrier for lower-income Americans to eat healthier is not education about what they should and should not be eating, but access to affordable, high-quality food.</p> <p>Scaling a direct cash payment program nationwide during a pandemic could end up having broader public health benefits, beyond just preventing the spread of the virus, Baker said. It could give more Americans the resources to eat healthier meals. If lawmakers provide continuous payments, reducing residents\u2019 fears about being able to make it through the crisis, their lower levels of anxiety could also lead to better overall health outcomes.</p> <h2>\u2018As long as the crisis lasts\u2019</h2> <p>As policymakers in Washington debate which Americans to exclude from direct cash payments, and whether they should send just one check, or two or three, Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, encouraged them to think bigger.</p> <p>Direct cash payments should last \u201cas long as the crisis lasts, and even a little bit after\u201d, Tubbs said.</p> <p>Receiving $500 or $1,000 monthly isn\u2019t much during a global pandemic that has destroyed the economy, Tubbs said: \u201cIf they were working two or three jobs, this is not replacing what they made, this is enough to let them get by.\u201d</p> <p>Martin-West and Baker, the researchers evaluating the Stockton experiment, agreed that an effective program of national cash payments needed to match the scale and scope of the problem. That means payments should go out immediately, within 10 to 14 days; they need to recur throughout the crisis; and they need to reach Americans with as few bureaucratic hurdles as possible.</p> <p>Since the 2008 recession, \u201cthe average household has not recovered,\u201d Baker said. Banks got bailed out, the stock market boomed, but the government did not do enough to help most Americans.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have now is an entire economy of people living paycheck to paycheck because they were left out,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have been a house of cards for a really long time, and it wasn\u2019t going to take much to blow it over.\u201d</p> <p>A big, sustained program of direct cash payments was a chance for the American government to \u201ccourse-correct\u201d and make up for the failures of the 2009 bailout, she said.</p> <p>How big and how sustained? A good benchmark for the size of the checks the government should send to Americans now, Martin-West said, might be some common financial wisdom.</p> <p>\u201cThe advice that we\u2019ve all heard for how to be financially savvy is: you\u2019re supposed to have three months of income saved up. If we look at the median income for Americans, that would mean $7,500 in the bank,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That benchmark would mean supporting Americans with roughly $2,500 per month throughout the crisis. \u201cAt minimum, a year of those cash transfers would be ideal,\u201d Martin-West said.</p> <p>Lawmakers need to specify in the legislation that the coronavirus payments do not count as income that could later disqualify low-income families from receiving food stamps, or other continuing government assistance, the researchers said. If lawmakers fail to do that, families could lose their eligibility for other programs, hurting them more over the long run.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking. This is a New Deal type moment</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Tubbs</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While both Republican and Democratic plans call for reducing or even eliminating direct payments to higher-income Americans, Tubbs also said that he believes payments should be \u201ccloser to universal\u201d since \u201cthe crisis will impact everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the difference between [an income cutoff of] $99,000 and $100,000 is, especially at at time when we\u2019re laying people off and shutting down industries,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The two researchers suggested that the federal government should channel money to Americans through multiple programs, to make sure they reach everyone in need. Why not increase the amounts of existing welfare and disability payments, as well as using tax records to send taxpayers cash?</p> <p>But even large direct cash payments aren\u2019t a substitute for other kinds of government action, they cautioned. Other solutions are needed during the coronavirus crisis, including paid sick leave and better healthcare. In Stockton, the guaranteed income pilot has made clear that more money is not enough to help residents deal with systemic problems, like California\u2019s lack of affordable housing.</p> <p>Baker also questioned why the McConnell legislation was benchmarked against Americans\u2019 2018 tax returns, when so many Americans, including freelancers and gig economy workers, see their incomes change dramatically over time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/america-coronavirus-recession-universal-basic-income\">America is in crisis. We need universal basic income now | Karl Widerquist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the researchers worried about the part of McConnell\u2019s legislation that envisions a lower, $600 payout to Americans who do not reach certain income tax cutoffs. A single mom who spends most of her time caring for a child with a serious disability, for example, might not make the income cutoff for a full $1,200 check, even though she\u2019s \u201ccertainly going to be struggling in the middle of a public health crisis\u201d, Martin-West said.</p> <p>Not all lawmakers are onboard with even a single direct cash payment to Americans, and some key Senate Republicans expressed reservations about McConnell\u2019s plan on Thursday, including Lindsey Graham, an influential Trump ally.</p> <p>But merely focusing on increasing unemployment insurance, as Graham has suggested, Tubbs said, would leave out too many people who might not fit the criteria for unemployment, including women doing domestic and caregiving work, freelancers, barbers and hairdressers, and Lyft and Uber drivers.</p> <p>Americans needed both more unemployment insurance and direct payments, Tubbs said, not one or the other.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking,\u201d Tubbs said \u201cThis is a New Deal type moment, in terms of the recession that\u2019s bound to come from this public health epidemic, which we haven\u2019t seen in at least a century.\u201d</p> <p>Tubbs said he was not surprised that direct cash payments were having a national political moment, and he said that work to make the idea mainstream has already been done, including by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/andrew-yang-coronavirus-universal-basic-income-interview\">Andrew Yang</a>, the entrepreneur and Democratic presidential primary candidate, who made UBI his central policy issue in his bid for the White House.</p> <p>\u201cI think folks like myself, and people like the Economic Security Project, people like Mr Yang, have taken the brunt of the criticism,\u201d Tubbs said. \u201cI think now it\u2019s really a safe space, particularly because we\u2019re in a crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of people who were living in an economic pandemic before the corona crisis,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 March 2020 to correct a mistake that said White Policy instead of White House.</p>",
  "<p>Last Saturday night, Amber Valentine got dressed up to play a set, as she has nearly every weekend since she began DJing full time eight years ago. She put on her headphones as a smoke machine and lights filled the room \u2013 but this time, instead of walking on stage to perform, she walked into her living room.</p> <p>Valentine is one of an increasing number of performers moving their work online as nationwide lockdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus force bars and other nightlife spaces to a close. Drag shows, DJ sets, and dance parties have been taking to live streams and chat rooms to keep people connected and pay out-of-work performers as more and more cities in the US go on lockdown.</p> <p>Valentine came up with the idea to stream her set on Instagram live for a virtual dance party when New York City bars and clubs closed last week , and she\u2019s planning another one this weekend now the New York governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo-non-essential-workers-businesses\">has ordered</a> most people to stay home. </p> <p>\u201cThe response was like nothing I could have expected,\u201d she said. Thousands of people tuned in and hundreds of her Instagram followers sent her videos of themselves dancing to her music in their living rooms. Many used the comment section to chat with one another as they might do in a club, and although she didn\u2019t ask for money she made several hundred dollars via donations through her Venmo account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9z1ei6l8Me/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

They come in two types: towers, to which you attach a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and all-in-ones, which are computers built into the back of screens, such as Apple\u2019s iMac and Windows PC equivalents.</p> <p>Some basic specs should include:</p> <p>\u2022 Processor: look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5 2500 or Intel\u2019s i3 at the lowest end</p> <p>\u2022 RAM: 8GB minimum</p> <p>\u2022 Storage: an SSD with 256GB of storage minimum, some machines may also come with large capacity traditional HDD too</p> <p>Look for a discrete graphics card made by Nvidia or AMD if you work in a creative content industry, such as photo or video editing or similar.</p> <p><strong>Laptops</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"837cd5e75bcfae578c8aaab1c948685c8fa447cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/837cd5e75bcfae578c8aaab1c948685c8fa447cd/310_531_3659_2196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laptops are extremely popular because they contain everything you need in one package, but they also promote poor posture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laptops are extremely popular because they contain everything you need in one package, but they also promote poor posture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The big advantage of a laptop \u2013 portability \u2013 has one big downside: terrible ergonomics making you hunch over which is bad for your back, shoulders and wrists. Consider varying your working position and height during the day, from sitting at a desk or kitchen table to standing at a kitchen work surface.</p> <p>There is a massive range in laptops including traditional hinged laptops, 2-in-1s where the keyboard folds all the way round the back and convertibles where the screen detaches from the keyboard to turn into a tablet.</p> <p>Broadly speaking traditional laptops will be cheaper. You should look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7 processor, at least 8GB of RAM (preferably 16GB if an option) and 256GB of SSD storage \u2013 do not buy a laptop that only has a traditional hard drive, and nothing below 128GB. </p> <p>In addition you have to consider the screen, keyboard and trackpad. A 13in to 14in screen will be fine for most uses, so look out for a resolution of at least 1080p (1920 x 1200 or similar). The higher the resolution the crisper the screen will look.</p> <p>Laptops with poor keyboards or a poor trackpad can be infuriating to use, so check reviews before you buy. If you\u2019re really price constrained and do all your work in browser, consider a Chromebook which will offer a much better experience at the low end than an equally cheap Windows laptop.</p> <p>You can use a riser or a pile of books to bring laptops up to eye-level, or attach them to an external monitor, and connect a keyboard and mouse to improve ergonomics.</p> <p><strong>Monitor</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d01cbb8d7c645f138f58e190563418ba46ea6ec4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d01cbb8d7c645f138f58e190563418ba46ea6ec4/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You might be looking for a slightly less ambitious set up for your home office than a multi-screen trader, but picking a good monitor can make all the difference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You might be looking for a slightly less ambitious set up for your home office than a multi-screen trader, but picking a good monitor can make all the difference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armando Babani/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re buying a tower desktop you need a monitor, which come in a vast array of sizes, resolutions and prices. </p> <p>Up to 24in Full HD, 1080p or similar resolution should be fine, although Quad HD, 1440p or similar will look crisper. Larger monitors benefit greatly from increased resolution with QHD being a minimum at 27in or above, and 4K monitors being a luxury.</p> <p>Look for a monitor with height adjustment, and position the top of the screen at eye level.

Most will last months on a set of AA or AAAs.</p> <p>Some people swear by mechanical keyboards, which look like they should ship with PCs from the 1990s and require more physical action on the keys to activate, while others like scissor-switch keyboards that are shallower and more like those on a laptop. Stick to whichever type you\u2019re comfortable with.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forgot a mouse too. Avoid fancy-looking flat ones and consider a more ergonomically shaped one or a vertical mouse to help with wrist pain.</p> <p><strong>Noise-cancelling headphones</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5945dacf95d15742eb426a87eef4be4272cf1e11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5945dacf95d15742eb426a87eef4be4272cf1e11/0_192_3000_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noise-cancelling headphones help block out distractions and signify that you\u2019re at work and not to be disturbed, helping those around you to not inadvertently interrupt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noise-cancelling headphones help block out distractions and signify that you\u2019re at work and not to be disturbed, helping those around you to not inadvertently interrupt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bose</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the computer and desk set up, noise cancelling headphones might be the next best tip, particularly useful if your home office is more like the kitchen table.

Alternatives include Microsoft\u2019s free Office online or Apple\u2019s free Pages and Sheets on a Mac.</p> <p><strong>Image editing</strong></p> <p>Most computers will come with basic image editing built-in, such as Microsoft\u2019s Photos and Apple\u2019s Preview or Photos. The free GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is powerful but fairly complex. Paint.Net is fairly feature-packed but simple on Windows, and Google Photos in a browser can handle basic photo improvement jobs.</p> <p><strong>Video conferencing</strong></p> <p>Chances are you\u2019re going to end up using what your employer provides, such as Zoom, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams and so on The main consumer tools are Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Google\u2019s Duo and Apple\u2019s Face Time, the last of which only works on Apple devices.

And it\u2019s all thanks to streamers like Netflix. That\u2019s because, according to BT, everyone working from home consumes less bandwidth than the evening peak of everyone streaming TV, downloading games and other bandwidth intensive tasks.</p> <p>Howard Watson, BT\u2019s chief technology and information officer, said: \u201cEven if the same heavy data traffic that we see each evening were to run throughout the daytime, there is still enough capacity for work-applications to run simultaneously.\u201d</p> <p><strong>OK, so why is my wifi slow?</strong></p> <p>Just because the nation\u2019s broadband infrastructure can cope, doesn\u2019t mean your own home broadband won\u2019t need a little TLC. There are several things to consider:</p> <p><strong>Your broadband</strong><strong> speed</strong></p> <p>You might find that a slow broadband package isn\u2019t enough when shared between everyone working and streaming at home all at the same time. It\u2019s not just the download speed either as work video conferencing, file transfers and so on can be demanding on the often significantly slower upload speeds.</p> <p>You may need to pay for a faster package, or stop the kids streaming while you\u2019re working.</p> <p><strong>Do you need a new router?</strong></p> <p>Your router is a tiny, cheap computer and it gets old like anything else. If you haven\u2019t had your router replaced in the last six years, you could probably do with a new one, which will help with wifi speedand also range. Contact your service provider.</p> <p><strong>Wifi range extenders</strong></p> <p>Wifi strength and speed diminishes the further you are from your router. You may need to move the router to the middle of the house if you can.</p> <p>If you can\u2019t, wifi range extenders (\u00a330 and up) or powerline networking (\u00a360 and up), using the electrical wires as surrogate ethernet cables, can help.</p> <p>Failing that, mesh networking is your expensive, but powerful friend, replacing your router\u2019s wifi with a series of nodes that send wifi all over the house. Whole-home systems start at about \u00a3150 and scale to \u00a3400 for the very best.</p> <p><strong>Should I just turn it on and off again?</strong></p> <p>It sounds daft in 2020 to say this, but yes. Cheap routers can get befuddled for any number of reasons, particularly if pushed hard. Turn off your router at the wall or switch, wait at least 20 seconds, then switch it back on.</p>",
  "<p>Long before the arrival of Covid-19, the speed and contents of the news had made me feel almost overwhelmed with fear. Faced with a flood of images that includes migrant children in cages, melting glaciers and forest fires, it has felt impossible to process information, let alone assess the best way to react.</p> <p>We\u2019ve entered an era characterised by the twin forces of speed and instability, in which a superabundance of potential threats \u2013 running from Islamic State to nuclear war, the rise of the far right, Brexit, environmental catastrophe and now a global pandemic \u2013 is matched by a dearth of time in which to process them. It\u2019s impossible to keep up, and far too alarming to look away. Thanks to the accelerating effects of social media, it\u2019s begun to seem as if the social landscape is shifting at such a rate that thinking, the act of making sense, is permanently balked. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to distinguish real danger from rumours, speculations, conspiracy theories and deliberate lies, a process the spread of coronavirus around the globe has only intensified. Logging into Twitter or following the rolling news has meant being trapped in a spin-cycle of hypervigilant anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During this febrile period, I\u2019ve found myself longing for a different kind of timeframe, in which it would be possible both to feel and to think, to process the intense impact of the news and perhaps even to imagine other ways of being. The stopped time of a painting, say, or the dilations of the novel, in which it is possible to see patterns and consequences that are otherwise invisible. Art has begun to feel not like a respite or an escape, but a formidable tool for gaining perspective on what are increasingly troubled times.</p> <p>Can art do anything, especially during periods of crisis? In 1967, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/george-steiner-obituary\" title=\"\">George Steiner</a> wrote a famous essay about the deficiencies of art in the wake of the Holocaust. He argued that if a concentration camp commander could read Goethe and Rilke in the evening and still go about their duties at Auschwitz each day, then art had failed in its highest function, which he defined as the ability to humanise. The problem with this argument is that it implies for art to be successful it must act as a magic bullet, effortlessly reorganising moral faculties; in effect obliterating free will.</p> <p>Art can\u2019t forcibly induce a change in behaviour. It\u2019s not a re-education pill. Empathy is not something that happens to us when we read <em>War and Peace</em>. It\u2019s work, for which art can, however, provide us with radiant materials. Art can\u2019t win an election or bring down a president. It can\u2019t stop the climate crisis, cure a virus or raise the dead. What it can do is serve as an antidote to times of chaos. It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think.</p> <p>One of the problems with the internet as a source of information is that there is no end, no definitive conclusion to be reached. You travel link by link, pursuing digressions and counter-claims, interrupted by continuous breaking updates.

This \u201cgeneral emporium of much disregarded merchandise\u201d is overflowing with indeterminate objects, among them blacking bottles and pickling bottles, heaps of parchment scrolls, rags and hundreds of rusty keys. Buried somewhere in this maddening chaos is, or might be, a vital document, without which clarity and justice will never be achieved.</p> <p>There\u2019s a plague in <em>Bleak House</em> too, the hyper-contagious smallpox virus, which serves to underscore Dickens\u2019s larger argument about interconnection, his determined attempt to show that social classes are not inviolate or impermeable, and that no group of people, no matter how grand or rich, are truly separate from their neighbours, no matter how poor or abject. The fever doesn\u2019t respect titles or addresses, racing indiscriminately from the London slum of Tom-All-Alone to Bleak House itself. Esther catches it because she insists on helping the abject, homeless orphan Jo, shivering and stumbling from ditch to doorway, always being moved on. Realising she too is sick, she establishes herself in rigorous quarantine, knowing that by locking the door on her dear friend Ada, she is carrying out an act of love. \u201cAs she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace,\u201d she instructs, \u201ccome no nearer than the garden\u201d: the tender message of self-isolators everywhere.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of <em>Bleak House</em> is that it\u2019s a drama about the act of information-gathering itself, slowly and laboriously producing clarity and order out of lies, misinformation and occlusion. Back in the early 1990s, the critic and queer studies pioneer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick wrote an illuminating essay about this vexed and essential process. Sedgwick was once described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson</a> as \u201cfat, freckled, prone to blushing, bedecked in textiles, generous, uncannily sweet, almost sadistically intelligent and, by the time I met her, terminally ill\u201d. She wrote \u201cParanoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You\u201d at the centre of the Aids crisis, at a time when many of her closest friends and colleagues were dying difficult and painful deaths, and she herself was undergoing treatment for the breast cancer that later killed her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading The Road does not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though it was written predominantly for an academic audience, \u201cParanoid Reading\u201d is about something that affects us all, which is how we approach knowledge and uncertainty, as we do constantly in the course of our daily lives, and particularly at times of disaster or rapid political change. Sedgwick begins by describing the paranoid approach, so common and widely practised that we sometimes forget there are alternatives to it.</p> <p>A paranoid reader is concerned with gathering information, tracing links and exposing secrets. They anticipate and are perennially defended against catastrophe and disappointment. They\u2019re always on the lookout for danger, about which they can never, ever know enough. Paranoia can be an appropriate mode in circumstances like those we\u2019re in now, when knowledge is crucial and swift reactions matter. As the poet Anne Boyer observes in a much-shared essay about coronavirus, \u201cfear educates our care for each other \u2013 we fear a sick person might be made sicker, or that a poor person\u2019s life might be made even more miserable, and we do whatever we can to protect them because we fear a version of human life in which everyone lives only for themselves. I am not the least bit afraid of this kind of fear, for fear is a vital and necessary part of love.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulty lies in gauging the level and amount of information it\u2019s useful to acquire. How much does the average citizen need to know about epidemiology or viral loads? Does the accumulated store of possible scenarios help a person to act safely or does it paralyse their capacity to act at all? Furthermore, how much of what is read is true, and how much is being used to convey a more sinister message, like Trump\u2019s constant harping on a \u201cforeign\u201d virus, his deployment of a disease to broadcast propaganda about closed borders? At their worst, Twitter, Facebook and the like can be a factory for manufacturing speculation and mistrust, in which material travels more rapidly the more frightening it is, providing comprehensive evidence for hopelessness and dread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d/0_0_4254_4278/994.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden on the beach in his final years.\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden, see below, on the beach in his final years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Krause, Johansen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sedgwick\u2019s essay arose out of a conversation in the mid-1980s with her friend Cindy Patton, an activist-historian of the Aids epidemic. At the time, there were rumours that Aids might have been deliberately engineered by the US military. Sedgwick was excited to hear what Patton thought and startled by her reply. \u201cSuppose \u2026 that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they aren\u2019t actively hated; that the military deliberately researches ways to kill non-combatants whom it sees as enemies; that people in power look calmly on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes,\u201d she said. \u201cSupposing we were ever so sure of all those things \u2013 what would we know then that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3/0_251_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Bird/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Sedgwick took away from this \u201ccongenial pessimism\u201d, which strikes a definite echo with the present day, is that it isn\u2019t always necessary to track down every piece of information about a crisis in order to respond effectively to it. Patton\u2019s statement made her realise that there are other valid concerns for the artist, the activist, the citizen faced by emergency or disaster. At the very end of her essay, she briefly, tantalisingly floats another possible approach, which is more concerned with creativity and repair than the so-called hermeneutics of suspicion.</p> <p>A useful analogy for what Sedgwick terms the \u201creparative\u201d is to be fundamentally more invested in finding nourishment than identifying poison, a drive she locates in artists as diverse as the realist painter Jack Smith, artist Joseph Cornell, film-maker John Waters and <em>Nightwood</em> author Djuna Barnes. This is not the same thing as being naive or heedless, unaware of crisis or undamaged by oppression. Instead, it\u2019s about being driven to find or invent something new and vital out of inimical environments. \u201cWhat we can best learn from such practices,\u201d Sedgwick explains, \u201care the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture \u2013 even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.\u201d</p> <p>Sedgwick\u2019s faith in art was hard-won, and derived in part from the crucial role it played during the plague years of the Aids crisis. In contrast to the rapid international public health response to coronavirus, the first cases of \u201cgay cancer\u201d in California and New York in 1981 were met with apathy and derision. In 1984, by which time 5,596 deaths had occurred in the US and it was estimated 300,000 people had been exposed to the virus, the Reagan press officer was still responding to questions about the epidemic by joking about the journalist\u2019s possible infection status. Reagan himself didn\u2019t say the word \u201cAids\u201d until 17 September 1985. By the end of that year, 12,529 people had died.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/29/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2020\">Fiction to look out for in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such a situation, visibility mattered. In 1987, a six-person collective of artists in New York created the \u201cSilence = Death\u201d graphic, which became the international logo of Aids activism. This stark phrase was emblazoned in white letters on a black background beneath a pink triangle, taken from the insignia homosexuals were made to wear in concentration camps. It served to brand the call to arms, a crisp refutation of stigmatisation and homophobia.</p> <p>If silence equalled death, then part of the work of resistance was to make the fact of enforced silencing visible, as well as conveying something of the damage it caused. In 1989, the American artist and Act Up activist David Wojnarowicz posed for a famous photograph. He gazes furiously at the camera, his lips sutured with five loose stitches. Three thin trickles of blood run down his chin. In this distressing image, hurt and repair are fused. The needle works through flesh, self-inflicted wounds announcing larger harm.</p> <p>In our own era, the act of lip-sewing has been adopted by refugees. I\u2019ve seen photographs of refugees with stitched lips made on the border between Greece and Macedonia, in an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea, in Athens; all places where borders are closed to certain bodies and free passage is impeded. In these cases, the image possesses an uncanny power. It can travel where the body can\u2019t. It migrates and strays, taking up permanent residence in the mind, revealing what \u2013 who \u2013 has been forcibly excluded from sight.</p> <p>The desire to unveil hidden cruelty is also at work in a series of performances about rape carried out in the early 1970s by the Cuban-American artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/22/ana-mendieta-artist-work-foretold-death\" title=\"\">Ana Mendieta</a>, while she was still a student at the University of Iowa. In 1973, a nursing student was brutally raped and murdered in campus housing. It took months before there was an arrest, and during that frightening period, Mendieta took it upon herself to create work about the attack, conveying her own horror, as well as drawing attention to the invisible epidemic of violence against women. In the first of these performances, she invited her fellow students to her apartment. When they arrived, the door was ajar. Inside, there was lavish evidence that a horrible crime had been committed. Mendieta was tied to the table, half-naked, her underwear around her ankles. Blood dripped on the floor. The students stayed an hour and for the entire time she didn\u2019t move a muscle.</p> <p>Mendieta was working right at the beginning of second-wave feminism, when it was still possible to believe in the power of revelation, the shock tactics of re-enacting violence as a vaccination, a homeopathic cure. But by the 1990s, Sedgwick was already beginning to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t something weirdly naive about placing faith in this kind of unveiling, \u201cas though to make something visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from getting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction\u201d. As if violence is not titillating to certain appetites; as if the expression of pain cannot be consumed with relish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1/0_69_1503_902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Kraychyk/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The faith in inoculation remains, of course. In 2017, the actor Elisabeth Moss announced her irritation with people who refused to watch the ultra-violent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\" title=\"\">Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em>, a dystopic fantasy that felt closer by the day. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.\u201d But in the age of the internet, it\u2019s very hard to think that anyone needs more evidence of violence. We\u2019re already drenched in it, and its capacity to snap us out of numbness is grossly overstated. If anything, it does the opposite, glutting the viewer with despair.</p> <p>The night before Trump\u2019s inauguration, I saw the trans poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/16/eileen-myles-learn-to-write-poems\" title=\"\">Eileen Myles</a> read their own version of a presidential address at the London Review Bookshop. The vision they unfolded was the utopian inverse \u2013 painful! thrilling! \u2013 of what Trump would say the following day. Under Myles, the White House would be a homeless shelter, there\u2019d be 24-hour libraries, free trains, free education, free food, archery for everyone; sure, why not? It felt reparative, listening to that. It felt like my imaginative ability to frame utopias and then to move purposefully towards them might have been restored, at least for a minute.</p> <p>I had the same experience when I first read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/27/ursula-k-le-guins-electronica-album-music-and-poetry-of-the-kesh\" title=\"\">Always Coming Home</a></em>, Ursula Le Guin\u2019s 1985 collection of stories and anthropological fragments about a future civilisation, the Kesh, living in what is now California\u2019s Napa Valley in the wake of an apocalypse that is never quite described. It was a relief to encounter such a formidable thinker using her imaginative energy, her humour and her extensive knowledge to construct a better, fairer, more environmentally sane society \u2013 its architecture, sexual arrangements, metaphors, toys, songs, clothes, medical practices and stories \u2013 rather than simply magnifying all that is worst about our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/17/best-books-new-beginnings-jenny-colgan\">The best books about new beginnings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading <em>The Road</em> or <em>The Death of Grass</em> does not. Le Guin was no less concerned about the oncoming ecological crisis than Cormac McCarthy, but her approach is calmer and more infused with hope. Hope has a bad press in our cynical age, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being disengaged, a Pollyanna blind to the state things are in or uninterested in how they got that way. Hope is the precursor to change. Without it, no better world is possible.</p> <p>The same year that Wojnarowicz was photographed with his needle and thread, the film-maker Derek Jarman began the diary that would become <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\" title=\"\">Modern Nature</a></em>, an account of building his famous garden on the beach in Dungeness, Kent. Jarman was diagnosed HIV-positive in the winter of 1986, years before the invention of combination therapy made long-term survival a probability. In the face of his own oncoming death, he didn\u2019t give way to despair. Instead he elected to spend his time making this stony desert bloom.</p> <p>He planted irises and roses directly into the shingle, encouraging a riot of wallflowers and valerian, \u201call the dark humours blown away by the wind\u201d. This wild, unfenced arcadia sustained him through the political battles of his final years, and has now outlived him by more than quarter of a century. Last time I visited, in December, it was still humming with power.</p> <p>I have the same feeling when I look at photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans or read a novel by Ali Smith. I had it when I went to see my friend Rich\u2019s degree show at Goldsmiths and he\u2019d made dozens of ceramic razor clams and anemones, downed planes and nubbly coral reefs. It\u2019s a feeling of being inducted back into hope, a restoration of faith. It\u2019s easy to give into despair. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s frightening, so much that\u2019s wrong. But if this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat, even when we can\u2019t touch.

More than 80% of donated blood collected from the Red Cross is from drives at places closed for social distancing: workplaces, schools, and college campuses.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, American Red Cross faces a severe blood shortage due to an unprecedented number of blood drive cancellations during this coronavirus outbreak,\u201d the organization <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/give-blood.html\">said</a>, urging healthy persons to donate blood, platelets and plasma. \u201cThis blood shortage could impact patients who need surgery, victims of car accidents and other emergencies, or patients fighting cancer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis could lead to mortality,\u201d said Dr Jennifer Andrews, director of the blood bank at Vanderbilt University medical center and pediatric hematologist. \u201cThis could kill our patients.\u201d</p> <p>Vanderbilt\u2019s medical complex, like many other US hospitals, mainly receives its blood supply from American Red Cross.</p> <p>\u201cThis is really serious \u2013 it\u2019s put many large hospitals, like Vanderbilt, in a crunch, where we\u2019re not expecting our usual deliveries from the American Red Cross,\u201d Andrews told the Guardian.</p> <p>While the blood banking industry is \u201cquite cooperative with each other\u201d, with other suppliers willing to fill in when need be, smaller suppliers are also affected by donation declines.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, with all these blood donors not coming in to donate as they usually do, it\u2019s happening across the nation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for the worst. There are no blood alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201cPatients with leukemia or other cancers, patients who are in a motor vehicle accident or bleeding after childbirth \u2013 they need blood.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors elsewhere have also sounded the alarm over blood shortages.</p> <p>\u201cI am looking at the refrigerator that contains only one day\u2019s supply of blood for the hospital,\u201d Dr Robertson Davenport, transfusion medicine director at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor, <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/press-release/2020/american-red-cross-faces-severe-blood-shortage-as-coronavirus-outbreak-threatens-availability-of-nations-supply.html\">said</a> in an American Red Cross statement. \u201cThe hospital is full. There are patients who need blood and cannot wait.\u201d</p> <p>Red Cross officials believe there will be even more donor cancelations, making the blood shortage all the more dire.</p> <p>While blood drives do entail person-to-person contact, the American Red Cross and public health authorities maintain that donating remains safe. The American Red Cross said it had launched additional safety precautions for donors and staff.</p> <p>The ramped-up safety measures include temperature checks before donors enter a blood drive or donation center. When possible, staff will also space beds to foster social distancing between donors.</p> <p>Blankets generally used by platelet, <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/types-of-blood-donations/power-red-donation.html\">red blood cell</a>, and A-B plasma donors will be washed after each use. Staff will also enhance disinfection of equipment and give out hand sanitizer before and during donation appointments, the organization said.</p> <p>Blood donation authorities have emphasized blood donors are not in danger of contacting coronavirus from donating.</p> <p>In a statement, the not-for-profit organization America\u2019s Blood Centers emphasized that \u201cthere is no known risk to the safety of the nation\u2019s blood supply\u201d due to coronavirus.</p> <ul> <li><p>To donate blood, visit <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html\">redcrossblood.org</a></p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Infections pass 1,000 in Japan, Australia and Canada.</h2> <p>Japan recorded 1,016 cases of coronavirus as of Saturday. The tally rises to 1,728 if the 712 infections from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was stranded at port near Tokyo last month are included. The death toll in the country, including fatalities from the ship, is 43.</p> <p>In Australia, 1,049 cases of Covid-19, and seven deaths, have been reported<strong>. </strong>And Canada has 1,044 cases, and 13 deaths.</p> <h2>WHO warns young people \u2018not invincible\u2019</h2> <p>While the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are the hardest hit by the virus, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned young people: \u201cyou are not invincible\u201d. Urging young people to act responsibly, he said: \u201cThis virus could put you in hospital for weeks \u2013 or even kill you.\u201d</p> <h2>UK closures come into force</h2> <p>In Britain, pubs, cafes, gyms and restaurants closed for business on Friday night as the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">announced an unprecedented wage-support scheme </a>to try to prevent a wave of job losses.</p> <h2>Bondi Beach temporarily closed as Australians told to take social distancing seriously</h2> <p>The New South Wales government temporarily closed Bondi Beach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/21/bondi-beach-closed-down-after-crowds-defy-ban-on-gatherings-of-more-than-500-people\">after thousands flocked there on Friday and Saturday</a>, when temperatures were unseasonably hot.

  "<p>Celebrities have always been the symmetrical, smiling face of wealth inequality. Their role in modern life is as paradoxical as trickle-down economics: to be preternaturally charming and attractive, but also relatable and attainably aspirational. We speak of \u201cliking\u201d one celebrity and \u201cdisliking\u201d another on the basis of the professionally calibrated personas they beam out to us as sincerity. We enjoy their work \u2013 their acting, their singing, their athleticism \u2013 and we cheer on their successes. They are purveyors of a great American myth: that there is such a thing as \u201cwell-earned\u201d luxury, or a \u201cdeserving\u201d millionaire.</p> <p>And in America, fame doesn\u2019t just make you rich: it makes you a role model. So it makes sense that over the past, terrifying week \u2013 a week which has set the foundation of modern life shaking like the San Andreas fault \u2013 we have seen a slew of beloved celebrities solemnly, dutifully announcing that they have received a positive test result for Covid-19. Idris Elba, Kevin Durant, Daniel Dae Kim. Many of these celebrities, including the entire roster of the Brooklyn Nets, were tested on the basis of their potentially having been in contact with a confirmed infected person; many, including Elba, were asymptomatic. Tom Hanks and his wife were fortunate to be in Australia when they got symptoms - testing there is much more widely available.</p> <p>Still other celebrities have announced their <em>negative</em> test results, including Heidi Klum and Kris Jenner. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-testing-elite.html\">As the New York Times notes</a>, some of these celebrities \u2013 like Klum \u2013 received tests after using their platforms to complain about not being able to get tested.</p> <p>Covid-19 is a terrifying virus, and I genuinely hope that the celebrities who have contracted it recover fully. I have no doubt that their being tested will benefit many others, especially those who work alongside them and now know to self-isolate. In an ideal world, these celebrities would<em> </em>be tested, because we would <em>all </em>be tested, but that is not the world we live in. Instead, these celebrity Covid-19 tests have happened alongside a broader failure to test everyday citizens and residents in the US and the UK, including medical workers, those in at-risk groups, and those experiencing serious, even hospitalization-requiring symptoms. Medical workers are not being tested, and each day brings new stories of sick, vulnerable people who are refused testing. We know that testing is a key to derailing this virus\u2019s path of destruction. The communities that get tested fast and early \u2013 which, in test-strapped countries, appear to primarily be the communities of the wealthy and powerful \u2013 will be far better protected.</p> <p>Watching yet another celebrity announce that they have been tested (often while asymptomatic) feels like watching a medical drama that takes place on another planet. Meanwhile, the rest of us wait: not just for tests, but for the after-effects that a lack of testing will bring upon our communities, and upon the communities of those we love.</p> <p>The reaction of the internet community to celebrity Covid-19 testing has been, broadly, predictable. \u201cNot Uncle Idris!\u201d some cry. \u201cTom Hanks!? Who do I have to fight?\u201d Is this how we would react if, say, a hedge fund manager announced his Covid-19 status? Of course, Elba and Hanks\u2019s job is to play characters like Stringer Bell and Forrest Gump, <em>not</em> to directly manipulate markets and profit off of the financial devastation of everyday workers. But celebrities are, at the end of the day, multimillionaires and direct beneficiaries of staggering wealth inequality. And they\u2019re not only receiving better medical care than you \u2013 certainly, that\u2019s old news \u2013 but they\u2019re receiving access to a vital and very limited resource, one which should be allocated on the basis of priority, not privilege, especially at a time of international crisis. Strategically allocating tests would save countless lives; allocating tests on the basis of wealth and access will mean lives lost across every socioeconomic demographic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The wealthy and the powerful are counting on us not paying attention. They\u2019re looking out for their own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, that seems to be a lesson of this virus: it shows us who and what gets protected, as the ship sinks. On the Titanic, it was women and children. With Covid-19, it\u2019s the wealthy and powerful. Testing is just one part of the class story unfolding: everyday workers are being laid off en masse while the wealthiest industries begin batting their eyelashes at trillion-dollar bailouts. Researchers race to develop treatments and a vaccine for Covid-19 while billion-dollar firms fight to monetize their findings in advance. Low-paid \u201ckey workers\u201d \u2013 nurses, orderlies, delivery drivers, teachers, grocery store attendants and social caregivers \u2013 put themselves at greater risk of contracting the virus in order to keep society running, while generously paid employees in less-essential industries work from home. Mortgage holidays are set in place without a mention of rent relief. Contract workers, gig economy workers and service industry workers face complete financial devastation while unseen parasitic financiers (and, in a few instances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\">millionaire politicians</a>) play the market like Monopoly, round and round, collecting big as they pass Go.</p> <p>The wealthy and the powerful are counting on us not paying attention. They\u2019re looking out for their own: the hedge funders, the landlords, the pharmaceutical billionaires. They\u2019re counting on our attention being elsewhere \u2013 not Uncle Idris! Not Forrest Gump! \u2013 and they\u2019re counting on our anger losing steam by the time this international nightmare ends. They\u2019re counting on us taking it \u2013 as President Trump tells it \u2013 as \u201cthe story of life\u201d. Meanwhile, we\u2019re learning to look after ourselves. Community aid organisations proliferate, offering local, grassroots support to those in isolation. Nurses, orderlies and doctors charge ahead, fighting for testing, fighting for patients\u2019 lives. We do what we can to check in on those we love, and to look out for those we do not know.</p> <p>When this is over, I hope we\u2019ll remember who got thrown the life jackets, who got in the lifeboats. I hope we\u2019ll remember how the rest of us were left on the sinking ship, to save each other in the small ways that we could. I hope we have the energy to fight for structural change, once we\u2019ve thrashed and paddled our way back to the shore.</p> <p>And I hope whichever actor wins an Oscar for their portrayal of a delivery worker during the Covid-19 crisis donates all of their earnings to medical research.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 March &amp; 24 2020 to make it clear that Tom Hanks and his wife showed symptoms of Covid-19 and were treated in Australia where testing is much more widely available and to illustrate the article with an image of Idris Elba.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jennifer Schaffer is an American writer living in London</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>So all-consuming and all-conquering has Disney become, it even owns the rights to its analogies now. First Disney was Marvel supervillain Thanos, relentlessly acquiring pop culture\u2019s Infinity Stones including Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel itself \u2013 all the better to obliterate half the Hollywood universe. Having swallowed up its rival 21st Century Fox for a colossal $71bn, Disney became the Death Star \u2013 an empire so intimidatingly huge and hungry it reduced its rivals to the status of scattered rebels. Last year, Disney dominated the movies like no studio has before, taking more than 38% of the world\u2019s box office. Now, with its streaming service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/12/which-streaming-stick-should-i-buy-for-disney\">Disney+</a> rolling out, Disney is like Simba in The Lion King: as Mufasa tells him, \u201ceverything the light touches is our kingdom\u201d.</p> <p>Maybe not quite everything, yet. But Disney\u2019s gravitational pull is warping the very space-time continuum of the media landscape. You will have to work harder than ever to escape the Magic Kingdom\u2019s reach. If it doesn\u2019t get you with the Avengers, it will get you with The Simpsons, or <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/\">National Geographic</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson\">Wes Anderson</a>. If it doesn\u2019t get you with Elsa sticking plasters, it will get you with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/03/baby-yoda-the-mandalorian-star-wars\">Baby Yoda</a> memes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"126260977f24b2cbdcf489c74c20e308c5742d0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/126260977f24b2cbdcf489c74c20e308c5742d0b/0_49_1787_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Disney CEO Bob Chapek, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnie driver\u2026 new Disney CEO Bob Chapek, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can anything stop Disney? Are the rebels\u2019 weapons useless against it? Or might the Death Star contain a fatal design flaw? One potential wrinkle came last month with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/25/disney-chief-executive-bob-iger-announces-surprise-exit\">surprise resignation of Disney\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger</a>. His successor was also a surprise: the unheard-of Bob Chapek, formerly head of Disney\u2019s theme-parks division. Iger, who was scheduled to retire at the end of 2021, will stay on as chairman to \u201cmake sure that our creative pipelines are vibrant\u201d. Inevitably, the relationship between the two Bobs has been likened to that of \u201cSith apprentice and Sith lord\u201d, though given Chapek\u2019s background, he is also an uncanny parallel to Tom Wambsgans, Matthew Macfadyen\u2019s character in HBO\u2019s Succession, who plots his ascent from the lowly resorts division of the Roy media empire \u2013 at last, an analogy Disney doesn\u2019t own.</p> <p>Iger was very much the architect of Disney\u2019s spectacular renaissance. By all accounts a straight-talking, decidedly un-Thanos-like New Yorker, he rose through the ranks of ABC television before Disney acquired it in 1996. In his autobiography, Iger recalls his first board meeting as Disney CEO in 2005. He got straight to the point and said: \u201cAs you all know, Disney Animation is a real mess.\u201d On a visit to Hong Kong Disneyland he had noticed that most of the characters in the parade were from Disney movies past, with barely any from the last decade.</p> <p>His solution was to go shopping. It helped that Iger had personal relationships with some key people \u2013 such as Steve Jobs, whom he persuaded to sell Pixar to Disney in 2006, for $7.4bn. He also got Jobs to vouch for him to Ike Perlmutter, owner of Marvel. Iger also had a relationship with George Lucas, which helped him acquire Lucasfilm. Rather than \u201cDisneyfying\u201d these assets, Iger was smart enough to let each of them operate independently. As he told Pixar\u2019s bosses: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for us to buy you for what you are and then turn you into something else.\u201d In fact, he imported Pixar\u2019s culture to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/18/frozen-ii-how-disney-left-other-animation-studios-out-in-the-cold\">rejuvenate Disney\u2019s own animation department</a>, just as he sidelined Perlmutter to give free rein to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/11/kevin-feige-martin-scorsese-marvel-studios-superhero-movies\">Kevin Feige</a>, the mastermind of Marvel\u2019s spectacular movie series. Considering Avengers: Endgame has taken close to $3bn alone, that $4bn price tag for Marvel looks like a sound investment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e85a62d447526bcf2a6c31672a0fc826f0a7fdf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e85a62d447526bcf2a6c31672a0fc826f0a7fdf0/0_0_3343_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Simpsons are now part of the Disney family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homer\u2019s new home\u2026 The Simpsons are now part of the Disney family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iger and Disney also had the good fortune to be stocking the cupboard just as the whole media landscape was tilting in favour of \u201cover the top\u201d streaming services. Having vanquished its old Hollywood rivals, Disney now finds itself facing the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+, HBO Max (which launches in the US in May), and Comcast/NBCUniversal\u2019s forthcoming Peacock. \u201cThe old guard of the traditional entertainment business is going through changes nobody would have predicted even five years ago,\u201d says Cynthia Littleton, business editor at Variety. \u201cSo there was a real feeling that if Disney did not prepare for the future, they could become a takeover target by a gigantic tech firm.\u201d She describes Iger as a \u201conce-in-a-generation executive\u201d. \u201cHe gets a lot of credit for looking out at the landscape and saying: \u2018We need to do this and we need to do this now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Littleton does not imagine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/21/disney-streaming-service-to-launch-earlier-in-uk-on-24-march\">Disney+</a> will catch up with Netflix\u2019s 160 million subscribers any time soon. Its stated target was 60 to 90 million, although it already has 30 million subscribers in the US, and some analysts are predicting it could reach 130 million in five years. \u201cI think they expect to be a really strong competitor, but they don\u2019t see it as a zero sum game.\u201d</p> <p>One weak spot in the plan is the content. Disney+ gives you more than 500 movies and 350 series from the Disney/Pixar/Star Wars/Marvel back catalogue, not to mention National Geographic and 30 seasons of The Simpsons \u2013 all for a very competitive \u00a35.99 a month (compared to \u00a38.99 for HD Netflix). But much of it is aimed at children and families. Flagship Star Wars spin-off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/12/the-mandalorian-review-star-wars-jon-favreau\">The Mandalorian</a> has been a runaway success, but grownup subscribers expecting more of the same might be disappointed. Much of Disney+\u2019s original content either plays it safe or pitches it wrong. There are family-friendly reboots such as High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and a live-action Lady and the Tramp; there are new series such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7aN9OkNl7U\">The World According to Jeff Goldblum</a>, in which the actor cocks a quizzical eyebrow at, you know, stuff. And there are dispiritingly on-brand shows like Disney\u2019s Fairy Tale Weddings (couples getting married at Disney theme parks), or Be Our Chef, in which families compete to make a Disney-themed dish to serve at Disney World. You have to wonder how vibrant those \u201ccreative pipelines\u201d are right now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca94125c71bf4122c4badbd2acb4050ac03962c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca94125c71bf4122c4badbd2acb4050ac03962c9/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yifei Liu in Disney\u2019s delayed live-action Mulan remake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kick-ass too\u2026 Yifei Liu in Disney\u2019s delayed live-action Mulan remake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasin Boland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the Mandalorian demographic, there are some Marvel spin-offs further down the pipeline: The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (due in August, although production has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis) and WandaVision (December). But shows have been cancelled or long-delayed, including a Tron-themed series and Star Wars spin-off Obi-Wan. Other, edgier fare has been moved to the streaming service Hulu in the US (it owns that, too), such as Love, Victor \u2013 inspired by the hit movie Love, Simon, with a gay protagonist dealing with his sexuality. The latter suggests Disney is keeping things \u201cfamily friendly\u201d, which could be tantamount to playing to a conservative common denominator.</p> <p>It is a similar picture in the movie world. With so many universes coming under the Disney umbrella, and so much return required of its investments, there is the fear that Planet Disney will now simply eject a steady stream of sequels and spin-offs. But with both the Marvel and Star Wars sagas reaching some kind of conclusion last year, you wonder how much appetite there is for more of the same. Disney and Pixar are still putting out original stories but, again, their big successes of late have been sequels such as Toy Story 4 and Frozen II, or remakes of Disney classics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/11/the-lion-king-review-anthro-leonine-clones-original\">such as The Lion King</a>.</p> <p>Next in the pipeline comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/08/mulan-first-trailer-for-disney-live-action-reboot-released\">a live-action remake of Mulan</a>, which could expose another compromising aspect of Disney\u2019s supremacy. China is vital to Disney\u2019s growth, and the Mouse House has learned its lesson with Mao\u2019s house, so to speak. Its 1997 movie Kundun (directed by Scorsese) led to a virtual shutout by the Chinese authorities for its pro-Tibetan stance. Disney has, by all accounts, been making huge efforts to get back in ever since. It finally succeeded in 2016, with the opening of the $5.5bn Shanghai Disneyland, which Iger described as \u201cthe biggest accomplishment of my career\u201d. But Disney only owns 43% of it; the rest is in the hands of the Chinese government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5726464c241d78852e203464debf6bf203406827\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5726464c241d78852e203464debf6bf203406827/0_0_2397_1598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disney+ release The Mandalorian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star wares\u2026 Disney+ release The Mandalorian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney+/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the new Mulan is unlikely to be taking any chances. The story looks to be closer to the original Chinese legend than the 1998 animation: no Eddie Murphy-voiced comedy dragon, and no sexuality-subverting relationship with officer Li Shang, who falls for Mulan when she is pretending to be a man. It could still be a great movie, but Mulan betrays a concern over just how much Disney is honing its product according to commercial and political considerations. When Walt Disney opened Disneyland in 1955, he dedicated it to \u201cthe ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America\u201d. But Disney the company no longer represents American values; it seeks to embody those of the world \u2013 potentially including its most repressive regimes.</p> <p>This is not to suggest Disney is inherently problematic, or that it is doing anything the rest of Hollywood isn\u2019t also doing. Against these totalitarian fears, you could set such frontier-pushing mainstream films as Black Panther or Captain Marvel or Moana \u2013 all of which have made radical steps in terms of representation and inclusion. Or Disney\u2019s laudable embrace of the LGBT+ community (Mulan aside): it has hosted unofficial \u201cGay Days\u201d at Disney World for more than 20 years. Disney\u2019s dominance is not simply down to deep pockets; its reputation was built on courage and innovation. Despite its flops, it has consistently set the bar creatively.</p> <p>So you could see Disney as a machine designed to exploit the masses by any means, or you could see it as a creative coalition striving to make the best possible fare. Either way, we have never seen a kingdom like Disney\u2019s, except, perhaps, in one of its movies. In The Lion King, Mufasa gives the young Simba a portfolio-management lesson straight out of the Iger playbook. \u201cEverything you see exists together in a delicate balance,\u201d he says. \u201cAs king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.\u201d To which Simba replies: \u201cBut Dad. Don\u2019t we eat the antelope?\u201d</p> <p>Still, having established itself as entertainment\u2019s apex predator, is a last-minute plot twist in store? The coronavirus has disrupted the landscape immeasurably, and Disney has been disproportionately hit. As the biggest player, it has had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/13/disney-delays-release-of-mulan-the-new-mutants-and-antlers-as-black-widow-speculation-grows\">delay more high-profile releases</a> than any other studio \u2013 including Mulan, which was due out on 27 March, and halt production on more movies. It has also had to close all of its theme parks, which is revenue it will never get back. The parks and products division makes up roughly 50% of Disney\u2019s profits. In addition, another of its acquisitions, the leading US sports channel ESPN, has no actual sports to broadcast. It is suddenly looking vulnerable. In the past month or so, the company has lost about a third of its value \u2013 some $85bn. There is speculation that Apple could be contemplating a takeover bid. Having devoured its rivals, will Disney be unable to fight off an even larger predator? That would be the ultimate irony. Or perhaps it\u2019s just the circle of life.</p> <p><em>Disney+ is available on various platforms from Tuesday 24 March</em></p>",

You can console yourself, momentarily, with the timetables that parents are drawing up and putting on Twitter: 9am to 11am, Frozen; 11am to 11.05am, pizza; 11.05am to 1pm, fighting; 1pm to 3pm, Frozen II. But this will kill only 30 seconds. Even the most anarchic parent will recognise that they have to find a fruitful way to fill the days, which means trying to replicate the formal education the kids are missing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.educationotherwise.org/index.php/approaches\">Education Otherwise</a>, the primary English home-schooling organisation (it has a Welsh arm; <a href=\"http://www.schoolhouse.org.uk/\">Scotland has Schoolhouse</a>), describes parents\u2019 two core approaches: structured or autonomous. Structured learning follows the school day and curriculum; there is a solid argument that, since you intend for your children to go back to school and the school will give you materials (all primary and secondary schools are making plans to this effect), this is the way to go. If you are of an autonomous bent, however \u2013 keen to follow the Platonic ideal: \u201cDo not train a child to learn by force or harshness, but direct them to it by what amuses their minds\u201d \u2013 that is also legitimate. Your children are unlikely to get hopelessly behind. They might even come out knowing more about creative writing than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/09/fronted-adverbials-sats-grammar-test-primary\">fronted adverbials</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When children are engaged and active their focus can be incredible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amanda Grace is the deputy head teacher of Macaulay Church of England primary school in Lambeth, London; she also has two sons at secondary school. She is clear on the structured approach: \u201cStart every morning with a timetable and stick to your timings. Use language such as \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d. For younger children, you can build in very clear timings such as 10 minutes\u2019 reading followed by 10 minutes\u2019 Lego, role playing, chase games or exercises.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Wilson, 19, was home-schooled between the ages of 12 and 13. While he and his mother, the film-maker Beadie Finzi, describe a lot of creative learning, sometimes only tangentially related to the curriculum, he says: \u201cWe put together quite a formal timetable. The routine aspect is important. If you\u2019re just: \u2018At some point we\u2019ll do this,\u2019 you\u2019ll fall into the trap of not ever getting anything done.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Children under five</strong></h2> <p>I just made myself laugh out loud by attempting to start this paragraph with \u201carguably\u201d. There is no argument: this is the hardest age to do yourself. Whether you have one, two or three under-fives, all those situations are uniquely challenging (loneliness, squabbling or constant squabbling).</p> <p>On the plus side, a lot of the formal learning requirements are things you would do instinctively: communication and language development; fine motor movements; large movements and coordination; reading and writing; counting and adding; shape, space and measures; and expressive arts and design. There is a section on understanding \u2013 the world, people and communities, technology \u2013 and, sincerely, where would any of us start? The challenges in this age group will be around letting off steam, especially if you can\u2019t leave the house, not being able to socialise, especially for a child without siblings, maintaining concentration, especially your own, and mess.</p> <p>Keep your timetable realistic. You will not conclude a slime-making session in less than an hour; you will probably not spend more than 10 minutes at a go, reading. Make as much use of your garden as you can (for communication, all motor skills, understanding the world). In the pre- or only just-verbal age group, it\u2019s hard to explain what\u2019s going on in a reassuring way; you can download a really good, illustrated booklet <a href=\"https://www.mindheart.co/descargables\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Five to eight</h2> <p>By this point, you\u2019ll have materials from school, and can base your day around that. Now they\u2019ve got some fine motor skills, you can build in some practical experiments, which can be either directly or indirectly germane to the curriculum. Making sugar crystals, exploding baking powder and vinegar, putting eggs in Coke, dyeing noodles in unicorn colours: all of this will genuinely (I\u2019m not even joking) come up in the science curriculum, and can be spaced out over several days, which will give a sense of the world still turning. Cooking is obviously useful for maths, especially in the earlier years. And kids of this age are still biddable enough to engage in physical enterprise, like home circuits, music and movement. \u201cAnything you can do with physical actions will also enhance their focus,\u201d Grace says. \u201cGetting children to stand behind their chair and make up actions for factual learning also helps break it up and make it more fun. Anything that can be turned into a game or a competition also galvanises focus dramatically.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a400b6f69f947c2698f5e6d9dda68c8fcf9ece5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a400b6f69f947c2698f5e6d9dda68c8fcf9ece5/0_419_3284_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Child studying at a table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t expect them to listen to you taking for hours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of them will be approaching key stage 1, and the school will certainly have areas that they want you to cover, although these tests were always about measuring schools more than pupils, and it seems likely to me that we\u2019ll find creative ways around the data gap. So don\u2019t pile pressure on them, but likewise, don\u2019t underestimate them. \u201cWhen children are engaged and active,\u201d Grace says, \u201ctheir focus can be incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t expect them to listen to you drone on for hours. \u201cWhen it comes to listening to any sort of teaching input, we have an old adage in the profession that the time in minutes that you talk to your class should never be more than the children\u2019s age in years plus two. The key here is in children being active and unearthing the learning themselves as far as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Sit next to them while you\u2019re actively trying to help them understand. Grace continues: \u201cQuestions should be open, such as \u2018tell me more about that\u2019, \u2018what made you think that, \u2018what did you know already that led you to do that question in that way?\u2019 \u2018Tell me how you did it\u2019, \u2018Did the way you approached that work \u2013 why/why not?\u2019 \u2018What would you change next time and why?\u2019 Take a little time to look up \u2018Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy\u2019 online.\u201d</p> <p>At this, and indeed, all ages, \u201cYou cannot over-encourage a child,\u201d Grace says. \u201cTry to give time frames and tangible rewards. Young children love a sticker. A hug and a jump around for completing the task at hand is also highly effective and can be explicitly built into the day\u2019s timetable. Timers work well, as do clear expectations such as: \u2018When I check in 10 minutes time, you will have written up to this line.\u2019</p> <h2>Nine to 11</h2> <p>They are approaching key stage 2 , but the same rider applies as to key stage 1: really try to minimise stress. There is even more material at this stage, both online and in the meat world, that you\u2019ll be able to access through the school or online. The BBC is putting out its educational content, BBC Bitesize and BBC Teach, on iPlayer, as well as doing two bespoke educational podcasts a day on BBC Sounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ee3aebd273b5a2e76c4e33ac71cb99bb05d54cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee3aebd273b5a2e76c4e33ac71cb99bb05d54cf/0_336_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You will get through a lot because you are not waiting for 29 others kids\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You will get through a lot because you are not waiting for 29 others kids.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There will upsides. Wilson remembers: \u201cYou have to plan quite far ahead, because you\u2019re going to get through an enormous amount of things. What would take a class a week will take you a day, easily, because you\u2019re not waiting for 29 other people to finish.\u201d</p> <p>Beadie Finzi, his mother, recommends bringing in other family members, though obviously for 2020 that depends who is well and how old they are. \u201cWhile me and Alex [Wilson\u2019s father] had some emotional bandwidth, we would have lost our minds if we\u2019d done it all. And the conversations that Ben had with Uncle Tony about biology, he\u2019ll remember for the rest of his life, because they were wild.\u201d If you can think of people \u2013 other parents, family members \u2013 who are particularly good at a subject, you can organise group tutorials on platforms like Skype or Zoom.</p> <p>While you probably want to cover off the curriculum, you\u2019ll have time to do other things. Kerstin Rodgers home-schooled her daughter for a year at the end of primary school. \u201cMy boyfriend at the time was very interested in self-sufficiency, he was a bit of a prepper. So my daughter was quite adept with an axe at age nine.\u201d If the early years were all about \u201ccooking, designing, problem-solving, experimenting, water play using the bath or sink,\u201d Grace says, at this age you can \u201cmake up plays or compose letters and cards for grandparents, Skype the plays, put together Powerpoint presentations to share. Anything with a real-life purpose is far more appealing to children.\u201d</p> <h2>Twelve and above</h2> <p>OK, deep breath: this might involve some arguing against Fortnite or TikTok. The cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels has left some teens ashen about the loss of their life\u2019s work, others celebrating, some doing both in cycles of five minutes. Emphasise that the learning was and is precious in its own right, and the exams were only ever a pretty random temperature check on the infinitely vast and beautiful ecosystem of their giant brains. Or something.</p> <p>This does mean continuing to take the learning seriously, and trying to match the five hours of learning they would do at school. Most secondary schools will have a homework app and be funnelling through what they consider at least the necessary work, if not more. So apart from having to bend them to your will, the challenge is whether or not you can help if you don\u2019t understand it yourself.</p> <p>\u201cThe first port of call is to see if your child can explain it to you,\u201d Grace suggests. \u201cIn doing so, their own learning will become far more concrete. When you look things up online, be careful to put in the level of understanding that you need; is it for key stage 2 or GCSE?\u201d Rodgers was actually trying to teach her daughter in French, her own second language, but coped with that better than the maths and science. \u201cThey way they teach those things has obviously moved on a lot from when we did them. So you\u2019re having to learn it all again.\u201d</p> <p>Look things up. Consult widely (by which I mean, ask Twitter). Try not come off as interfering. Kids are never too old to be diverted by arts and crafts. Consider a more advanced science kit, so you can blow things up. Let them have some privacy. Encourage them to talk to their friends after school, and especially if you\u2019re self-isolating. Wilson recalls: \u201cWhen I was 12, I didn\u2019t have a phone. Which meant your friendships were at school, and that was it. I remember being incredibly lonely at points. This is what parents should prioritise. Technology makes it a bit easier. It\u2019s definitely the trickiest aspect to get right.\u201d Play a lot of cards.</p> <p>\u201cIf you do have a large family,\u201d Grace says, \u201cmaybe there is a small project that a group of the children can work on together, such as a collage or painting while you hear one of them read or tackle the maths problems.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, don\u2019t be too hard on yourself or them; if you need to throw in the towel for the day, do it. Both Finzi and Rodgers dropped the timetable if they had to, and they have magnificent children (Ben Wilson is now in his first year at Sussex University; Kerstin\u2019s daughter is Sienna Rodgers, who was an alternative samba band leader at age 8, and became editor of Labour List at age 23). Sometimes life feels like a marathon done at a sprint, and this is one of those times. We don\u2019t have to win it \u2013 we just have to live it.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Land of poems and stories: the Cotswolds</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf ever I heard blessing it is there. Where birds in trees that shoals and shadows are.\u201d In April and May the Cotswold landscape still speaks in the soft, calm tones of Laurie Lee. For a first-time visitor it can take a while to tune into the hard, spare, wall-bound fields of the Cotswold plateau. Yet in the valleys and on the scarp edges, there are bluebells and wood anemones, clear spring-fed streams and a soundtrack of willow warblers and blackcaps, fresh back from their winter travels.</p> <p>The deep valleys around Stroud hold hanging woods, filled in April with the scent of wild garlic. At the National Trust-maintained <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/woodchester-park\" title=\"\">Woodchester Park</a>, where the half-completed Victorian manor stands mysterious in the valley bottom, it feels as though the clock has stopped and no one has yet arrived to restart it.</p> <p>Further north, in my home patch, the same timeless feel pervades <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hailes-abbey\" title=\"\">Hailes Abbey</a>, with, above it, a monument marking Thomas Cromwell\u2019s seat, from which it is said he watched the Abbey burn almost 500 years ago. From here you can walk a couple of miles along the Cotswold Way to Winchcombe.</p> <p>Spring is a wonderful time to explore smaller towns and villages, many of which are the subject of poems and stories. For me, each name conjures a memory: a village cricket match in April snow at <a href=\"https://www.cotswolds.info/places/guiting-power.shtml\" title=\"\">Guiting Power</a>; my childhood love of <a href=\"https://www.cotswolds.info/places/bibury.shtml\" title=\"\">Bibury</a>, with its row of ancient cottages, river, watermill and trout farm. The trout leaping for dancing mayflies in the spring.</p> <p>Today, an April treat is a long run or walk to listen to yellowhammers and skylarks along the Cotswolds\u2019 western edge, from Winchcombe to Broadway.

Just getting there is an adventure, as you are sometimes in a race against the incoming tide. For one of the great joys of being on Lindisfarne is that when the three-mile-long causeway closes (for around 10 hours a day) no one can get on or off.</p> <p>Tourists and pilgrims head to the medieval priory ruins or Lindisfarne Castle, but it\u2019s the island\u2019s expansive beauty, tranquillity and coastal walks that draw me here. When the tide starts coming in and the daytrippers scuttle back to the mainland, I stay on and pretend that I\u2019m a local.</p> <p>I first visited five years ago, on a cold winter\u2019s eve, but I resolved to return and have done three times since.</p> <p>In spring (May is best) the island is quieter than in crowded high summer, the wildflowers are beginning to burst into colour \u2013 look out for golden marsh-marigolds, lilac lady\u2019s smock and pale blue forget-me-nots. Seabirds reel about in the sky, and you\u2019ll hear the song of tiny meadow pipits and long-tailed pied wagtails.</p> <p>This is the time when I, too, like to shake off my hibernal self and walk, in glorious solitude, past the harbour and castle, up the east coast path to Emmanuel Head, and then turn west to the wild, windy three-mile strip of sand that is North Shore.</p> <p>If I set out before the causeway opens \u2013 the route via the castle up to the North Shore is along higher ground and not affected by the tides \u2013 I have this perfect walk to myself. Along the way, it\u2019s a joy to meander down into the coves and beaches.</p> <p>Coves Haven beach, which sits just past Sandham Bay, is my favourite place to pause for a sandwich or sip from my flask of tea.</p> <p>At this time of year, I\u2019m buoyed by the air that is less bite and more caress, the sun, surprisingly strong when it\u2019s out, the swaying of the marram grass, the ghostly cry of the seals and the eider ducks \u2013 which sound as though you\u2019ve just told them a filthy joke.</p> <p>Fair weather or not, Lindisfarne is very special, a place I go to dive into peace and listen deeply to nature, alive in the salty, sea air.<br><strong>Jini Reddy, whose new book, <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wanderland-9781472951939/\" title=\"\">Wanderland</a>, is out on 30 April (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99)</strong><br><br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018My whole being relaxes\u2019: Rathlin Island, Co Antrim</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbc2dd7f1df47423cdb3f525b9071e3c9c07da08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc2dd7f1df47423cdb3f525b9071e3c9c07da08/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Church bay, Rathlin Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church Bay, Rathlin Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Ricordi, Italy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My first visit to Rathlin Island was a birthday celebration. I had turned 14, it was early spring, and this wild initiation deeply affected the way I experienced the natural world. Watching the web of life resurge in spring on Rathlin is a rare and unique awakening. Catching the ferry from Ballycastle, you land on an island that is hardly changed by time. Our world is spinning, seemingly uncontrollably, but on arriving somewhere like Rathlin Island, the uncoiling is instant. The reconnection with nature and ourselves, the unburdening, is hard to avoid here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a38062a39c46ee1199d83daa4a33730101f20008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38062a39c46ee1199d83daa4a33730101f20008/1427_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"A fulmar off the cliffs of Rathlin Island.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fulmar off the cliffs of Rathlin Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The island, shaped like a sycamore seed, lies off the north-east coast of Northern Ireland. Its rugged cliffs are home to the largest sea bird colony in the north of the island of Ireland, and of course, this was why I first begged to go. I longed to see the spring abundance, the birds arriving from sea to breed. Thousands of beating wings. Heart-splitting symphonic sound. The <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/rathlin-island/\" title=\"\">West Light Seabird Observatory</a>, managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, is where you go to view the clamouring. Fulmars, guillemots, razorbills and gannets congregate in spring, and in early summer puffins join the colony. The cascading movement of birds and waves draws out all the cumbersome weight of the world.</p> <p>My whole being relaxes on Rathlin. The east of the island smells of salted dry wood, like an old ship hauled up on to horseshoe-shaped Church Bay. The community shop and little museum are crammed with wonderful island remnants. </p> <p>Looking out to sea from Church Bay, you might see the surface perforated by surging seals. From the surrounding meadows and farmland, you might hear the bubbling of lapwings, mewing buzzards, the nightly winnowing of a snipe. In Kebble nature reserve in the west of the island you can, in spring, spot the unusual<a href=\"https://wildflowerfinder.org.uk/Flowers/B/Bugle(Pyramidal)/Bugle(Pyramidal).htm\" title=\"\"> pyramidal bugle</a>, one of the rarest wildflowers in the British Isles. Then, out of the corner of your eye, you may see a sprite of light: a golden, blue-eyed Irish hare, the will-o-the-wisp of the island. This heady wild wonderland is magnetic: if you visit once, it will reel you back in. <br><strong>Dara McAnulty, 15</strong><strong>, author of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/littletoller/photos/a.1019993704701932/2633401206694499/?type=1&amp;theater\" title=\"\">Diary of a Young Naturalist</a>, out 5 June (Little Toller, \u00a316)</strong><br><br></p> <h2><strong>England\u2019s loneliest hike: Dengie peninsula, Essex</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ad921ad266b6d00ec74d6343701c33532ff9f34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ad921ad266b6d00ec74d6343701c33532ff9f34/0_62_5681_3408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Saxon chapel of Saint Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Saxon chapel of Saint Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Grist/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bradwell-on-Sea on the Dengie peninsula is my favourite place in spring: it\u2019s 27 miles from my home, 43 minutes via country lanes in full blossom to this 30 acres of shell beach awash with ghosts and calm \u2013 plus we can take the dog.</p> <p>I feel the past the moment we arrive. The seventh-century chapel, <a href=\"https://www.bradwellchapel.org/home.html\" title=\"\">St Peter-on-the-Wall</a>, overlooks the cockleshell dunes where late-pagan Britons were converted to Christianity. The occasional Thames barge floats by like a ghost ship.</p> <p>Everything here seems slow. Oystercatchers beat in noisy circles, two at a time. Wind turbines fan hedgerows and fields of corn. I\u2019m cautious around the beach edges. I\u2019ve seen adders here: spring, when they wake from hibernation, is the best time to see them (but it\u2019s rare so don\u2019t let that put you off). They\u2019re beautiful, and slide through wild crops of edible purslane like liquid silver falling down a plughole.</p> <p>We look for fossils, pick the first shoots of samphire, and take afternoon swims. It\u2019s about warm enough for the hardy from April \u2013 just. Mostly, if we\u2019re feeling lazy, we just sit, drink coffee and watch the Blackwater ebb and flood.</p> <p>Sometimes we walk. The best spring walk is southward, along the seawall to Burnham-on-Crouch.

Fifteen miles from my home town of Liverpool, the Dee is a river border between Wales and the Wirral peninsula, and the small towns and beaches on its banks give it the feel of a secret island.</p> <p>Spring has a particular magic. We\u2019ll walk along the sandstone prom in the village of Parkgate, buy an ice-cream from Nicholls and eat it on a bench watching the ever-changing estuary. This was once an embarkation point for Ireland but, by the mid-1800s, as the estuary silted up, Parkgate\u2019s maritime days were over. Today it\u2019s the salt marshes that make Parkgate a special place: it\u2019s a breeding ground for skylarks, redshanks and egrets, and a hunting ground for peregrines and marsh harriers. Time it right and you might witness a rare visit from the tide as it swallows up the marsh and overlaps the promenade wall. As the seawater flushes out water voles, shrews and harvest mice, in come the kestrels, merlins and sparrowhawks as marsh reverts to sea.</p> <p>Further along the coast is Thurstaston beach, a haunt of mine since childhood. A site of special scientific interest for its constantly eroding cliffs, Thurstaston is a strange landscape, a churning and collapsing place where my 14-year-old daughter and I hunt for precious stones: quartz and granite treasure glittering in the sunlight, occasionally a fossil, transported here from Scotland and the Lake District by ice-age glaciers. </p> <p>At West Kirby we walk at low tide across the sands to Hilbre Island, an archipelago cut off from the mainland for four hours out of every 12. Check the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast-and-sea/tide-tables/5/461#tide-details\" title=\"\">BBC tide tables</a> before setting out, and keep to the recommended route across the sand. Good boots or wellies are essential.</p> <p>It takes an hour to reach Hilbre via smaller isles Little Eye and Middle Eye \u2013 and it\u2019s vital to start your return three hours before high tide. In April, I have seen sandwich terns, Manx shearwaters and dunlins here. Sometimes there are fulmars and Arctic skuas. The old lifeboat station ruins are a good place<strong> </strong>for watching grey seals.</p> <p>Above all, from anywhere along the Dee, watch and wait for sunset\u2019s spectacular displays of changing light. <br><strong>Jeff Young, whose </strong><strong>latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ghost-town-9781908213785.html\" title=\"\">Ghost Town, A Liverpool Shadowplay</a>, is out now (Little Toller, \u00a316)</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018Spring is not gentle here\u2019: Treshnish Isles, Hebrides</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799e53701e27909125454a2fcb87f390243cb5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799e53701e27909125454a2fcb87f390243cb5e7/0_0_5367_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puffins on Lunga, one of the Treshnish Isles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puffins on Lunga, one of the Treshnish Isles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up in tropical Papua New Guinea, where there were only two seasons: the dry season and the monsoon. When I arrived in Scotland as a teenager I was mesmerised by its four seasons, especially spring, which navigates that precarious space between darkness and light \u2013 a faerie child creeping out from beneath the dark skirts of winter.</p> <p>Spring has drawn me again and again to Lunga, one of the small islands and skerries that make up the Treshnish Isles, west of Mull and part of the Inner Hebrides. A site of special scientific interest, it is home to huge colonies of puffins (best seen from mid-April), razorbills, fulmars and shags, and is an important breeding area for grey seals.</p> <p>Spring is not gentle here; new life is profuse but so is danger. The hares come out boxing, thousands of guillemots cling to sheer rock and cry a deafening \u201carrr, arrr\u201d, and the puffins, which have come in off the Atlantic to lay their eggs in rabbit burrows, welcome humans, whose presence keeps away the skuas and gulls.</p> <p>The weather is mercurial. Even landing is precarious. There is no beach \u2013 the boat sidles up to a profusion of boulders washed smooth by the Atlantic, and you jump across the divide, but the smell of gorse, camomile and salt as you climb the steep path to the plateau clears away the dregs of winter. From here you might spot minke whales, porpoises, basking sharks and sea eagles, and when the boat returns two hours later, it will seem too soon.</p> <p>I base myself on Mull, in Tobermory, with its seafront cottages in spring-like shades of primrose, rose campion and bluebell. From here, boat trips by <a href=\"http://www.staffatours.com/\" title=\"\">Staffa Tours</a> (check if still running: 07831 885985) run to both Lunga and nearby Staffa.

Over the past 30 years, these former peat diggings have been transformed from unsightly holes in the ground into one of Britain\u2019s top birding spots. It\u2019s a linked series of nature reserves, and each has a mixture of open water and reedbeds. They are all crossed by a disused railway line giving easy access to viewpoints and hides.

This is also the best time to hear one of our most elusive birds, the bittern, whose loud, booming call sounds like someone blowing across the top of a milk bottle. I don\u2019t see bitterns very often, but on fine spring days they sometimes fly up from their reedbed hideaways \u2013 looking, as one young visitor suggested, like a \u201ctoasted heron\u201d.</p> <p>Birds of prey include buzzards, sparrowhawks and marsh harriers, which float low over the reeds, occasionally rising high into the sky to display. From late April, hobbies chase flying insects, while the reedbeds and adjacent vegetation are home to chiffchaffs, blackcaps, whitethroats, and several warbler species.</p> <p>Other migrant visitors such as swallows, sand martins and swifts catch flying insects over the open water, and one of my favourite birds \u2013 the great crested grebe \u2013 performs its famous courtship display, the male and female rising up in the water to wave weed at one another in a bizarre gesture of affection.</p> <p>On sunny spring days, hairy dragonflies and orange-tip butterflies are on the wing, and there is always a slim chance that you might stumble across an otter.

And spring is absolutely the best time to go \u2013 be it early in the season, when the verges are sprung with primroses and crocuses, and the cries of new lambs fill the air, or a little later, when the hawthorns turn the hedgerows white and the woods are overflowing with bluebells.</p> <p>My first encounter with this beautiful vale was a stay on a campsite near the quaint village of Maentwrog, as part of a trip to interview land artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/02/david-nash-exhibition-opens-at-national-museum-cardiff\" title=\"\">David Nash</a>, who is based up in Blaenau Ffestiniog \u2013 Mordor to Maentwrog\u2019s Shire.</p> <p>For several mornings, as I walked up to see David in his chapel workshop, the day dawning choral all about me, golden sun made the fresh-sprung grass and bronze-purple stones of the field walls shine. It was here, in 1978, that David set his wonderful work of land art, Wooden Boulder, in motion. </p> <p>The huge rough-hewn sphere of heartwood fell into a stream when he was trying to move it to the chapel and slowly \u2013 buoyed, bounced and buffeted by hectic stream spate and lazy summer drift \u2013 meandered its way to the saltmarsh maze of the Dwyryd\u2019s estuary.</p> <p>Another springtime, drawn by memories of train songs and half-glimpsed smoke, I set off north up the valley, zigzagged my way up steepening slopes in clouds of pollen and heather fug, and emerged on a fir-tree\u2019d ridge.</p> <p>I found a path that led to a small sturdy cottage, in front of which curved a set of narrow-gauge railway tracks. There, I found a tiny platform. A painted sign read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/07/ffestiniog-railway-cottage-snowdonia-wales\" title=\"\">Coed y Bleiddiau</a> (Wood of the Wolves). Hearing a distant huff and chuff, I saw a red locomotive approaching. I held out an arm and was overjoyed to see the train slow. It drew up before me, a steaming crimson and copper wonder.</p> <p>I climbed aboard and the train began to trundle down to Porthmadog \u2013 ghosting above the Dwyryd river through ancient woodland and cuttings spangled with late snowdrops and daffodils. Over stone embankments, viaducts and bridges, past gardens strung with immaculate washing, through level crossings manned by fellows who wave, it slowly descended towards the bright estuary flats, Wooden Boulder and the Irish Sea.

Some days you will be lucky, greeted by bright skies that make it impossible not to run headfirst into the waves. On others, the rain will so blur the landscape that it is hard to hold on to any discrete shape of the coast beneath it. This changeability is a large part of why I love England\u2019s southernmost county at this time of year.</p> <p>Lelant, the village where my mother and grandmother grew up, is on the quiet north coast of West Penwith, the region of Cornwall towards Land\u2019s End. Lelant\u2019s beach, Porthkidney Sands, occupies the same yawning bay as St Ives. Unlike St Ives, though, it has no car parks, cafes, or rows of toilets lined up before the sea like so many nervous swimmers. Instead you are met with an endless empty beach, where sandpipers hop in and out of the foam left by departing waves.</p> <p>Virginia Woolf called it \u201cvast &amp; melancholy\u201d, but since I was a child, it has been on this beach that I have felt most free. We\u2019ll often stride out west along the coastal path from Lelant to Zennor, stopping briefly in St Ives to visit the bronze abstract figures in Barbara Hepworth\u2019s sculpture garden, prettily framed by blossoming trees. Zennor is a village set atop a wild stretch of granite cliffs, which erupts with lavender-coloured spikes of squill and pink tufts of thrift in spring.</p> <p>Zennor\u2019s church, St Senara, is home to the \u201cMermaid Chair\u201d, a 600-year-old pew with a mermaid combing her hair carved into its side. There\u2019s a famous folktale attached to this pew, telling how a young man followed a mermaid over the cliffs and never returned.<br><strong>Lamorna Ash, whose first book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-salt-clear-9781526600011.html\" title=\"\">Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town</a> is out on 2 April (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99)</strong></p> <h2><strong>Big skies and salty air: Suffolk coast</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29777e5dfca0408aacf28d3c03eb2c3df92735ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29777e5dfca0408aacf28d3c03eb2c3df92735ab/0_292_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The River Blyth, with Blythborough church in the distance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The River Blyth, with Blythborough church in the distance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sid Frisby/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rich coastal landscape of Suffolk has inspired scores of composers, artists and writers, not least Benjamin Britten and the German writer WG Sebald, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/aug/13/the-rings-of-saturn-by-wg-sebald-walking-through-history\" title=\"\">Rings of Saturn</a> takes readers on a pilgrimage deep into the human soul. My own quest to understand why so many of us embark on pilgrimages began here, one April, as I set Sebald\u2019s book down and turned my gaze out to sea.</p> <p>With big skies and salty air, and hedgerows bursting with blossom and birdsong, spring here offers a tonic for mind and body; it feels like you can step out of time into a simpler world. I love to amble along the footpath by the River Blyth \u2013 starting from Walberswick. With marsh harriers circling overhead, waders calling and the song of larks ascending, your heart lifts.</p> <p>In the opposite direction is a circular trail along wooden causeways through marshes where, by May, reed warblers will be busy building nests and cuckoos calling to their mates as they have done since time immemorial. For a fee of \u00a31, the Walberswick ferry, a traditional rowing boat, will take you across the river to Southwold, and back to the 21st century.</p> <p>Another favourite in spring, a little further up the coast, is the walk from Pakefield into Lowestoft, whose promenade and beach offer plenty of space. Inland, the 12 acres of formal gardens at <a href=\"https://www.somerleyton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Somerleyton Hall</a> (check that it is open first) present lots of ideas for spring planting. It is one of the finest gardens in East Anglia, with areas from a walled garden to an arboretum.

  "<p>The candlesticks and photo frames that usually adorn our mantelpiece have been usurped by four less conventional ornaments, and it doesn\u2019t take long for visitors to notice. \u201cAre they... ashes?\u201d Well, yes \u2013 but they\u2019re not so much a macabre display of what Americans call \u201ccremains\u201d as a small warehousing operation; we\u2019re working on the logistics to enable their respective onward journeys, but for now they are stuck here, above our fireplace. Visitors have other questions: why the Russian hats? Why is that one just a cardboard box? Let me explain.</p> <p>In December 2016, my 70-year-old Uncle Rod, my mum\u2019s younger brother, died. His will, of which I was executor, left his body to medical science. Skeletal and riddled with metastases as he was, the doctors politely declined the gift. His will\u2019s small print stipulated that anything left after his dissection should be cremated and scattered into the Avon from the Ashton Avenue Bridge, near his beloved Bristol City football ground.</p> <p>In life, Rod embraced the unorthodox, and he had mentioned to me years before that he didn\u2019t want a funeral, just a \u201cgathering\u201d of loved ones. I decided the best way of honouring his wishes was to organise a direct cremation \u2013 one with no ceremony or witnesses \u2013 and a knees-up in the garden room at Bristol Zoo, one of his favourite haunts.</p> <p>About five weeks after his death, I answered the door to a man cradling a sturdy cardboard box in a canvas tote bag: Rod\u2019s mortal remains. We chatted for a few minutes (mainly about how David Bowie had recently been directly cremated and therefore it had to be the coolest option), before he handed the box to me and left. I hadn\u2019t held ashes before; they were much heavier than expected. After a few stupefied seconds, I stood and cried for a solid minute, then placed the box on the sitting-room mantelpiece, under a Soviet-badged hat, next to my nan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6f9f48913ae281694514ad79044e286625f2e628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9f48913ae281694514ad79044e286625f2e628/41_45_392_571/343.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Brown\u2019s uncle Rod with his mother, Dolly.\" width=\"343\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clare\u2019s uncle Rod with his mother, Dolly. Photograph: courtesy of Clare Brown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Clare Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ah yes, Nan (and the hats). Rod\u2019s flat had been decorated with remnants of his nomadic past; Bobby Kennedy merchandise from the US, aboriginal flags and a didgeridoo from Australia, military memorabilia from eastern Europe. While clearing it out \u2013 a hurried process, because the council wanted it back \u2013 Dan, my husband, lifted a Cossack hat from a shelf and discovered a large green plastic bottle beneath it. Reading the label that dangled from its neck, he announced: \u201cI\u2019ve found your nan!\u201d</p> <p>Dolly died, aged 90, in 2012 and left no instructions, so my mum popped her on the kitchen windowsill of the family home in Sheffield for a year or two, because \u201cshe always did love to see a line of washing\u201d. Rod volunteered to return their mother\u2019s urn to her birthplace, Newport in south Wales, and have her remains interred in her own mother\u2019s grave. We\u2019re not sure why Rod never made it, but we couldn\u2019t leave Dolly in Bristol for the council to find, so she came back to Nottingham with us. It seemed only right to keep her hat on; and when we found a second hat in the flat, obviously it had Rod\u2019s name on it.</p> <p>When our thoughts turned to scattering, we decided it might be nice to send Rod and Dolly down river together, although my mum had her reservations (\u201cBut she can\u2019t swim!\u201d). Then Rod\u2019s good friend Carol called us from Bristol to say that the Ashton Avenue Bridge<strong> </strong>was closed while extensive works took place, which is why, over two years later, Dolly and Rod are still sitting to the left of the mirror, under their furry hats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are family, and hiding them away in a cupboard would seem inhospitable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To the right of the mirror are the urns with the ashes of Dan\u2019s Aunty Mary and her husband, John. This summer, when his 89-year-old aunt died, it was my husband\u2019s turn to be an executor.</p> <p>Mary and John courted for 14 years before finally marrying in 2000, when she was 69 and John 65. But, after John\u2019s death in 2014, Mary\u2019s health began to deteriorate, especially her eyesight. She withdrew to her sofa, eating and even sleeping there. While clearing her house, Dan was a little more prepared for the shock of finding the green urn containing John, tucked beside the pillow at the end of the sofa that Mary slept on each night. So John came back with us until after Mary\u2019s funeral, at which point they were reunited on our mantelpiece. This time there were no hats; we didn\u2019t want it getting gimmicky.</p> <p>Mary did express her wishes before she died: her ashes are to be scattered, along with John\u2019s, on Woolley Edge, a Wakefield beauty spot. But John\u2019s son from his first marriage is keen to be there, and ill health has so far prevented him from leaving his home in Spain. We\u2019re waiting to coordinate timings for both scattering trips; in the meantime the strange quartet will remain on the mantelpiece. They are family, after all, and hiding them away in a cupboard would seem inhospitable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7910a1338e46a5def8c4b11e4e6aa08a37fcc4a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7910a1338e46a5def8c4b11e4e6aa08a37fcc4a7/202_254_2361_3331/709.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Brown's husband Dan\u2019s Aunty Mary and Uncle John on their wedding day in 2000\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan\u2019s Aunty Mary and Uncle John on their wedding day in 2000.

There must be thousands of urns awaiting a final resting place, but few seem to be on display. There are grieving relatives who keep ashes by choice, of course; but what about the remains that are, like ours, in transit? Are they all hidden in cupboards?</p> <p>According to Catherine Powell, customer experience director of <a href=\"https://www.purecremation.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pure Cremation</a>, there are almost 250,000 unclaimed urns in the UK. She says that even families who do have the ashes of a loved one can find it hard to agree what to do with them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://scattering-ashes.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Scattering Ashes</a> is a company that offers various dispersal and commemorative items, from decorative urns and garden memorials to water ceremony packages and ashes jewellery. The company carried out its own research into the length of time between receipt of remains and the decision to do something with them; 25% of the families they asked took more than three years to make their final move.</p> <p>While there is a growing acceptance of unconventional methods when it comes to dealing with ashes in the UK, Richard Martin, the company\u2019s director, has identified geographical differences. For instance, 75% of his jewellery customers live in the south-east. On the other hand, he adds: \u201cWhen we contacted UK football grounds a few years ago to ask how they\u2019d respond to ash-scattering requests on their pitches, we found that most northern clubs welcomed the idea, while most in the south were firmly against.\u201d</p> <p>We haven\u2019t been tempted to consider alternatives for our own collection of ashes \u2013 no fireworks, pendants or Viking longboats \u2013 because we have instructions from the deceased. But as about 60% of Britons don\u2019t have a will, many families have to make these decisions while grieving, which explains the often lengthy delay in dealing with the ashes. </p> <p>Will I miss our four urns when they\u2019re gone? The thing is, their very presence represents an absence, because they \u2013 Dolly, Rod, Mary and John \u2013 are already gone. They\u2019re already missed. And I\u2019m looking forward to getting those candlesticks back where they belong.</p> <h2>Final resting place: the dos and don\u2019ts of scattering ashes</h2> <p>There is very little legislation around ash scattering, but common sense applies in all settings: consider the effect on the surrounding area and those who use it, and avoid disposing of non-biodegradable tributes along with the ashes. You will also need to make sensible choices about wind direction.</p> <p><strong>On private land</strong> You need permission from the landowner.</p> <p><strong>On your own land</strong> No permission is required, and there\u2019s no need to keep a record.</p> <p><strong>At a cemetery, church</strong><strong>yard or natural burial site</strong> Easily arranged, by applying to the site manager \u2013 or ask your funeral director, if you have one, to act on your behalf. </p> <p><strong>At </strong><strong>a historic site or beauty spot</strong> National Trust England and Wales, English Heritage, Welsh Heritage, Historic Scotland and the National Parks will all consider requests made direct to the local property or landowner. No permanent site markers are allowed. Rather than scatter from or on popular mountain tops, placing ashes inside an out-of-the-way hollow or around a tree is preferred. (The Royal Parks in London and the Forestry Commission do not permit scattering.)</p> <p><strong>At a sports ground </strong>Some football and cricket grounds and racecourses will allow ashes to be scattered pitch- or track-side, or sometimes in an adjacent garden of remembrance. Permission must be secured.</p> <p><strong>On rivers or lakes</strong> <a href=\"https://www.scattering-ashes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/GEHO0306BKIK-e-e.pdf\" title=\"\">The Environment Agency has published a leaflet</a> about river scatterings, stating that ashes should not be put in water 1km from any drinking water supply, or from bridges over rivers used by boaters or canoeists, or anywhere close to a marina, anglers or bathers. If you can comply with these requirements no permission is necessary. If in doubt, contact your local Environment Agency office, which can also advise about tide times.</p> <p><strong>At sea</strong> Many companies offer scatterings by boat all round the UK coastline, but you could also organise your own beach ceremony \u2013 again, provided you have consideration for others, and ensure it\u2019s a sandy beach and the ashes are placed below the tide line.</p> <p>Further information is available at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cemeteries-and-burials-prevent-groundwater-pollution\" title=\"\">environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;If you would like your&nbsp;comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

It also touches on the doomed romance between a girl who lived in Eyam and a boy outside the village who talked to her from a distance, until she stopped coming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dafb395ec9036c9e57a91101d9ec2780809bb53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dafb395ec9036c9e57a91101d9ec2780809bb53b/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man touches the boundary stone in Eyam from which no resident could pass during the village\u2019s isolation in 1666.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man touches the boundary stone in Eyam from which no resident could pass during the village\u2019s isolation in 1666.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The poem was also influenced by a scene in Meghad\u016bta in which an exile sends reassuring words to his wife in the Himalayas via a passing cloud.</p> <p>\u201cThe cloud is convinced to take the message because the <em>yaksha</em>, which I think is sort of an attendant spirit to a god of wealth, tells him what amazing landscapes and scenery he\u2019s going to pass across. I thought it was a kind of hopeful, romantic gesture,\u201d said Armitage.</p> <p>He thought there was a message to be learned \u201cabout taking things easy and being patient and trusting the Earth and maybe having to come through this slightly slower, and wiser, at the other end \u2013 given that one thing that\u2019s accelerated the problem is our hectic lives and our proximities and the frantic ways we go about things\u201d.</p> <p>Poetry is \u201cby definition consoling\u201d because \u201cit often asks us just to focus and think and be contemplative\u201d, said Armitage.</p> <p>\u201cPoetry is often about detail, even to the point where there\u2019s just something sacramental in the ordinary descriptions of everyday life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s going to be a book of poems that are consolation against catastrophe, but just in poetry\u2019s nature, in the way it asks us to be considerate of language, it also asks us to be considerate of each other and the world. In the relationship with thoughtful language, something more thoughtful occurs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"book break\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.left-rule:before,.right-rule:before{content:'';float:left;width:43%;height:1px;border-top:1px dotted #bdbdbd;margin-top:12px}.right-rule:before{content:'';float:right}svg{display:block;margin:auto}p{margin:0px}#wrapper{margin:0px}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;left-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;right-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;svg version=&quot;1.1&quot; width=&quot;30px&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot; id=&quot;Layer_1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; x=&quot;0px&quot; y=&quot;0px&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 30 24.8&quot; enable-background=&quot;new 0 0 30 24.8&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot; fill=&quot;#fdadba&quot;&gt; &lt;path d=&quot;M29.3,1.4C26.2,0.5,23.4,0,21.2,0c-3.4,0-5.2,1-6.2,1.9C14,1,12.2,0,8.8,0c-2.3,0-5,0.5-8.1,1.4L0,1.6v23l1.3-0.4 C4.2,23.4,6.7,23,8.8,23c4.2,0,5.2,1.8,5.2,1.9l1.9,0c0,0,0.9-1.9,5.2-1.9c2.1,0,4.6,0.4,7.5,1.3l1.3,0.4v-23L29.3,1.4z M8.8,20.9 c-2,0-4.2,0.3-6.8,1V3.1C4.6,2.4,6.9,2,8.8,2c3.7,0,4.9,1.4,5.2,1.8v18.3C12.9,21.5,11.3,20.9,8.8,20.9z M28,21.9 c-2.6-0.7-4.9-1-6.8-1c-2.5,0-4.1,0.5-5.2,1.1V3.8C16.3,3.4,17.5,2,21.2,2c1.9,0,4.2,0.4,6.8,1.1V21.9z&quot;/&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Lockdown by Simon Armitage</h2> <p>And I couldn\u2019t escape the waking dream<br>of infected fleas</p> <p>in the warp and weft of soggy cloth<br>by the tailor\u2019s hearth</p> <p>in ye olde Eyam.<br>Then couldn\u2019t un-see</p> <p>the Boundary Stone,<br>that cock-eyed dice with its six dark holes,</p> <p>thimbles brimming with vinegar wine<br>purging the plagued coins.</p> <p>Which brought to mind the sorry story<br>of Emmott Syddall and Rowland Torre,</p> <p>star-crossed lovers on either side<br>of the quarantine line</p> <p>whose wordless courtship spanned the river<br><em>till she came no longer.</em></p> <p>But slept again,<br>and dreamt this time</p> <p>of the exiled <em>yaksha</em> sending word<br>to his lost wife on a passing cloud,</p> <p>a cloud that followed an earthly map<br>of camel trails and cattle tracks,</p> <p>streams like necklaces,<br>fan-tailed peacocks, painted elephants,</p> <p>embroidered bedspreads<br>of meadows and hedges,</p> <p>bamboo forests and snow-hatted peaks,<br>waterfalls, creeks,</p> <p>the hieroglyphs of wide-winged cranes<br>and the glistening lotus flower after rain,</p> <p>the air<br>hypnotically see-through, rare,</p> <p>the journey a ponderous one at times, long and slow<br>but necessarily so.</p>",
  "<p>As the Schengen area closed its external borders last week, in a move designed to replace the closing of member states\u2019 national borders against imported Covid-19 infection, some internal barriers still went up in Europe. The day after the European commission\u2019s announcement, the Greek government introduced a set of measures that would apply to the migrant camps in the Greek islands.</p> \n<p>As of Wednesday, the camps have been locked down from 7pm to 7am. In the daytime, only one person is allowed out per family, and the police control their movements. Some camps, on the islands of Leros and Kos, have been closed entirely.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, visits to the camps\u2019 reception centres have been temporarily suspended, except for those who work there, and arrivals are being subjected to compulsory fever screening. The measures only apply to the camps, not to the resident population of the islands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the five Greek island \u201chotspots\u201d that are sheltering about 42,000 people, one case of Covid-19 has been recorded. The affected person is a resident of the island of Lesbos. There have been no cases in the camps so far.</p> \n<p>In Greece as a whole, 464 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded and six deaths. The government has banned mass gatherings and is urging Greeks to practise social distancing. Thirteen hospitals on the mainland have been turned over to the treatment of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe imposition of this restriction of movement on the people of the camps and not for anyone else on the islands is unacceptable and discriminatory,\u201d said Apostolos Veizis, director of the medical operational support unit for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Greece. \u201cYou are locking children, women and men into severely overcrowded camps where the sanitation and hygiene conditions are horrific.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The largest camp, Moria on Lesbos, is temporary home to about 20,000 people but was built for just over 6,000. In parts of Moria, there is one water tap for 1,300 people, one toilet for 167 people and one shower for 242 people.</p> \n<p>Up to six people may be sleeping in 3 sq metres (32 sq feet), a quarter of the size of an average parking space. \u201cThey do not have enough water or soap to regularly wash their hands and they do not have the luxury of being able to self-isolate,\u201d Veizis said.</p> \n<p>Over a third of the migrants are children, just under a half of whom are unaccompanied. Their principal countries of origin are Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Palestine and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and their average stay in the camp is between five months and a year.</p> \n<p>There are already high levels of health problems among the migrants, due to the unsanitary conditions, and high levels of stress. Veizis calls the situation \u201ca chronic emergency\u201d. \u201cIf we had an outbreak in these camps, it would be disastrous,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Greek National Public Health Organisation, which is responsible for health in the camps, did not respond to requests for comment. However, a European commission spokesperson, Ciara Bottomley, wrote in an email that the commission was funding the deployment of doctors and other medical staff to the hotspots. \u201cThe healthcare response in case of an incident on a hotspot island foresees first treatment at the local island hospital followed by air evacuation to one of the specialised hospitals in the mainland,\u201d she went on.</p> \n<p>Those measures appear to apply to local residents only. Since last July, all arrivals to the camps have been excluded from the Greek healthcare system. Three government-funded doctors are conducting vulnerability screening in Moria, but the only medical care is being provided there by NGOs and voluntary groups.</p> \n<p>Veizis said MSF had been in contact with the government to discuss case management in the camps as part of the government\u2019s evolving Covid-19 strategy, in case of an outbreak there.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, he fears the new regime will add to the migrants\u2019 stress while fanning tensions between them and local residents. Violence directed at NGOs forced some of them to temporarily suspend operations this month.</p> \n<p>The new measures, Veizis says, are just \u201cone more element to pit the people of the islands against the asylum seekers\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo-non-essential-workers-businesses\">ordered the shutdown of all non-essential businesses </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo-non-essential-workers-businesses\">in the state</a>, as the number of confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> cases surged above 7,000. Except for essential services, all New Yorkers are now ordered to stay indoors from 8pm Sunday evening.</p> <p>Cuomo called the new measures the \u201cultimate step\u201d to curb the outbreak.<br><br>\u201cThese provisions will be enforced. These are not helpful hints. This is not if you really want to be a great citizen. These are legal provisions,\u201d he said at a briefing on Friday morning in Albany, the state\u2019s capital. \u201cWe need everyone to be safe; otherwise, no one can be safe.\u201d</p> <p>The governor also announced <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1241027181381406721\">a 90-day moratorium</a> on evictions for residential and commercial tenants.</p> <p>What does a quarantine mean for New York state\u2019s 19.5 million residents?</p> <p><strong>Can New Yorkers go outside?<br></strong>Yes.<strong> </strong>Although<strong> </strong>New Yorkers are strongly encouraged to stay indoors and public gatherings are limited, they can still go to the grocery store, hospital or doctor\u2019s office, walk their dogs or even head to the laundromat. That\u2019s simply because state officials have determined these activities are essential.</p> <p>Although residents are still allowed to enjoy the outdoors, the governor reminded them to use common sense in maintaining social distance.</p> <p>\u201cOutdoor recreation is a solitary recreational exercise. It\u2019s running. It\u2019s hiking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not playing basketball with five other people.\u201d</p> <p>Only professionals in industries also deemed essential during the outbreak will be permitted to go back and forth from their jobs. Residents working in healthcare, sanitation, food services, law enforcement as well as gas stations and laundromats won\u2019t see specific limitations on their movement.</p> <p>All non-essential businesses have been ordered closed, however, after state officials increasingly demanded staff reductions. Previously capped at groups of 50, non-essential gatherings of New Yorkers of any size, for any reason, are now banned.</p> <p><strong>What happens if residents don\u2019t comply?</strong><br>Cuomo announced that the mandate applies to all individuals and business in the state. But it\u2019s important to note the measure stops short of being a so-called shelter-in-place order, which is intended for mass shootings.</p> <p>In contrast, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/shelter-in-place-california-coronavirus-bay-area-explained\">issued an order</a> mandating residents shelter-in-place earlier this week, although Cuomo on Friday said California was no longer officially using that term.</p> <p>However, unlike New York\u2019s regulations, California\u2019s mandate is enforceable as a misdemeanor crime, and demands sheriffs and police chiefs \u201censure compliance with and enforce this order\u201d.</p> <p>In New York \u201cthe violation of any provision of its order constitutes an imminent threat and creates an immediate menace to public health\u201d, the mandate states.</p> <p>Any businesses violating the order would be fined and forced to close. However, Cuomo insisted the state does not plan to fine individuals who violate the regulations.</p> <p><strong>What about transit?</strong><br>New York is home to the county\u2019s largest, and oldest, transportation system of subway trains and buses \u2013 the MTA in New York City. According to the order, mass transit will stay operational, but residents are strongly discouraged from using public transit unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.</p> <p>Roads, gas stations and some auto repair services will stay open.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-center-us-coronavirus\">New York now the center of the US coronavirus crisis \u2013 can it cope?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In New York City, the mayor, Bill de Blasio, had pushed for a shelter-in-place order to limit even non-essential travel, such as by foot, bicycle or scooter. However, the state governor had repeatedly dismissed the idea, insisting New Yorkers would not be confined to their homes under a quarantine. The governor is the only official with the executive power to order a city or the entire state to, in effect, lock down. Donald Trump reiterated on Friday that the federal government was not ready to order a nationwide stay-at-home order.</p> <p>The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus soared by more than 1,000 in the city in just a matter of hours on Thursday.

require senators and their staffers to work through the entire weekend to have the bill ready by Monday.</p> \n  <p>McConnell said the $1 trillion package Senate <strong>Republicans </strong>released yesterday -- which outlines direct payments to American families and $200 billion to airlines and other distressed industries, among other things -- would be the starting point for negotiations.</p> \n  <p>However, Senate <strong>Democrats </strong>have already signaled they want many changes made to the bill, so a lot of negotiating will need to take place between now and Monday to set up a

Many of those restaurant workers are also aspiring actors, but auditions and shoots are off the agenda as the TV and film industry screeched to a stop.</p> <p>One of LA\u2019s most prominent chefs, Nancy Silverton, announced that she was turning one of her restaurants on Melrose Avenue into a relief center for laid-off restaurant workers that would provide 300 high-quality meals every night for the next two weeks, paid for by the whiskey company Maker\u2019s Mark, along with a variety of household essentials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41a792cbf4f910234f892d235e0d6bf8fbcd2e00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a792cbf4f910234f892d235e0d6bf8fbcd2e00/0_50_3325_1995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wearing a mask for protection against the coronavirus, Henry Powell heads to his car after shopping at a Safeway store in Sacramento\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wearing a mask for protection against the coronavirus, Henry Powell heads to his car after shopping at a Safeway store in Sacramento.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up north in Sacramento, the first day of shelter-in-place felt like a weekend-come-early.</p> <p>The clangs of the passing trolleys and beeps of the pedestrian walk signals echoed in the downtown area\u2019s near-empty streets.</p> <p>The typical steady flow of pedestrians had slowed to a trickle, with few still pacing the sidewalks with dogs and grocery bags. Parking, a precious commodity in California, was plentiful, with lines of meters blinking blankly next to swaths of spaces. The Capitol Mall, usually buzzing with activity on a weekday, sat quiet and peaceful under blue skies, few cars and even fewer people passing by the state house.</p> <p>Downtown Sacramento businesses generally heeded the governor\u2019s advisories early on, with bars and brewpubs closing down earlier in the week. On Friday, some restaurants with their chairs stacked on top of their tables were open for take-out and delivery only. Some bars were completely dark, with gates pulled down and shuttered.</p> <p>\u201cDowntown is kind of a ghost town,\u201d said Shane Nicolette, 27, a barista at Temple Coffee Roasters. \u201cOver the last week, it\u2019s been a progression of state workers and people who work downtown, figuring out how they can work from home. Now it\u2019s kind of integrated into everything over here.\u201d</p> <p>On a typical weekday, Nicolette would serve up to 500 people. On Friday, he served 50.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to cut hours back, way back. And when you work for tips, it\u2019s a huge impact going from a line out the door to one person every 10 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Other businesses downtown have already started letting their workers go. The manager on duty at Rodney\u2019s Cigar and Liquor Store, who asked to be identified only as Bob, said he learned right after the governor issued his shelter-in-place order that he lost his other job working as a parking attendant at the downtown Marriott and Hyatt hotels. \u201cIt\u2019s been rough, really rough,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to find some place else, some place unaffected. We\u2019re all looking for some place unaffected.\u201d</p> <p>The lack of business as usual downtown made the presence of Sacramento\u2019s homeless population stand out in sharp contrast. None of the unhoused individuals approached by a reporter said they had heard from the city, county or state about coronavirus, or about washing their hands, nor had they received any hand sanitizer.</p> <p>\u201cI just know what I\u2019ve been hearing from the past week out on the street from other people,\u201d said Thomas Mitchell, 44. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the coronavirus was here until it was already here.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell has already suffered a stroke and a seizure while out on the streets, as well as the stomach flu. He\u2019s not worried about getting coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out here eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve already been sick. So be it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afb8651fa0828c13052eb8b6fd025d8f8e72b29a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afb8651fa0828c13052eb8b6fd025d8f8e72b29a/0_0_4894_2937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Lake in Oakland theater displays a message about Donald Trump and the Coronavirus on their marquee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Lake in Oakland theater displays a message about Donald Trump and the Coronavirus on their marquee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while the rest of the state comes to terms with the new restrictions, life seemed to be slowly taking on a new, if altered, sense of normalcy in the Bay Area, where a shelter-in-place order took effect on Tuesday.</p> <p>Midmorning, two medical students at the University of California San Francisco stationed themselves at a typically busy corner of the city\u2019s Mission District, soliciting N95 masks. They made sure to stand six feet apart, a distance enforced by a tape measurer they\u2019d extended.</p> <p>Behind them, dog-walkers and parents with children enjoying a warm spring morning dotted the usually crowded Dolores park.</p> <p>Even as workers nailed plywood over windows of nearby shops, the video-rental section of Fayes coffee did brisk business.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re telling people if you want to leave your house once this week and rent 15 movies, we\u2019re not going to be charging late fees,\u201d said the store owner Justin Lawrence.</p> <p>Life had re-emerged, too, on the trails and sidewalks lining Oakland\u2019s iconic Lake Merritt.</p> <p>Sidewalks filled only with radio silence on Monday night had been reanimated by Friday morning, as bikers and joggers awkwardly navigated a 10-ft sidewalk while trying to observe social distancing norms.</p> <p>Nearby, Amber Fina, 30, was organizing clothes in the tent where she sleeps. She said she\u2019s lived through similar restrictions amid a hurricane in her native Florida, but the lockdown in Oakland was posing unexpected challenges.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s making it impossible to get money. Not that many people are out, and if they are nobody wants to get close to you to hand you money. I need to eat,\u201d Fina said.</p> <p>Fina held up a bag of purified water and a bottle of sanitizer, which she said two healthcare workers delivered when they came through the encampment this week to take her and her neighbors\u2019 temperature. Police have been kind, she said, coming around to ask if she needed services. They haven\u2019t chased anybody off the encampment, she said, not even when the guys three tents down set a fire near their tent earlier this week.</p> <p>Two construction workers near a playground smoked as they took a break from a project underway. One of the workers, Greg Stevens, said he was happy for the work.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about everyone losing their minds and panic-buying everything,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cDid you see the crowds at gun stores? I\u2019m an avid shooter, but c\u2019mon. To me, that\u2019s the dangerous part. People losing all reason.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2742cd35cef8069d8f96bbc7ad0d0ab8f9a9a44e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2742cd35cef8069d8f96bbc7ad0d0ab8f9a9a44e/0_118_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families arrive at West Oakland middle school to pick up grab and go meals during the Oakland unified school district shutdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families arrive at West Oakland middle school to pick up grab and go meals during the Oakland unified school district shutdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Munsch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kendall Shotwell looked on as her two-year-old son Rider, wearing a hat that said Little Dreamer, ran in circles in a nearby playground and hopped on the scooter he\u2019d commandeered from another child.</p> <p>Shotwell\u2019s husband is also in construction and works as an electrician, but he\u2019s been off work.
