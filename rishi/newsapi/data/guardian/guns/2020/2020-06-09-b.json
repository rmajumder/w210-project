coronavirus by people with no symptoms is \u201cvery rare\u201d, saying this guidance could pose problems for governments as they seek to lift lockdowns, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports. </p> <p> Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the Covid-19 pandemic, said on Monday that many countries undertaking contact tracing had identified asymptomatic cases, but were not finding they caused further spread of the virus. \u201cIt is very rare,\u201d she said. </p> <p> \u201cI was quite surprised by the WHO statement,\u201d said Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who added that he had not seen the data Kerkhove\u2019s statement was based on. </p> <p> \u201cIt goes against my impressions from the science so far that suggest asymptomatic people \u2013 who never get symptoms \u2013 and pre-symptomatic people are an important source of infection to others.\u201d </p> <p>Smeeth and other experts said understanding the risks of transmission among people with mild or no symptoms is crucial as governments begin to ease the lockdown measures they imposed to try and reduce the pandemic\u2019s spread and gradually replace them with case tracking and isolation plans. <br></p> <p> \u201cThis has important implications for the track/trace/isolate measures being instituted in many countries,\u201d said Babak Javid, a Cambridge University Hospitals infectious diseases consultant. </p> <p>The co-head of Singapore\u2019s coronavirus taskforce told Reuters on Monday there had been asymptomatic transmission cases there, between people living in close quarters. However, China said last week that 300 symptomless coronavirus carriers in its central city of Wuhan, the pandemic\u2019s epicentre, had not been found to be infectious. </p> <p> Keith Neal, a professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Britain\u2019s University of Nottingham, said that while the question of how big a role asymptomatic transmission plays in new infections is unclear, what is known is that people with symptoms are responsible for most of the spread of the disease. </p> <p> \u201cThis reinforces the importance of any person who has any of the symptoms of Covid-19 arranges a test .\u2026 as soon as possible and isolating until they get their test result,\u201d he said. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T12:24:18.754Z\">at 1.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edf72428f083999a26dd07b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T11:42:19.983Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hundreds more fatalities from Covid-19 in the north-west of <strong>England</strong> and in care homes have driven up the number of excess deaths since the <strong>UK</strong> went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than those anywhere else except the US, writes <strong>Robert Booth</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, in London. </p> <p>The number of deaths from the virus in England and Wales fell to 1,822 in the last week of May, the fewest for eight weeks, according to the latest data from the Office of National Statistics.

Many economists believe the pandemic will push the German economy into its biggest decline since the end of the second world war in the second quarter.</p> <p>Seasonally adjusted exports fell 24% on the month while imports slid by 16.5%. The trade surplus shrank to \u20ac3.2bn, the federal statistics office said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 15.6% and saw imports down 16%. The trade surplus was expected to come in at \u20ac10bn.</p> <p>Alexander Krueger, an economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said a recovery may have already started due to a loosening of the lockdown and reopening of borders, but little was left of the last decade\u2019s export boom. \u201cThe road out of the corona trough is long, rocky and above all uncertain, especially for foreign trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite a \u20ac130bn stimulus package announced last week, which comes on top of \u20ac750bn worth of measures announced in March, the government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year. Economists expect a slow recovery and the pace will depend largely on how fast Germany\u2019s European neighbours and other trade partners, including China and the US, emerge from the crisis.</p> <p>Exports to France and the US, hit hard by the coronavirus, fell most while those to China, which was first affected by the virus but which has since started to see some signs of recovery, fell slightly less sharply, the office said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T07:06:53.637Z\">at 8.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edf2e208f0883ec2fc1d94a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T06:41:24.053Z\">7.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>China\u2019s</strong> education ministry has warned that Chinese students should consider whether to study in <strong>Australia</strong>, amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Canberra, Reuters reports.

  "<p>Extremists&nbsp;are exploiting gaps in existing laws to push their agenda, such as peddling&nbsp;antisemitic coronavirus&nbsp;conspiracy&nbsp;theories, a former counter-terror chief has warned as a major review of current legislation is launched.</p> <p>A former assistant commissioner for specialist operations at the Metropolitan police, Sir Mark Rowley, has been asked to lead a review to examine whether existing legislation adequately deals with \u201chateful&nbsp;extremism\u201d.</p> <p>Rowley, who was appointed by the head of the Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE), Sara Khan, said he believed the UK had a strong counter-terrorism system in place but the country is less ready to address growing threats from hateful&nbsp;extremists&nbsp;who encourage community tensions.</p> <p>The CCE, which advises the government on new policies to deal with extremism, cited a recent rise in antisemitic posts and conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to the Jewish community as \u201chateful extremism\u201d.</p> <p>Rowley said: \u201cExtremism, hate crime and terrorism have all been increasing challenges for our communities and society as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I was in post as head of counter-terrorism policing for four years, I knew that we had a strong counter-terrorism system, resources and laws in place.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cHowever, I increasingly realised that nationally we are less&nbsp;experienced and ready to address the growing threats from hateful&nbsp;extremists&nbsp;who encourage community tensions, the rise in hate crime and&nbsp;some to even become terrorists.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Sara asked me to look from an&nbsp;operational&nbsp;perspective&nbsp;at&nbsp;whether the existing legal framework has gaps that allow&nbsp;extremists&nbsp;to&nbsp;flourish, I was initially cautious \u2013 not least because successive governments have tried to tackle this very problem, by proposing new legislation, and failed.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, after some&nbsp;initial scoping I am convinced that the commission\u2019s clarity of focus on&nbsp;\u2018hateful&nbsp;extremism\u2019 can help&nbsp;identify the gaps that exist at&nbsp;the boundaries of current laws, such as hate crime and terrorism, which are being exploited daily by&nbsp;extremists.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCE\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/far-right-swooping-on-towns-to-exploit-tensions-report-says\">first major report found far-right activists </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/far-right-swooping-on-towns-to-exploit-tensions-report-says\">were exploiting community tensions</a> by swooping into towns and cities and distorting the truth in an effort to turn residents against minorities, particularly Muslims.</p> <p>Khan visited 20 towns and cities and sifted through 3,000 responses to a call for evidence to produce her first major report, published on Monday, titled Challenging Hateful Extremism. She concluded in her report that the government\u2019s response to extremism was \u201cinadequate\u201d, \u201cunfocused\u201d and urgently needed a complete overhaul.</p> <p>The review called on the government to focus on what the commission calls \u201chateful extremism\u201d, which stands apart from terrorism and violent extremism.</p> <p>As part of his legal review, Rowley has been tasked to identify whether there are gaps in existing legislation or inconsistencies in enforcing the law in relation to hateful&nbsp;extremism&nbsp;and make recommendations that are compatible with existing legal and human rights obligations.</p> <p>Khan said the UK authorities \u201cability to counter repeat and persistent offenders is inconsistent and often ineffective\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhen&nbsp;extremists&nbsp;engage in terrorist activity, they are often caught by robust counter-terrorism legislation.&nbsp;But when they incite hatred, engage in persistent hatred or justify violence against others,&nbsp;extremists&nbsp;know they will not cross over into the threshold of terrorism.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Khan said a legal review was \u201ceven more pertinent\u201d during the current pandemic as&nbsp;extremists&nbsp;propagate \u201chorrific\u201d material which seeks to blame and incite hatred and violence against other people in society.</p>",
  "<p>All statues in Labour councils across England and Wales, and across London, will be examined for links to slavery and plantation owners, their leaders have said, as an east London authority took one down off its plinth on Tuesday evening.</p> \n<p>The statue of slave owner Robert&nbsp;Milligan at West India Quay in London\u2019s Docklands was removed using a JCB, after the charity which owns the land where it stood promised to organise its \u201csafe removal\u201d following a petition launched by Ehtasham Haque.</p> \n<p>The local council, Tower Hamlets, said it had removed the statue and had \u201calso announced a review into monuments and other sites in our borough to understand how we should represent the more troubling periods in our history\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the capital\u2019s landmarks \u2013 including street names, the names of public buildings and plaques \u2013 would be reviewed by a commission to ensure they reflect the capital\u2019s diversity, with a view to removing those with links to slavery after Black Lives Matter protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Manchester, the council announced a city-wide review of all the statues in Manchester \u201cto understand their history and context\u201d.

  "<p><em>Neil Basu, assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, sent this internal note to his fellow Metropolitan police officers:</em></p> <p>This message doesn\u2019t come from the head of counter-terrorism policing, an assistant commissioner of the Met police, nor a representative of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council. It\u2019s a personal message from me to policing colleagues across the UK. I have worn the badge proudly for 28 years. I also happen to be of mixed Indian and white British heritage, which means that I am the most senior BAME officer in the UK.</p> <p>I joined the Met in 1992, just after a BBC documentary called Black and Blue. It was powerful, depressing stuff, following the aspirations of young black and Asian police recruits \u2013 or more importantly, how those aspirations were shattered. Friends and family thought I was insane and I wouldn\u2019t last 28 minutes, let alone 28 years. But here I still am, and I would do it all again.</p> <p>In 1993, as I took my first independent patrol, I had my doubts about the organisation I had just joined. Doubts that it would become the professional, open and caring institution it is today. And just a few days later, a young black man called Stephen Lawrence was brutally murdered in a racist attack in Eltham [in south-east London]. It was senseless, and devastating for the family. Their grief was compounded many times over by our poor response.</p> <p>Then came the Lawrence inquiry by Sir William Macpherson. Few inquiries have received such attention or have been so transformational \u2013 exposing inequalities so familiar to BAME communities, and particularly the black British community. It was particularly hard to be a BAME officer at that time, and less than 2%&nbsp;of us were. For the failings of an organisation I love to be exposed so explicitly and publicly was painful.</p> <p>The damning findings and recommendations of that inquiry are etched into the fabric of UK policing\u2019s history \u2013 but the positive outcomes, hard won, are real. Our progress since has not been smooth, either, with missteps and setbacks along the way. Each setback is heart-breaking and despite how far we have come we must confront the fact that with many of our communities \u2013 especially the black community \u2013 we still have a long way to go.</p> <p>The death of George Floyd horrified us all, and rightly so. All the good cops I know \u2013 regardless of heritage \u2013 were also horrified, but for many of my BAME colleagues I suspect this has been a particularly shattering week. At least, that\u2019s how I feel.&nbsp;The way George died represented the worst of policing and will forever be a totemic image of racial injustice in America. His last words \u2026 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe \u2026\u201d have become an anthem, and I desperately hope this is their moment for change, as Stephen\u2019s senseless murder and the inquiry by Macpherson were for UK policing.</p> <p>It is not my place to criticise our colleagues in the US, still less to characterise the many with the actions of the few, or ascribe collective guilt. It is important, however, to highlight the differences between the UK and US \u2013 differences of structure, law, government and, most importantly, culture. We are not the same, because unlike America we overwhelmingly police by consent, and not by force.</p> <p>And so we cannot directly compare policing in the UK to that of our counterparts in the US. But what we are seeing in America, and here in the UK, too, is anger directed not just at police brutality but the racial bias built into the very fabric of our institutions and society \u2013 perhaps best illustrated in the UK by the huge disparity in young black men in the criminal justice system. Meanwhile, recent reports describe how BAME communities are not only more likely to die as a result of Covid-19, they have also been disproportionately affected by the way we have policed lockdown rules. This disparity is seen in education, in health, in the workplace \u2013 it\u2019s everywhere \u2013 and it\u2019s a daily lived experience for many.</p> <p>So let us view the legitimate anger, manifesting itself now in different ways, with nuance and care. Yes, some people behave badly; yes, a tiny minority are no more than criminal opportunists, but the overwhelming majority are showing solidarity with George and what his death represents. They have a point. We need to listen to our communities, and our people, and focus on what we in the UK can do better.</p> <p>I want to say a profound thank you to those officers policing these protests in the UK, and for the restraint, dignity and empathy many showed under real pressure. You walked the thin blue line with grace, and I salute you. UK policing is built upon the values of courage, integrity, professionalism and compassion. But these words only carry meaning if we act on them. Professionalism, born out of experience, skill and training, prevents us from applying pressure in a dangerous way when restraining suspects and people in mental health crisis.</p> <p>Integrity and courage means to speak up and act when we know we should intervene, with our peers, and even with our bosses. Indeed, it is precisely because one of our BAME officers had the courage to stand up and tell their bosses how they felt, that I felt inspired to write this.&nbsp;Above all, we must retain the key value so grimly absent as George Floyd died. Compassion.</p> <p>So, in the days to come, if you\u2019re working alongside a BAME colleague please take the time to check how they are. And if you are one of my BAME colleagues please know that whether you feel OK and able to get on with life, or you feel like you have been deeply affected \u2013 your feelings are valid. If you feel like you need help or support, please do not be afraid to ask for it.</p> <p>If we want to honour George\u2019s memory and leave policing in a better state than we found it, let\u2019s hold our values close to our hearts, act them out, and be a force for true change.</p> <p>Taking a knee was and is a powerful symbol of challenge and hope, and I was moved to see some of our officers do so. But personally I see this as a time to stand up \u2013 stand up to racists, to inequality and injustice.</p> <p>We can be better than this, and we must be better than this. There can be no better sight than watching people of many different faiths, nationalities and colour, standing together in peace against injustice. At the height of probably the greatest fear some of our communities have ever known, this is a time to stand together.&nbsp;</p> <p>Take care of yourselves, and one another.</p> <p>Neil&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Legal experts in Australia have said it is \u201cin the public interest\u201d to reopen investigations into several high profile Aboriginal deaths in custody and that implementing recommendations made from 13 previous inquiries could immediately reduce Indigenous incarceration rates by 20-30%.</p> \n<p>Law professor at the University of Technology, Sydney, Dr Thalia Anthony, echoed the calls of Black Lives Matter protesters and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/will-you-join-us-david-dungays-mother-tells-qa-australians-must-unite-to-seek-justice-for-her-son\">the family of David Dungay</a>, for state and territory public prosecutors to investigate past cases \u201cwhere there has been insufficient coronial inquest and insufficient investigation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere needs to be criminal investigation, not only to re-examine the evidence, but in light of standards we have for the treatment of First Nations lives,\u201d Anthony said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/black-lives-matter-protesters-referred-to-our-count-of-432-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-its-now-437\">Aboriginal deaths in custody: Black Lives Matter protests referred to our count of 432 deaths.

Several inquiries into the case did result in a prosecution. Police officer Chris Hurley initially claimed Doomadgee had tripped but was charged with manslaughter over the death. He was acquitted in 2007.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland\">Queensland</a>&nbsp;government paid a $30m settlement and delivered a formal apology to the people of Palm Island, after the federal court found police officers breached the Racial Discrimination Act and acted unlawfully in responding to riots over his death in custody.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen the DPP instigate charges, they do it on a number of bases. So that includes the public interest. At the time, there may not have been a public interest to prosecute, but with this shift in public consciousness around the issues you could say at this point there is public interest to prosecute.\u201d</p> \n<p>Anthony also called for urgent judicial reforms, many of which have been detailed in at least 13 different national investigations into Indigenous incarceration rates since 2009.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cbfe8c30-262e-4df5-844a-a36af3ce7c80\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2009)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Senate access to justice inquiry </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>(31 recommendations)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2010)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Australian Law Reform Commission inquiries into family violence and family violence and commonwealth laws</strong></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2011)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Lower house inquiry into Indigenous youth experiences with the criminal justice system</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>(40 recommendations)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2012)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Lower house inquiry into the prevention and diagnosis of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>(19 recommendations)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2013)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Senate inquiry into justice reinvestment </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>(Nine recommendations)&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2014)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Productivity Commission report on access to justice</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>(83 recommendations)</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2015)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Senate Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs inquiry into Harmful Use of Alcohol in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities</strong></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Experience of Law Enforcement and Justice Services</strong></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into Indefinite Detention of People with Cognitive and Psychiatric Impairment in Australia </strong></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2017)</i>&nbsp;<strong>The Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>(227 recommendations)&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2018)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Australian Law Reform Commission\u2019s Pathways to Justice</strong></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1994)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Reports of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner</strong></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><i>(January 1, 2010)</i>&nbsp;<strong>The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children </strong></p>\n    <p> </p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Anthony supports the establishment of an Indigenous-led independent commission looking into Aboriginal deaths in custody, and monitoring statistical trends.</p> \n<p>But she said there are law reforms that can happen now if state and territories are willing, including bail reform, efforts to reduce the number of people on remand, and the decriminalisation of minor offences.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat would include public order offences and offensive language, move-on laws, it would include shoplifting \u2013 that should be dealt with through a civil process \u2013 traffic offences like unregistered, unlicensed or uninsured vehicles, should all be dealt with through the civil system,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd if you get rid of those offences, I think you would probably reduce, especially for First Nations women, the prison rates by 20 or 30%.\u201d</p> \n<p>The national cabinet model, which has proved so successful in managing Covid-19, shows urgent reforms are possible, Anthony said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose were really hard decisions.

For some it will never happen. But as much as we talk about unconscious profiling, one thing that does exist are the facts.\u201d</p> <p>Hughton, who wants to get back into management, does not see enough diversity at the top of the Football Association. He commends the FA for ensuring that one BAME coach is associated with each England age group but believes there is more to achieve. \u201cIf you are looking at the make-up of our stakeholders and they are without ethnicity, it doesn\u2019t make things easier,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/06/watford-andre-gray-george-floyd-stereotyped-and-judged-by-police\">Watford's Andre Gray: 'It's not just about George Floyd \u2013 we are still stereotyped and judged by police here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that our stakeholders have a responsibility. We have to set things in place to encourage more BAME coaches to want to take their badges. In time the big organisations will be under more pressure to make sure they have an inclusive workforce and board. Our FA and Premier League need to be seen to be inclusive of the workforce. There has to be more pressure on our stakeholders to prove that they are more inclusive.\u201d</p> <p>Hughton, 61, has experienced racism. When he was younger, he had to learn to control his emotions. What he admires in today\u2019s generation, however, is the refusal to accept the status quo. \u201cIf I\u2019m looking at the protests at the moment and wondering if it will change things, the answer is yes,\u201d Hughton says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"708d0acb1096f23cc85d8b9407c8dc3746b0e5ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/708d0acb1096f23cc85d8b9407c8dc3746b0e5ca/216_102_2363_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Hughton assisting manager George Graham during a Tottenham training session in 1998\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Hughton assisting manager George Graham during a Tottenham training session in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne thing I absolutely applaud is that Raheem is not alone. These players have a platform. I\u2019ve seen the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold speaking out and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/02/fa-will-take-common-sense-approach-to-players-taking-a-knee-in-matches\">Liverpool team going down on one knee</a> before training.</p> <p>\u201cWhere does the pressure on organisations come from? It comes from enough voices and enough dissatisfaction. A lot of those marching are young individuals. The fact they are seeing what a lot of people have seen for many years is encouraging. It\u2019s going to be about pressure applied.</p> <p>\u201cI think black players have been the most vocal because they have had those experiences. What I saw from Liverpool was powerful and I would applaud any organisation or club that felt the same. I think it would be more powerful if it came from white players as well. But it would be more powerful if it came from the game as a whole. The game has an opportunity. I know there have been false dawns in the past and stances which have lost momentum but the feeling with this is not going to go away for the time being. Our organisations have a good opportunity to be part of change.\u201d</p> <p>Hughton says there must be visible action. Last year the EFL implemented the Rooney Rule, compelling clubs to interview at least one BAME candidate when hiring a first-team coach. \u201cI would have no doubt that a lot of people would use it as a sticking plaster \u2013 \u2018I will interview at least BAME person for the job because I have to\u2019,\u201d Hughton says. \u201cBut in theory I do agree with the Rooney Rule. It\u2019s a step. What I would rather have of course is for everybody to use it in the right way. I think some will and some won\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cThis has to lead to BAME individuals in positions of real authority \u2026 There has to be a real desire to make that change.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>From the moment Colin Kaepernick first took a knee during the national anthem to call attention to police brutality and systemic racism before a San Francisco 49ers preseason game back in 2016, he stood alone while the meaning of his silent demonstration was hijacked, contorted and undermined by detractors cloaked in patriotism, either misguidedly or deliberately, as a protest against the US military. The most tremendous of these bad actors was, of course, Donald Trump, at an Alabama rally the following year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\">infamously challenged the league\u2019s owners</a> to release anyone who refused to stand: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired!\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rather than back the players\u2019 right to freedom of expression, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell gifted Trump a decisive optical victory early in his administration by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/10/nfl-boss-roger-goodell-says-all-players-should-stand-for-the-national-anthem\">unveiling a policy</a> requiring every player, coach, trainer, ballboy, referee and executive to stand for the anthem or face punishment.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Four years later \u2013 after the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer choked the life from George Floyd in a gruesome extrajudicial murder that was beamed into living rooms throughout the country, sending hundred of thousands into the streets across America to demand police reform \u2013 Kaepernick\u2019s protest appears not merely justified but prescient. On Thursday, more than a dozen of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars including Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley, Michael Thomas and Deshaun Watson, the sorts of in-their-prime stars who might have shied away from social issues in the past, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2ctjBvEmRY\">posted a video</a> demanding the NFL state that it condemns systemic racism and \u201cadmit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting\u201d. And<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/democrats-unveil-police-reform-plan-congress-george-floyd-protests\"> congressional legislation tackling police reform</a> that would have been dismissed as politically quixotic only weeks ago has planted itself squarely in the national discourse.</p> \n<p>Ever since he first seized on Kaepernick\u2019s protest as a fountainhead of easy political points, Trump has co-opted American sports as not merely a proxy battle in the culture wars that reflect a country\u2019s deep divides but the primary theatre. He\u2019s returned to the well time and again when the polling numbers have called for a jolt, but the events of the past week have shown that the reservoir has run dry.</p> \n<p>The horrifying deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery have made it so the public can no longer stand by as Kaepernick\u2019s protest is misrepresented: the reality of the long-marginalized scourge of state-sanctioned murder of black and brown people has finally reached a mass audience. Consider New Orleans Saints star Drew Brees, who issued a public apology after he was blasted by teammates and fans for saying he \u201cwill never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Friday, only hours after Trump publicly excoriated Brees for backing down on his long-held stance, Goodell surprised many by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">releasing the mea culpa</a> his players asked for: \u201cWe, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96a3d449c37b8a98421c09cb53ae650b349af9fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a3d449c37b8a98421c09cb53ae650b349af9fd/0_0_4251_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Kaepernick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester in Washington wears a face mask with Colin Kaepernick\u2019s image.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sport holds a mirror up to society and the reflection isn\u2019t always pleasant. But Goodell\u2019s long-overdue reversal is less noteworthy as a courageous stand, which it is not, and more the barometer of public sentiment it surely is. A <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_060220/\">recent Monmouth University poll</a> states that a majority of Americans believe police officers are generally more likely to treat black people unfairly than to mistreat white people. And more than three-quarters of the country, including 71% of white Americans, believe \u201cracial and ethnic discrimination is a big problem in the United States\u201d \u2013 a 26-percentage-point spike from four years ago when Kaepernick was dismissed by large swatch of the public as an extremist and a clout-chaser.</p> \n<p>Goodell may have fumbled the handoff that Kaepernick first gave him in 2016, but he wasn\u2019t going to do it twice. And the commissioner\u2019s tacit endorsement has ensured that taking a knee will become the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912018945158402049\">locking arms</a> \u2013 that is to say, an acceptable and thereby meaningless form of protest. Whenever the next NFL season kicks off, kneeling will become another form of pre-game window dressing: just another patriotic thing to do when the anthem plays.</p> \n<p>But this mainstreaming of ideas once regarded as radical is proof that Kaepernick\u2019s protest, and the sacrifice of his NFL career that came with it, was worth the price.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3293aae03c57694a70233e027ca43363ecebc48f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3293aae03c57694a70233e027ca43363ecebc48f/0_0_3600_2396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Kaepernick, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of Colin Kaepernick, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in Miami.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Louis/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The NFL\u2019s diversity problem is its decision-making ranks has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/22/nfl-rooney-rule-diversity-draft-pick-incentives\">exhaustively documented</a>, but football itself is the most integrated sport we have in America. It\u2019s not just for black kids, it\u2019s not just for white kids. You can be fat and play on the line. You can be skinny and play wide receiver. You can be a total non-athlete like Tom Brady and win multiple Super Bowls.&nbsp;Which made it somewhat depressing that Brees, a 41-year-old who\u2019s spent more than half of his life around black teammates while becoming a symbol of hope for a city that endured one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/22/hurricane-katrina-recovery-lower-ninth-ward\">worst racial injustices in American history,</a> continued to push a false narrative in conflating a protest of extreme police brutality with disrespect for the military \u2013 especially when he\u2019d been given four years to get up to speed.</p> \n<p>Yet Brees\u2019 thoughtful response to Trump\u2019s broadside, addressed directly to the president, represents the sort of teachable moment that\u2019s bound to reach an audience beyond Kaepernick\u2019s influence and further the movement toward justice.</p> \n<p>\u201cThrough my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag. It has never been,\u201d Brees wrote. \u201cWe can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when?</p> \n<p>\u201cWe as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Or as LeBron James put it, in more <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAq3fpCgyve/?utm_source=ig_embed\">economical language</a>: \u201cDo you understand NOW!!??!!??\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAq3fpCgyve/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Environmental groups have accused a Russian mining firm of emphasising the role of global climate change in last week\u2019s historic oil spill in part to avoid punishment for its ageing infrastructure and potential negligence in the accident.</p> \n<p>The World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace Russia said that although climate change likely played a role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/03/vladimir-putin-orders-state-of-emergency-huge-fuel-spill-siberia-power-plant-kerch\">spillage of more than 20,000 tons of diesel fuel</a> that turned two rivers crimson near the Arctic city of Norilsk, the risks of thawing permafrost to Arctic infrastructure were publicly known and could have been addressed months or years earlier. </p> \n<p>The accident is one of the largest in Russian history and had been compared by Greenpeace to the Exxon Valdez spill.</p> \n<p>Regional officials on Tuesday said some pollutants from the leak had reached Lake Pyasino, a large body of water that leads to the Kara Sea. But the main damage has been done to the local Ambarnaya and Daldykan rivers and may take a decade to clean, local officials and environmentalists have said. Nornickel said that its monitoring did not show that the lake had been contaminated, citing the \u201cendeavour and the sacrifice of the accident responders\u201d who had responded to the spill and placed sea boons to halt the fuel\u2019s spread. A Russian emergency official on Tuesday also said that contamination levels in the lake remained \u201cwithin the maximum permissible concentration,\u201d according to data from Russia\u2019s environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"148adc3b-5522-49c4-b316-a4d287d07869\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nckCjv0VdOk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The operational director for the mining firm Nornickel, Sergei Dyachenko, had earlier denied that negligence at its subsidiary could have caused the accident. In a company press release, he said that \u201canomalously warm temperatures\u201d may have sped the thaw of permafrost beneath a gas tank and led to its collapse. In another press release, the company blamed the accident on \u201ca&nbsp;sudden sinking of&nbsp;supports of&nbsp;the storage tank which served accident-free for more than 30&nbsp;years\u201d.</p> \n<p>Experts have pointed to the broad impact of climate change in Russia\u2019s Arctic region over the past decade, noting in particular how thawing permafrost has led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/14/thawing-permafrost-destroying-arctic-cities-norilsk-russia\">fissures in apartment buildings</a>&nbsp;in Norilsk.</p> \n<p>But environmental groups say they are worried that Nornickel, a company that has been attacked in the past as one of Russia\u2019s biggest polluters in the Arctic, is now seeking to twist concerns about climate change to its defence.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to write off Nornickel\u2019s failure in risk management and ecological safety on the fashionable topic of climate change,\u201d said Alexey Knizhnikov of the World Wildlife Federation. \u201cThe main factor is mismanagement.\u201d</p> \n<p>The accident, and a government investigation into its causes, is likely to have serious repercussions for Russian industry in the Arctic. Russian oversight agencies have drafted plans to review oil reservoirs throughout the region and investigators have charged one power plant official with violating environmental protection rules, which carries a maximum sentence of five years.</p> \n<p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, also gave a public scolding last week to Vladimir Potanin, the billionaire president of Nornickel, about the company\u2019s ageing reservoirs. \u201cIf you had changed them on&nbsp;time, there would have been no environmental damage and&nbsp;no need to&nbsp;foot such costs,\u201d Putin told Potanin in a televised video call. Nornickel has pledged to cover all costs for the cleanup and to restore the local environment.</p> \n<p>Greenpeace Russia last week put out a statement titled \u201cThe melting of the permafrost is not an excuse for Nornickel\u201d, noting it believed the company \u201csought to avoid responsibility for the accident\u201d by blaming it on climate change.</p> \n<p>The environmental organisation noted that as far back as 2009 it had reported on the risks to Russia\u2019s oil-and-gas infrastructure from thawing permafrost.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible that the company did not know about [thawing permafrost], but it is possible that the company used a dangerous facility irresponsibly,\u201d said Vasily Yablokov, Greenpeace Russia\u2019s climate project manager.</p> \n<p>Weak enforcement and business cost decisions meant companies were hesitant to replace technology, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn principle, the interests of businesses are put above the ecology,\u201d said Yablokov.</p> \n<p>A Nornickel spokesperson said: \u201cSo far, we have only named a possible version of what happened. Final conclusions can be drawn only after the investigation is completed.\u201d She also said the company was actively involved in the clean-up from the accident.</p> \n<p>During a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, Dyachenko said the company believed that thawing permafrost was the cause of the accident. He said: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any precise monitoring being done on permafrost before [the accident],\u201d adding that local efforts to monitor the thawing permafrost were focused on the city of Norilsk and its residential building stock.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In a statement provided after publication, Nornickel said it \u201ccategorically rejects accusations of any attempts to avoid blame or downplay its responsibility for the diesel spillage in the Arctic,\u201d adding that such accidents were \u201cabsolutely unacceptable regardless of their primary cause.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company said it was cooperating with law enforcement agencies and had launched \u201ca full and thorough internal investigation\u201d into the accident.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe unequivocally accept that climate change risks, including those of abnormally high temperatures in the Arctic, must be properly addressed and mitigated. Nornickel has immediately launched a comprehensive inquiry into the increased risks we are now facing so to avoid climate-change related accidents in future.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe fully accept our responsibility for the event and are making appropriate financial provisions and arrangements for related legal liabilities as well as additional voluntary commitments in order to mitigate the inflicted environmental damage,\u201d the company said.</p>",
  "<p>A collective of senior black music industry executives from companies including Warner, Sony, Universal Music Group, BMG, Live Nation, Spotify and the Music Managers Forum has published an open letter to business leaders calling for immediate action on racism and marginalisation within the sector.</p> <p>The newly formed Black Music Coalition welcomed industry statements of support on last week\u2019s #BlackoutTuesday, a music industry-endorsed day of reflection during the ongoing global Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the death in police custody of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;in Minneapolis, but said that it was time to transform that support into \u201ctangible changes\u201d.</p> <p>The letter states: \u201cThe music industry has long profited\u202ffrom the rich and varied culture of black people for many generations but overall, we feel it has failed to acknowledge the structural and systematic racism affecting the very same black community and so effectively, enjoying the rhythm and ignoring the blues.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ukmusic.org/assets/general/UK_Music_Diversity_Report_2018.pdf\">A diversity report commissioned by UK Music in 2018</a> found that ethnic minorities represented 17.8% of roles within the British music industry. While 25.9% of workers age 16-24 age bracket are from an ethnic minority, that number drops steadily to just 11.4% in the 45-64 age bracket, indicating low representation at senior levels.</p> <p>A push for industry diversity had resulted in a lot of black employees in entry-level positions, said Char Grant, a senior A&amp;R manager at BMG. \u201cBut the support structure and the infrastructure for development hasn\u2019t been there so they\u2019ve been left to work it out for themselves. That can be quite a difficult place when you\u2019re not supported.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition, which formed over WhatsApp, has called for the implementation of specific career development programmes for black staff to advance future generations of leaders. It asked for change regarding the lack of black staff in senior management and the complete absence of black female presidents and chairwomen across the industry.</p> <p>The major disparity was with industry \u201cdecision makers\u201d, said Afryea Henry-Fontaine, senior marketing manager at Virgin EMI/ Universal Music Group. \u201cPeople that control the budgets, decide if an act is going to be signed. That\u2019s where there isn\u2019t diversity at all, at that capital-controlling level.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition called for businesses to create dedicated internal task forces to review, drive and challenge its equality and diversity aims, as well as the advancement of black executives across the business, with a focus on equal pay, mentorship and career progression.</p> <p>The lack of black music industry executives has a negative effect on the UK\u2019s rising black musicians, said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThings are lost in translation. There\u2019s not a sensitivity to different cultural nuances. Those that are advising them outside of management don\u2019t understand the culture in the way that they should.\u201d</p> <p>Following #BlackoutTuesday, Republic Records, home to Ariana Grande and Drake, pledged to stop using the term \u201curban\u201d to describe music made by black artists. The coalition\u2019s signatories called for music companies across the board to cease use of the term and replace it with \u201cblack music\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Urban\u2019 does often relate to R&amp;B, hip-hop \u2013&nbsp;sub-genres of blackness,\u201d said Whitney Boateng, a promoter at Metropolis Music. \u201c\u2018Urban\u2019 strips away the actual blackness from the music. Black is not a swear word. To say \u2018black music\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that people who are not black are not included \u2013&nbsp;it just means that you\u2019re giving credit to the actual genre and its makers and forefathers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8843d831e686f313f0e5e52a8d7ee19527ebb85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8843d831e686f313f0e5e52a8d7ee19527ebb85/0_169_6109_3665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AJ Tracey, whose single Dinner Guest is currently in the UK Top 10.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AJ Tracey, whose single Dinner Guest is currently in the UK Top 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grant said the term was outdated regarding today\u2019s charts, where black British music is a dominant fixture. \u201cIt\u2019s full of artists that have built their brands and their identities through strong fanbases, and they deserve to be on a level playing field with all the other artists at the top of the charts. \u2018Urban\u2019 doesn\u2019t support the advancement of people\u2019s understanding of the layers of black music. It contributes to the mentality of: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s urban \u2013&nbsp;you need to graduate to pop.\u2019 We need to be rid of that.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition asked music companies to commit a portion of their annual budget to offer financial support to black organisations, educational projects and charities. \u201cThey need more funding,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to come from the government or the National Lottery, and so I think it\u2019s disingenuous for an industry that profits so incredibly well from black culture and black music not to support those projects.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to mandatory anti-racism and unconscious bias training across each company for all non-black members of staff, led by black educators, the coalition asked for complimentary counselling and holistic services to be made available to black members of staff with immediate effect in order to address the effects of workplace racism and global violence against black people.</p> <p>\u201cBlack executives have been experiencing men and women that look like them being racially targeted and murdered by an institution that is supposed to serve and protect,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that play out on the news, on social media, in horrific and callous ways, and then we\u2019re expected to go into a work environment and operate as if everything is normal.\u201d</p> <p>She said it was important for companies to equip black employees with mental health provision and support. \u201cOften our experiences \u2013 especially as black women \u2013 are [dismissed as] \u2018You\u2019re being a bit dramatic\u2019 or, \u2018It wasn\u2019t that bad\u2019 and it\u2019s brushed under the rug. So it\u2019s really important to be able to speak to somebody that can identify and understand and help to unpick that situation without the fear of losing your job.\u201d</p> <p>Sent to CEOs, presidents and industry leaders on Monday morning , the letter has received a positive response. \u201cThis is not going to happen in 24 hours,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThis is a longstanding commitment that we\u2019ve made, and it\u2019s about pushing the conversation forward. It\u2019s about assessing that understanding and working with internal teams to make and push forward long-lasting change.\u201d</p> <p>The open letter follows US executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas\u2019s #TheShowMustBePaused initiative on 2 June, which called for the music industry to cease activity for a day in order for black participants to take space for their mental health and for allies to reflect on their obligations to black music communities.</p> <p>While the day provoked a mass social media movement beyond the music industry, some musicians and industry employees criticised the blackout for pledging silence at a time when social media had become a key tool for the spread of information between protesters on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Henry-Fontaine said she understood the scepticism, but affirmed the importance of the day. \u201cThis is the first time the entire industry has stopped and been so public in their support. The whole purpose is to be in dialogue, to hold companies accountable. These are the first five immediate calls to action. There are many more to come because this is a multifaceted issue. We\u2019re not gonna click our fingers and it\u2019ll all be over.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The father of Stephen Lawrence has said black people are still treated as second-class citizens in Britain, with police breaking promises to change they made two decades ago after being shamed by their failure to find his son\u2019s racist killers.</p> <p>Neville Lawrence used a Guardian interview to back peaceful&nbsp;anti-racism protests, saying he was \u201cpleased\u201d by the mass marches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-protests-black-lives-matter-colston-statue-rhodes-live\">sweeping </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-protests-black-lives-matter-colston-statue-rhodes-live\">the country</a>, triggered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-bail\">US police killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> <p>Lawrence said racial injustice in Britain was worse than it should be and that the government, from the prime minister down, was not doing enough.</p> <p>Revealing his continuing exasperation with UK policing, he said it was still institutionally racist, as shown by stop and search disproportionately targeting black people.</p> <p>Lawrence, 78, said statues such as that of the slave owner Edward Colston, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">pulled down</a> and dumped in Bristol harbour at the weekend, were \u201coffensive\u201d and should not have been left up in the first place. However, he warned against violence and voiced concerns over the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/protesters-rally-in-oxford-for-removal-of-cecil-rhodes-statue\">protests moved to Oxford</a>, with more than 1,000 gathering to demand the removal of a statue of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes from Oriel College.</p> <p>It came as Britain\u2019s head of counterterrorism, Neil Basu, denounced racial bias in UK institutions and society, and said protesters had legitimate aims that should not be tarnished by a violent minority.</p> <p>In an internal post for officers, the most senior BAME officer in policing wrote:&nbsp;\u201cWhat we are seeing in America, and here in the UK, too, is anger directed not just at police brutality but the racial bias built into the very fabric of our institutions and society \u2013 perhaps best illustrated in the UK by the huge disparity in young black men in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, recent reports describe how BAME communities are not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">more likely to die as a result of Covid-19</a>, they have also been disproportionately affected by the way we have policed lockdown rules. This disparity is seen in education, in health, in the workplace \u2013 it\u2019s everywhere \u2013 and it\u2019s a daily lived experience for many.\u201d</p> <p>Basu said he felt moved to see officers take a knee at the weekend, adding: \u201cWe must confront the fact that with many of our communities \u2013 especially the black community \u2013 we still have a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence\u2019s 18-year-old son, Stephen, was murdered in 1993 by a racist gang in south-east London, with police bungling the investigation.</p> <p>He and his wife, Doreen, now Lady Lawrence, spent years fighting the police, who denied wrongdoing, and won a public inquiry which in 1999 found errors were down to incompetence and \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d.</p> <p>Police promises to reform and enshrine racial justice in the ranks, Lawrence said, were not delivered and he still had no idea when they would be kept. \u201cI thought&nbsp;when they came out they would be respected and done in quick time, so people can see they are making the force more fair.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not done in quick time, it\u2019s not been done, I don\u2019t know when it will be done \u2013 we should not be talking&nbsp;about it 21 years later. They have fallen way, way short. Twenty-one years short.\u201d</p> <p>The 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">Lammy </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">review</a> concluded that \u201cBAME individuals still face bias, including overt discrimination, in parts of the justice system\u201d. It showed that, while black people comprise 3% of the overall population in England and Wales, they made up 12% of its prison population, with the percentage of black people in prison higher in relation to their share of the general population than the corresponding figure&nbsp;in the US.&nbsp;Just 1.2% of police officers in England and Wales are black, official data shows.</p> <p>Lawrence said police had made some improvements but these were insufficient to gain support in certain communities, damaging their ability to fight crime. \u201cWithout the community behind you it is harder to solve crimes. It is like a them-and-us situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want people stealing and doing bad things. Some people still think the police are not there for them.\u201d</p> <p>The Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has declared that Britain\u2019s biggest force is <a href=\"https://archive.voice-online.co.uk/article/police-force-no-longer-institutionally-racist-says-dick\">no longer institutionally racist</a>. Lawrence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/04/neville-lawrence-to-lead-new-police-monitoring-group\">who has previously praised her</a>, said: \u201cI totally disagree with her. Yes, the police are institutionally racist.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence cited stop and search as an example. Figures for 2019 show the Met stopped more black people than white, despite black people making up 12%&nbsp;of London\u2019s population and white people 59%. The Met has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">said it is focusing its efforts on the areas with the worst violence.</a></p> <p>Lawrence said some officers were still misusing their powers: \u201cStop and search can be good if done in the proper way. A lot of these officers do not do it in a proper way.\u201d</p> <p>He said he had been stopped and searched, as had his black police family liaison officer, when driving off-duty in plain clothes. \u201cI had to laugh,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way to pounce on people, it\u2019s an excuse, it\u2019s not a reasonable excuse to stop people.\u201d</p> <p>He said the government should bring back a special steering group to oversee the changes promised after the 1999 Lawrence inquiry.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere is no one policing the recommendations now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police&nbsp;cannot be relied on to reform. They are a group of people who do not believe they should be told what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence said the current Conservative government was failing on racial justice and that Johnson, who has compared&nbsp;women wearing the burqa to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and used the racially offensive term \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d, may himself have a problem with race:&nbsp;\u201cI have not seen anything that has convinced me he has not.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence said the protests should be peaceful and that those attacking the police should be caught and prosecuted. He said black people were still treated as second-class citizens, \u201cnot only in this country but all over the world\u201d, making action on the streets much-needed. \u201cI am pleased there are lots of people trying to support it.\u201d</p> <p>However, he said he was concerned protesters were potentially exposing themselves to the coronavirus: \u201cThey have made a decision to put themselves at risk to show their displeasure at what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Amid controversy after protesters tore down the Colston statue, Lawrence said: \u201cThe people in power should have the decency to realise it is offensive. They should have removed it. [But] I would not have been part of that group that took it down. The authorities should have known it was offensive and taken it down.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing renewed anger over monuments honouring slave owners and colonialists, Lawrence said: \u201cPeople who have done bad things should not be put up as heroes. Statues in public places should be someone who has done something good, not something bad.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence said the loss of his son and the police failings still haunt his life, which is now split between London and Jamaica, where he was born and where Stephen was buried. \u201cI can\u2019t forget because it\u2019s my life, this I have been going through for 27 years. We are all still feeling pain. When I hear a song me and my son used to listen to, I\u2019m back,&nbsp;to the&nbsp;times we were together.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence said the death of Floyd in Minneapolis shook him greatly. \u201cWhen I saw the news, tears came out of my eyes. I did not believe someone could do that when others stood by and watched. It was unforgivable&nbsp;for someone to kneel&nbsp;on someone\u2019s neck when they say \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019.\u201d</p>",

He says it was striking that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> used cabinet this morning to reset his response to the <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protests, reinforcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">the message he conveyed in a video message last night.</a></p> \n  <p>In a tweet on Sunday night, after BLM protesters tore down the <strong>Edward Colston</strong> statue in Bristol and a minority of BLM protesters in London got involved in clashes with the police, Johnson posted this on Twitter.</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Boris Johnson #StayAlert<strong>\u2714</strong>@BorisJohnson</p> \n   <p>People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

The spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The PM began cabinet by discussing the anger and the grief felt not just in the US but around the world following the death of George Floyd. He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered.</p> \n   <p>He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law.</p> \n   <p>He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to that effort.</p> \n   <p>The PM said his message to all those who protested lawfully was \u2018I hear you and I understand\u2019. However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019. <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled. At the No 10 lobby briefing yesterday, in response to the same question, the spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/08/uk-coronavirus-johnson-says-anti-racist-protests-were-subverted-by-thuggery-live-news-covid19-updates?page=with:block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e#block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e\">Johnson did not think the UK was a racist country. </a>Now the line is that the UK is \u201cmuch, much less racist\u201d than it was.</p> \n  <p>At today\u2019s briefing the spokesman was also asked if Johnson felt that any of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-record-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-comments-bumboys-piccaninnies-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">his various racially offensive comments in the past</a> had contributed to the UK\u2019s problems in this regard.

I understood the arguments, it certainly seems anachronous, and while the thoughts of its removal in no way concerned me, I simply considered it someone else\u2019s decision to make. On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully.

  "<p>Last November, Prince Andrew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/nov/15/prince-andrew-says-he-let-the-side-down-over-friendship-with-jeffrey-epstein-video\">gave a rare interview</a> to the BBC\u2019s Emily Maitlis. The prince was under pressure to explain his friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who had killed himself that summer in a Manhattan jail, and to answer accusations from one of the young women whom Epstein had trafficked, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/23/boorish-and-self-centred-little-love-for-prince-andrew-over-epstein-links\">Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a>. What could go wrong?</p> <p>As it turned out, everything. Andrew said he couldn\u2019t remember meeting Giuffre and denied having had sex with her. The claims were impossible, he said, because at the time he was at Pizza Express in Woking. He expressed little sympathy for Epstein\u2019s multiple victims.</p> <p>In the wake of the Newsnight broadcast, the prince stood down from royal duties and exited public life. The interview appears to haunt the prince still, and may explain the thinking of his British legal team now embroiled in an increasingly rancorous battle with federal prosecutors in New York.</p> <p>Since late last year Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, has been seeking a face-to-face interview with the Queen\u2019s second son. Berman is in charge of a criminal investigation into sex trafficking. The prince is not a suspect. But investigators are keen to build up a portrait of what exactly happened behind closed doors at Epstein\u2019s mansion in New York and at his home in the US Virgin Islands. Andrew visited both. So did underage girls, though the prince told Maitlis he never saw them.</p> <p>Andrew has insisted he is eager to cooperate fully with the US investigation. But the prince and the detective appear to define \u201ccooperation\u201d very differently. Berman wants a sit-down interview. The prince\u2019s PR advisers say Andrew is ready to provide a witness statement. This would be sworn, of course. But it falls well short of a probing FBI encounter with follow-up questions.</p> <p>Over the past four months the two sides have been involved in an unhappy game of transatlantic ping pong. On a bleak day in January, an exasperated Berman appeared in front of his office and made a statement for TV. He said the prince had not \u201cfollowed through\u201d on his initial offer to speak to the FBI and to the southern district of New York. There was \u201czero cooperation\u201d, he complained.</p> <p>In March, Berman went on the attack again. He said the prince had \u201ccompletely shut the door on voluntary cooperation\u201d. Ominously, he said his office was now \u201cconsidering its options\u201d. What that meant became clear on Monday when the Sun published an <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11805488/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-us-quizzed/\">eye-catching front-page exclusive</a> headlined \u201cYanks: Hand Over Andy\u201d.</p> <p>In the face of apparent stonewalling, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) is now seeking help from the UK government. It has made a formal request, known as a mutual legal assistance treaty submission, to get access to Andrew. The prince\u2019s advisers have not confirmed this. The request opens up various legal scenarios, all of them potentially hugely embarrassing for the royal family.</p> <p>There is no prospect of Andrew being flown back to the US in handcuffs. The US attorney general, William Barr, made this clear in a <a href=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6162445140001\">Fox News interview</a>. But Andrew may be compelled to appear as a witness in a UK court. Under the terms of the treaty, officials could interview him on behalf of US prosecutors. Viewed from London, neither option looks especially appealing. Or as one source put it to the Sun: \u201cIt\u2019s a diplomatic nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham Palace press office no longer looks after Andrew after he stood down last year. On Monday his solicitors, Blackfords LLP, put out a statement on his behalf. It is a quietly smouldering document, accusing the Americans of bad faith and poor behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cThe Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance to the DoJ,\u201d it says. \u201cUnfortunately, the DoJ has reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming that the duke has offered zero cooperation. In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proferred.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew is not and was never a criminal \u201ctarget\u201d, Blackfords stresses, adding that he was assured his dealings with the attorney\u2019s office would remain private.</p> <p>The standoff seems to be as much about cultural stereotypes as the law. The prince\u2019s advisers appear to view Berman as a brash and ungentlemanly showboater, more keen on TV ratings and career-boosting publicity than justice. Mentioning Andrew\u2019s name guarantees primetime coverage, they suggest. One compared Berman to a human \u201cwrecking ball\u201d who had destroyed trust with his disturbing and regressive manner.</p> <p>The Americans, by contrast, apparently regard their British counterparts as cold, slippery and obstructive, and perhaps stuck up as well. Even the metaphors come from different sides of the pond. A source close to the prince\u2019s legal team likened the row this week to a game of cricket: \u201cLegal discussions with the DoJ are subject to strict confidentiality rules. We have chosen to abide by both the letter and spirit of these rules. We believe in playing straight bat.\u201d</p> <p>It is reasonable to wonder whether this rhetorical obsession with good manners and sportsmanship is a way of avoiding the horrendous facts. In his Newsnight interview, Andrew described Epstein\u2019s behaviour \u2013 the financier had a 2008 conviction for abusing a 14-year-old girl \u2013 as \u201cunbecoming\u201d. To which Maitlis shot back: \u201cUnbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u201d</p> <p>Like Maitlis, the DoJ seems unimpressed. Late on Monday, Berman accused the prince of \u201cfalsely\u201d portraying himself as keen to cooperate with the Epstein investigation \u2013 in other words, of lying. Andrew had repeatedly declined requests to schedule a date, Berman said, adding: \u201cNearly four months ago [he] informed us unequivocally \u2026 that he would not come in for such an interview.\u201d</p> <p>The prince has indicated he hopes to be completely exonerated in the Epstein affair. He reportedly <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2020/06/08/statement-marked-start-prince-andrews-meticulously-planned-fightback/\">compares his woes</a> to those of the late Lord Bramall and other high-profile figures wrongly accused by the Metropolitan police of historical child abuse. Andrew\u2019s wish once the legal action is concluded is to return to public duties.</p> <p>According to Stephen Bates, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Royalty-Inc-Britains-Best-Known-Brand/dp/1781313563\">author of Royalty Inc</a> and a former royal correspondent, there is not much prospect of that. \u201cRoyals have appeared in court cases over the years in fairly deferential circumstances. I can\u2019t think of a case where they have been involved in foreign litigation like this. Such is the mess Andrew has got himself into.\u201d Bates added: \u201cWhat Epstein did for Andrew was to give him an entree to fabulously wealthy Americans.\u201d </p> <p>In addition to the FBI case, dozens of Epstein victims are seeking compensation from the financier\u2019s estate, which is worth around $600m. This civil legal action, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-people-jeffrey-epstein/epstein-estate-victims-reach-agreement-on-compensation-fund-idUKKBN23535R\">taking place in the US Virgin Islands</a>, has nothing to do with Andrew as such and he is not obliged to respond to its requests. But as a celebrity royal he is likely to figure in the continuing Epstein media coverage, whether he wants to or not.</p> <p>For most of his gilded life, Andrew has got what he wanted. Both he and his ex-wife Sarah \u2013 they share a home, Royal Lodge, in Windsor \u2013 have used their connections and social status to their advantage. This time, though, it appears the prince is likely to lose his fight with US prosecutors. Sooner or later he will have to sit down for an interview.</p> <p>In the other court \u2013 that of public opinion \u2013 his case may already be lost.</p>",
  "<p>A patient is at serious risk of dying after his cancer went undetected when the suspension of many NHS services due to the coronavirus pandemic meant he had to wait months for a scan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fighting for my life because I didn\u2019t have a scan. I should have had the scan months earlier, but didn\u2019t because normal NHS care was suspended because of the coronavirus. I started asking for one in early March but didn\u2019t finally get one until last week,\u201d Sherwin Hall told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m angry, frustrated and disappointed. And I\u2019m devastated that I might lose my life to cancer that could have been cured if they had done what they were supposed to do [more quickly].\u201d</p> <p>The scan revealed Hall had a tumour measuring 14cm in his pelvis and 30 small tumours in his lungs, which he believes developed during the time he could not get a scan. Doctors say the 27-year-old delivery driver\u2019s cancer is particularly aggressive and fast-growing.</p> <p>Patient safety campaigners, health charities and medical negligence lawyers warn that growing numbers of cases like Hall\u2019s are emerging, in which patients are at risk from life-threatening illnesses because they missed out on diagnostic tests or surgery while hospitals were concentrating on treating Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>Hall began seeking care at Leeds General Infirmary and the city\u2019s St James\u2019s hospital days before before the lockdown began on 23 March. But doctors diagnosed his pain as being caused by<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/prostatitis/\"> a condition called prostatitis</a>, in which the prostate gland becomes inflamed.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe them. I did my own research and knew it was something else. I kept begging them in April and May to give me an MRI scan but I didn\u2019t have one until last week. Both my GP and my consultant told me that I couldn\u2019t get one because scanning services were slowed down because of the coronavirus,\u201d said Hall, whose case was highlighted on ITV News on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>His pain became excruciating and at one point was so debilitating that he considered taking his own life, he said. His chances of surviving cancer remain unclear.</p> <p>Hall has instructed Mary Smith, a lawyer at Novum Law solicitors, to investigate his care and the possibility of him suing the NHS. He is also trying to crowdfund the cost of seeking medical treatment in the US, and is finally starting chemotherapy later this week in Leeds.</p> <p>More patients are coming forward whose health has suffered because they could not access NHS care, said Smith. \u201cThis is a fairly widespread problem. The concern at the moment is that for non-Covid patients, the healthcare system in parts of the UK has entered a state of paralysis and this really cannot be allowed to continue because people are suffering harm.</p> <p>\u201cFor patients to be denied potentially life-saving diagnostics and treatment when hospitals are empty or running far below normal capacity, and so many doctors and other healthcare workers are able and willing to treat them, is a clear breach of the government\u2019s systemic duty under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to have a properly functioning healthcare framework in place to protect patients\u2019 lives. It is indefensible.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Walsh, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said Hall\u2019s case was not unique. \u201cSadly, there are many other patients with various potentially life-threatening conditions who have also been missing out, often with serious consequences.\u201d</p> <p>He said the NHS should use its mothballed Nightingale hospitals, and also private sector hospitals, to give the growing backlog of patients the tests and treatment they needed as a matter of urgency. \u201cNot to do so is running the risk of creating a second catastrophe affecting thousands of patients.\u201d</p> <p>Other cases emerging where the pandemic prevented treatment include:</p> <ul> <li><p>A woman in her 40s whose breast cancer spread into her blood and bones when her treatment was delayed.</p></li> <li><p>A woman suffering severe depression when she could not have surgery to fix a badly broken arm that had not healed properly.</p></li> <li><p>A young woman with severe dental problems who ended up with severe depression when she could not get treated.</p></li> </ul> <p>A spokesperson for NHS England said cancer services were quickly returning to normal.&nbsp;\u201cCoronavirus has turned millions of lives upside down.&nbsp;NHS staff have made huge efforts to ensure that patients continue to get treatment. Cancer services are largely now open, ready and able to receive all&nbsp;patients who need care. Anyone concerned about a possible cancer symptom should contact their GP practice and come forward for a check-up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Dr Phil Wood, the chief medical officer at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust, which runs the two hospitals where Hall sought help, said:&nbsp;\u201cWe are extremely sorry to hear about Mr Hall\u2019s circumstances, and we are looking into Mr Hall\u2019s case to understand the background.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe have maintained MRI scanning for all urgent interventions, clinically prioritising those patients who have been referred by a GP with a suspected cancer diagnosis, or those presenting in our emergency department where MRI was considered appropriate.&nbsp;All our urgent referral pathways have remained open during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThroughout the Covid-19 outbreak we have continued to follow Nice guidelines by clinically triaging cases into high, intermediate and low risk of cancer.\u201d</p>",

The plan was hugely controversial, by the time the law got passed the scheme had been watered down and was to a large extent voluntary, and later it was enthusiastically repealed by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government. But Blair has not lost interest in the concept and, at an event today, he said that coronavirus made the case for digital ID more compelling than ever.</p> <p>As PA Media reports, Blair said that only if people can show easily whether they are clear of coronavirus will industries like international travel be able to restart. Speaking at the virtual CogX technology conference, Blair said that such a system would operate alongside track and trace programmes as the economy reopens. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can create a digital ID today that is much more easily protected so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people.</p> <p>It is a natural evolution of the way that we are going to use technology in any event to transact daily life and this Covid crisis gives an additional reason for doing that.</p> <p>I think people\u2019s disease status - have they been tested, what is the result of that test and have they had the disease, do they have the disease - unless you are able to record some of this data in a way people can use, it is going to be difficult to go back to anything like a near normal in things like transport.</p> <p>If you are going to start international travel again, how can you do that unless people can be easily tested and have some record of that test?</p> <p>There has always been a good case for introducing some form of digital ID but I think that case is even more powerful today.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f/0_184_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:32:15.682Z\">at 4.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edfa64b8f08758335228acd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:13:08.701Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the press conference to launch the report on the test and trace system from the Independent Sage pressure group (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-coronavirus-live-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1#block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1\">11.25am)</a>, its chair, <strong>Sir David King</strong>, a former government chief scientific adviser, suggested there had been a \u201closs of moral authority\u201d on the test and trace issue.

Independent Sage is <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/who-is-on-the-independent-sage/\">a group of 12 senior scientists (mostly professors)</a>, set up to shadow the official Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. They have already published <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">other reports critical of the government\u2019s coronavirus policy</a>, although today\u2019s is probably the harshest. Ministers have until now largely ignored them, treating them as minority voices in the science community. But it is hard to dismiss them as not credible. Independent Sage is chaired by <strong>Sir David King</strong>, who was the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser (ie, one of Sir Patrick Vallance\u2019s predecessors) between 2000 and 2007.</p> <p>The report should be on <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">the Independent Sage website </a>shortly. But here\u2019s an extract from its news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new report from the Independent Sage ... says the virus will only be contained if 80% of contacts of infected people are traced. It describes this as \u2018impossible\u2019 under the current system and says a radical restructuring is necessary with responsibility handed over to local public health directors.</p> <p>The report expresses particular concern that the erosion of trust in government in recent weeks is likely to have a major effect on compliance and that no attempt has so far been made to engage with local communities. BAME communities, in particular, it says have suffered \u2018a disproportionate loss of trust\u2019.</p> <p>Currently, the government is using a centralised system of \u2018test, track and trace\u2019 led by Baroness Dido Harding with private contractors providing 25,000 contact tracers. The report notes that New Zealand has shown that eliminating the virus is possible but that containing it depends on tracing at least 80% of contacts who then must remain isolated for 14 days. \u2018This is clearly not happening,\u2019 the report says and urges the government to adopt an existing approach used by public health authorities, \u2018Find, Test, Trace, Isolate and Support\u2019 (FTTIS).</p> <p>Individuals must be supported, the report says, financially and in other ways as surveys from late May have shown that compliance with government guidelines decreased. Noting a \u2018background of decreasing confidence in the government\u2019s management of the pandemic,\u2019 it says that incentives must be introduced as currently people are reporting leaving home when they have symptoms.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report makes five recommendations. They are:</p> <p><strong>1. Local directors of public health (who work for councils) should take the lead in test and trace, the report says.</strong> A local approach would be \u201cmost effective\u201d it says.</p> <p><strong>2. There should be effective community engagement to build trust in the scheme, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Test and trace data should be embedded within NHS and council data, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>4. Material support, including food and money, should be available for people asked to isolate, the report says. It is this is \u201ccritical\u201d if FTTIS is going to work.</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Key performance data should be published weekly, the report says.</strong></p> <p>Commenting on his report, King said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it \u2018world beating\u2019. It is clear from our research that this simply isn\u2019t the case, indeed the system as it stands is not fit for purpose. This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country\u2019s recovery.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later today Independent Sage is holding a public consultation, followed by a press conference at 1.45pm.</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>The Independent Sage criticisms largely relate to how test and trace operates in England.

The government expects children to be able to return to early years settings, and for reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes, from this point. This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning.

What is needed, now, is a national plan for education, along the lines being developed by the Scottish government.</p> <p>This should cover all possible scenarios and focus on blended learning, at home and at school; greatly increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access so that they can access online teaching and learning, and the requisitioning of local public spaces, such as community centres and libraries, so that pressure on school space is lessened and more children are able to return to school in safe environments.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5edf4d008f083999a26dce55\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T09:02:18.422Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK excess deaths associated with coronavirus have now reached around 64,000, says ONS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Stripe</strong>, head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, has posted a useful Twitter thread on today\u2019s death figures.

  "<p>Ellis Genge has revealed that he and Eddie Jones were subjected to racist abuse on England\u2019s tour of South Africa in 2018. Genge was a non-playing member of the squad for the three-Test tour and has spoken of an incident which took place after one the matches.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview with BBC 5 Live, Genge also spoke of the racist abuse he suffered when growing up in Bristol, the Black Lives Matters protests and called for more black coaches in elite rugby union. Genge\u2019s comments follow those of the England footballer Raheem Sterling, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/09/raheem-sterling-english-football-black-managers-campbell-cole\">who has spoken of the need for more black representation</a> at the top of the game. </p> <p>Genge said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">tearing down of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol</a> on Sunday was \u201cwarranted \u2026 after 10 years of asking\u201d. </p> <p>Recalling his youth in Bristol, Genge said: \u201cI still get that [racist abuse] now.

It is still very rife, especially in sport. Look, you can\u2019t control that yourself, you just sort of need to put the message out there. Like Raheem Sterling said, if you have got a platform, you can use it. It\u2019s something that needs to be stamped out.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Paul Hull, his former coach at Bristol, Genge also echoed Sterling\u2019s calls for more black coaches at the top end of the game. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to see that. The issue in rugby is it has been a white man\u2019s game for a number of years. There\u2019s not really many black coaches or ethnic coaches, especially here in England.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think people are commercialised, especially the black and African boys in rugby or women to be icons, we are not presented like that. I can understand why the youth, and [with] the poverty today, don\u2019t want to be rugby players because it is not the way we are presented, we\u2019re sort of put on this posh pedestal and it\u2019s slowly breaking the mould.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC later apologised for using a picture of Lewis Ludlam \u2013 Genge\u2019s England team-mate \u2013 in a story about the Leicester prop.

  "<p>The Conservative manifesto made a clear promise. It <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf\">pledged</a> that in the government\u2019s trade talks, \u201cwe will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d. Just six months after the election, the promise has been ditched. Our government is now <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/03/britain-ready-allow-import-chlorinated-chicken-us/\">proposing</a> that chlorine-washed chicken, beef treated with growth hormones, pork from animals injected with a drug that makes their meat leaner, called <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/47032-time-for-us-to-ban-ractopamine.html\">ractopamine</a>, and scores of other foods produced in the United States by dangerous, cruel and disgusting means will be allowed into this country, as long as higher trade taxes (tariffs) are applied to them.</p> <p>&nbsp;The trade secretary, Liz Truss, has made it clear that any such tariffs would be <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-talks-boris-johnson-trump-a9549656.html\">removed within 10 years</a>. It\u2019s impossible to see the American trade negotiators allowing them to pass in the first place. The US intends to secure \u201ccomprehensive\u201d access to our food markets, while \u201c<a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Summary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\">reducing or eliminating tariffs</a>\u201d. This nonsense about higher tariffs is a blatant attempt to soften us up, to sugar the toxic pill of US imports that don\u2019t meet our standards. When I say sugar, I mean high-fructose corn syrup.</p> <p>&nbsp;It\u2019s not as if our standards are wonderful. But by comparison to the revolting practices in the US, our food rules, laid down by the European Union, are a haven of sanity. As well as washing chicken flesh with chlorine to compensate for the filthy conditions in which it is raised and processed, and injecting dangerous substances into cattle and pigs, Big Farmer and Big Food in the US use 72 pesticides that are<a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-019-0488-0\"> banned</a> in the UK and food colourings that have been linked to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17825405/\">hyperactivity in children</a>, impose no limits on the amount of <a href=\"https://www.sgs.com/en/news/2015/12/global-regulatory-requirements-for-baby-food\">sugar in baby food</a> and permit cow\u2019s milk to contain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/02/chlorinated-chicken-foods-us-trade-deal-uk-eu\">twice the amount of pus</a> that the UK allows.</p> <p>&nbsp;What this all means is that we will bring into this country food whose production is banned here. Either our farmers and food processors will be outcompeted, or our domestic production standards will be brought down to match. Some Conservative MPs attempted to <a href=\"http://www.farmbusiness.co.uk/news/minister-claims-unintended-consequences-as-agriculture-bill-import-standards-amendment-is-defeated.html\">insert an amendment</a> into the agriculture bill last month to uphold the manifesto promise. But it was decisively slapped down by government loyalists. The bill returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday. </p> <p>&nbsp;The US government argues that these matters should be left to <a href=\"https://www.farminguk.com/news/chlorinated-chicken-should-be-offered-in-uk-us-ambassador-says_53138.html\">consumers</a>. We should each be allowed to decide whether we buy cheap vegetables containing residues of pesticides that are banned here. But I suspect that, rather than having to read and interpret the labels on everything we buy from shops, takeaways and restaurants, most of us would prefer to know that all the food on sale is safe to eat. Anyway, just in case we did try to exercise such choice, the US also insists that all <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-talks-boris-johnson-trump-a9549656.html\">useful labelling be banned</a>. Perversely, it has argued that <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2019/nov/27/leaked-papers-us-uk-trade-talks-guide-revelations\">warning labels are \u201charmful\u201d</a> to public health.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t end with food. In the same section of their manifesto, the Conservatives promised that \u201cin our trade talks \u2026 the NHS is not on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs is not on the table. The services the NHS provides are not on the table.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-us-trade-deal-nhs-leaked-papers-dossier-corbyn-a9220916.html\">leaked dossier of trade documents</a> released by the Labour party last year revealed that the US was seeking \u201cfull market access\u201d to the NHS. If the promised food and farming standards were a lie, how long will it be before we discover that the NHS pledge was also worthless?</p> <p>&nbsp;I suspect this has been the agenda all along. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\">neoliberal extremists</a> who populate the front benches have long sought to rip down our public protections, rip down our public services, rip down everything that stands in the way of the most vicious form of capitalism. A trade deal with the US allows them to do so while disclaiming responsibility for the consequences. Once they have signed it, they can claim that, sadly, their hands are tied. They could say that unfortunately, the rules don\u2019t allow us to maintain food standards and force us to open the NHS to competition. Perhaps mistakes were made during the negotiations but it\u2019s a done deal now, enforced by legal instruments, and there\u2019s nothing we can do.&nbsp;They know they could never obtain public consent for these policies. A US trade deal would impose them without consent.</p> <p>&nbsp;Even parliamentary consent is unnecessary. The <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0120/cbill_2019-20210120_en_1.htm\">trade bill</a>, which has now reached the committee stage in the House of Commons, makes no provision for <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2020/may/20/trade-bill-slap-face-mps-say-campaigners\">parliamentary scrutiny</a> of any deal. Parliament has <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/05/the-tory-trade-bill-threatens-parliamentary-sovereignty/\">no legal right under this bill to debate or vote on a trade deal</a>, or even to know what it contains. The bill also grants the government <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/what-are-henry-viii-powers/\">Henry VIII powers</a> to change the law on trade agreements <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8854/?doing_wp_cron=1591707554.6092081069946289062500\">without parliamentary approval</a>. The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are granted no formal role in negotiating or approving trade treaties. In other words, nothing is being left to chance. This is not democracy. This is elective dictatorship.</p> <p>&nbsp;To make matters worse, the US is likely to insist that the deal is enforced by an offshore tribunal, which allows corporations to sue governments if domestic law affects their \u201cfuture anticipated profits\u201d. This mechanism has been used<a href=\"https://stopisds.org.uk/what-is-isds/\"> all over the world</a> to punish nations for laws their parliaments have passed. It ensures that, over time, legislation everywhere has to be tailored to the <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/topic/globalization-trade/corporate-power-expanded-isds/\">demands of corporate power</a>. Far from taking back control, a trade deal on these lines with the US involves a massive renunciation of sovereign power.</p> <p>&nbsp;The government knows that accepting such a deal means no deal with the EU. US food rules are incompatible with EU standards. In the leaked documents, US officials remark that \u201cthere would be <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2019/nov/27/leaked-papers-us-uk-trade-talks-guide-revelations\">all to play for in a no-deal situation</a>\u201d. I suspect our government sees it the same way.</p> <p>The&nbsp;pigheaded&nbsp;obstructionism of the UK in the current EU talks is at stark odds with its willingness to prostrate itself before US power. Dominic Cummings says he intends to stay in his post as adviser at No 10 <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/under-fire-dominic-cummings-considering-22104633\">for the next six months</a>. In other words, he will stay for long enough to ensure that the transition period for leaving the EU is not extended, making a no-deal Brexit more likely.</p> <p>Just as Donald Trump seeks to erase Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, Boris Johnson and Cummings seek to erase Clement Attlee\u2019s much deeper legacy. It\u2019s not about sovereignty. It\u2019s not about taking back control. It\u2019s not about British values or British autonomy. It\u2019s about locking deregulation and the demolition of public services in place, by means that cannot be challenged by either people or parliament. The combination of a no-deal Brexit and a coercive US trade agreement will allow the government to rip down a wide range of rules and protections, creating a paradise for the disaster capitalists funding the party, and hell for the rest of us.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>They intend to pursue this agenda regardless of the pandemic, regardless of <a href=\"https://www.campaigns.nfuonline.com/page/56262/petition/1?locale=en-GB\">a food standards petition</a> that has already gained 800,000 signatures, regardless of the economic and political harm it might do. This is their game, and we must use every democratic means to stop it.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>After two weeks off, Trevor Noah returned to the Daily Show on Monday night and addressed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=guardian+protests&amp;oq=guardian+protests&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.4199j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">the protests against anti-black racism and police brutality </a>which have erupted nationwide after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The movement has spread across the world; as a protester in London told American news: \u201cWe\u2019ll keep fighting the same fight that you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat right there is why this movement has become as big as it has,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbecause everyone is now realizing that we\u2019re all in the same fight. Like these protests may have been sparked by one killing in one American city but the truth is that if you are a black person, or a minority, or a poor person in many places around the world \u2013 in London, Berlin, Seoul, Cape Town \u2013 you understand what it means to be a target of the police and the target of a system that is designed to keep you down, with violence if necessary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People aren\u2019t just demanding statues of racists and confederate leaders be taken down, they\u2019re doing it themselves. <a href=\"https://t.co/cZQMveI5gX\">pic.twitter.com/cZQMveI5gX</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And whenever there are protests, he added, \u201cthere are always going to be people who stand on the sidelines. There\u2019s always going to be people who sit in their newspaper offices or their TV news studios and say, \u2018I sympathize with you, but this is not the way to get what you want, this is not the way that you should be doing it, protesting is a waste of time, it turns people off, it\u2019s just performative, it doesn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u2019 Well, you know what? I hope those people are hungry, because they\u2019re going to be eating their words.\u201d</p> <p>Noah recapped some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/what-have-protests-achieved-george-floyd-death-police-funding-statues\">\u201cincredible results\u201d after just two weeks of protests</a>, such as the widespread removal of Confederate statues and racist monuments which have been argued over for decades. For example, the Robert E Lee monument, which stood for 130 years in Richmond, Virginia, will be removed, and Philadelphia took down its large monument to a racist police commissioner of the 1960s. As for people out there who maintain that the statues are necessary for people to \u201clearn their history\u201d, Noah had one message: \u201cRead a book, motherfucker! That\u2019s how you learn history.</p> <p>\u201cThe bubonic plague was a major event in history, but we don\u2019t go around putting up statues of rats,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/08/john-oliver-us-policing-is-a-structure-built-on-systemic-racism\">John Oliver: US policing is 'a structure built on systemic racism'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The protests have also sparked a rush on books about race and racism, and while \u201cI know a lot of people might say it\u2019s too little, too late, why are you only reading now?\u201d said Noah, \u201cI think at the same time we\u2019ve got to be happy that people <em>are</em> reading now. How many times have we seen a video, how many times have we seen a protest, and no books have been bought, no conversations were had?\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s working, Noah continued, because people are speaking up, and saying the words Black Lives Matter in public. \u201cBlack Lives Matter has become the phrase that people admit needs to be said,\u201d Noah said, as everyone from Mitt Romney to fans of the K-pop band BTS to brands such as Gushers and Bud Light, corporations like Amazon have spoken up against systemic racism. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these companies are actually going to do something to show that they believe Black Lives Matter other than just saying it,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbut it is still a major step to have American corporations who just a few years ago were terrified of that phrase saying it as part of their corporate ethos.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/05/seth-meyers-trump-george-floyd-protests-late-night-recap\">Seth Meyers: 'The map is finally all red, but not for the reason Trump wants'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the movement has to be larger than performative slogans \u2013 \u201cwe all agree that posting statements, taking down statues and selling books is not enough,\u201d said Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s part of it, but it\u2019s not enough.

  "<p>The world stands on the brink of a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned as it urged governments to act swiftly to avoid disaster.</p> <p>Better social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the coronavirus pandemic may put basic nutrition beyond their reach, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cUnless immediate action is taken, it is increasingly clear that there is an impending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-double-number-of-people-going-hungry\">global food emergency</a> that could have long-term impacts on hundreds of millions of children and adults,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to act now to avoid the worst impacts of our efforts to control the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Although harvests of staple crops are holding up, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">export bans and protectionism that experts feared</a> have so far been largely avoided, the worst of the impacts of the pandemic and ensuing recession are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/global-hunger-could-be-next-big-impact-of-coronavirus-pandemic\">yet to be felt</a>. Guterres warned: \u201cEven in countries with abundant food, we see risks of disruption in the food supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>About 50 million people risk falling into extreme poverty this year owing to the pandemic, but the long-term effects will be even worse, as poor nutrition in childhood causes lifelong suffering. Already, one in five children around the world are stunted in their growth by the age of five, and millions more are likely to suffer the same fate if poverty rates soar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-covid-19-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most Covid-19 cases and deaths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guterres laid out a three-point plan to repair the world\u2019s ailing food systems and prevent further harm. These are: to focus aid on the worst-stricken regions to stave off immediate disaster, and for governments to prioritise food supply chains; to strengthen social protections so that young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women and other at-risk groups \u2013 including children who are not receiving school meals in lockdown \u2013 receive adequate nutrition; and to invest in the future, by building a global recovery from the pandemic that prioritises healthy and environmentally sustainable food systems.</p> <p>Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, said the world\u2019s food systems were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/16/race-against-time-to-prevent-famines-during-coronavirus-crisis\">under threat as never before in recent times</a>, as the pandemic and lockdowns hampered people\u2019s ability to harvest and buy and sell food. \u201cWe need to be careful,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very different food crisis than the ones we have seen.\u201d</p> <p>Harvests are healthy and supplies of staple foods such as grains are \u201crobust\u201d, according to the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/coronavirus/un-secretary-general\">UN report on the impact of Covid-19 on food security and nutrition</a>, published on Tuesday. But most people get their food from local markets, which are vulnerable to disruption from lockdowns.</p> <p>Increasing unemployment and the loss of income associated with lockdowns are also putting food out of reach for many struggling people. Though global markets have remained steady, the price of basic foods has begun to rise in some countries.</p> <p>Lockdowns are slowing harvests, while millions of seasonal labourers are unable to work. Food waste has reached damaging levels, with farmers forced to dump perishable produce as the result of supply chain problems, and in the meat industry plants have been forced to close in some countries.</p> <p>Even before the lockdowns, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/12/malnutrition-leading-cause-of-death-and-ill-health-worldwide-report\">global food system was failing</a> in many areas, according to the UN.

  "<p>Black Lives Matter UK has said it is touched by people\u2019s generosity after donations towards combating the causes and consequences of racism reached more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, six days after launching a fundraising drive, Black Lives Matter UK (BLMUK) had raised more than \u00a3750,000.

The details were first published by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper and KVUE-TV.</p> <p>Ambler got out of the car and showed his hands, according to the report, but then moved towards the car and was tasered by JJ Johnson, a black Williamson county deputy who was being filmed at the time by a camera crew from Live PD, a real-time police TV show, although the footage was not aired.</p> <p>Another, white, police officer arrived and Ambler was hit with a taser a further two times. An Austin police officer arrived at the scene as the officers struggled to handcuff Ambler. Body-camera video from that officer recorded the final minutes of Ambler\u2019s life.</p> <p>Between gasps, Ambler says he is trying to adhere to their commands. He tells the deputies four more times that he can\u2019t breathe and pleads: \u201cSave me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have congestive heart failure,\u201d Ambler said. \u201cI am not resisting.\u201d</p> <p>One of the deputies fired his taser a fourth and final time, the body-camera video shows.</p> <p>The deputies subsequently placed handcuffs around Ambler\u2019s wrists after his hands went limp. The officers then realized he was unconscious and his pulse had stopped. Deputies performed CPR for several minutes until medics arrived. Ambler was later pronounced dead.</p> <p>Investigators with the Williamson county sheriff\u2019s department of internal affairs determined in a report that the deputies did not violate the agency\u2019s pursuit or use-of-force policies, according to the Statesman.</p> <p>The report did not indicate whether the deputies faced any disciplinary action or were forced to take time off because of the incident.</p> <p>Ambler\u2019s death was ruled a homicide, according to the report made to the state attorney general\u2019s office, which noted that the homicide could have been \u201cjustifiable\u201d.</p> <p>An autopsy revealed he died of congestive heart failure and hypertensive cardiovascular disease associated with morbid obesity \u201cin combination with forcible restraint\u201d.</p> <p>Margaret Moore, district attorney for Travis county, which includes the part of Austin where Ambler died, said the death is still being investigated with the intention of bringing the case to a grand jury.</p> <p>Details of the death of Ambler, which echoes the dying pleas of Floyd that he could not breathe, have emerged as a police officer was charged with involuntary manslaughter for a separate incident in New Mexico, earlier this year.</p> <p>Christopher Smelser, an officer at the Las Cruces police department, is facing the charges after he placed Antonio Valenzuela, 40, in a neck restraint during an arrest on 29 February. Valenzuela, who was also tasered twice by police, became unresponsive and paramedics were unable to save him at the scene.</p> <p>An autopsy returned on Thursday showed that Valenzuela died from asphyxial injuries from the chokehold. According to a Las Cruces police statement, Smelser used a \u201cvascular neck restraint technique to gain control\u201d of Valenzuela, who was wanted for a parole violation. The police department has now banned the use of chokeholds.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want another person to get hurt,\u201d Sylvia Montoya, Valenzuela\u2019s aunt, told the Sun-News. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see another family go through our pain and I don\u2019t want to hear of another death at the hands of an officer.

  "<p>Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:42669767\">study</a>, by researchers from Harvard medical school, Boston University of Public Health and Boston children\u2019s hospital, looked at images captured between January 2018 and April 2020 and found a \u201csteep increase\u201d in vehicle counts starting in August 2019 and peaking in December 2019.

By focusing on hospitals in Wuhan, the acknowledged epicentre of the outbreak, the study forces the correlation. It would have been interesting (and possibly much more convincing) to have seen control analyses of other Chinese cities outside of the Hubei region,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, pointed out that one of the two hospitals in the study was the Children\u2019s hospital of Wuhan, described in the paper as \u201cthe largest paediatric hospital in Hubei\u201d. But relatively few children have been hospitalised with Covid-19<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>\u201cThe comment that children\u2019s hospitals were affected \u2026 suggests this probably was not Covid-19,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The authors of the study acknowledged that they could not confirm whether the increased vehicle volume was directly related to the new virus. Wuhan would have been entering influenza season; several doctors said that in December some schools had cancelled classes because of the flu.</p> <p>Other limitations include the presence of tall buildings, trees and smog, which limited the number of high-resolution images that could be taken. There was also limited archival footage of Wuhan in previous years because of a \u201clack of commercial interest\u201d.</p> <p>The study said: \u201cOur evidence supports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the Huanan seafood market. These findings also corroborate the hypothesis that the virus emerged naturally in southern China and was potentially already circulating at the time of the Wuhan cluster.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Who would have thought a genial comedy, 40 years old, would be so thoroughly refracted by current events? Whatever one might have expected from a first viewing of The Blues Brothers, it wasn\u2019t that it would uncomfortably mirror what is happening in Britain and America right now.&nbsp;</p> <p>But consider this: at various points in The Blues Brothers, you see cars driven through groups of pedestrians (including, at one point, a group of anti-fascist demonstrators); you see a big city police force responding to provocation with ultra-violence, and the military on the streets of Chicago; you see a far-right figurehead assuring the world his is \u201can organisation of decent, law abiding white folks, just like you\u201d; and you see the African-American experience appropriated and repackaged as entertainment for a white audience. A month ago, none of that might have registered all that hard with me; right now it made watching The Blues Brothers a disorienting experience.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth remembering, perhaps, that cultural appropriation was not so much of a sin when The Blues Brothers was made in 1980. Dan Aykroyd and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/11/tragic-legacy-john-belushi-actor-died-overdose\">John Belushi</a> were absolutely sincere in their love of the blues, and they fought for the legends who made cameos to have speaking roles, given to Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and Ray Charles. On the other hand, though, it\u2019s discomfiting to see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUUyFrHERpU\">John Lee Hooker playing Boom Boom</a> for black people in the street, while Aykroyd and Belushi \u2013&nbsp;who was, let\u2019s be honest, a moderate pub singer \u2013&nbsp;play R&amp;B to a big theatre full of white people at the gig they put on to raise money for their old orphanage. Though one might well argue: well, isn\u2019t that exactly what happened to the blues 20 years or so earlier?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2963aea0640ae3b11adca35c6fdd52a1a117d141\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2963aea0640ae3b11adca35c6fdd52a1a117d141/0_74_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aretha Franklin with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blues legend ... Aretha Franklin with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictures/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But judge The Blues Brothers on its own terms, not as an illustration of the politics of race, rather as a comedy. Aykroyd and Belushi? Comic legends! John Landis? One of the most interesting American comedy directors of his era. So why didn\u2019t I laugh? Because Aykroyd\u2019s labour-of-love script (rejigged by Landis) neglected to put in actual jokes. It has a great deal of ridiculousness, and physical goofing, and situations exaggerated to preposterous extremes. Just not jokes. I\u2019d assumed the line I\u2019d heard quoted most often \u2013 \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, we\u2019re musicians\u201d \u2013&nbsp;came at the end of some bravura riff, not that it was a single response to a single question. That isn\u2019t a joke. Nor is saying \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re on a mission from God\u201d \u2013 every few minutes.</p> <p>There is no internal logic: you suspect Aykroyd et al thought it was hilarious to have Carrie Fisher popping up over and over trying to kill Belushi, but it feels lazy, as if changing the pace and direction of the film was beyond the actors and script, and could only be done by bringing in a murder attempt, never to be mentioned again. It\u2019s self-indulgent, rather than funny, which is to be expected from a film that was filmed amid a blizzard of cocaine, and which was a spin-off of a spin-off \u2013 from Saturday Night Live, to an album, to a film.</p> <p>Still, The Blues Brothers moves quickly enough that it doesn\u2019t have the chance to bore, and it has occasional moments of brilliance. A bunch of those, naturally, come from the special guests\u2019 musical performances. Ray Charles, especially, is fantastic, with a bracing rendition of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK33V7FGjd8\">Shake </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK33V7FGjd8\">Your Tail Feather</a>, backed by The Blues Brothers band (an incredible collection of soul and R&amp;B sidemen, who could probably make me sound tolerable).&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HCR4c1zPyk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2HCR4c1zPyk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Most compelling, though, is the portrayal of Chicago. The film was, at least in part, conceived as a love letter to the city, and was filmed on location. It opens with a jaw-dropping aerial shot of the heavy industry of the city\u2019s south side, a Blakean panorama of dark Satanic mills, a world corrupted by humanity. The street scenes \u2013&nbsp;like those of so many location-shot movies (think of The French Connection) \u2013&nbsp;are compellingly grimy. In those sections, and those sections alone, the film manages to find the poetry in the city it hymns, especially in the big song-and-dance routines.</p> <p>It\u2019s a product of its time, of course. But I have to confess I\u2019ve never fathomed the appeal of US comedy of that era. Perhaps it was only never having seen The Blues Brothers that made me think it might be different.

  "<p>A charitable trust supporting the work of Prince Andrew has been required to return more than \u00a3350,000 in payments made to a trustee after a public watchdog intervened.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charity-commission-finds-prince-andrew-charitable-trust-trustees-breached-charity-law-over-payments-to-trustee/regulatory-compliance-case-prince-andrew-charitable-trust\">Charity Commission has revealed</a> the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust broke the law by handing over large sums to the prince\u2019s household to compensate for time spent on other activities by one of his employees.</p> <p>The problem emerged last year following publicity over the prince\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-and-newsnight-anatomy-of-a-pr-disaster\">interview on BBC Newsnight</a> about his friendship with the disgraced financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The highly critical report is a further blow to his position.</p> <p>Examination of the charity\u2019s accounts and records identified \u201cissues of concern that required attention\u201d, according to a lengthy statement by the commission released on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result of this work, \u00a3355,297 has been returned to the charity, which will be redistributed towards causes in line with the charity\u2019s purposes. The current trustees acted to rectify this matter once it was identified by the commission.\u201d</p> <p>The Prince Andrew Charitable Trust \u2013 which supported his charitable work in the areas of education, entrepreneurship, science, technology and engineering \u2013 has notified the commission that it intends to wind up. Remaining funds will be distributed to charities with similar objectives.</p> <p>Helen Earner, the commission\u2019s director of operations, said: \u201cCharity is special \u2013 with unpaid trusteeship a defining characteristic of the sector. By allowing the payment of a trustee via its subsidiaries the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust breached charity law and by insufficiently managing the resulting conflict of interest from this payment the trustees did not demonstrate the behaviour expected of them.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re glad that concerns we identified are now resolved, after the charity acted quickly and efficiently to rectify these matters. The recovered funds will now go towards the causes intended, and we will continue to work with the trustees as they wind up the charity.\u201d</p> <p>The trustee was paid by the charity\u2019s three trading subsidiary companies as a director of those companies. The payments were for work carried out for the trading subsidiaries over a five-year period from 2015.</p> <p>The commission added: \u201cTrustees cannot be paid to act as directors of a subsidiary company, unless there is authority from the charity\u2019s governing document or the payments are authorised by the commission or the court, none of which were in place at the charity.</p> <p>\u201cTrustees also have a duty to act with reasonable care and skill, taking account of any special knowledge, skill or professional status. This board of trustees, which included a lawyer, was expected to have had the knowledge and experience to act in accordance with charity law.\u201d</p> <p>The commission said the charity could not \u201cshow that conflicts of interest relating to the payments received by a trustee were managed adequately at trustee meetings\u201d.</p> <p>Other problems identified included that:</p> <ul> <li><p>There was no standalone conflicts of interest policy at the charity for trustees to refer to.</p></li> <li><p>Open and fair competition was not conducted before the trustee was appointed to the roles at the charity\u2019s subsidiaries.</p></li> <li><p>No evidence was obtained to demonstrate that these payments to the trustee provided value for money for the charity.</p></li> </ul> <p>The commission\u2019s report has been released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/prince-andrew-lawyers-accuse-us-doj-misleading-public-over-epstein-case\">amid a war of words</a> between US prosecutors and the prince\u2019s lawyers over his cooperation with the investigation into Epstein\u2019s activities.</p>",
  "<p>Palestine will declare statehood over all of the West Bank and Gaza, with Jerusalem as its capital, and push for global recognition if Israel goes ahead with plans to annex land it occupies, the Palestinian prime minister has said.</p> <p>Mohammad Shtayyeh&nbsp;described the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/what-would-israel-annexing-the-west-bank-mean\">possible step</a> pledged by the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to a decades-long international effort for Israelis and Palestinians to reach an agreement that establishes two states side by side.</p> <p>He said Palestine would not continue to wait on statehood just to honour previous agreements made with Israel if it broke them by annexing territory. \u201cIt takes two to tango.\u201d</p> <p>Shtayyeh said he was leading a concerted push to gather diplomatic pressure against Israel and wanted world powers to threaten sanctions on Netanyahu\u2019s government so that \u201cIsrael does not get away with murder\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we want is that Israel should feel the heat,\u201d Shtayyeh said at a press conference held by the local Foreign Press Association in Ramallah on Tuesday.</p> <p>Palestinian leaders have declared statehood in the past, including Yasser Arafat in 1988. In 2012, Palestine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/29/united-nations-vote-palestine-state\">gained UN observer state status</a>. However, with the Palestinian territories remaining occupied by Israel, and in the absence of an agreement, there has not been full international recognition.</p> <p>Shtayyeh, for example, is the prime minister of the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Palestinian Authority, a body created in 1994 and intended to be a pre-state interim government.</p> <p>\u201cThe fruits of peace have never actually materialised since the signing of the agreement,\u201d Shtayyeh said.</p> <p>With Israeli forces in control of the Palestinian territories, any declaration of statehood would be largely symbolic. However, Shtayyeh\u2019s government might hope that growing international unease over Israel\u2019s annexation plans could encourage governments to formally back Palestinian claims.</p> <p>His comments will also be interpreted as further exasperation from the Palestinian leadership, which has seen Israel \u2013 with backing from Donald Trump \u2013 move to solidify its already tight territorial grip.</p> <p>Palestinian officials have been scrambling to respond to Israeli threats of annexation for months. In May, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/palestinian-leader-mahmoud-abbas-ends-security-agreement-with-israel-and-us\">announced</a> that all previous agreements signed with the US and Israel, including security cooperation, were void.</p> <p>During the past year, Netanyahu has made repeated promises to annex, or \u201capply sovereignty\u201d to, different areas of the West Bank, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>&nbsp;captured from Jordan in 1967.</p> <p>Under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">a unity government deal</a>, the Israeli leader has pushed to bring annexation plans&nbsp;to the cabinet for discussion as soon as 1 July.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting and pushing for Israel not to annex,\u201d Shtayyeh said. \u201cIf Israel is going to annex after July 1st, we are going to go from the interim period of the Palestinian Authority into the manifestation of a state on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does a manifestation of the state on the ground mean? It means that there will be a foundational council. There will be a constitutional declaration. And Palestine will be on the borders of [19]67, with Jerusalem as its capital. And we will call on the international community to recognise this land. That is where we are.\u201d</p> <p>In a phone conversation last week with James Cleverly, the UK\u2019s minister for the Middle East and north Africa, Shtayyeh called on London to recognise Palestine as a state.</p> <p>Cleverly had told parliament in May that the UK would not support Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank because it would make a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d harder to achieve. The UK has not recognised Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>Shtayyeh, however, said he was optimistic that European governments would consider recognising Palestine as a response to annexation. \u201cI think the British government and all European governments are really looking at this very seriously. The tone I have heard was very different, too,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked for comment, a British Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK will recognise a Palestinian state at a time of our choosing, and when it best serves the objective of peace.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Britain is trapped in lockdown purgatory. In Liverpool, where I live, we are back to square one, with an \u201cR\u201d rate estimated to be hovering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/calls-for-local-lockdowns-as-study-finds-r-value-above-1-in-north-west-england\">at or just over 1</a>. That means the vast majority of people have been staying indoors, not sending their children to school, or seeing their friends and family for nearly three months, only to find that coronavirus, and the risk of transmitting it to others, is still in circulation. Now what?</p> <p>Our household of four \u2013 two home-working adults, two primary-school age children \u2013 is augmented in normal times by many regular<strong> </strong>visitors. I know from my own early experiences that nuclear families contain pressures and unspoken traumas that can only be relieved by constant engagement&nbsp;with the outside world, but the March lockdown enforced that rigid nuclear model almost without warning.</p> <p>We\u2019ve stayed in our bubble, believing it to be temporary, and were doing all right in lockdown for a good eight weeks, blessed with good weather and a decent back yard, in spite of a troubling suspicion that Zoom calls might come to be regarded as satisfactory replacements for real-world relationships. At times the lockdown has only seemed possible to endure because our household has the resources to make it tolerable.</p> <p>Then the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/stay-alert-coronavirus-blame\">message changed</a>, to the effect that it was the responsibility of individual households not only to maintain social relationships virtually, to educate children and to keep the economy running, but also<strong> </strong>to \u201ccontrol the virus\u201d. I started to wonder whether there was a method \u2013 however buried, however unconscious \u2013 in this. After all, who needs society \u2013 and its attendant systems of social support \u2013 when you\u2019ve got nuclear families and stoic individuals?&nbsp;</p> <p>The lockdown has&nbsp;been&nbsp;necessary, but in the past few weeks, it has begun to feel<strong>&nbsp;</strong>insidious and wrong. I could only pinpoint the feeling when reading the sociologist Richard Sennett\u2019s 1970 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/13/society-sennett-disorder-review\">The Uses of Disorder</a>, which imagines a young girl of the near future growing up in \u201ca neighbourhood that does not permit her family or her circle of friends to be intensive and inward-turning \u2026 [there] would be a natural social life that arose out of the necessity for common action\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Common action depends on social life. Whenever people are ordered to retreat from physical society it\u2019s necessary to ask for whom, and for what purpose, they are doing it. At the start the answer was clear: it was for each other, and it was for the NHS. But, then, the hospitals \u2013 in most cases \u2013 weren\u2019t overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. Intensive care units, for the most part, were never full. A&amp;E departments emptied overnight, and the Nightingale hospitals were almost never used.</p> <p>It became clear over April and May that thousands of people were dying during this crisis from&nbsp;causes other than coronavirus.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>To give an example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says\">10,000 more people with dementia have died</a> than would normally die in the same time period, over and above those with dementia who are known have died with Covid-19.<strong> </strong>They may have died because, to put it bluntly,&nbsp;an attempt to prioritise the quantity of their lives over the quality has disastrously backfired.&nbsp;</p> <p>My dad, 75 this week, has dementia, and moved into a care home near my house last year. His home is one of a handful in Liverpool that has had no infections so far and, understandably, its staff want to keep it that way. But he\u2019s getting more confused. He hasn\u2019t been outside the home since 22 March. Since my visits have been limited to a quick wave from the porch when I drop off his Guinness and crisps, he<strong>&nbsp;</strong>spends most of the day asleep and is gradually losing any sense of time and its significance.</p> <p>For how much longer can we be said to be protecting the elderly \u2013 and all vulnerable people \u2013 during the pandemic while making so little provision for them to be included in society?&nbsp;Both the government and its scientific advisers know that reducing infections in care homes is necessary to prevent a second wave. But what <em>we</em> know is that, throughout the pandemic, the Tories have been consumed with treating a public health crisis as an exercise in political management, resulting in a social and economic crisis of a scale that it shows little interest in acknowledging, let alone addressing.&nbsp;</p> <p>The government\u2019s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>solution<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to isolation and unemployment is to re-open garden centres, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/which-uk-shops-are-reopening-and-when-as-covid-19-lockdown-eases-john-lewis-mcdonalds\">\u201cnon-essential\u201d shops</a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/pub-gardens-in-england-could-reopen-from-22-june-reports\">beer gardens</a>. There have been no major media splashes on re-opening libraries, swimming pools and public toilets, nor government attempts to find \u2013 or fund \u2013 ways for schools to recommence lessons using outdoor spaces, or for care homes to allow physical visitors.&nbsp;The best we have to show for 40 years of \u201cbaseline economic growth\u201d, it seems, is a pathological aversion to the civic sphere.</p> <p>The result is a lockdown twilight zone, where public life and private spirits continue to wither while the idea of being able to go to Next in a car is presented as a return to the kind of normality most people have said <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-only-9-of-britons-want-life-to-return-to-normal-once-lockdown-is-over-11974459\">they don\u2019t even want</a>. In other words, it\u2019s the worst of both worlds, offering neither the certainty of \u201cstay at home, save lives\u201d nor the messy reality of everyday public life. It underscores and contributes to inequalities that already exist and bends us towards a society based on turning inwards rather than outwards.</p> <p>In such circumstances, where people from black and ethnic minority groups have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">vastly higher mortality risk</a> from Covid-19, it\u2019s galvanising and heartening to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-protests-black-lives-matter-colston-statue-rhodes-live\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> taking place at a time when we are being told to stay in, indefinitely, unless we have a risky job to go to or have an overwhelming urge to buy some compost.&nbsp;</p> <p>Protesters have one clear message: we refuse to live like this, and we refuse to die like this.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The coronavirus crisis has widened to expose the effects of social marginality and inequality, and the ways in which race and class work in tandem to compound disadvantage in multiple and lethal forms. Had it taken the pandemic and its repercussions seriously in the first place, the government could have avoided stumbling into an endless semi-lockdown that will put more lives at risk and make countless others miserable.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Lynsey Hanley is the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

It is history | David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despair, pain and anger have been running high within black communities. The recent killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/06/04/tony-mcdade-black-trans-man-killed-police-officer-name/\">Tony McDade</a>, and George Floyd echoed the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/sandra-bland-video-footage-arrest-death-police-custody-latest-news\">Sandra B</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/sandra-bland-video-footage-arrest-death-police-custody-latest-news\">land</a>, Michael Brown and many others. These terrible events have ignited much more than mass demonstrations: they have triggered feelings that many within black communities have been suppressing for a long time, in order to simply be able to carry on living their lives. The issue of <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/what-does-intergenerational-trauma-and-healing-look-like-for-black-women/ar-BBVfjnZ\">intergenerational trauma</a> that is often explored when studying the history of slavery has resurfaced in the most violent way. </p> <p>What these killings and subsequent protests have also captured are the chaotic ways most former colonial powers have been avoiding an honest reckoning with the impact of the past. This is a story of the legacies that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/racism-british-society-minority-ethnic-people-dying-excessive-force\">shaped societies</a> in the most dramatic way, putting black and brown people at the bottom of the social ladder. It is about the many forms of racism that have led to discriminatory practices. These have, in turn, prevented large swathes of society from having access to decent jobs or the ability to benefit from social mobility. Floyd\u2019s death has pushed people into uncomfortable trenches, where they must reckon with a difficult history.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Britain, the death and protests were also followed by a mass show of solidarity from institutions and companies around the country. That seemed like a positive step \u2013 but it was also incredibly puzzling for those of us who have long been fighting for racial equality. Some of these institutions are routinely accused of lacking a multiracial representation among their staff members \u2013 while others continually fail to address endemic racism.</p> <p>The dissonance between these performative shows of solidarity and the inability to connect what was happening in the US with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/racism-george-floyd-britain-america-uk-black-people\">Britain\u2019s own history of discrimination</a> was uncanny. The disingenuous argument often used is that Britain doesn\u2019t have the same record of police brutality \u2013 or that a series of race relations acts are proof that the UK is committed to racial equality.</p> <p>What is striking here is the failure to make a link between numerous pressing issues: the dispute over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/06/labour-accuses-government-of-cover-up-over-bame-covid-19-report\">the release and findings</a> of Public Health England\u2019s report on the high number of coronavirus deaths within BAME communities; the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/windrush-scandal-only-60-victims-given-compensation-so-far\">Windrush scandal</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">hostile environment</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52900700\">inner contradictions</a>; the lack of support for victims of the Grenfell fire; the resistance to teaching British black history and the continued glorification of the British empire\u2019s legacies. Each deserves a full article, but let us try to disentangle the racialised knot at the heart of these stories and their links with policing black and brown bodies. Let us start by setting the record straight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/systemic-racism-police-brutality-british-problems-black-lives-matter\">Police brutality towards black people</a> \u2013 as well as against Asian and other minority ethnic groups \u2013 has taken many forms over decades in Britain. We all remember the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">Macpherson </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">report</a> from 1999, following the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, that established that the Metropolitan police was institutionally racist. Since then, several groups have done a tremendous amount of work to bridge the gap between communities and police forces. Yet trust still needs to be built \u2013 and police forces still lack officers from minority ethnic communities. Government austerity cuts have further eroded efforts to tackle this imbalance. In recent months we have even seen <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52905787\">excessive fines</a> against BAME groups for breaching lockdown rules during the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet the issue at the heart of our current situation is not the police, but poverty, exclusion, and accepted institutionalised and <a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/understanding-everyday-racism/book3570\">everyday racism</a>. This has led many in the majority group to view black people as either exceptional \u2013 the \u201cchosen one\u201d who has shown remarkable abilities and therefore deserves to be praised \u2013 or as a criminal, a member of the <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/race-and-the-undeserving-poor/9781788210386\">undeserving poor</a>, or finally as a foreigner, even when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">ancestors have contributed</a> to the wealth of this nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>How do we move past the current dangerous moment where young black people are caught up in places of despair and rage? How do we offer a potential for hope? Some argue that we can\u2019t fix <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-cornel-west-on-whether-us-can-break-down-racial-barriers\">a system that isn\u2019t working</a> and that the police should be abolished; others support the idea that local and community collective endeavours are the answer to failed leadership. My belief is that governments, institutions and organisations have a lot to learn from those grassroots movements. The task is enormous but let us imagine how genuine joint efforts could transform our cities, towns and country.&nbsp;</p> <p>People in cities have already shown that they can take this difficult history into their own hands. On Sunday, those protesters in Bristol toppled the statue of Edward Colston, responsible for the transportation of nearly 85,000 African captives in the late 17th century.</p> <p>The statue was erected in 1895, long after his death, in honour of Colston\u2019s philanthropic deeds towards parts of the community in Bristol. He was for generations of Bristolians one of the fathers of the city. However, the presence of the statue has been a source of division for many years, with previous efforts to have the statue removed continuously stalled. At the weekend, young people removed the bronze statue in the most dramatic way and then threw it into the harbour, to cheers from onlookers. The home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Priti Patel</a>, described the event as an act of vandalism.</p> <p>The reality was a much more complex history, in which a very specific local past and a present marred by decades of appalling racial and social inequalities finally collided. What happens next is unclear: many other slave traders are still celebrated in Bristol, while poverty, racism and all forms of inequalities are, more than ever, in urgent need of being tackled.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Olivette Otele is professor of history and memory of slavery at the University of Bristol.

In the Covid-19 crisis it only took the month of April to get practically the same result. In March and April, exports have now shrunk by almost 36%. The export sector is probably the most exposed to the crisis, suffering from the domestic lockdown measures as much as from lockdowns across the world and supply chain disruptions.</p> <p>Looking ahead, while April was the worst month ever in terms of most economic data releases, the month of May could become one of the best months ever.</p> <p>With the worst now behind us, things will start to brighten. In past recoveries, the German economy could always count on exports to kickstart the recovery. After the 2008/9 crisis, it was the Asian countries and strong demand for German investment goods which helped the German economy to overcome the recession swiftly.

Some have fled to their villages and others are too frightened to return to work in virus-hit cities.</p> <p>In the past week, some people have been spooked by widely exchanged videos and posts depicting the ordeal of families running around hospitals for a bed and of some private hospitals demanding extortionate fees as a pre-condition for admission.</p> <p>The message accompanying the videos is invariably: \u201cContinue the lockdown. For the government, you are only a number. For your family, you are the whole world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much fear of the virus as fear of a loved one not being able to get treatment that\u2019s frightening,\u201d said a woman in the chemist at the community centre.&nbsp;</p> <p>Places of worship across the country too saw only a trickle of visitors amid strict social distancing rules.</p> <p>Not many Delhi residents will be encouraged to resume normal life given the figures coming out.

It reserves the right to sell facial recognition technology for specific purposes, for example, as well as to re-sell the same technology from other vendors as part of its large consulting business.</p> <p>The statement is still the strongest yet from a major technology company against misuse of facial recognition services, which have provoked alarm among civil rights communities for their ability to silently track entire populations.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK, facial recognition technology has steadily gained ground as a policing tool, despite the objections of groups such as Liberty and Amnesty International, who argue that it\u2019s a violation of privacy without the accuracy required to be useful for preventing crime.</p> <p>In February, the Met police launched its largest trial yet, scanning shoppers in the Stratford Centre mall in east London to try to match them against a checklist of more than 5,000 people \u201cwanted for serious criminality, such as grievous bodily harm.\u201d The trial was rolled out despite warnings from watchdogs including&nbsp;the information commissioner, the surveillance camera commissioner and the biometric commissioner,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/met-police-deploy-live-facial-recognition-technology\">critics alleged.</a></p> <p>In September,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/microsoft-boss-tech-firms-must-stop-if-its-legal-its-acceptable-approach\">Microsoft\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/microsoft-boss-tech-firms-must-stop-if-its-legal-its-acceptable-approach\">president, Brad Smith, told the Guardian</a>&nbsp;that the company was voluntarily withholding its own facial recognition technology from governments that wold use it for mass surveillance, but stopped short of committing to an all-out ban.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt is a technology that can be deployed in, literally, an Orwellian fashion,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut I think whenever you want to ban a technology, you also have to ask, well, what are the potentials for it to do good as well?

It sought feedback from large employers, which seemed to be the last to complete the second stage of enrolment.</p> <p>A timetable, tabled at the committee, shows that on 20 May the ATO discovered there were 3.3m fewer employees of businesses with 500 or more workers actually registered in the program than was first thought.</p> <p>Some 577 businesses had enrolled with an estimate of more than 500 employees, but in fact had registered for just one to four workers.</p> <p>Jordan and the ATO second commissioner, Jeremy Hirschhorn, said the error \u201ctemporarily obscured size of demand driven program\u201d.</p> <p>The source of the error was identified on 21 May. Some 0.1% of businesses had filled in the enrolment confusing \u201cthe amount payable to rather than the number of employees\u201d, Jordan said, resulting in businesses claiming to have 1,500, 3,000 or more.</p> <p>Hirschhorn said this resulted in 1,500 out of 1m businesses putting a \u201cdramatically wrong number\u201d when estimating their number of employees.</p> <p>\u201cWe did not build rigorous analytics behind that field that asked for the estimated number of employees that businesses had [claimed for],\u201d Jordan conceded.</p> <p>Cormann said the discovery of the discrepancy triggered a fresh estimate of the cost of the program at a time that \u201cthe health and economic outlook was significantly better than in March\u201d.</p> <p>Cormann insisted the $60bn \u201cestimates variation\u201d was therefore \u201cnot an accounting error as it has been falsely described by some\u201d but rather the product of \u201csubstantially changed parameters\u201d.</p> <p>The chair of the committee, Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher, seized on the evidence, telling reporters after the hearing that employer errors were \u201ca very small part of the massive revision\u201d and accusing the government of trying to \u201cblame business\u201d for its own miscalculation.</p> <p>Earlier, in the hearing, Gallagher probed a guarantee given by Scott Morrison on Friday that \u201cthe six months provision of jobkeeper has been set out in legislation and people can count on that\u201d.</p> <p>Gallagher suggested the guarantee had immediately been breached by a decision to revoke jobkeeper from the childcare sector after fees are reintroduced from 13 July, ending the temporary free system.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree that\u2019s what&nbsp;[Morrison has] done,\u201d Cormann said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/the-cliff-what-happens-when-australias-coronavirus-stimulus-runs-out-of-road\">'The cliff': what happens when Australia's coronavirus stimulus runs out of road?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cormann argued the jobkeeper program will remain \u201cin place to the end of September\u201d but \u201cin relation to childcare workers\u201d it was replaced with a $708m transition payment and return to the usual subsidy model, which was more \u201cfair and equitable\u201d.</p> <p>Kennedy revealed that 120,000 childcare workers currently receive the $1,500 fortnightly payment and are set to lose it from 20 July.</p> <p>On Monday, the education minister, Dan Tehan, conceded the transition payment is likely to be less than jobkeeper but argued it was more fairly spread across the sector.</p> <p>On Tuesday Tehan defended Morrison by telling ABC News Breakfast the prime minister \u201cwas talking about the legislation that is there, which guarantees that the jobkeeper package will be there for six months\u201d.</p> <p>In a round of morning interviews, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, did not rule out further changes to phase out the payment before September.</p> <p>Under consideration in the Treasury review are options including removing the payment from certain industries \u2013 so that only the hardest hit sectors such as tourism retain it \u2013 or requiring businesses to show they have the required 30% downturn in revenue each and every month not just the first qualifying month.</p> <p>Cormann told the committee he was \u201cnot aware of any other sectors in scope\u201d for removal of jobkeeper, but the government is yet to receive the review, due by the end of June.

It is clear from our research that this simply isn\u2019t the case \u2013 indeed, the system as it stands is not fit for purpose,\u201d King said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local-first approach.

It was set up partly in response to a lack of transparency around the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The membership of Sage and minutes and documents relating to its meetings have since been published.</p> \n<p>The independent group\u2019s report points out that the epidemic is still growing in some parts of the country, such as north-west England. They say erosion of trust in the government in recent weeks will make it less likely that people will comply if they are called by contact-tracers and told they must self-isolate.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Covid\u201019 is to be eliminated, as New Zealand has shown is possible, then at least 80% of all close contacts of those with Covid\u201019 infection (the index case) must remain isolated for 14 days so that they are unable to pass on infection to others. This is clearly not happening,\u201d says the report.</p> \n<p>It argues for a more comprehensive system than just test and trace. The report says it should be \u201cfind, test, trace, isolate and support\u201d. Speed is vital: the scientists point out that Sage itself advised that the aim should be to isolate as many contacts as possible within 48 hours.</p> \n<p>Test results should be available within 24 hours, says Independent Sage.

  "<h2><strong>The last TV show you loved</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/01/hollywood-review-ryan-murphy-netflix\">Ryan Murphy\u2019s Hollywood</a>, about the beginnings of the film industry, made me laugh and cry. It just made us see everything differently, and made me sad and angry in places. Watching it, you realise how difficult it must have been to be anything but a white, middle-aged man back then. There are nods to actual famous people in it, too, such as Vivien Leigh \u2013 I was staying up into the early hours Googling it all.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>The show that should never have been cancelled&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>I don\u2019t know if this counts because it wasn\u2019t officially cancelled, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/farewell-fleabag-the-most-electrifying-devastating-tv-in-years\">Fleabag</a>. It\u2019s so amazingly written, and changed my views on feminism and being open and honest about things like sex. I saw the stage show, too \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t think that just one person on the stage would make you feel all those emotions. I\u2019m hoping that in years to come Phoebe Waller-Bridge does a special where we find out how the characters are getting along.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and the show that should be cancelled</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m not a fan of Naked Attraction. Good on these people from having the confidence to strip off, but surely we shouldn\u2019t be dating people off their penis alone.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Your TV guilty pleasure</strong></h2> <p>When I\u2019m getting ready to go out, I always watch Law &amp; Order in the bath. As soon as I hear the theme music, I just get all goose-pimply. I know I\u2019ve been in the bath too long if I start watching a second one.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>The best performance you\u2019ve ever seen on TV</strong></h2> <p>I am absolutely obsessed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/17/this-country-series-three-review-bbc-mockumentary-charlie-and-daisy-may-cooper-cotswolds-comedy\">This Country</a>. Daisy May Cooper\u2019s character, Kerry, is so relatable, and someone you\u2019re rooting for from the get-go. She\u2019s stuck in her village, but she\u2019s happy with that. Coming from a small village in County Durham, where it is a bit like Groundhog Day and you have to make your own entertainment, it\u2019s very relatable. I remember going down to the river when I was younger and there were Barbie dolls down there in circles for six months. Everyone kept saying it was devil worshippers, but I think it was just kids being stupid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83d468858aec8dd93801587aa1c365703d32d78d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83d468858aec8dd93801587aa1c365703d32d78d/0_42_5758_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This Country is very relatable\u2019 ...

I have lots of friends in the LGBTQ community and I know the difference that the show has made \u2013 by bringing drag mainstream and letting these amazing drag queens tell their stories about issues such as homophobia and racism. I think it has just made everybody think more about how they act towards other people.</p> <h2><strong>Your TV turn-offs</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ll sound like a prude, but I don\u2019t like a lot of sex scenes. Sometimes, I think they\u2019re not necessary. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t watched Normal People yet \u2013 I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/06/politics-of-sex-in-normal-people-bbc-sally-rooney\">a lot of sexy time</a>. I also love talking to the mum and dad about stuff I\u2019ve watched. Even before Gogglebox, I would always WhatsApp my mum while we were watching a programme, or call her after, which might be a bit awkward with a show like that.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>The show you wish you could guest star on</strong></h2> <p>I am a massive Doctor Who fan, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/10/david-tennant-terry-pratchett-podcast-doctor-who-pc-backlash-interview\">my favourite doctor was David Tennant</a>, so if we could go back in time to that era and I could be somewhere in the background, that would be great. I would even stick myself inside a Dalek just to be there. I think Jodie Whittaker is an amazing Doctor. I find it hilarious that people can believe in things like cyborgs, but they couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around the Doctor being a woman. It\u2019s a science fiction show!&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Scarlett Moffatt Wants to Believe is available now on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08c6f5x\">BBC Sounds</a></em></p>",
  "<p>There are growing calls for justice from the families of two alleged victims of police violence in France including a 14-year-old Roma boy left with severe facial injuries after his arrest.</p> <p>Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, has said the case of Gabriel Djordjevic, who sustained a fracture to his eye socket and four broken teeth after he claimed he was kicked by a police officer, was \u201ctroubling\u201d.</p> <p>Castaner said he did not understand the police explanation for the boy\u2019s injuries, which was that he had fallen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal that a 14-year-old boy, or anyone else, be injured during an arrest. There are two explanations: that of the young man and that of the police officers and they are totally contradictory. It\u2019s not for me to decide which is right,\u201d Castaner told BFMTV. He said he had referred the case to internal police investigators.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand the explanation the police have given \u2026 the [police] chief doesn\u2019t understand it either,\u201d Castaner said.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.loopsider.com/fr/video/gabriel-14-ans-violemment-interpelle-nous-raconte-son-histoire\">Loopsider, </a>Gabriel admitted he and a friend were about to steal a scooter. \u201cSure, it was stupid, but what they did to me\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cThere were four of them. One of them put handcuffs on me and put his knees on my back. A woman [officer] held my feet while a bearded police officer kicked me in the face.\u201d</p> <p>The arresting officers have denied the accusations and say the youngster fell while running away.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s lawyer, St\u00e9phane Gas, said nothing suggested the alleged attack on the boy was racially motivated but the violence was unacceptable and he had written to the minister to demand the immediate suspension of the officers.</p> <p>\u201cThe scenario given by the police for what happened makes no sense at all,\u201d Gas said. He added that the teenager had never been in trouble with the police before. \u201cHe is absolutely traumatised and will be seeing a psychologist this week,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Djordjevic family has lodged a legal case for \u201corganised violence\u201d and a second complaint with the police\u2019s internal investigators.</p> <p>In another high-profile case, the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/adama-traore-death-in-police-custody-casts-long-shadow-over-french-society\">Adama Traor\u00e9, 24, a black Frenchman, who died in 2016 after being arrested</a> by police in circumstances similar to George Floyd in the US, said on Tuesday they had rejected the offer of talks with the justice minister.</p> <p>\u201cThe Traor\u00e9 family reiterates that it wants legal progress and not an invitation to talks that won\u2019t lead to any procedural purpose,\u201d the campaign group, Truth for Adama, said.</p> <p>The family\u2019s campaign for the officers involved in his arrest to face legal action has been given new momentum by worldwide anger over Floyd\u2019s killing and the BLM movement.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday evening to coincide with Floyd\u2019s funeral in Texas.</p> <p>In Paris, <a href=\"https://sos-racisme.org/\">SOS Racisme</a> called for a \u201csolemn gathering\u201d at Place de la R\u00e9publique and asked protesters to respect eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the time it took for Floyd to die.</p> <p>\u201cYour presence will serve to remind people of our determination to fight racism in the police and everywhere else,\u201d the association said, adding that protesters should wear masks and respect social distancing rules.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected in other French cities. Public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned under France\u2019s coronavirus rules, but Castaner said there would be no action taken against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The minister has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d for racism in the police and an end to officers being trained to use the chokehold during arrests.</p> <p>However, Castaner denied the country\u2019s forces of law and order \u2013 police and gendarmes \u2013 were racist. \u201cThere is unacceptable violence, but I reject the idea that the police force is racist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In measures aimed at restoring public confidence, Castaner said officers would be required to have their identification number clearly shown on their uniform and the use of body cameras would be increased.</p>",

The media and watchdogs cannot scrutinize the payments to ensure against waste, fraud or favors to political allies.</p> <p>Eleven national news publications are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/lawsuit-by-the-washington-post-new-york-times-propublica-dow-jones-bloomberg-against-sba/34484f63-d99e-44cb-916a-76dad37d9386/\">suing</a> for public records, yet little public attention has gone to the problem, as the government has scrambled to respond to a cratered economy and unemployment that has soared past 40m jobless claims.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely mind-boggling that we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re shoveling so much money out to private businesses, and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, founder of the watchdog group Accountable.US.</p> <p>Loans under the program are forgivable, meaning companies don\u2019t have to pay them back. Recipients are meant to spend the money on continuing to pay workers or on recurring expenses, such as rent and utilities.</p> <p>As Congress rushed to provide economic relief to US businesses, it also sent money to companies that did not critically need financial aid. More than 300 publicly traded companies received payments. Indebted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/us-oil-gas-companies-coronavirus-relief-loan-ppp\">fossil-fuel producers</a> have been among them. At least one company used its aid to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/how-private-jet-owners-got-subsidy-coronavirus-relief-funds-n1217061\">benefit wealthy, private jet-owning clients</a>. Small businesses, meanwhile, say they have struggled to gain access to the loans.</p> <p>The program has also raised concerns of conflicts of interest. A top treasury department official charged with steering the coronavirus bailout program is <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/this-treasury-official-is-running-the-bailout-its-been-great-for-his-family\">set to benefit financially</a> from the spending he is overseeing.</p> <p>Liz Hempowicz, policy director at the Project On Government Oversight, said the program and the cracks in it demonstrate a \u201cshocking lack of transparency\u201d.</p> <p>Meaghan Smith, a Democratic strategist and former Department of Health and Human Services official, said the amount of aid is unprecedented.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s trillions of dollars that was passed basically at warp speed so I think there are severe concerns about the level of oversight,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>Oversight advocates want Democrats to demand better transparency with any funds they approve. But the Senate\u2019s Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said any additional aid legislation should be narrower in scope than Democrats in the House have backed.&nbsp;Congress and Donald Trump last week updated the program to let businesses spend more of the money on expenses other than payroll \u2013 but they declined to set new oversight requirements.</p> <p>One transparency measure was defeated after failing to get support from two-thirds of lawmakers in the House. The bill, sponsored by Congressman Dean Phillips from Minnesota, would have required the Small Business Administration to make information about payments to businesses public. </p> <p>\u201cWe cannot accept a situation in which bigger businesses with access to other sources of liquidity are pushing to the front of the line at the expense of those with the greatest need,\u201d Phillips said on the House floor.&nbsp;</p> <p>The government bailout for businesses is unprecedented, dwarfing what went out even during the 2008 recession. In the first 14 days of lending, the SBA oversaw 1.7m loans totaling more than $342bn, more than it administered over the last 14 years. By <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/PPP_Report_200530-508.pdf\">30 May</a>, those figures had grown to 4.5m loans totaling $510bn.</p> <p>The SBA has refused to release its loan records to media organizations and transparency groups. In a 20 April letter to Accountable.US, the SBA official William Briggs pointed to \u201cprivacy and confidentiality issues\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>The SBA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/document/report-20-14-flash-report-small-business-administrations-implementation-paycheck-protection-program-requirements\">internal watchdog</a> has already found that the program \u201cdid not fully align\u201d with the legislation\u2019s provisions, including for giving banks guidance about which loans to prioritize.&nbsp;</p> <p>None of the entities involved are required to publicly disclose where the money is going \u2013 not the banks lending the money, the companies taking it nor the government agencies overseeing the program. The government has said it will review loans of more than $2m.&nbsp;</p> <p>Revelations of loans so far have come from voluntary disclosures, leaks by whistleblowers, or regulatory filings required of publicly traded companies. Big companies \u2013 including the $4.4bn NBA team the Los Angeles Lakers and $2.2bn fast-food chain Shake Shack \u2013 have taken money and then given it back following media scrutiny.&nbsp;</p> <p>Congress did establish a five-person panel to oversee spending, but it does not have the power to subpoena records.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bharat Ramamurti is on that commission and is also managing director for the corporate power program at the liberal Roosevelt Institute thinktank.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cTo me, the biggest issue with the PPP [paycheck protection program] is not the Lakers and Shake Shack are not getting the money, it\u2019s that hundreds of thousands of small businesses that are eligible for PPP and really need PPP are not getting it,\u201d Ramamurti said, noting he was speaking for himself and not the commission.</p> <p>\u201cThat is more tragic to me than a public company getting a few million bucks that will likely go to help its workers because of the design of the program.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Many of the companies getting aid have hundreds of employees and are worth millions or billions of dollars. They fit the legal description of a \u201csmall business\u201d but are not the mom-and-pop companies in most Americans\u2019 minds.</p> <p>At the same time, businesses like local restaurants and shops have said they have not been able to access the funds \u2013&nbsp;or have had longer waits than bigger companies \u2013&nbsp;and have been forced to lay off employees and even permanently close.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hundreds of thousands of small businesses are eligible for PPP and are not getting it</p> <footer> <cite>Bharat Ramamurti</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A survey of small businesses by the Census Bureau through the beginning of May found that only 38% of those that had asked for a loan had received one.

An additional unemployment insurance benefit of $600 a week has been helpful, but many Wisconsinites have not received it yet because of a backlog in applications, he added.</p> <p>Republicans leaders in Washington oppose extending that benefit.&nbsp;</p> <p>In all, the government has spent about $3tn on coronavirus aid in four separate packages.</p> <p>Of that, $784bn has been allocated to individuals, including unemployment benefits, paid leave and direct cash payments, according to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/15/854774681/congress-has-approved-3-trillion-for-coronavirus-relief-so-far-heres-a-breakdown\">NPR</a>. Far more has been set aside for businesses: $810bn for small businesses, $513bn in tax benefits for all businesses and $532bn in non-forgivable loans to large corporations.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of folks feel like maybe the government isn\u2019t focusing on them, and is leaving them behind,\u201d Grover said.</p>",

In it, Dowd accuses Mattis of letting himself be used by a \u201cbunch of hack politicians\u201d and aligning himself with the \u201cugly, hateful, disgraceful\u201d attitudes of Democratic politicians. Mattis, Dowd asserts, has sullied his once-sterling reputation for all time.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Dowd\u2019s letter does more than simply seek to discredit Mattis. By way of justifying the president\u2019s use of force in DC, Dowd brands those collected in Lafayette Park as \u201cphony protesters\u201d who \u201cwere not peaceful and are not real\u201d. They were, Dowd declares, \u201cterrorists\u201d. To be clear, Dowd&nbsp;is not describing the rioters who smashed&nbsp;stores or shot and killed a retired police captain in St Louis. He is describing citizens who were doing what the constitution recognizes as a fundamental right \u2013 engaging in peaceable protest. That is, until, without warning, they were stormed in a show of force that smacked of an authoritarian crackdown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dowd\u2019s brandishing of the term 'terrorist' represents a frightening rhetorical escalation at a perilous time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s presidency has largely inured us to overheated rhetoric. We\u2019ve grown accustomed to Trump and his allies vilifying journalists as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d or&nbsp;characterizing&nbsp;officials trying to hold him to account as treasonous criminals. All the same, Dowd\u2019s brandishing of the term \u201cterrorist\u201d represents a frightening rhetorical escalation at a perilous time in the life of our nation.</p> <p>In his letter, Dowd reminds Mattis of Dowd\u2019s own previous military service \u2013 he addresses the general as one marine to another. Yet for people in the military, the word \u201cterrorist\u201d is hardly a casual term.&nbsp;Since 9/11, the fight against terrorists has resulted in two decades of American wars abroad. Thousands of American soldiers have died in the effort to vanquish this existential foe, who has come to represent the most legitimate target of the lethal force of the world\u2019s mightiest military.</p> <p>In labeling protesters as terrorists, Dowd engages in something far more ominous&nbsp;and shocking&nbsp;than&nbsp;mere&nbsp;rhetorical overkill. He&nbsp;is effectively&nbsp;erasing&nbsp;the difference between Americans peaceably exercising their constitutional rights and Isis insurgents laying down roadside explosives.&nbsp;</p> <p>That Trump has approvingly retweeted Dowd\u2019s unhinged rhetoric is disturbing enough. More alarming still, Dowd\u2019s words find a powerful echo in Tom Cotton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">recent, alarming call</a> in the New York Times for an \u201coverwhelming show of force\u201d to restore order to the streets of America \u2013 shock and awe as a tool for pacifying the American citizenry. Such calls to unleash the military at home provide a foretaste of how Trump might respond to protests in the wake of a contested election in November. That Trump will challenge a loss at the polls can be safely assumed.&nbsp;I suspect&nbsp;he will go further still: if he loses re-election he will almost certainly frame his electoral defeat as a fraud orchestrated by the Democratic party and the mainstream press.&nbsp;</p> <p>Imagine, then, that pro-Biden demonstrators take to the streets, demanding that Trump leave office. Does anyone believe Trump would recoil from invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 \u2013 the step Cotton advocated in his now-notorious&nbsp;Times&nbsp;op-ed \u2013 to use troops to restore \u201corder\u201d? Last week, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper \u2013 Mattis\u2019s successor at the Pentagon \u2013 aroused the president\u2019s ire when he expressed reservations about invoking the Act.</p> <p>Come the weeks after 3 November, it is doubtful that an impulsive, cornered Trump would listen to calls for restraint \u2013 not with the likes of John Dowd and Tom Cotton whispering in the president\u2019s inflamed ear.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lawrence Douglas is the James J Grosfeld Professor of Law, Jurisprudence &amp; Social Thought at Amherst College.

  "<p>A judge has set bail at $1.25m for&nbsp;Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with second-degree murder in connection to the killing of&nbsp;George Floyd.</p> <p>Chauvin, 44, appeared in court by video link on Monday to face charges of murder and manslaughter after he was filmed kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, despite his cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>He said almost nothing during an 11-minute hearing, and remains detained in Minnesota\u2019s maximum security prison in Oak Park Heights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/what-have-protests-achieved-george-floyd-death-police-funding-statues\">What the George Floyd protests have achieved in just two weeks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Judge&nbsp;Jeannice Reding<strong>&nbsp;</strong>granted the prosecutors\u2019 motion to set unconditional bail at $1.25m, or $1m with conditions, which included being law-abiding, making future court appearances and surrendering firearms.</p> <p>The Minnesota assistant attorney general, Matthew Frank, argued that the \u201cseverity of the charges\u201d as well as the strength of public opinion made it more likely that Chauvin would flee if set free, the Star Tribune reported.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney did not object to the bail conditions, raised to $1.25m from $1m without conditions, and to $1m from $750,000 with conditions, the newspaper said.</p> <p>The hearing came as mass protests sparked by Floyd\u2019s death continued into a third week in dozens of cities and towns across the US. Hundreds of mourners lined up outside a church in Floyd\u2019s native Houston, Texas, to pay their respects. The Republican Texas governor, Greg Abbott, was among the first to view the casket and planned to meet privately with the family later on Monday.</p> <p>Joe Biden, the former vice-president, travelled to Houston to meet with Floyd\u2019s family and will provide a video message for Floyd\u2019s funeral service. Previous memorials have taken place in Minneapolis and Raeford, North Carolina, near where Floyd was born.</p> <p>\u201cListening to one another is what will begin to heal America. That\u2019s just what VP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden\">@JoeBiden</a> did with the family of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeorgeFloyd?src=hashtag_click\">#GeorgeFloyd</a> \u2013&nbsp;for more than an hour,\u201d tweeted the Floyd family\u2019s lawyer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1270063155440496646\">Benjamin Crump</a>. \u201cHe listened, heard their pain, and shared in their woe. That compassion meant the world to this grieving family.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s funeral will be on Tuesday, followed by burial at the Houston Memorial Gardens cemetery in suburban Pearland, where he will be laid to rest next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd.</p> <p>As the doors opened on Monday at the Fountain of Praise church in Houston, the city where Floyd spent most of his life, Floyd was lying in an open gold-colored casket, dressed in a brown suit. His body was escorted to what organizers say will be a six-hour public viewing that was expected to draw thousands of mourners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bbd1d171d296b4c2a42d3b57e5378d273efc8bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bbd1d171d296b4c2a42d3b57e5378d273efc8bf/0_83_5317_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Houston rapper Cal Wayne looks at the casket during a public visitation for George Floyd at the Fountain of Praise church, in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houston rapper Cal Wayne looks at the casket during a public visitation for George Floyd at the Fountain of Praise church, in Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godofredo A Vasquez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mourners, many wearing masks and T-shirts with the words \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d stood 6ft apart as they paused briefly to view the casket. Some made the sign of the cross as they passed. On the stage behind the casket were two identical murals of Floyd wearing a black cap that read \u201cHouston\u201d, and angel wings drawn behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWith this happening to him, it\u2019s going to make a difference in the world,\u201d said Pam Robinson, who grew up with Floyd in Houston and handed out bottled water to mourners waiting outside in the searing Texas heat. One man in the line, which had no shade, collapsed as temperatures rose above 90F and was taken by stretcher to a cooling station in front of the church.</p> <p>The mourners came from near and far: Comill Adams said she drove more than seven hours from Oklahoma City with her family, including two children ages eight and 10. They wore matching black T-shirts with \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d on the back of the shirts she made specifically for the memorial.</p> <p>\u201cWe had been watching the protests on TV. We\u2019ve been at home feeling outraged. At times it brought us to tears,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe fact this one is causing change, we had to come be a part of.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrations in honor of Floyd continued across the country. In Los Angeles, mourners joined four different memorial processions that converged downtown.</p> <p>Floyd died on 25 May after Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for more than eight minutes, even after he stopped responding. His death has inspired international protests and drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by police and the US criminal justice system.</p> <p>In Washington on Monday, Democrats in Congress proposed a sweeping overhaul of police oversight and procedures, a potentially far-reaching legislative response to the mass protests denouncing the deaths of black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s next court appearance was set for 29 June.</p> <p><em>Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>",
  "<p>For a few hours one Tuesday last May, Brooklyn felt like a lonesome prairie. Oakland-based composer and guitarist <a href=\"https://chuckjohnson.bandcamp.com/\">Chuck Johnson</a> had taken the opening slot at Union Pool, performing a set of solo instrumentals on pedal steel guitar, the sustain-rich country music instrument that can hauntingly convey human weeping. The headline act, NYC quintet <a href=\"https://suss.bandcamp.com/\">Suss</a>, played a medley of the self-described \u201cambient country\u201d soundscapes that they had been making since casually forming at a party some years before.</p> <p>\u201cWe might capture this big sky Montana feel, but we\u2019re urban musicians,\u201d Suss co-founder Bob Holmes says over the phone from his Manhattan apartment. Back in the 80s, he was a member of US cowpunk trailblazers Rubber Rodeo \u2013 now, he\u2019s pushing a placid alternative vision for country. \u201cIt\u2019s about two words: high and lonesome. You get the feeling of expansiveness, of tugging at the heartstrings. It\u2019s warm and inviting music that creates spaces you just fall into and fall in love with.\u201d</p> <p>Country songs traditionally tell stories, but Suss and Chuck Johnson are part of a new crop of artists who emphasise abstract expression over linear narrative and conventional structures. These musicians continue a legacy that joins the dots between country and post-rock, experimental music and world-class pedal steel pioneers such as Susan Alcorn, Robert Randolph and Sarah Jory. Brian Eno\u2019s 1983 LP Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, which features <a href=\"https://daniellanois.bandcamp.com/\">Daniel Lanois</a> on pedal steel guitar, and <a href=\"https://brucekaphan.bandcamp.com/\">Bruce Kaphan</a>\u2019s 2005 album Slider<em> </em>are some of the hybrid genre\u2019s touchstones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb8152c2a880136f593caf122b4c58cc97e18f8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8152c2a880136f593caf122b4c58cc97e18f8e/327_551_4022_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedal steel guitarist Chuck Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedal steel guitarist Chuck Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Paynter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its various knee levers and strings, the pedal steel guitar \u2013 which originated, pre-pedals, in Hawaii \u2013 is difficult to learn and conventionally used as part of a band. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a machine rather than an instrument, a product of the 20th-century industrial age,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cYou might as well be operating a forklift and be trying to make it sound pretty.\u201d Johnson remembers his first encounter with the pedal steel guitar, back in his home town of Durham, North Carolina. \u201cIt was a total disaster. I couldn\u2019t make anything happen with it, which was humbling, to the point that I didn\u2019t pursue it again for many years.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson did go on to master the instrument and has crafted evocative soundtracks for film, including HBO documentary Private Violence and Emmy award-winning TV show A Chef\u2019s Life. Then, in 2017, he answered a challenge from his label to create a solo album of pedal steel guitar music. <a href=\"https://chuckjohnson.bandcamp.com/album/balsams\">Balsams</a><em> </em>ultimately doubled up as a balm for his injured dog Bubbles, who was recovering from a spinal injury. \u201cI needed to make music that would keep her relaxed as she was nearby while I was working, and she\u2019s very sensitive to music,\u201d Johnson says, as she barks away in the background. \u201cShe tends to prefer drony minimalist music and listens to ambient all the time.\u201d The result is a silvery, soothing guitar record with subtle electronic flourishes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The rise of ambient country \u2013 playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5hlvwGw0mDtNhSt7m5Fovs\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, Kobe City\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ztom-motoyama\">Ztom Motoyama</a>, New York\u2019s <a href=\"https://eeriegaits.bandcamp.com/\">Eerie Gaits</a>, and sprawling Austin band <a href=\"https://balmorhea.bandcamp.com/\">Balmorhea</a> mine similarly serenely mellowed-out soundscapes that create a sense of place, often evoking sundown vistas and wide-open expanses. But there are also a number of avant-garde artists recontextualising country and western-inspired sounds and ideas. Across Buck Young\u2019s two albums of country folk-tinged and Americana noise cut-ups \u2013 2018\u2019s Proud Trash Sound and Buck II: Where Do You Want It? \u2013 you will hear a myriad samples and field recordings, from a howling freight train rolling across the US to a galloping, saloon-style piano loop soundtracking a vintage western gunfight.</p> <p>Buck Young\u2019s Zoe Burke refers to the group\u2019s collage-like approach as \u201cextreme sound mulching\u201d, explaining that the audio was taken apart and put back together several times. \u201cThis is a country record made by noise musicians,\u201d she says, referencing the pan-US collective who try to capture a \u201cnebulous and distant America\u201d with their work. \u201cIt turned into a project about being constantly in motion, just as much as a nod to perceived histories of American music.\u201d Pedal steel guitar from maestro Alan Jones, warped and manipulated to queasy effect, lends a traditional yet eerie ambience.</p> <p>Burke felt drawn to country after feeling displaced when their Baltimore show space was forced to shut down following neglect from the \u201cslumlord\u201d they were renting from. \u201cUsing not-so-legal methods of travelling around the country for long stretches of time, beholden to the bizarre nooks and crannies of this country \u2013 how can you not make country music after going through something like that?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfa6f721feac88248a95306255aac865b13ea695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa6f721feac88248a95306255aac865b13ea695/0_586_5131_3079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambient country group Suss.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambient country group Suss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/theres-a-hunger-for-the-next-frontier-the-new-cosmic-americana-gram-parsons\">\u2018There\u2019s a hunger for the next frontier\u2019: the new cosmic Americana</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She says Buck Young are attracted to the \u201cuniquely American despondency\u201d of country: \u201cI think that much of the best American experimental music yields the same end result.\u201d And she says discovering artists from \u201cthe dark annals of country music\u201d like Ramblin\u2019 Red Bailey, Harry Johnson, Hi-Fi Guys and those featured on the <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Various-God-Less-America/release/594490\">God Less America</a> compilation in 1995 \u201cwas like finding a ripped-out chapter in a history book; the Mickey Mouse mask ripped off from a musical tradition that is more twisted than any contemporary music\u201d.</p> <p>Country music is constantly evolving \u2013 as well as mainstream genre splicings by the likes of Avicii and Lil Nas X in recent years, it has found a niche in underground styles ranging from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgBxA2NtDoU\">vaporwave</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx97JA6X03M&amp;list=PL-LaU2Lneihqw2ULV8IASceBPl4Cq0C1w\">chopped and screwed hip-hop</a> to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwC3Sgvd_4g\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWMG_-Hszww\">psytrance</a>.

  "<p>Good morning,</p> \n<p>Just a few weeks ago, New York was considered the global centre of the coronavirus crisis.

A <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops\">report from Motherboard in 2019</a> revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app, where Ring users can post videos and photos of \u201csuspicious\u201d people caught on camera.</p> <p>According to a map provided by Ring, the doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US \u2013 a 300% increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019. Amazon did not respond to request for comment regarding whether it will continue its partnerships with local police forces. </p> <p>Amazon also sells web hosting services to law enforcement agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Since 2018, a coalition of employees known as We Won\u2019t Build It has called on the company to halt those sales, as well as to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement. In a statement to the Guardian, We Won\u2019t Build It said the same demands remain. Amazon did not respond to request for comment.</p> <p>The company\u2019s track record with non-white employee organizers has also proven to be in conflict with its public statements regarding racial equity, said Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group of employee activists at the company.</p> <p>\u201cActions speak louder than words,\u201d the group said, citing Amazon\u2019s treatment of Chris Smalls, a black activist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\">fired </a> for organizing employees to protest against unsafe coronavirus-related conditions in Amazon warehouses.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon\u2019s words mean nothing when they are firing black employees organizing for better working conditions, when leadership planned racist smears against Chris Smalls, calling him \u2018not smart or articulate\u2019, when they deny our call for racial equity assessments in their business decisions and eliminating the environmental racism of its pollution, when they supply facial recognition software and Ring surveillance video access to police departments that are killing black people with impunity.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon is not the only company whose work with police departments have been in question since the protests following the death of George Floyd began. Last week, chat service Slack <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxma3/slack-blog-post-worked-with-police\">removed a blog post</a> showing how local police forces can use the app after some Black employees criticized it. Airbnb has publicly supported Black Lives Matter but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Airbnb/status/1267536619164151808\">has been criticized</a> for its role in gentrifying predominantly black neighborhoods and pushing out original residents.</p> <p>Amazon did not respond to request for comment or answer whether it plans to withdraw from any of its police partnerships.</p>",
  "<p>Fish and chips with a side order of mushy peas has been a Friday night tradition for generations. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded fish and chip shop in London in 1860 and dedicated takeaways have been serving customers ever since.</p> <p>Yet despite this heritage, if you choose battered cod, plaice or haddock to soak up your vinegar, it\u2019s unlikely to have been fished from UK waters: the majority of the cod and haddock we buy is imported from the Barents Sea or around Norway or Iceland.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.seafish.org/article/sea-for-yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea For Yourself</a> campaign, which is largely funded by Defra and aims to inspire the UK to eat seafood caught in UK waters, close to half of adults would buy more seafood if they knew it was caught locally. The good news is that if you\u2019re keen to eat more seafood that\u2019s been caught closer to home, there\u2019s a wealth of alternatives to choose from.</p> <p>We know fish is good for us and the catches found in our waters, from mussels, oysters and crab, to oil-rich mackerel and flaky lemon sole, are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. The NHS recommends that we should all enjoy at least two portions of fish a week, one of which should be an oil-rich variety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335f8ace768e08b47358b25604c82330856531fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335f8ace768e08b47358b25604c82330856531fe/0_151_1998_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two mackerel on blue wooden background, close up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish such as mackerel are rich in oils.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foodcollection RF/Getty Images/Foodcollection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMost of us are familiar with nutrition advice that encourages us to eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for optimal health, and it\u2019s the same when it comes to seafood,\u201d says Juliette Kellow, consultant nutritionist at Seafish, a non-departmental public body set up to support the UK seafood industry and funded mainly by a levy on all first-hand purchases of seafood products in the UK, including imported seafood. \u201cMany varieties of fish provide a range of B vitamins, which help fight fatigue for those of us always on the go.</p> <p>\u201cIncorporating fish such as herring, coley or hake, and shellfish like crab and mussels into your diet is smart, as they provide a great source of protein and allow you to make the most of all the health benefits seafood offers.\u201d When you\u2019re trying to get more variety into your diet, it makes sense to try something new.</p> <p>Trying a wide variety of fish dishes instead of sticking to well-worn favourites supports UK fishermen, helps stocks stay sustainable and keeps your mealtimes creative \u2013 because of course, the real beauty of seafood is its endless versatility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/omnigov/fish/index.html\" data-alt=\"Fish by numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/omnigov/fish/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fish by numbers</a> </figure>  <p>Four in 10 of us claim we\u2019d be more likely to cook seafood at home if we felt more confident using it in the kitchen, and whipping up a Friday night fish supper \u2013 whether you\u2019re angling for a pile of battered monkfish bites, a plate of simply dressed devilled herrings or a steaming bowl of moules marinie\u0300re \u2013 is a lot easier than you might think.</p> <p>If a fish and chip supper is non-negotiable on a Friday night, beer-battered dover sole is a delicious alternative to cod, while shellfish is a great choice if you\u2019re bored with chicken and looking for an alternative source of low-fat protein.</p> <p>In warmer weather, go for fresh hake with seasonal asparagus and Jersey Royals, or a poached hake salade nic\u0327oise. For something a bit different, crab thermidor is surprisingly quick to make, while fish tacos made with coley goujons make the ideal bite for sharing in front of the TV. Fresh oysters on ice or spiced coconut mussels are perfect for impressing. When the weather cools down, there\u2019s a wealth of winter warmers to choose, from roast hake with curried stew to smoked mackerel risotto.</p> <p>Plenty of seafood dishes are surprisingly quick to pull together. Monkfish and coconut curry takes about 15 minutes to prepare, while an Asian-spiced crab and noodle salad with black sesame seed dressing can be on the table in 10 minutes flat. Children love fish too, which is always a bonus when faced with picky eaters \u2013 coley goujons instead of fish fingers, or mackerel fishcakes made with mash are easy weekday crowd-pleasers.</p> <p>We all have a favourite fish, and when you\u2019re seafood savvy it\u2019s not hard to find an often-overlooked alternative to your usual choice \u2013 from soft, flaky flounder to firm, boldly flavoured sprats or rainbow trout.</p> <p>With so much choice, you may struggle to decide what to cook, but to make things a bit easier, Seafish has created a website so you can arrange for the best of UK seafood to be delivered to your door.

I was listening to all the things being said, their mouths running off, and thought: \u2018That\u2019s enough! I\u2019m going to write a song to answer all that.\u2019 And I just wrote what I felt inside.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was also trying to capture a certain point in time, to tell a story about the moment. But at the same time I wanted to recognise that there is tomorrow. So the song reflects the mood of the day but also calls on people to rally and protect the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>This snapshot in time was in keeping with one of the tenets of calypso (or kaiso), which stems from the African slaves on the sugar plantations in the 17th century. It is a form of storytelling that holds power to account, sometimes in amusing fashion, and Rally is no different when you get to its pointed final verse:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>Now they\u2019re making restrictions and laws to spoil our beauty. But in the end, we shall prevail. This is not just cricket, this thing goes beyond the boundary. It\u2019s up to you and me to make sure that they fail.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\u201cKitchener always told me every song should be an editorial,\u201d Rudder explained. \u201cThat verse was about the world being afraid of our fast bowlers and bringing in rules about the number of bouncers per over. It was a deliberate attempt to humble the West Indies and struck a note with Caribbean people; we saw that change for what it was.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42762ad2489cb444707a08cda7b14acd9056ff76\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42762ad2489cb444707a08cda7b14acd9056ff76/134_175_5413_3249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empire Windrush packed with West Indian immigrants on arrival at the Port of Tilbury on the River Thames on 22 June 1948\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empire Windrush packed with West Indian immigrants on arrival at the Port of Tilbury on the River Thames on 22 June 1948.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It may not have reversed the legislation but Rally was the third big hit in a year that supercharged Rudder\u2019s career, having already been crowned Calypso King \u2013 the best on show at Trinidad\u2019s famous annual carnival \u2013 12 months earlier.</p> \n<p>First came <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PDuOxwAS3I\" title=\"\">Haiti</a><em>, </em>an apology for the world turning its back on an impoverished country born out of slave rebellion 200 years earlier; then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l6s3joSKy0\" title=\"\">Panama, which took a cheeky swipe at corrupt Trinidadian politicians</a> who had fled to Central America and foreshadowed Manuel Noriega\u2019s removal as Panamanian president.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/richie-richardson-west-indies-sun-hat-cricket\">The prime of Richie Richardson: one man and his West Indies sun hat | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Rally hit the sweet spot in a different way, its rousing lyrics and tropical melody becoming such a favourite at Test venues across the Caribbean over the decade following its release that when the West Indies board searched for an anthem before a series against Australia in 1999, there was only ever one winner.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe board told me they had adopted it but needed it as a \u2018real\u2019 anthem, so I rewrote some of the lyrics and rejigged the arrangement,\u201d Rudder recalled. \u201cIt originally began with \u2018No noble thoughts, brought us here to these islands\u2019 only for Guyana to point out they are no island, so that quickly became \u2018this region\u2019.

<strong>William Callaghan:</strong> </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An air-and-ground search is continuing for a lost Victorian teenager with non-verbal autism, after life-threatening low temperatures overnight.</p> \n   <p>Hundreds of people are racing to find William Callaghan, 14, who became lost in steep and rugged terrain on Mount Disappointment about 2.20pm on Monday.</p> \n   <p>William became separated from his family wearing just blue trackpants and a hoodie ahead of a night where temperatures dropped below zero.</p> \n   <p>Acting Inspector Christine Lalor said the youngster had been walking to the summit with his family when he raced ahead.</p> \n   <p>Tuesday\u2019s clear, sunny sky kept hopes high of finding him after an air-and-ground search started on Monday afternoon.</p> \n   <p>But with another chilly night coming, fears for the boy are growing.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be another cold evening again, hence ... it\u2019s vital that we try to find William before nightfall,\u201d Insp Lalor said. \u201c(His parents) are holding up as well as can be expected.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Search and Rescue Squad Senior Sergeant Greg Paul told reporters on Tuesday they were fighting against time, but remained hopeful.</p> \n   <p>The weather bureau expects the temperature on the exposed mountain to drop to zero degrees and -3C in the valleys overnight.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite life-threatening weather, but we have had people survived several nights in these weather conditions as well,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cLuke Shambrook, six years ago ... we found him on day five, he was alive and he\u2019s alive today.\u201d</p> \n   <p>A mix of four-wheel-drives, people on foot, motor bikes, horseback and those in the air are involved in the search.</p> \n   <p>More than 200 volunteers joined about 150 police and emergency services who are looking for William.</p> \n   <p>Sen Sgt Paul said the area had very thick bush from bushfire regrowth and it hampered searches, given the undergrowth.</p> \n   <p>But they were \u201cgiving it our best effort\u201d to search the steep terrain.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe only advantage is ... there is an opportunity to stay a little bit warm if you can snuggle up in the undergrowth,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>William went missing without food and water and could have covered a lot of distance by now, police said.</p> \n   <p>He is very energetic and food-focused, with police believing he may have walked into a house to help himself to food, or tuck himself into a bed.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWilliam doesn\u2019t verbalise so if anyone finds him the best way to communicate with him is to be patient and calm,\u201d Acting Insp Lalor said, adding William taps his chest to communicate.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIf anyone in the area could check their homes, check their beds and any out houses to see if William is in those locations.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div>

the Magpies and that coach <strong>Nathan Buckley</strong> had not supported him when he spoke out against <strong>Eddie McGuire</strong> in 2013.</p> \n  <p>Club president McGuire had suggested on radio that Sydney\u2019s <strong>Adam Goodes</strong> could be used to promote the King Kong movie, and later apologised for doing so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI spoke out against McGuire\u2019s racism on 28/5/2013 and was ostracised internally for doing so, particularly from Buckley, who stated, \u2018You threw the president under the bus\u2019,\u201d Lumumba said in a Facebook post.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey viewed what I did as wrong, and remained unapologetic about it, and as a result, I was treated differently, for the worse.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt had a negative effect on my mental health and general well-being.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWithout a support network within the club/league that could cater to my specific needs, I used psilocybin (mushrooms) out of desperation to deal with my distressed state, which subsequently helped me confront CFC over the issues.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Lumumba, who made his AFL debut in 2005, also reiterated the claim that he was called \u201cChimp\u201d by Collingwood teammates before being traded to Melbourne at the end of 2014.</p> \n  <p>That claim was publicly backed up by former Magpies teammate <strong>Andrew Krakouer</strong> in 2017.</p> \n

  "<p>You know what sure would help a lot? Taking a break from all our worries. But with zero chance of a lock-in during lockdown, the closest we can get is clinking our glasses against a nearby screen. So which TV local should you consider frequenting? Here\u2019s a Camra-ready rundown \u2026</p> <h2>Rovers Return Inn</h2> <p>Everyone probably has a personal favourite in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/31/no-southern-comfort-at-the-rovers-return\" title=\"\">the soap opera bottle royale</a> but the Queen Vic seems to run endlessly hot with punch-ups and affairs. Compare that to Coronation Street\u2019s local pub-hub, a homely haven where Newton and Ridley beer flows as freely as the gossip. Just don\u2019t think about the shotgun incident that unfolded over Christmas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce457fc8a920063327758c77530692a2a75c4c02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce457fc8a920063327758c77530692a2a75c4c02/0_183_2848_1707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feeling animated ...

It shows the value of not chasing every hip new trend, except for all those episodes of The Simpsons where Moe chases some hip new trend.</p> <h2>The Winchester Club</h2> <p>Forget Del Boy\u2019s fave The Nag\u2019s Head: too bright, too busy. If you are a grey-economy impresario looking for a watering hole with a little privacy, Arthur Daley\u2019s preferred haunt \u2013 with its nominal members-only policy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/06/glynn-edwards-obituary\" title=\"\">affable barman Dave</a> \u2013 is a pleasingly dingy refuge. Minder\u2019s status as an ITV4 schedule-filler also means it is easily accessible twice a day.</p> <h2>Paddy\u2019s Pub</h2> <p>This wretched Irish dive bar is full of scum-bums and sociopaths. Even worse, they own the place. But for all the bloviating and backstabbing, the obnoxious gang from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/08/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-from-humble-sitcom-to-pop-culture-giant\" title=\"\">It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a> \u2013 cockroach-durable at 14 seasons and counting \u2013 provide a genuinely valuable service in uncertain times. Think of them as a moral compass (in that whatever they are doing, you should do the opposite).</p> <h2>The Grapes</h2> <p>Fondly reminiscing about the crush of a boozy Friday night? Just remember how long it took to get served at the bar. The joys of a quiet pint of mild are hymned in the short-lived but beloved mid-2000s sitcom Early Doors. It makes this scruffy Stockport boozer look like a covetable sanctuary to linger in, loaf and debate the status of temporary traffic lights.</p> <h2>Quark\u2019s Bar</h2> <p>Picard\u2019s USS Enterprise has Ten Forward, a bougie wine bar where Whoopi Goldberg dispenses sage advice along with cosmic mocktails. It\u2019s very dull. Much more fun is Quark\u2019s on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, named for its ever-scheming Ferengi owner. After imbibing absurdly strong Romulan ale, you can lose your shirt at the dabo gambling tables or lose your trousers in a sexy holosuite.</p> <h2>The Brick</h2> <p>Overseen by May-December couple Shelly and Holling, The Brick is the centre of all things in Cicely, Alaska \u2013 a place where Northern Exposure\u2019s cast of eccentrics gather to share homespun wisdom and droll asides.

What sets it apart is the grandiloquence of proprietor Al Swearengen, although since everyone has a six-gun it would be a bad idea to bang a fist on the bar and yell \u201cshots!\u201d.</p> <h2>Cheers</h2> <p>Before he ran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/04/the-good-place-was-this-the-most-devastating-tv-finale-ever\" title=\"\">The Good Place</a>, Ted Danson oversaw an even better place.

  "<p>A victim of domestic violence, who is surviving on universal credit but has been denied legal aid in a battle to hold on to her home, is challenging strict regulations that could force her to cross-examine her former partner in court.</p> <p>The woman, known as Claire (not her real name), has launched a judicial review of the refusal to provide funding made by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). Without legal aid, she cannot pay for a lawyer and will have no option but to represent herself. Her challenge will be heard in the high court on Tuesday.</p> <p>LAA regulations take into account any so-called trapped capital in the home she jointly owns with her ex-partner when assessing her eligibility to legal aid.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal aid agency is saying that I have to sell my house in order to fight to be in my house, or to get my fair share of it,\u201d Claire said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that I can\u2019t do that. The alternative is to represent myself. The idea of seeing my abuser again in court is utterly terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>The Public Law Project (PLP), which is representing her, says assessment is unrealistic because it does not consider whether she is able to access that money.</p> <p>\u201cActing as a litigant in person in those proceedings could involve having to cross-examine her ex-partner \u2013 of whom she is completely terrified \u2013 while at the same time arguing complex points of law,\u201d Katy Watts, a PLP solicitor, said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unrealistic to think that anyone in that situation could represent themselves effectively. Our client receives universal credit and cares for two small children. There is no way she could pay for legal representation on her own. There is a very serious access to justice problem here.</p> <p>On previous occasions Claire had to go to court on her own to defend a non-molestation order. \u201cHe was there with his barrister. His barrister was pushing for a \u2018zonal order\u2019, which would have allowed my ex-partner back into the house, but I had no idea what it meant at first. They were using legal jargon I didn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the first time I had seen him or heard his voice in four weeks. He was really angry. It was awful. I was petrified. I had nobody to help me. When I heard his voice I was physically sick in the courtroom. There was such an inequality of power. He had his barrister and I didn\u2019t have anybody.\u201d</p> <p>Olive Craig, a senior legal officer at Rights of Women said: \u201cWe frequently speak to women who cannot afford to pay for representation but who are considered to be financially ineligible for legal aid because the test is so strict. You should not have to sell your home and make yourself and your children homeless to be able to access justice.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny Beck, a director at the family firm Beck Fitzgerald who is acting pro bono for the woman, said: \u201cSadly, Claire\u2019s case is not unusual. She is a victim of serious abuse who needed to protect herself and her children. Claire has already had to go to court alone to protect herself. She was terrified.</p> <p>\u201cLegal aid is denied to about one in five of the women I see because of the way the scheme works. Even those living below subsistence level are denied proper access to justice. We are facing a real justice crisis here. There\u2019s little sense in protective laws if normal people cannot access them.\u201d</p> <p>A Legal Aid Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe cannot comment on ongoing proceedings.\u201d</p>",

Graham told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> last week: \u201cTo lay the blame at President Trump\u2019s feet for the division in this nation is a pretty short-sighted view of it.\u201d</p> <p>But a growing chorus of Republicans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">military leaders</a> have condemned Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">aggressive response</a> to the protests, which included a threat to deploy American soldiers on the streets and showed little intellectual or emotional grasp of centuries of racial injustice.</p> <p>Last week, Trump\u2019s former defence secretary, the retired general Jim Mattis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">spoke out against</a> what he called Trump\u2019s \u201cdeliberate\u201d efforts to divide the country.

And last week the Republican senator Lisa Murkowski <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/politics/lisa-murkowski-mattis-trump-reaction/index.html\">admitted she </a><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/politics/lisa-murkowski-mattis-trump-reaction/index.html\">was \u201cstruggling\u201d</a> with whether to support Trump\u2019s re-election.</p> <p>Several Republican groups have formed to oppose his 2020 bid, including <a href=\"https://rvat.org/\">Republican Voters Against Trump,</a> which last week launched a $10m digital ad campaign, and the Lincoln Project, which has produced a series of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnBRu0ANDIc\">hard-hitting advertisements</a> that got under the president\u2019s skin.</p> <p>Wilson, who is also one of its co-founders, said: \u201cFor a long time individuals in the party were very suppressed by the fear of Donald Trump destroying them because he would tweet about them, he would say bad things about them and it could wreck somebody\u2019s primary chances or hurt them in some other political space.</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019ve reached a point where the intolerance for his incompetence has reached just stratospheric levels. People just cannot abide it. It\u2019s one thing to say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s rough around the edges but he gets things done,\u2019 but now he\u2019s failing in so many dimensions that people are no longer tolerant of it.\u201d</p> <p>Some Republicans fear that Trump\u2019s unpopularity, which led to defeat in the House of Representatives in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-midterm-elections-2018\">2018</a>, could cost them their Senate seats in November. Wilson added: \u201cHis political standing has collapsed so greatly that it\u2019s easier for these folks to not feel the same risk level. There\u2019s going to come a point very soon where having a nasty tweet from the president is a badge of honour and a tool of survival because my rule of \u2018everything Trump touches dies\u2019 is real.</p> <p>\u201cThe people that are trying to get away from it now, I think, are going to end up in a better position than they would have been prior to this. There are many more people that are going to put daylight between themselves and this president because he is political herpes. They don\u2019t want to be touched by it.\u201d</p> <p>There are reasons to be cautious, however. Trump has the backing of more Republican elected officials than he did in 2016, with many having learned to bite their lips and be grateful for his tax cuts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/donald-trump-judges-create-new-conservative-america-republicans\">conservative judges</a> and other policies.</p> <p>Those now criticising the president did not vote for him in 2016 either, and Romney pinned his colours to the mast when he was the sole Republican to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS-aFfJe20U\">vote for Trump\u2019s removal from office</a> after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment\">impeachment</a> trial. Moreover, attacks from party elders have sometimes been counterproductive, reinforcing Trump\u2019s image as a Washington outsider who will shake up the status quo.</p> <p>The president\u2019s base remains solid, and his \u201claw and order\u201d response to the protests is likely to harden it even further. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-trump-loses-ground-key-2016-voters-n1226971\">NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll,</a> Biden stands at 49% and Trump at 42%, though among self-identified Republicans, the margin is 92% to 4% in favour of the president.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/politics/trump-base-analysis/index.html\">A CNN analysis noted that,</a> since 2000, no Republican ever had more than 91% of Republicans supporting him at this point in ABC News/ Washington Post polling. But Trump is faring worse at this point with independents and Democrats than any Republican over the same period. The base alone may not be enough to secure a second electoral college win.</p> <p>Despite a global pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economic</a> slump and mass protests, Trump, who in April tweeted that Mutiny on the Bounty was one of his favourite films, has been quick to crush any signs of rebellion. Murkowski, Powell and Romney were all met with disparaging tweets, a clear warning to anyone else who might be tempted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/donald-trump-re-election-nixon-protests-strategy\">Trump reaches for Nixon playbook after protests that have rocked America</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott,</a> a political science professor at Fordham University, said: \u201cIn terms of officeholders, I think what\u2019s always held them back is fear of the retribution because he\u2019s shown with [retired senator] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/03/jeff-flake-trump-supporters-threats-interview\">Jeff Flake</a> and others that he will wreak havoc or vengeance on those who don\u2019t toe his line.

While police minister Stuart Nash has said he does not<strong> </strong>believe it is a problem, regional development minister Shane Jones said this week there were \u201cincidents and influences\u201d police should not be proud of.</p> <p>\u201cNew Zealand is more ethnically diverse than ever, and the police have to learn to deal with that or lose goodwill,\u201d said Jones, who is of M\u0101ori and Dalmation descent.</p> <p>\u201cWe have all seen instances where police in dealing with ethnicities, and even dealing with M\u0101oridom, could have done a heck of a lot better \u2013 and I need go no further than the balls-up of the T\u016bhoe [tribe] raids.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, the police commissioner formally apologised to the central North Island iwi for police actions during the raids which occurred in 2007.</p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Education secretary expected to concede defeat</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you to flip through the matters of greatest import.</p> \n<p>Plans to push ahead with reopening schools in England are in disarray after the government admitted not all primary school pupils will be able to return before the end of summer. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is expected to concede today that many primary pupils will not return until the new school year in autumn. Boris Johnson last month announced the opening of primary schools for reception, year one and year six from 1 June. Now, government sources acknowledge that with little more than six weeks remaining before schools close for summer, the practicalities are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/09/plans-to-reopen-english-primary-schools-before-summer-in-disarray\">too difficult for the planned return of all children</a>.</p> \n<p>Ministers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/08/uk-ministers-face-legal-challenge-for-refusal-to-order-ppe-inquiry\">facing a high court legal challenge</a> after they refused to order an urgent investigation into the&nbsp;shortages of personal protective equipment&nbsp;faced by NHS staff during the coronavirus pandemic. About 300 UK health workers have so far died of Covid-19, and many&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;staff groups and families claim inadequate PPE played a key role in exposing them.</p> \n<p>Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations could be eased more quickly after Nicola Sturgeon, the first secretary, announced on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/scotlands-lockdown-could-be-eased-soon-after-deaths-diminish\">no deaths had been recorded for two days running</a>. Sturgeon has been pressed to explain her&nbsp;much more cautious approach&nbsp;than the government in Westminster, or the Welsh and Northern Irish administrations. She is due to announce on Thursday 18 June how much more the lockdown might be eased.</p> \n<p>At&nbsp;Heathrow airport&nbsp;there has been some confusion as the first passengers subject to new quarantine restrictions&nbsp;landed.

Correction: it took Sarah Cain 40 minutes to get to work \u2013 until the day we speak, when it took 16 minutes. Because Cain, who previously walked to work, has got herself a bike. \u201cIt was a bit nerve-racking,\u201d she tells me on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve been on a bicycle.\u201d</p> <p>But she set off early, the weather was fine and she knows the route. \u201cI had my helmet on and a bright jacket,\u201d she says. \u201cI might be a bit shaky in more traffic. You see a lot more families out on bikes and that gets your confidence up a little bit.\u201d She is determined to carry on: she knows it is good for her and good for Bristol. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in the Lycra brigade, I\u2019m just going to be your bog-standard cyclist.\u201d</p> <p>On a bog-standard cycle. Cain paid \u00a3100 for hers, secondhand, at <a href=\"https://briscycle.co.uk/book-in-your-bicycle-for-service-2/\">Briscycle</a>, a local independent bike shop. She is very happy with it \u2013 and with Briscycle. Andrew Bebesi, who runs the shop with his wife, Julianna, says it has been crazy during lockdown. \u201cWe were working really hard over the past few years and it was just about pootling along,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got too many bikes to fix and too few to sell.\u201d</p> <p>Moving premises to a busier street has had something to do with it, but Bebesi, who is originally from Hungary, is in no doubt that the pandemic and lockdown \u2013 less traffic, anxiety about using public transport, the need to exercise \u2013 have been the big drivers towards the bike shop boom. He refers to the time before Covid-19 as \u201cpeacetime\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9251d32a76edc2fcc7e003c505608f90366f0201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9251d32a76edc2fcc7e003c505608f90366f0201/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Bebesi of Briscycle bike shop in Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is panic-buying now in the bike trade\u2019 ...

Bebesi works 16-hour, sometimes 18-hour, days; they get 70 to 80 phone calls. When he is not talking to customers looking for bikes, or attempting to book a service, Bebesi is trying to source parts. \u201cI just managed to secure a load of chains. There is panic-buying now in the bike trade, because there is an enormous number of bicycles to be repaired.\u201d</p> <p>If you are a key worker, Bebesi will give you a service quickly; otherwise you have to wait for up to two weeks. Any bikes he gets in sell fast. \u201cLast Saturday, we sold eight bikes in 20 minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as we opened the door, they were just pulling the bikes out.\u201d</p> <p>These are secondhand bikes, reconditioned with warranties, like Sarah Cain\u2019s. Bebesi also sells new bikes \u2013 he is Bristol\u2019s sole distributor of the <a href=\"https://www.gtbicycles.com/gbr_en/\">GT brand</a>. But he sold out of them two months ago and has not been able to get in any more stock. He hopes he might get some in August.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bebesi and Cain\u2019s experiences are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/23/two-wheels-good-bike-sales-soar-as-uk-takes-to-cycling\">reflective of the whole cycling industry</a>.

Steve Garidis, the executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.bicycleassociation.org.uk/\">Bicycle Association</a>, the body that represents the industry in the UK, says the numbers for the lockdown period are still being crunched, but \u201cinitial indications are that sales in April rose significantly compared with the seasonal average\u201d. Sales of bikes worth less than \u00a3500 \u201cappear to have been especially strong\u201d, he adds.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sigma Sports, a bike shop in south-west London, <a href=\"https://cyclingindustry.news/sigma-sports-sales-data-provides-detailed-snapshot-of-covid-19-crisis-bike-boom/\">reported a 677% rise</a> in year-on-year sales of entry-level bikes for April.

Sales of women\u2019s bikes are now outperforming men\u2019s and there\u2019s been a surge in demand for small-wheeled children\u2019s bikes, too, suggesting that families with young children are also turning to cycling to keep fit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"300e3e07a11771c3b6469fe208690f812b341922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/300e3e07a11771c3b6469fe208690f812b341922/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women and son browse bikes in a cycle shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Families with young children are turning to cycling to keep fit,\u2019 says Graham Stapleton, the CEO of Halfords.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fotostorm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the other end of the scale, my local bike shop, <a href=\"http://www.sparksbicycles.co.uk/\">Sparks</a>, a small, family-run independent in Harlesden, north-west London, is almost out of new bikes. \u201cIt went ballistic in terms of how many people came in looking for budget bikes,\u201d says Sat Patel, who has run Sparks for 30 years. \u201cWe only hold a small amount of stock anyway and as soon as I ran out I couldn\u2019t replenish. Being a small independent, we get a very little piece of the pie.\u201d At the moment, he has only a couple of mid-range and higher-end road bikes available, for \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sparks is the only shop I visit while researching this article; it is a 10-minute ride for me. When it became clear that bike shops could remain open under lockdown, Patel initially had some concerns about his and his family\u2019s safety (his daughter is helping out on the day I drop by). But he has a system that works: the back of the shop is closed to customers, with only one allowed in the shop at a time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although he has hardly any bikes to sell, he is busy repairing and servicing. There are several bikes in the back of the shop, awaiting treatment, and a steady stream of customers. While I am there, Marco from Italy picks up his bike, the broken pedal now fixed. There is a bike shop nearer his home, he says, but the wait for repairs was too long.</p> <p>Sparks doesn\u2019t take bookings \u2013 you just show up and leave your bike in the queue. If I left mine today for a service, I would get it back in between a week and two weeks\u2019 time, much sooner if I were a key worker.&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories that in some shops they\u2019re telling people 10 weeks,\u201d says Patel.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b3691759bb3e73159ac18a334950c5b1a3d957c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b3691759bb3e73159ac18a334950c5b1a3d957c/0_0_2304_4096/563.jpg\" alt=\"The staff at Hart\u2019s Cyclery in Edinburgh\" width=\"563\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I didn\u2019t expect it to be quite as wild as it has been\u2019 ... the staff at Hart\u2019s Cyclery in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three hundred and thirty miles north, in the Corstorphine area of Edinburgh, is <a href=\"https://www.harts-cyclery.co.uk/\">Hart\u2019s Cyclery</a>. Too far to pedal from London, even for a newly super-fit cyclist, but you can tell it is busy, from the clanking and shouting, even on the phone. Now is not a great time to talk, says Graeme Hart, the owner. Can I call back after six?</p> <p>Even then there is plenty of background activity, but they have locked the door \u2013 no more customers today. Hart describes the listing of bike shops as essential business during lockdown as \u201cprobably the single most significant thing in the bike trade for the last 30 years\u201d.</p> <p>The shop offers servicing and repairs as well as selling a range of new bikes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/17/i-can-just-glide-through-traffic-how-e-bikes-could-answer-our-commuting-problems\">including e-bikes</a>, which now make up about a third of sales (in numbers; it is more in revenue, as the cheapest e-bike on offer costs \u00a31,600). Hart reckons business has at least doubled from normal times, although he hasn\u2019t had time to sit down and work it out. \u201cA real cross-section of people have been coming in, mostly new customers, people I\u2019ve never seen before, rediscovering their bikes or buying bikes for the first time.\u201d</p> <p>He has even got some new bikes to sell, because the Dutch brand Gazelle has reopened its factory. \u201cThere\u2019s a trickle of stock \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be in there quick.\u201d</p> <p>Hart knew, amid the general doom and gloom, that his business would probably be all right. \u201cI thought: people are still gonna want to ride their bikes, I figured kids would want to ride their bikes because all other activities were closed. So I thought it would be busy. But I didn\u2019t expect it to be quite as wild as it has been.\u201d</p> <p>Will the bonanza last, though? Does Britain\u2019s nascent love affair with the bicycle have the momentum to carry it over the hills ahead and become significant and permanent? Duncan Dollimore, the head of campaigns at the charity <a href=\"https://www.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK</a>, says: \u201cFor years, people have said: \u2018Don\u2019t talk about Holland \u2013 we won\u2019t cycle in the UK because it\u2019s too hilly, it\u2019s too wet, it\u2019s just not in our culture,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had this massive social experiment over the past three months; people have had to think again about the way they travel and we\u2019ve had the doubling of the number of people cycling. It shows there is a latent demand to do it, but only if people feel safe.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/23/two-wheels-good-bike-sales-soar-as-uk-takes-to-cycling\">Two wheels good \u2026 Bike sales soar as UK takes to cycling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has felt safe, even for families, without the traffic. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not just bike sales that have gone through the roof; it\u2019s entry-level bike sales,\u201d says Dollimore. \u201cIt\u2019s people buying entry-level bikes for day-to-day journeys or with the kids. It shows there is a demand for it.\u201d</p> <p>But with lockdown easing and motor traffic picking up, the roads are already becoming less nice places for those on two wheels. That is why there is a need to act right now.</p> <p>There is money. <a href=\"https://www.cyclinguk.org/article/ps225m-temporary-cycle-space-allocated-english-regions\">The Department of Transport has allocated \u00a3225m for temporary cycle space in English regions</a>. It is down to local authorities to put in the infrastructure, such as pop-up cycle lanes to separate bikes from cars and lorries.&nbsp;Some work has been done. A lot more needs to happen, and fast, says Dollimore. \u201cIn another month, time will be running out \u2013 traffic will be increasing, people won\u2019t be able to use public transport. There\u2019s an urgent need to act, otherwise people who can\u2019t use public transport will choose to get in the car again. Get on with it or the moment will have gone and we will have lost this opportunity to have this once-in-a-lifetime change to the way people move around urban areas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"716e0cfe0d2839450d37396b101d892465ef1bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/716e0cfe0d2839450d37396b101d892465ef1bac/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycle route infrastructure in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The transport department has allocated \u00a3225m for temporary cycle space in England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in Edinburgh, Hart agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious we can\u2019t all drive cars for ever more. To have sustainable places to live and work, we need more people on bikes and I think this has brought that into a sharp focus.\u201d</p> <p>If the Netherlands is Dollimore\u2019s bugbear, then Denmark is Hart\u2019s. \u201cThere is this thing in the UK: that it\u2019s rainy, it\u2019s cold, there\u2019re hills, the usual fallacies that get trotted out. Copenhagen has got an unbelievable level of cycling and it\u2019s Baltic there.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Yeah, but Copenhagen doesn\u2019t have the hills of Edinburgh, does it? \u201cGoing east-west it\u2019s not that hilly; there are loads of journeys you can do that aren\u2019t that hilly.\u201d There you go: only travel east-west in Edinburgh. And if you do need to go north-south, you could always buy one of Hart\u2019s e-bikes. (For \u00a31,600.)</p> <p>Finally, to London \u2013 and one more lockdown returnee to the saddle. Monica Reus is an A&amp;E nurse at Chelsea and Westminster hospital. Her bike had been gathering dust and cobwebs in the corner of her flat. \u201cI was not very confident in the London traffic,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, I didn\u2019t really have the will.\u201d</p> <p>But with Reus working in a hospital during the pandemic, she worried about infecting other people on the bus or the tube. As an NHS worker, she is entitled to free membership of Cycling UK, which gives her third-party liability and legal assistance, so she dusted off the bike. \u201cAt first, it was really scary, because I\u2019m not very good at cycling. But it got much better, to the point where I am cycling to every shift and even on my days off. I did my first 60km ride on Sunday. I do enjoy it; I feel healthier, my mood is better, I feel like I don\u2019t need to depend on the tube and I don\u2019t have to worry about infecting anyone or touching anyone around me.\u201d</p> <p>What about in November, when it is sure to be Baltic? \u201cMaybe I will, with a wetsuit,\u201d she says, laughing. Ha! I think Reus, who is Spanish, means waterproofs. But maybe not: her English is excellent. Maybe, in fact, a wetsuit is the answer.</p>",
  "<p>The government has been accused of \u201cincompetence and complacency\u201d in its handling of an independent review of Prevent, the programme that aims to stop people from becoming terrorists, amid further delays to its completion.</p> <p>The review was first announced in January 2019 and it has been beset by delays. Its first chair, Lord Carlile, was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/19/lord-carlile-prevent-review-legal-challenge\">forced to step down</a>&nbsp;in December 2019 and it took four months for the Home Office to launch a recruitment campaign for his replacement.</p> <p>Since then, the department has extended the window for applications from 1 June to 22 June with the final interviews not taking place until the end of July. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/unconvicted-terrorism-suspects-face-indefinite-controls-under-uk-bill\">counter-terrorism and sentencing bill</a> that will have its second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday seeks to remove a statutory deadline for ministers to respond to the review\u2019s findings.</p> <p>Conor McGinn, the shadow security minister, said: \u201cThe Prevent review should have finished its work and reported to ministers this month, but the government\u2019s incompetence and complacency means it won\u2019t even have started.</p> <p>\u201cThe introduction of a new counter-terrorism bill before the Prevent review has even begun underlines just how much time the government has wasted. Ministers must ensure there are no further delays or they will risk further undermining the credibility of the review and their own counter-terrorism strategy.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe Independent Review of Prevent began in August 2019 and the Government wants to see it concluded as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWe have launched a full and open competition to appoint a new Reviewer following Lord Carlile stepping down, and have extended the application period in recognition of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Communities, activists and civil liberties organisations have been calling for a review of Prevent for years, claiming that it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background. Advocates of the strategy reject this and say it has successfully diverted vulnerable individuals from being radicalised.</p> <p>The most controversial element of the Prevent programme is the statutory duty imposed on schools, NHS trusts, prisons, local authorities and other public bodies to report concerns about people they suspect may be at risk of turning to extremism.</p> <p>The Home Office said it had extended the deadline for applications due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and to \u201censure that as broad a range of candidates as possible have the opportunity to apply\u201d.</p> <p>The counter-terrorism and sentencing bill returning to parliament on Tuesday includes proposals to weaken the burden of proof for terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) to be imposed on people suspected of terrorist activity and remove the two-year cap on their use.</p> <p>Tpims are controversial and resource-heavy measures \u2013 usually based on secret intelligence \u2013 for controlling the risk presented by terrorism suspects at large where criminal prosecution is not an option.</p> <p>The bill introduces &nbsp;a new \u201cserious terrorism sentence\u201d with a 14-year minimum jail term and up to 25 years on licence for the most dangerous offences, broadly defined as featuring a likelihood of multiple deaths.</p>",
  "<p>On 4 June 2020, as darkness enveloped Hong Kong, thousands of people broke through barricades and slipped into the tree-lined Victoria Park in the heart of the city. Shielding their candles from the wind, and carefully sitting 1 metre apart, they filled the length of the open space. The annual Tiananmen Square vigil had been banned, with police citing coronavirus concerns. But Hong Kong was determined to mark the anniversary as it always has. For three decades, the city has been the only place within China where the massacre can be publicly remembered. The commemoration is by far the world\u2019s largest, but also its most vulnerable. Its tiny flames speak to the endurance of hope and memory, and to their looming extinction.</p> <p>When the People\u2019s Liberation Army massacred hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing on 4 June 1989, the response in Hong Kong was overwhelming. One million or more residents marched in mourning. People from across society \u2013 clergymen, activists, Cantopop stars, businesspeople, foreign diplomats, even triad gangs \u2013 worked together to smuggle \u201cmost wanted\u201d student leaders off the mainland and to safety.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just horror and sympathy that Hong Kongers were feeling in 1989; it was foreboding. The British colony was due to be handed back to China eight years later, and in the days before the killings, as rumours of an impending crackdown spread, local activists had held signs warning \u201cToday China, tomorrow Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>By that point, the Chinese and the British had already made the handover agreement that would come into effect in 1997. Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its autonomy and way of life for 50 years, until 2047, under the formulation known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. It was a fudge, probably the best outcome achievable under the circumstances \u2013 a binding international treaty, but one that everyone knew was essentially unenforceable should China break its pledge.</p> <p>About 500,000 people left between the signing of the deal in 1984 and 1997. Prince Charles, who attended the handover ceremony, wrote after his departure: \u201cThus we left Hong Kong to her fate and the hope that Martin Lee, the leader of the Democrats, would not be arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Yet at the time of the handover, the fear in Hong Kong was matched by a certain excitement. One supporter of the current protests, Li, who is 71 and came to Hong Kong as a teenager from Guangdong, popped two bottles of champagne to celebrate: \u201cOne to say farewell to Britain, and one to welcome the People\u2019s Liberation Army to Hong Kong,\u201d he remembered. As a child, Li had witnessed the mass famine caused by the Great Leap Forward and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, but now he felt hopeful. \u201cWe expected tomorrow to be better. We\u2019re Chinese people, not just Hong Kongers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As the handover passed and life in Hong Kong appeared to be continuing pretty much as promised, sympathy for the mainland grew. China\u2019s years of double-digit growth brought economic rewards to the region and optimists hoped that its ongoing economic liberalisation would, over time, bring political change, too: the mainland might become more like Hong Kong. In 1997, one in five Hong Kongers identified as Chinese; 10 years later, one in three saw themselves that way.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Tiananmen vigil has always been a barometer of anti-Beijing sentiment; the first, in 1990, attracted 150,000 people, while only 30,000 gathered in 2000. When the activist Bonnie Leung first attended as a student, a few years later, she was seen as \u201ca weirdo\u201d, she said. Every one of the friends she invited refused. But its relative unpopularity did not, to her, diminish its importance. Its very existence showed why Hong Kong was different: \u201cEven when we don\u2019t care, we always know.\u201d</p> <p>Every so often, Beijing would tighten its grip on Hong Kong, and attendance at the vigil would surge again \u2013 as in 2004, after a huge backlash killed off an attempt by the Hong Kong government to pass a national security bill that might have paved the way for peaceful critics of the Chinese Communist party to be jailed. Still, it seemed inevitable that the commemoration would gradually dwindle. Some wondered how long it would be before the vigils died away, and the memory of Tiananmen Square passed with them.</p> <p>But on 4 June 2019, 30 years after the massacre, 180,000 gathered in Victoria Park. It was the biggest turnout for years. The public had been galvanised by the threat of an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be taken to the mainland to face Communist party-controlled courts. If the bill became law, it seemed to spell the end for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from China. Anger had spread well beyond the usual community of activists and intellectuals. Even then, few saw what was brewing. On 9 June, when 1 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/vast-protest-in-hong-kong-against-extradition-law-china\" title=\"\">marched</a> to demand that the law be scrapped, the organisers \u2013 who included Leung, now in her 30s \u2013 were as astonished as anyone. A few days after that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-china\" title=\"\">another march</a> drew 2 million people: more than one in four of the population.</p> <p>In the months that followed, even as the movement grew more radical, support continued to rise. By this spring, 58% of residents backed the protesters. A city once seen as orderly and materialistic has discovered itself to be idealistic and angry. In the past year, police have arrested more than 8,000 protesters, including children as young as 11 and pensioners as old as 83. Demonstrators and police have fought pitched battles outside shopping malls, government offices, police stations and the international airport. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9/0_0_5643_3762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice but to fight. We have to try to do something,\u201d said 25-year-old Kelvin Chan, sitting alone near the waterfront of Victoria Harbour as dusk fell. It was a Sunday in early August, nine weeks into the protests. Chan, in a loose black T-shirt and a facemask that barely covered his face, did not look ready to fight, but said he was \u201cwaiting for the battle\u201d that would inevitably take place once the police arrived. Protesters nearby made a barricade outside the Intercontinental Hotel as curious guests watched from the stairs. Like many of his generation, Chan believed that soon he would no longer have the chance to attend protests like these. \u201cIn the future, 2047 or earlier, I think China will brainwash Hong Kong people. China wants to control Hong Kong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That future is arriving more abruptly than anyone anticipated. Late on 21 May, China\u2019s national legislature announced plans to impose an anti-sedition law on Hong Kong, going even further than the bill shelved by the Hong Kong government 17 years ago and the subsequent extradition law. \u201cHong Kong as we know it is finally dead,\u201d said Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker and longtime pro-democracy campaigner. \u201cThis is the start of a new but sad chapter for Hong Kong.\u201d The new legislation will give the government the power to silence critics and dissidents through vague charges of subversion, and to install Chinese national security agencies in the city. The nature of the move is as alarming as its content: it sets a precedent of Beijing forcing unpopular legislation on Hong Kong, which under the terms of the handover was promised \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d. </p> <p>Days later, police announced that they were banning the Tiananmen vigil, citing Covid-19 measures. By then, the idea of a candlelit commemoration seemed to belong to another Hong Kong: to the restrained, almost genteel activism that endured for so long. But Tiananmen\u2019s legacy persists, even among young protesters who have grown dismissive of the vigil over the years. When unrest reached its height last autumn, with molotov cocktails arcing over roads and tear gas grenades bouncing off the tarmac, graffiti appeared on a wall in the centre: \u201cIs it our 4 June 1989 now?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Understanding the protests shaking Hong Kong requires delving back far beyond 1989. Hong Kong as we know it began to take shape in the years after the second world war. In just a decade, the population quadrupled to about 2.5 million, as former residents who had escaped the brutal wartime Japanese occupation returned, and mainland Chinese fled across the border to escape the civil war between the nationalists and communists, and after 1949, the beginning of Communist party rule.</p> <p>This was an exhausted, impoverished, crowded, hungry city. But it was also dynamic. Its inhabitants had experienced how bad things could get, and were intent on establishing a life for themselves. The new arrivals provided much of the cheap labour that powered the city\u2019s postwar manufacturing boom in the 50s and 60s, with the textile sector soon supplemented by clothing, plastic and electronics factories. This success, along with the city\u2019s heritage of trade and of the rule of law, and from 1978 onwards China\u2019s own economic liberalisation, would later make it a global financial centre.</p> <p>Until the prospect of the territory\u2019s return to China loomed, during a century and a half of colonial rule, Britain showed little interest in giving Hong Kong\u2019s citizens the power to elect their leaders. But to serve British interests, the administrators had introduced powerful institutions such as an independent judiciary. Thus Hong Kong had what the last governor, Chris Patten, described as \u201cliberty without democracy\u201d, enjoying free speech, free media and the right to protest, without the right to choose who ran the place.</p> <p>Under this system, protests became a crucial way to challenge British authorities, and later Beijing. In the 60s, major demonstrations, which developed into deadly riots in 1967, were brutally put down by police. But these events also pushed the colonial administration into tackling the needs of the local population: housing, labour rights, education. Aware of Hong Kong\u2019s anachronistic status in a post-colonial world, the British became highly conscious of the need to respond to public demands. Partly in response, protests tended to be targeted in their aims and cautious in means. After the handover, demonstrations would force authorities to abandon plans for a national security law in 2003, and the imposition of \u201cmoral and national education\u201d classes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/world/asia/thousands-protest-chinas-curriculum-plans-for-hong-kong-schools.html\" title=\"\">in 2012</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646/0_0_2000_1270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, though, political activity remained a fairly marginal business, and the democratic movement was law-abiding, even sedate. It wasn\u2019t until the excitment of the 2008 Beijing Olympics faded that the mood clearly began to shift. Many protesters remember that year as a turning point in their views on the mainland. Many were shocked by the steady stream of reports on corruption and other abuses in China. They included the embezzling of donations sent by Hong Kongers to victims of the Sichuan earthquake and the Sanlu infant formula <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/china-executes-milk-scandal-pair\" title=\"\">scandal</a>, when officials suppressed warnings about tainted milk and 300,000 children fell ill as a result.</p> <p>Over the next few years, Hong Kongers were outraged by the moral and national education controversy, and protested against the extension of the mainland\u2019s high-speed train line, fearing it was another sign of how the mainland wanted to swallow up Hong Kong. They were also alarmed by Beijing\u2019s increasing authoritarianism and repression \u2013 particularly after Xi Jinping took power in 2012 \u2013 and the mainland\u2019s growing impact on the city. It began to become evident that the mainland\u2019s economic boom was not making it more like Hong Kong, as some had once thought inevitable. It was making Hong Kong more like the mainland.</p> <p>Alongside the political anxieties came economic frustrations. Hong Kong is one of the most unequal developed economies in the world. In a city full of designer stores and flashy restaurants, it is impossible to ignore the gap between the rich and the poor. A handful of ultra-rich families prosper while the very poorest dwell in tiny \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/29/hong-kong-coffin-homes-horror-my-week\" title=\"\">coffin homes</a>\u201d, less than 2 square metres in size. Even middle-class young people see no hope of moving out of cramped family apartments. Since 1997, about 1 million new residents have arrived from the mainland, without a corresponding increase in public spending, adding to the pressure on services and contributing to soaring property prices.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Max Chung, an activist from a residential area near the border with China, has seen his neighbourhood transformed by visitors from the mainland who come to Hong Kong on weekend shopping trips. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get a table at a restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to take back our normal lives. We don\u2019t want the Chinese suitcases to roll over our feet. We want to have normal food, not the expensive ones. We really want to take back what we used to have.\u201d</p> <p>There is undoubted snobbery, and at times outright bigotry, in the way that many in Hong Kong talk about mainlanders \u2013 casting them as uncouth, uncultured \u201clocusts\u201d straining services and taking over the town. But Hong Kong has also chafed at what it sees as the arrogance of the mainland: the belief that Mandarin should take precedence over Cantonese, and that Hong Kong should simply adapt to the expectations of new arrivals. \u201cThey think: I give you money, so I am the boss. So they can be rude. They can do anything they want,\u201d said Jay, a 21-year-old student \u2013 like many activists, he preferred not to give his name.</p> <p>The hollowness of liberty without democracy has become clear to all. Hong Kong\u2019s 3.8 million voters can choose district councillors to handle matters such as bus routes. But the city\u2019s chief executive is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/hong-kong-chief-executive-election-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">elected by</a> a committee of only 1,200, composed of representatives from business and other groups, as well as elected legislators. The system ensures that the successful candidate is Beijing\u2019s candidate. It has also traditionally given the wealthy a big say in choosing the leader, in a society where a tiny number of tycoon families already have disproportionate power, owning everything from supermarket chains and insurance firms to utility companies and housing.</p> <p>Beijing has now begun to accuse the same oligarchs it once relied upon of being greedy. It sees the protests, at root, as an economic problem, seized upon by \u201ctroublemakers\u201d and hostile foreign powers. But the tradeoff that the party has offered on the mainland \u2013 material security in place of political freedoms \u2013 does not attract Hong Kongers. People don\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting a decent economic deal, and they see political space as a right, not an optional extra. The grievances about their standard of living have morphed into deeply political sentiment.</p> <p>Over time, as discontent grew, so did the number of protests. In 2004, there were 1,975 protests in Hong Kong; by 2015 that had risen to 6,029. Tactics began to diversify. Attendance at the Tiananmen vigils began to rise. The friends who once snubbed Bonnie Leung now called her and asked if they could go together.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite the mounting frustrations of Hong Kongers, by early 2019, the pro-democracy movement looked to many as though it was in terminal decline. The last major protests, which took place in 2014, had ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/01/hong-kong-protests-produce-no-real-winners\" title=\"\">in failure</a>, and since then the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms had accelerated. On 31 March 2019, the usual stalwarts \u2013 Martin Lee, pro-democracy politicians and Joshua Wong, the teenage face of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/-sp-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-pro-democracy-protests\" title=\"\">2014 umbrella movement</a> \u2013 demonstrated against the extradition bill. The implications of the bill seemed obvious: if Hong Kong\u2019s residents could easily be extradited to face the party-controlled mainland legal system, did \u201ctwo systems\u201d really exist any more? It looked like a death blow to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Yet recent history had showed the severe costs of challenging Beijing. The crowd totalled just 12,000.</p> <p>To understand the movement that has taken shape over the past year, you need to understand its relationship with its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/dec/11/hong-kong-protests-timeline-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the umbrella movement</a>. Those protests also centred on a demand for real universal suffrage, electrified the city and grabbed international attention. But they did not achieve their goals, and today many scorn the earlier movement as timid and unserious. \u201cAfter umbrella, I felt totally disappointed in Hong Kong people,\u201d said Jay, the student. \u201cI was there on 28 September 2014. I was shot by teargas and pepper spray. The next day people were singing songs like it was a carnival. So I think they\u2019re hopeless.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Yip/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From 2014 onwards, Beijing did everything it could to crush the possibility of another umbrella movement. Members of the Democratic Legislative council were disqualified from the parliament. Independent bookshops disappeared, while five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/31/a-chapter-closes-last-hong-kong-bookshop-selling-titles-banned-in-china-shuts\" title=\"\">booksellers</a> dealing in salacious titles about China\u2019s leaders were kidnapped and transported to the mainland. Hong Kong University rejected the highly regarded human-rights scholar Johannes Chan for a senior position after pro-Beijing newspapers waged a campaign against him, increasing concerns about pressure on academia. The umbrella movement leaders were jailed; the best-known, Wong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/14/joshua-wong-the-student-who-risked-the-wrath-of-beijing-its-about-turning-the-impossible-into-the-possible\" title=\"\">warned that</a> Beijing\u2019s encroachment had already diminished one country, two systems to \u201cone country, one-and-a-half\u201d.</p> <p>The defeat of the umbrella movement had looked to most like an end, not a beginning. In retrospect, it was the moment when many Hong Kongers started to believe that polite protest wouldn\u2019t work. For people like Jay, the umbrella movement has been a useful example of what not to do. Those protests demanded universal suffrage; this time round, they are primarily a stand against the erosion of rights. Those had charismatic leaders; these are leaderless and decentralised. Those were led by academics and students; these span classes, with construction workers and finance professionals joining forces. Those were committed to polite civil disobedience; these are more radical, and at times violent. Above all, the umbrella movement fractured quickly, while this time \u2013 despite all the government\u2019s efforts to split the movement \u2013 people have stayed unified.</p> <p>Yet when the mass protests began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/10/hong-kong-protests-in-pictures\" title=\"\">June </a>2019, they were peaceful. In mid-June, after police fired tear gas on protesters outside the seat of the government, the Legislative Complex, protesters formed what is known as the \u201cfive demands\u201d, which included the withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into police brutality. On 15 June, Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, announced she was suspending the legislation. But as many as 2 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-streets-flooded-by-extradition-bill-protesters-in-pictures\" title=\"\">took to the streets</a> the following day.</p> <p>Though he is known as Hong Kong\u2019s father of democracy, Martin Lee was initially reluctant to join the demonstration. He thought it was time to negotiate: \u201cI would have liked the movement to stop,\u201d he admitted when we met last autumn at his wood-panelled chambers in central Hong Kong, where a bust of Winston Churchill stood on a shelf. In the end, he concluded he should march because the bill had been postponed rather than scrapped and might yet be revived. Lee embodies the city\u2019s tradition of courageous but pragmatic, cautious activism. But he, like so many in the city, found himself swept along by the tide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341/0_186_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Davidson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others in the movement began to adopt more radical tactics, storming the legislative council on 1 July. Harsher police crackdowns spurred further protests as demonstrators escalated in response. Authorities refused permission for rallies and police violence intensified. Officers arrested bystanders for heckling them, drove vehicles directly at protesters and fired at journalists, in one case leaving a woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/an-eye-for-an-eye-hong-kong-protests-get-figurehead-in-woman-injured-by-police\" title=\"\">blind in one eye</a>. Thugs were unleashed upon protesters and prominent activists, leaving them bloodied and beaten. In August, protesters paralysed the airport, forcing thousands of flights to be cancelled as police began to use live rounds. On 1 October, China\u2019s national day, a police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/hong-kong-protester-shot-with-live-round-during-china-national-day-rally\" title=\"\">shot</a> a 21-year-old student in the chest, while across town, a middle-aged man arguing with protesters was set on fire. The government invoked the emergency regulations ordinance, awarding itself draconian powers. In November, universities were turned into fortified camps for protesters, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/we-couldnt-hesitate-escaping-hong-kongs-university-siege\" title=\"\">12-day siege</a>. Hundreds have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/fresh-unrest-in-hong-kong-after-44-protesters-charged-with-rioting\" title=\"\">charged</a> with the vaguely defined offence of rioting, which can carry a 10-year prison sentence, and more than 1,000 children have been arrested.</p> <p>If the protests were initially motivated by fear about Hong Kong\u2019s future, as they continued, a new sense of identity and community formed. It was evident in the flashmob performances of the new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/12/glory-to-hong-kong-pro-democracy-anthem-embraced-by-protesters\" title=\"\">anthem</a>\u201d, Glory to Hong Kong, held in the shopping malls that once seemed to epitomise the city\u2019s individualism and devotion to consumption. It was evident, too, in the networks that formed to provide mutual aid, from feeding activists to treating the injuries of protesters who were too afraid of arrest to go to hospital. (These networks would find new purpose when the coronavirus reached Hong Kong. While the government dithered, the people took action: tracking cases and warning of apparent hot spots; distributing masks to the poor and elderly.) </p> <p>The sheer inventiveness of protesters helped to maintain a movement that most expected to fizzle out within weeks. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/27/hong-kong-way-peaceful-protest\" title=\"\">Hong Kong Way</a>, a 30-mile human chain that stretched across the city in late August, revived the spirits of supporters. Other actions had a concrete effect. The landslide for pro-democracy candidates in November\u2019s local elections didn\u2019t just send a message to Beijing. District councillors are among the few allowed to vote for the chief executive \u2013 potentially giving pro-democrats a greater say in who replaces Lam. It was followed by a surge in the formation of pro-democracy trade unions. </p> <p>For Helen, a protester in her late 20s, the past year has redefined how she sees Hong Kong. \u201cWe valued economics over a lot of things before,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, you see that people care for freedom and rights over economics. We found out how much we loved this place.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While most protesters remained peaceful, a significant number started to adopt more extreme tactics, attacking Chinese state-owned businesses and companies seen to sympathise with the government. In a few cases, they assaulted locals sympathetic to Beijing. One man was killed by a stone thrown, seemingly by a protester, in a clash.</p> <p>Along the route of a march in September, someone had scrawled under a bus stop: \u201cToday Xinjiang, tomorrow Hong Kong.\u201d To outsiders, it might have seemed incredible to compare this still largely rural region of western China, which is kept under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">extraordinarily repressive</a> security, to this cosmopolitan global financial centre, still by far the freest part of China. Protesters saw Xinjiang as a warning: if they did not take a stand now, they would never be able to do so. People were fighting not to win, but because they knew what losing meant.</p> <p>Many young protesters speak of a willingness to die for the cause, writing wills and last messages for their families to find. \u201cThere is some part of me that has changed,\u201d says Niko Cheng, 22, a nursing student who volunteers as a medic. For months she has been prepared to be arrested, sacrificing her future. And at the height of the protests in the summer, she was ready to die if that would help to expose the brutality of the police. \u201cIf you have been to the frontline once, you feel that everyone surrounding you loves Hong Kong so much, and they are willing to do everything for it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of them have already given up their future to be here. After that, you can\u2019t go back to being a normal person again. You can\u2019t just watch,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cOne Nation, One Hong Kong\u201d graffiti left behind by protesters on a wall in Hong Kong - 24 May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti left after a protest in Hong Kong last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willie Siau/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though there is no doubt that protesters have been violent, there is widespread suspicion in the movement \u2013 rightly or not \u2013 that undercover officers have acted as agents provocateurs. There is also fury that no police have been held responsible for outrages. Before the protests, just 6% of the population said it had no trust in the police; now, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/11/09/surveys-show-majority-of-hong-kong-people-have-lost-trust-in-the-citys-police-force/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> report zero trust. The population is traumatised and exhausted. A study by the University of Hong Kong suggested that one in three adults <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/10/hong-kong-nearly-a-third-of-adults-report-ptsd-symptoms-study\" title=\"\">had symptoms</a> of post-traumatic stress disorder, comparable to rates in conflict zones. (This may underestimate the extent of the problem, since only those over 18 were surveyed, while many protesters are younger.) </p> <p>As support for the movement has intensified, so has opposition to it. A large chunk of the population, not only recent arrivals from the mainland, is equally passionate in rejecting the movement. Friends have fallen out. Parents have kicked out activist children. Helen, the protester whose view of Hong Kong has been transformed by the protests, hadn\u2019t spoken to her father for months, even though they live in the same small flat. He couldn\u2019t understand how irresponsible she was being. She couldn\u2019t understand how a man who had swum across the sea to escape Mao\u2019s China had become so loyal to Beijing.</p> <p>The rallying cry for Helen\u2019s generation has been \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d. Now some have become supportive of the idea of full independence from the mainland, even if they believe it unrealisable. As people gathered late last month to protest Beijing\u2019s announcement of the national security law, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anger-still-there-hong-kong-defiant-one-year-anniversary-first-protests-china\" title=\"\">chanted a slogan</a> rarely heard before: \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way out!\u201d</p> <p>Activism in Hong Kong was always constrained by the understanding of how little was possible. Margaret Ng, a veteran democratic activist and former legislator, describes Hong Kong\u2019s struggle with Beijing as \u201cDavid and Goliath, without the sling\u201d. But the political space has shrunk so far that, for some, the end result is not caution but nihilism. An ideology of self-destruction known as lam chao, or \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us\u201d, has gained momentum. More radical demonstrators believe the collapse of Hong Kong is the only way to really bring change. \u201cWe are not afraid. If the Chinese army comes out, we will celebrate. The entire Hong Kong business environment will collapse. If they call the military here, it would ruin Hong Kong and also mainland China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Yan, 26.</p> <p>\u201cI have hope, but my hope is that we take China down with us,\u201d Helen said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Beijing has abandoned any pretence of winning hearts and minds. With the prospect of pro-democracy candidates making inroads in this September\u2019s elections for the legislative council, and the international cover afforded by the coronavirus pandemic, repression by authorities has dramatically intensified. Now they are doing through fear what they failed to do through persuasion.</p> <p>In the months before the new national security law was announced, Beijing replaced its envoy in Hong Kong with an enforcer lacking experience of the region but known for his hardline tactics. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office described protesters as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/china-calls-hong-kong-protesters-a-political-virus\" title=\"\">political virus</a>\u201d that required elimination. In April, 15 of the region\u2019s best-known pro-democracy figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\" title=\"\">were arrested</a> on charges of illegal assembly. They included Margaret Ng, the media tycoon Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, a key vigil organiser \u2013 and Martin Lee, who had until now avoided the fate that Prince Charles had feared in 1997. \u201cI\u2019m relieved and very proud to finally be listed as a defendant after seeing so many brilliant young people arrested and charged,\u201d the 81-year-old told reporters.</p> <p>Even after these ominous moves, the news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/hong-kong-what-are-the-implications-of-china-sedition-laws-national-security-beijing\" title=\"\">national security law</a> was shattering. \u201cIf the extradition bill was a rifle aimed at our rights, the national security legislation is a machine gun,\u201d Lai wrote. Johannes Chan, the legal scholar, said: \u201cHistory tells us the law will soon apply to all kinds of political dissidents, then it will apply to media, NGOs, the lawyers and basically anyone who criticises the government.\u201d That is how the mainland\u2019s laws are used. The Nobel peace prize laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/13/liu-xiaobo-nobel-laureate-chinese-political-prisoner-dies-61\" title=\"\">Liu Xiaobo</a> died while serving an 11-year sentence for incitement to subvert state power. His crime was a call for democratic reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the announcement, downloads of VPNs soared, as did calls to immigration consultants. Some in Hong Kong always saw the movement as a last-ditch bid to stay in their home. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d one professional said when the anti-extradition bill first drove him to the streets in anger in July. But the spur for many protesters was the knowledge that they would not be able to do so. \u201cAcross classes, people in Hong Kong have completely lost trust in the PRC. They just give up hope entirely. If they cannot leave, what can they do? Many people are asking this question,\u201d says Ming Sing, an associate professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Authorities insist there is nothing to fear, claiming that the new law will only target \u201ca narrow set of acts\u201d, and that the vast majority of Hong Kong residents will not be affected. Yet Carrie Lam has refused to rule out the law being applied retrospectively, and her statements seem designed to induce rather than allay people\u2019s fears: \u201cWe are a very free society, so for the time being, people have the freedom to say whatever they want to say\u201d, she told reporters in May.</p> <p>Some Hong Kong residents are genuinely anxious to put the unrest behind them as the city plunges deeper into recession. But many are also under intense pressure to demonstrate support for Beijing. Victor Li, the son of the billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, said he hoped that the legislation would help the city\u2019s society and economy return to normal. The heads of five of the city\u2019s universities also endorsed the law, along with hundreds of celebrities and artists. State media claim that 2.93 million residents have signed a petition backing the law, though protesters believe this figure is wildly implausible.</p> <p>With the law yet to be drafted, Hong Kong\u2019s protesters hope international pressure could still have some impact on its final form, and how it is implemented and enforced. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even Beijing would have not preferred to exercise this nuclear option \u2026 we made Beijing pay the full price,\u201d the researcher and activist Lokman Tsui wrote in a Facebook post the morning after the announcement. \u201cTaiwan is watching. The United States is watching. Beijing is on notice, in front of the entire world. We have hope because we act. We take the hit, we get up and we live to fight another day.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing appears unfazed by US threats or international criticism. Even as the Chinese economy struggles to recover amid the pandemic, it no longer \u201cneeds\u201d Hong Kong as it once did. In 1997, Hong Kong\u2019s economy was equivalent to 20% of the mainland economy; now it is about 3%. Either Beijing has gambled that Trump won\u2019t follow through on threats to remove the region\u2019s special trade status, or \u2013 more likely \u2013 it has concluded that asserting its own power takes precedence. It, too, can take the hit.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Though the fear in Hong Kong is palpable, resistance has not yet disappeared. This year has seen a marked shift to what political scientist Edmund Cheng calls \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d, such as trade unionisation and the \u201cyellow-ribbon economy\u201d, supporting only local businesses that back the protests. This is what opposition might look like in the long-term.</p> <p>The Tiananmen commemoration, too, is evolving. Despite the ban, thousands of Hong Kong residents descended on Victoria Park. Others held vigils throughout each of the city\u2019s districts. \u201cYou can seal the park but you can\u2019t seal people\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Han Dongfang, a labour rights activist who led protests in Beijing in 1989.</p> <p>For many, this year\u2019s commemoration was no longer just about those who died in Beijing, but Hong Kong\u2019s struggle. The usual slogans calling for the CPC to reckon with the massacre were drowned out by chants of the protest movement, as well newer slogans calling for independence: \u201cOne-nation Hong Kong\u201d. The crowd included the older generation and young activists, who now see the events of 1989 as a warning.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something now, maybe someday Hong Kong will become like June 4,\u201d said Zack Ho, 18, who attended a vigil near his home before rushing to join the main one in Victoria Park. \u201cWe saw how the tanks rode over students. That\u2019s the real picture of how evil the Chinese regime is. We have to remind Hong Kongers that maybe that\u2019s the future of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>The massacre, and the vigils to commemorate it, planted the seeds for today\u2019s Hong Kong: the understanding of what is at stake, and the sacrifices that may be required to defend it. The CPC drew its own lessons from the events of that year \u2013 not just Tiananmen, but the collapse of the Soviet Union. It learned to avoid a bloody crackdown if you can help it \u2013 the costs are too high \u2013 but also to avoid concessions, and to hold on to political power at all costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/chinas-memory-manipulators\">China\u2019s memory manipulators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will Hong Kong ever see another mass commemoration of 1989? \u201cI think it will be one of the things that they really want to get rid of,\u201d said Leung. \u201cIt is totally peaceful. We hold candles. We do nothing but mourn, and be the guardians of the truth. But the idea is so threatening to the Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>It echoed her earlier remark that Hong Kongers knew, even when they didn\u2019t care: not just about 1989, but about all the events that had followed in its wake \u2013 as mainlanders could not. The vigil stood not only for the city\u2019s freedoms of assembly and expression, but also of information.

  "<p>\u2018What are you most looking forward to about going home?\u201d Andrew Burnham, a Covid-19 patient at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/photograph-hospital-icu-covid-19-nhs-coventry\">University </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/photograph-hospital-icu-covid-19-nhs-coventry\">hospital in Coventry</a>, is asked. \u201cJust getting out of the hospital,\u201d the 65-year-old says abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not that bad are we?\u201d quips one of the nearby nurses.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just going stir crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my family for 10 weeks. It\u2019s going to be quite incredible. I don\u2019t know if I can give them a big hug straight away \u2013 I might have to keep 2 metres away. But if I can, oh I will.\u201d</p> <p>Burnham spent six of the past 10 weeks in intensive care and has required extensive physiotherapy to rehabilitate his body. Today, he\u2019s finally going home.</p> <p>Dr Vjeran Cajic, a consultant in infectious diseases, says: \u201cThe success rate of patients treated in ITU [intensive care] for Covid is not more than 50%. Without support for his breathing, Mr Burnham would definitely have died. But we\u2019re not surprised [he\u2019s going home]. As doctors, we provide treatment when we feel there\u2019s a chance we will be successful, so any good outcome is a reason to be happy, not surprised.\u201d</p> <p>Though visibly drained and still short of breath, Burnham is thankful to the NHS. \u201cI appreciate an awful lot of people put an awful lot of effort into keeping us going,\u201d he says. As he is wheeled out of the ward by an ambulance crew, the corridor is lined with well-wishers: the people who saved his life are clapping him out.</p> <h2>Reunited</h2> <p>____________________</p> <p>Since the start of the pandemic, 537 patients have been discharged from University hospital, which is part of the UHCW trust, and the hospital now has only six patients with Covid-19; to date, 248 patients have died from, or with, coronavirus. </p> <p>Molly Phillis, 84, and her husband, John, 83, were discharged from University hospital last month. The couple, who have been together for 63 years, were admitted days apart and kept on separate wards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"47a269540f5afa4ce34aefb26a27b833d2fac4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47a269540f5afa4ce34aefb26a27b833d2fac4bf/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John and Molly Phillis, who both treated in hospital for Covid-19.

Then I went downhill and called an ambulance for myself.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t see each other for 17 days. I was only about 90ft away from her in the neighbouring ward but we couldn\u2019t even shout or write a note to one another because of the risk of contamination. I didn\u2019t know what was happening to Molly, it was awful.\u201d</p> <p>Early on, Molly was asked to consider what kind of end-of-life care she might prefer. She declined the doctor\u2019s proposals for resuscitation. Luckily, she made a full recovery and Molly and John are now back at home together.</p> <p>\u201cIf you get taken into a ward and you\u2019ve got pneumonia, the staff know exactly how to treat you; if you go in with a broken leg, they can fix it,\u201d says John. \u201cBut with this, all they can do is make you comfortable. They are in the dark as much as we are. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to admire them so much. They were absolutely brilliant.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Molly came home, life changed. We still had to isolate in our apartment for another 14 days but it didn\u2019t matter. We could talk, we could hold each other, we felt better immediately when we saw each other.\u201d</p> <h2>Gratitude</h2> <p>____________________</p> <p>Dawn Annette Baker, 52, was in the same ward as Molly. While delighted to be home, she is still living with the legacy of the infection.</p> <p>\u201cAfter two weeks in hospital, most of my muscle mass had gone, so my daughter had to help me get into the shower because I was too shaky. Even just making a cup of coffee was difficult,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m left with damage because I get out of breath constantly and my asthma is really bad now, whereas it was totally under control beforehand. My peak flow is lower than it should be, but I have to manage that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cceca82b59a08f15858a8e9f5261591e82d04b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cceca82b59a08f15858a8e9f5261591e82d04b5/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Annette Baker, who spent two weeks in hospital with Covid-19.

I started thinking to myself: have I seen my kids for the last time? I haven\u2019t been able to say what I needed to say.\u201d</p> <p>After two weeks in hospital, she surprised her children when she returned home on 8 April. She later had a second bout of coronavirus-like symptoms, but opted to self-isolate instead of returning to the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cMy kids are my world. We\u2019re such a close knit family. I\u2019ve never gone two weeks without seeing them before. [This experience has taught me] to not take anything for granted. If I could go back [to the hospital] and help, I\u2019d do it tomorrow, just to take a little bit of pressure away from the staff.\u201d</p> <h2>Losing a loved one</h2> <p>____________________</p> <p>Not everyone is fortunate enough to be reunited with their family. Even in their final hours, patients with Covid-19 must be strictly isolated from loved ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06e5684d2f6634e492ef889dc3d1c839de63e4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06e5684d2f6634e492ef889dc3d1c839de63e4ff/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Erica Young, whose mother Vicky Cornwell died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erica Young, whose mother Vicky Cornwell died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Erica Young, whose mother Vicky Cornwell died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19.

She was a fantastic woman.'</p> <footer> <cite>Erica Young on her mother</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Erica Young\u2019s mother, Vicky Cornwell, contracted Covid-19 in her care home and died in hospital. The experience was heartbreaking for Young, but she says she is grateful that her mother was so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nhs-frontline-meet-people-risking-lives-tackle-coronavirus\">tenderly cared for by everyone in the NHS</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Mum was moved to hospital there was no opportunity to speak; it was a case of asking whoever answered the phone how she was, passing on my love and the love of the family, but there was no more that that could be done,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was heartbreaking to be allowed to see her only when she was dead and not when she was still alive, when she would have known I was there.\u201d</p> <p>When Young visited her mother\u2019s body, she had to wear full PPE (personal protective equipment). \u201cI was still thinking they had rung the wrong daughter, that somebody else\u2019s mum had died, not mine. But it was mine.</p> <p>\u201cI said to them, \u2018What can I and can\u2019t I do when I go in?\u2019 They said, \u2018You can hold her hand but you can\u2019t kiss her.\u2019 So I had a chat and I held her hand. I\u2019m glad I saw her \u2013 it gave me a chance to say goodbye.\u201d</p> <p>Only six mourners could attend the funeral because of local lockdown restrictions.</p> <h2>Standing in the gap</h2> <p>____________________</p> <p>And yet, even amid the sadness of her family\u2019s loss, Young sees reasons to be positive. In particular, she was reassured by the knowledge that hospital chaplains were visiting Cornwell in hospital. \u201cThey made an awful situation more bearable,\u201d Young says. \u201cMy family owe them a huge debt.\u201d</p> <p>Having granted permission for a BBC camera crew to film one such conversation, the family were able to watch footage of Cornwell discussing her life and role as a lay preacher. Young says: \u201cI could see that it was Mum, even though they had blurred out her face, and you could see she was nodding and she was engaged. That was really, really reassuring and comforting because it was probably the last significant conversation of her life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3466b58e87b6f5e39cd387d35ea4a42c25e8ed69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3466b58e87b6f5e39cd387d35ea4a42c25e8ed69/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Rev Simon Betteridge, who offers comfort and guidance to patients and staff at the hospital.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rev Simon Betteridge, who offers comfort and guidance to patients and staff at the hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Rev Simon Betteridge, who offers comfort and guidance to patients and staff at the hospital.</p></li> </ul> <p>Rev Simon Betteridge, the chaplain who counselled Cornwell that day, says: \u201cThere is a privilege in people accepting you within their story for a short time, and you providing them with a degree of firm ground. We don\u2019t necessarily come up with any clever words or prayers or anything. It\u2019s about listening, really.

Through the UHCW charity, University hospital has sourced dozens of iPads, which are being used for patient-to-family video calls.</p> <p>Heather Healey, a \u201cquery Covid\u201d patient, was able to call her 13-year-old son, James, from her bed. \u201cWhen you interact online and you can see somebody\u2019s face, you can see the love in their eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cI could see his and he could see mine as well.

Over the last week we have admitted two patients with Covid-19.

A box of food and things like that.</p> <p>\u201cSome people will come back to say thank you in person but most people don\u2019t actually remember being in ITU.

Yet annexation had continued into the modern era. Indonesia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/30/east-timor-indonesias-invasion-and-the-long-road-to-independence\">annexed East Timor</a> in 1975, Iraq briefly annexed Kuwait in 1990, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Israel, too, has joined the club. In 1980, it annexed majority Palestinian East Jerusalem, and a year later, it annexed the Golan Heights, captured from Syria.</p> <p>In short, annexation is when a country declares that a piece of land outside its borders is part of the state. Often this is done after military occupation and whether the people living there want it or not. International law is <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24716&amp;LangID=E\">fairly clear</a> about annexation \u2013 it is illegal.</p> <h2>What precisely does Israel want to annex?</h2> <p>Netanyahu has made repeated promises during the past year to annex, or \u201capply sovereignty\u201d, to different areas of the West Bank, a chunk of land Israel captured from Jordan in 1967.</p> <p>In April last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/netanyahu-vows-to-annexe-jewish-settlements-in-occupied-west-bank\">Netanyahu said he planned to annex Jewish settlements</a>, outposts in the West Bank where hundreds of thousands of Israelis live, to global condemnation. In September, the Israeli leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/netanyahu-vows-annex-large-parts-occupied-west-bank-trump\">added he would also annex the Jordan Valley</a>, which makes up to one-third of the West Bank and borders Jordan.</p> <h2>Doesn\u2019t Israel already control that land?</h2> <p>Yes. Israel has run a military occupation for more than half a century that has created a situation in which <a href=\"https://www.nad.ps/en/media-room/press-releases/dr-saeb-erekat-ongoing-israeli-settlement-announcements-occupied-palestine\">Palestinian officials say</a> there is already de facto annexation.</p> <p>The country has deepened its grip over the land, squeezing many of the roughly 2.5 million West Bank Palestinians into urban enclaves.

  "<p>History will remember parts of Covid-19 Australia fondly, I suspect. Like the way public policy decisions were stripped free of ideological bias and policy that actually worked for the good of all was quickly implemented. Like free childcare. Nothing signals to Australians that we have \u201csnapped back\u201d to the old ways more than the Morrison government\u2019s public holiday announcement that free childcare is to be dumped come 13 July.&nbsp;</p> <p>So coated in ideology is everything to do with childcare funding that we have returned to a funding system that even the education minister, Dan Tehan, describes as \u201cquite complex\u201d. And yet it\u2019s this system that is now back, with a few new little extra twists and turns to complicate it even further.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/australian-government-to-end-free-childcare-on-12-july-in-move-labor-says-will-snap-families\">Australian government to end free childcare on 12 July in move Labor says 'will snap families'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parents will have to pay fees, but in order to have some control over what happens, the government has given services an additional subsidy. Receipt of this funding enables the government to make some demands on childcare services, such as not increasing their fees until September, and giving up jobkeeper for their employees. The existing childcare system comes with a complex activity test that metes out childcare hours based on the number of hours a parent works. In what\u2019s called a relaxing of that test (not an abolition as many had counselled should be done), families will now be able to have 100 hours of subsidised care a fortnight even if they have lost work because of Covid, but only if they can prove they really looked (for at least four hours&nbsp;a fortnight) for new work. Confused? Yes, the snap back is as confusing as the initial system was, and almost as confusing as the free childcare system was.</p> <p>But it\u2019s confusing not because organising for children to get access to early education and care while their parents work is inherently complicated, but because the government has a set of beliefs surrounding education and care. They are not beliefs grounded in the value of it to children, or families for that matter. Let\u2019s look at who the decision to go back to charging for childcare will hurt the most and it\u2019s easy to see the ideology these beliefs are coated in.</p> <p>Going back to paying for childcare will hurt women. The announcement isn\u2019t just that childcare is no longer free \u2013 it is also that the first group of employees to have the jobkeeper tap turned off in Australia will be childcare educators. A group that is 97% female and already among the lowest paid workers in Australia. Apparently Australia is a country that gives subsidies to male tradies to fix up houses for those rich enough to afford them but takes subsidies away from those who don\u2019t earn enough to even dream of home ownership.</p> <p>It will also hurt mothers. No matter how much people would like to consider childcare as something required by both parents, we know that it is almost always the woman who drops her job to look after children when childcare becomes unaffordable, because the reality is that women earn less in Australia than men do. When heterosexual families need to work out which job should go, it often makes more financial sense for it to be the mother\u2019s.&nbsp;And guess what? You can\u2019t get a job if you haven\u2019t organised childcare first. You can\u2019t organise childcare if you don\u2019t have the money to pay for it. Women can\u2019t change that basic equation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/snapping-back-to-the-childcare-subsidy-method-is-nuts-it-should-not-be-a-system-that-profits\">Snapping back to the childcare subsidy method is nuts.

They are about to discover that childcare in Australia is little more under a conservative government than a reward for being a productive member of the economy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Children are clearly the absolute losers. While the government can pretend childcare and early education are two separate things, they are not. Going back to a system that makes a child\u2019s early education dependent on its family capacity to pay for it, will mean children, especially the ones who need it most, will invariably miss out.&nbsp;</p> <p>So these are bad decisions for women and children. These decisions reflect the government\u2019s ideology about lifters and leaners, and about women and their value. Is it any wonder that the government makes decisions like this? After all, almost 80% of this government\u2019s representatives (House of Representatives) are men. We voted for a party that doesn\u2019t seem to believe women are good enough to represent an electorate. We get policies that don\u2019t represent women.&nbsp;</p> <p>Childcare?

The plan would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct when officers violate a citizen\u2019s civil rights, limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments and put pressure on the justice department to address racial profiling and systemic racial bias in policing.</p> <p>Though the legislation has galvanized Democrats, it remains unclear if congressional Republicans will join the effort, particularly in the Senate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing outlandish calls, defund the police. Abolish the police,\u201d McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that did not address the Democrats\u2019 proposal. \u201cI think you may want a police officer to arrest a criminal before you try to work through his feelings.\u201d</p>"
