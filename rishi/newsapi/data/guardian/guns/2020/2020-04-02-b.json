That might seem too obvious to need stating, but in this time of crisis some of Australia\u2019s leaders have ignored it.</p> <p>It is parliament that scrutinises and evaluates the actions of the executive government, holding the government to account and protecting the liberties of citizens.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the second world war, not only did parliament continue to sit but the contest of parliamentary democracy remained vigorous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout the history of the commonwealth, parliament continued to sit, no matter what crisis confronted the nation \u2013 whether war, natural disaster, or social and economic calamity.</p> <p>At the peak of the Spanish influenza pandemic, in 1920, the House of Representatives sat for 114 days and the Senate for 76. That is more for either chamber than during each of the last three years of world war one, from 1916-18.</p> <p>During the second world war, not only did parliament continue to sit but the contest of parliamentary democracy remained vigorous.</p> <p>The prime minister lost the confidence of the House of Representatives, resulting in a change of government that was later confirmed in a general election. All this happened without any weakening of the war effort.</p> <p>Labor, under John Curtin, declined when in opposition to take part in a national unity government, and instead participated in an advisory War Council. When Curtin was prime minister, his political opponents did the same.</p> <p>Parliament has never ceased to function until this year, when the Morrison government cancelled the scheduled May and June sittings.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic poses challenges that the commonwealth has never had to face before, but they do not remove the need for parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>In times such as these, it is the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community who are most reliant on having parliamentary representatives to defend their civil and industrial rights.</p> <p>Then there is the question of the inevitable restructuring of the economy as the pandemic subsides. That must not happen with Australia governed as if it were a one-party state.</p> <p>The response to the crisis has now extended to an unprecedented curtailment of civil liberties, including restrictions on movement and gatherings, enforced detention, and the electronic tracking of individuals.</p> <p>In the present circumstances these measures are justified. But for how long should they be imposed? Who will decide if and when they should lifted, and in what circumstances? Peter Dutton, perhaps?</p> <p>The actions of ministers should be debated and judged according to democratic process, but it is extremely difficult to do so when parliament is not sitting and regulation becomes the means for implementing government policy.</p> <p>The regulations imposed under s.477 of the Biosecurity Act, for example, are what academic lawyers call \u201cHenry VIII\u201d measures, ie they prevail over other existing laws and impose criminal sanctions on those who do not comply.</p> <p>They are not subject to review by the Senate\u2019s scrutiny of delegated legislation committee, and even if parliament were sitting, they could not be disallowed because the governor-general has declared a state of emergency. This lasts for three months but may be extended.</p> <p>That is how authoritarian governments rule.</p> <p>There is a strong bipartisan feeling on the scrutiny of delegated legislation committee, of which I am deputy chair, that the committee must continue full scrutiny of all government by regulation \u2013 ie by executive-made laws \u2013 during an extended suspension of parliament.</p> <p>Even before the spread of Covid-19, there was evidence of declining public trust in our institutions of governance.</p> <p>If democracy is allowed to wither through this extended suspension of parliament, reactionary, far-right nationalists will more easily manipulate the fears and anxieties that are rife in times of crisis</p> <p>The worst response to such manipulation would be for parliament to remain suspended, with the government not being held openly to account.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/have-you-had-coronavirus-experiences-with-the-police-on-social-distancing-measures-in-australia\">Have you encountered police enforcing Australia\u2019s coronavirus social distancing laws?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are no technical obstacles to holding sittings of parliament in these circumstances.</p> <p>As Prof Anne Twomey of the University of New South Wales has argued, the constitutional requirement for parliament to sit \u201cin the seat of government\u201d, ie in Canberra, could be accommodated by having only minimum key personnel physically in the chambers, such as the presiding officers and a minister.

  "<p> The National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned there could be a rise in online child sexual abuse offences during the Covid-19 pandemic as it reveals its most recent intelligence shows there are at least 300,000 people in the UK who pose a sexual threat to children.</p> <p>The figure, which comes from intelligence pre-dating the coronavirus outbreak, reflects a new assessment of the threat and is far higher than previous estimates. The NCA believes there are a minimum 300,000 individuals in the UK posing a sexual threat to children, either through physical contact abuse or online.</p> <p>NCA investigators have also found that is possible to access child sexual abuse content on the open web in just three clicks.</p> <p>The figure is from the NCA\u2019s latest national strategic assessment, which will be published online on Friday, and comes amid warnings from charities and law enforcement agencies over heightened risks during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The NCA revealed offenders are already discussing opportunities over online chat forums to abuse children during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for child protection, Simon Bailey, chief constable of Norfolk police, said: \u201cIt is sickening to think that some criminals are looking to exploit the coronavirus crisis to cause harm online.

While there has been decreased reporting from professionals, such as teachers and social workers, the level of reports from children has remained stable.</p> <p>A host of educational products aimed at children of all ages, parents, carers and teachers will be issued through the agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/\">Thinkuknow website</a> and social media channels.</p> <p>Rob Jones, the NCA director of threat leadership, said: \u201cPreventing offences occurring is always crucial and now more so than ever when there is masses of online traffic and a possible elevated threat to children.</p> <p>\u201cWe are redoubling our efforts to promote our online safety messages to children, parents, carers and teachers and are working with partners to keep children safe.\u201d</p> <p>The NCA and UK policing arrest more than 500 child sex offenders and safeguard about 700 children each month.</p> <p>The NCA warning comes as new research showed that residential schools for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) recorded nearly 10 times the number of safeguarding concerns of a sexual nature than other residential schools.</p> <p>The study by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) is based on in-depth research at a small sample of mainstream residential schools, including private schools and state boarding schools, as well as Send residential schools for students.</p> <p>It found that online and peer-on-peer abuse were the most common safeguarding concerns of a sexual nature, and highlighted the challenge of managing children\u2019s online safety and peer relationships within the context of round-the-clock care.</p> <p>\u201cAlongside more serious reports of sexual violence and assault,\u201d the report said, \u201csome mainstream schools also recorded, for example, sexting and a range of peer-on-peer concerns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/02/children-safe-social-workers-fears-lockdown-coronavirus\">'I can't know the children are safe': social workers' fears over lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt seems unlikely that these issues were not also happening in other schools; rather, they were not being recorded in safeguarding logs, but perhaps elsewhere in behavioural logs.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, in special schools, some concerns with a sexual element seemed to relate to young people experiencing or exploring their bodies with no intent to harm.\u201d</p> <p>Nancy Kelley, deputy chief executive of the National Centre for Social Research which produced the report on behalf of IICSA, said: \u201cThis research uncovers the unique challenges involved in safeguarding children in residential schools. Managing relationships between pupils, overseeing children\u2019s online activity, and communicating with local authorities are all key areas of concern for these schools.\u201d</p> <p>IICSA was set up in 2015 because of serious concerns that some organisations had failed and were continuing to fail to protect children from sexual abuse.

The masks will be sent to each of Japan\u2019s more than 50 million households starting the week after next, first to areas seeing a spike in cases.</p> \n   <p>\u201cYou can use soap to wash and re-use them, so this should be a good response to the sudden, huge demand for masks,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>The leader of the opposition Democratic Party for the People, Yuichiro Tamaki, this week called on Abe to declare a state of emergency, while the Japan Medical Association pointed to a crisis at hospitals in some regions, where beds for virus patients are full and doctors and nurses are getting infected.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAbe has always been \u2018economy first\u2019,\u201d said Jesper Koll, CEO of fund manager WisdomTree Japan. \u201cIf you declare an emergency, it is definitely the end of \u2018Abenomics\u2019, the end of \u2018economy first\u2019.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Twitter users were scathing, with Abe and mask references trending on Thursday. \u201cIs the Japanese government for real? This is a total waste of tax money,\u201d wrote a user with the handle Usube.<br></p> \n   <p>It\u2019s not the first time Abe has faced criticism for his coronavirus strategies.</p> \n   <p>Some have said his initial response to the virus outbreak was sluggish, with charges from critics that he played down the threat in the hope that Tokyo could go ahead and host the now-postponed Summer Olympics this year. Abe denied the claims.</p> \n   <p>Critics say he should act now on a state of emergency, fearing a surge in infections after crowds gathered in some places to attend traditional cherry blossom viewing parties last month, despite calls to stay home. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, was blasted after pictures emerged of her at one such event, but Abe defended her, saying it was a private gathering at a restaurant.</p> \n   <p>Though small compared with outbreaks in the United States, Europe and China, coronavirus infections are on the rise in Japan - with more than 2,500 confirmed cases as of Thursday morning and 71 deaths, according to NHK public broadcaster. A record of more than 90 new cases appeared in Tokyo alone, its biggest one-day increase, Kyodo news agency said.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a05f1379b37de7f49a242ef74cffad8cc18acc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a05f1379b37de7f49a242ef74cffad8cc18acc/0_0_4433_3077/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A businessman wearing a protective mask walks at Shinjuku in Tokyo, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A businessman wearing a protective mask walks at Shinjuku in Tokyo, Japan.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T10:15:05.226Z\">at 11.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8598678f087564da1e43e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T07:48:00.242Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In a worrying sign, a refugee camp in Greece has been placed under quarantine after 20 of its in-place residents were diagnosed with coronavirus, reports Helena Smith in Athens. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Officials began testing people in the facility after a woman from the camp was discovered to have contracted the virus after giving birth in an Athens hospital this week. </p> \n   <p>Those who tested positive were among a group of 63 traced through the woman although officials none were displaying symptoms of the novel virus, the migration ministry said.

Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another\u2019s space; suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering.

The government has bought options on up to 17.5m antibody tests of different types that are currently being tested, but cannot say definitively when they will be safe to use.</p> \n<p>When the antibody tests are available, Hancock said, the government was looking at the possibility of issuing immunity certificates, so that some of the population \u201ccan get back to work as much as possible\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, some critics fear that this could lead to resentment in the population who have not had the virus, and that people might even deliberately try to get infected in order to obtain an immunity certificate.</p> \n<p>Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian that immunity certificates for frontline medical workers would be crucial for allowing staff to return to work and allowing personal protective equipment to be rationed in the safest way.</p> \n<p>However, in the wider population, fraud could be an issue, which could rule out home-based testing, and there were concerns about unintended consequences. \u201cPeople going out to deliberately get infected so they could get back to work is a concern and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d avoid that,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are big issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>After a week spent in isolation with coronavirus himself, Hancock was forced to defend the government on numerous fronts. He told the press briefing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Johnson\u2019s ultimate target of 250,000 tests a day \u2013 first made on March 18 - was still valid.</p></li> \n <li><p>Premiership footballers should take a pay cut in solidarity with NHS workers who are putting their lives on the line.</p></li> \n <li><p>Shortages of swabs had been rectified, but the UK was \u201cstill tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>The UK was having to build its capacity from a \u201clower base\u201d than the likes of Germany, which is testing around 70,000 people per day.</p></li> \n <li><p>More commercial laboratories, including universities and private businesses, would be used to accelerate testing after criticism that this \u201cDunkirk\u201d approach had initially been ignored.</p></li> \n <li><p>The NHS will have \u00a313.4bn of debt written off, as previously confirmed.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Tensions have bubbled in Whitehall over who is to blame for low testing numbers in the UK, with some political sources blaming Public Health England (PHE) for not placing enough emphasis on the issue in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>However, PHE rejected criticism that it had been trying to do all the testing itself and was too inflexible in which chemicals were allowed to be used, suggesting that it was the responsibility of ministers to find private capacity for more tests.</p> \n<p>Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director of the public health body, said PHE\u2019s role was to \u201cmake sure our labs are doing what they need to do\u201d in terms of testing hospital patients with a clinical need, with NHS staff a second priority.</p> \n<p>Conservative backbenchers voiced concern in private about the government\u2019s failure to roll out testing faster, saying there was anxiety that the public mood could turn against the government if it appeared there was no end to the lockdown as a result.</p> \n<p>A former supporter Johnson in the leadership contest said they were worried sentiment could turn rapidly: \u201cI think the government could get blown away if people are still inside after Easter and there is no progress on testing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Concerns were voiced that Johnson and other ministers had appeared to allow PHE to lead on testing, without asking the independent researchers and the private sector to get involved until Hancock\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s not mass testing now is inexcusable,\u201d another Conservative MP complained.</p> \n<p>One senior MP said the party would be watching the polls closely and that he was \u201cfrankly amazed\u201d that Johnson\u2019s popularity was holding up. A bit like the virus, there might be a two-week lag before the public comes to fully realise that the government is failing to get the testing issue under control, they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are some in my party who are trying to blame PHE, but ultimately, it will be the politicians who get the blame if the economy collapses because we can\u2019t test NHS workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe death toll will become totemic. If we get thousands of people dying every day for several days, who knows where this will go. It is frightening, and the prime minister looks like he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the outgoing Labour leader, said: \u201cThe fact that we are not yet even testing 10,000 people a day is very, very serious indeed. There are almost half a million [frontline] people working in the NHS and the care sector. Even they have not yet been tested. It is ludicrous. We have got to get on top of testing.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Anthony Costello, former WHO director and professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London</strong></h2> <p>On virus testing, it is good that they are solving the swabs and reagents issues. It\u2019s good that they are galvanising the scientific community to help and it\u2019s good that they are setting a target for 25,000 tests [antigen tests that show if people have the virus] per day by the end of April [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">Hancock aspires to reach 100,000 a </a>day in England for all types of tests, including antibody tests] that will hopefully help to cover health workers and patients.</p> <p>If the blood tests for immunity come online, that will be a very valuable tool for looking at the scale of immunity in the population, as will their surveillance plan from Porton Down, to look at the rates of infection and spread in a sample survey. Whether or not the immunity blood tests will be sufficiently specific for Covid-19 is a big issue, because if they give out false positives, it will be dangerous for people believing themselves to be immune to go back into the front line and infect patients.</p> <p>Nonetheless, none of these strategies address the fundamental problem of stopping the spread of the virus.</p> <h2><strong>Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh</strong></h2> <p>Under normal circumstances, Public Health England (PHE) (and Health Protection Scotland) have extremely strict testing protocols, all validated to the highest certification standards. This has many benefits: providing robust results in which clinicians have complete faith, aligning to standard criteria that allow national and international comparison, and regular revalidation of individual laboratories. On a normal day this works. It is clinically robust and allows the NHS to benefit by bulk-ordering reagents from a single supplier at a competitive price.</p> <p>But these are not normal times. There is an urgent need to scale up testing. This might require that we adapt protocols to use whichever reagents and equipment are available. Research labs, which tend to operate in a less regimented manner, have the skills, equipment and (quite possibly) sufficient reagents to contribute to this effort. They won\u2019t be exactly the same items that PHE use, but they will work just as well.</p> <p>Crucially, almost all academic research that is not related to Covid-19 has been put on hold; the labs have been mothballed and the staff sent home. This represents a tremendous available resource for outsourcing and scaling up the testing. The academic community has the skills, resources and willingness to contribute if only someone would take the sensible, pragmatic decision to cede a little control. There is a glimmer of hope in Matt Hancock\u2019s \u201c5 pillar programme\u201d presented at the press briefing today, but still precious little detail.</p> <h2><strong>Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton</strong></h2> <p>It is good to finally hear the explanation from the minister of health about the difficulties in scaling up testing. This is down to a lack of preparedness in advance of a pandemic, which then impacts upon the ability to greatly and rapidly increase a national response, as we have seen in Germany. These are issues also being faced in other countries \u2013 for example, France has carried out fewer tests than the UK.</p> <p>The minister has promised 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. We shall see if this level is delivered. But throughout the coming weeks, we need to remember the lessons learned and realise that spare capacity in a health service or public health infrastructure is not \u201ca waste of money\u201d. It\u2019s vital in times of urgent need, and there will be a \u201cnext time\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Mark Harris, professor of virology at the University of Leeds</strong></h2> <p>[Hancock\u2019s five pillars] seems like the right approach. I am a little bit concerned about the timescale, that we are having to wait to the end of April [for high levels of testing]. We would hope that within the next few weeks we would start to see some effects of the social distancing and the lockdown, so it would be nicer if we could be testing quicker than that. But I understand what [Hancock] said about the fact that we didn\u2019t have a big diagnostic industry, unlike some other countries, so we are having to build up from scratch \u2013 I think that is quite honest and open of him.</p> <p>[Population sampling] is an excellent way forward. The challenge will be: what population do you sample? Also, what is the statistical analysis will you apply to the data you get from that? If you went into London, you\u2019d probably find there is a much higher proportion [of infection] than other parts of the country \u2013 maybe that is information that we need to know.</p> <p>I think we can always be critical of what has happened in the past, but I don\u2019t think that is appropriate at this stage. This is a crisis and we are where we are. We need to try to make sure that going forward we are doing the right things; the time for recrimination and looking back and learning the lessons will be in the future. For now I think [Hancock] is doing everything he can. Let\u2019s hope those words that were spoken today are actually translated into actions over the coming few days.</p> <h2><strong>Charlie Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, who is setting up a testing lab in the Francis Crick Institute</strong></h2> <p>It all sounds very sensible. Testing is absolutely essential to get healthcare workers back to the front line, when they don\u2019t present a risk to those around them and to patients. With a significant proportion of the workforce off right now with presumed coronavirus infection, having tests will be vital to frontline services already stretched because of the crisis.</p> <p>The sensible thing would be to staff coronavirus units with doctors and nurses who have had exposure to coronavirus, and that\u2019s why the antibody test is so important.</p> <p>We\u2019re obviously delighted to be playing a part. We will make a small but significant contribution, we hope. It is going to require collaboration on a national scale. We will be sharing our operating procedures, our assays [investigative procedures] and the development of those assays with other labs upon request very happily and providing training to get people up and running relatively quickly.</p> <p>On building a new British diagnostic industry, this pandemic has exposed the extreme vulnerability of every country. We are so dependent on a globalised diagnostic and clinical network. When the barriers come down and our supply lines fail, it is clear very rapidly how vulnerable we are. We need some way of being able to secure our pipelines to access vital diagnostic reagents and kits and if we can\u2019t, we need some way of manufacturing them ourselves from scratch very quickly.</p> <p>All of this is possible because the technology is not complex. Finding approaches to rapidly validate and qualify a diagnostic test for clinical use is challenging, but solvable with the right networks of collaborators and established diagnostic labs.</p>",

  "<p>Europe is in the eye of the global storm over Covid-19. Four of the six countries with the most confirmed cases are <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" title=\"\">in our continent</a>. The three with the most reported deaths are all in Europe too. Yet the European Union has often felt like a second-rank player, and some of its most important <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-europe-shock-tools-to-recover\" title=\"\">common principles</a> are being scattered to the winds. When <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_seven_early_lessons_from_the_coronavirus\" title=\"\">the pandemic</a> struck, it was nation states that stepped up, not the EU. Faced with a foe that ignores boundaries, the states of Europe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html\" title=\"\">closed their borders</a>. All focused on their own citizens. Citizens have reciprocated, looking overwhelmingly towards their own governments. Most have followed their governments\u2019 advice, not that of the EU. National leaders\u2019 public ratings have risen in many countries. In Europe\u2019s shared adversity, Europeans have become nation-statists once more.</p> <p>To a degree, this picture is misleading. It was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-prevention-excl-idUSKBN21J6FF\" title=\"\">the nation states</a> themselves that told the EU they had enough resources to combat the virus when it hit Europe. But the nation states were badly wrong; Britain has proved to be just the same. In January, the EU asked member states for details of the masks, tests and other supplies they might need, so that a common procurement plan could be initiated. Only four countries said they might have problems. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\" title=\"\">Britain</a> stood aside for ideological reasons too. The EU\u2019s subsequent \u201cthings under control\u201d assessment was therefore wrong, because the states were wrong too. It is also true that several EU states have been cooperating vigorously. Germany, Austria and Luxembourg have opened their hospitals to Covid-19 victims from France, Spain and elsewhere. France and Germany have now donated more masks to Italy than were provided in the more widely publicised aid from Russia and China, but without the latter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/china/news/serbia-sets-the-stage-for-beijings-mask-diplomacy/1450727/\" title=\"\">political dividend</a>.</p> <p>Nevertheless, by mid-March, as the EU closed its collective external border to the outside world, the union\u2019s common travel area collapsed, as a cascade of member states closed their national borders within Europe. Solidarity was again in short supply when the president of the European Central Bank, <a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/03/12/1584027114000/A-dangerous-slip-up-from-Lagarde/\" title=\"\">Christine Lagarde</a>, fed the nation state mentality further by saying it was not the ECB\u2019s job to be each EU member state\u2019s borrower of last resort (she later retracted the comment). When France and eight other EU members demanded the setting up of a Europe-wide \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/nine-eu-countries-say-its-time-for-corona-bonds-as-virus-deaths-rise.html\" title=\"\">corona bond</a>\u201d debt instrument to help the worst-hit nations, a north-south divide deepened. Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/solidarity-members-eurozone-coronavirus-dutch-coronabond\" title=\"\">said no</a>. Relations between Portugal and the Netherlands were stormy. Solidarity, in the eyes of Europe\u2019s \u201cfrugal four\u201d, now equates with moral hazard.</p> <p>When France and Germany, so often the driving force of an effective EU, pull in opposing directions, a faltering EU follows close behind. It feels significant that, when Italians go on their balconies to support their health workers, they sing Italy\u2019s national anthem, not the EU\u2019s Ode to Joy. Nor should it be any surprise that Europe\u2019s most celebrated integrationist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-could-be-final-straw-for-eu-european-experts-warn\" title=\"\">Jacques Delors</a>, emerged from retirement in March to warn that the retreat from solidarity posed \u201ca mortal danger to the European Union\u201d. Mr Delors is right about that. Europe\u2019s centrifugal forces are becoming more powerful in the pandemic \u2013 and, for once, Brexit is not chiefly to blame. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-contaminating-europe-democracy-viktor-orban-seize-more-power\" title=\"\">Hungary\u2019s</a> latest authoritarian shift is an act of contempt towards the EU\u2019s core principle that it is a union of democracies. <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/insights/trouble-eu-brewing-coronavirus-hit-italy\" title=\"\">Italy\u2019s</a> terrible Covid-19 experience will, in due course, feed into the nation\u2019s already mounting EU scepticism.

coronavirus pandemic has been significantly under-reported because of mistakes in notifying the government of fatalities.</p> <p>The Scottish government revealed on Thursday the number of Covid-19 deaths had jumped 66% in one day, up by 50 to 126 fatalities from the 76 reported on Wednesday. </p> <p>The first minister said that 40 of those deaths were historic cases detected by one unnamed testing laboratory, which had only just been notified centrally, but 10 were fatalities in the last 24 hours. </p> <p>She said there had been delays getting relatives\u2019 consent before recording them centrally, but admitted it was still unclear why the delays had occurred. </p> <p>Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, said every death meant there were roughly 1,000 coronavirus infections in the general population, implying that 40,000 more Scots have been infected.</p> <p>Officials were now updating all recent daily fatalities figures to include the newly disclosed cases, and the government hoped to produce a more definitive list later on Thursday. Sturgeon said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Part of the cruelty of this virus is that when people are in hospital and when they\u2019re dying, family members are not able to be with them.</p> <p>Therefore it has taken a bit longer for families to be informed and for them to give their consent to all of the things that are required.</p> </blockquote> <p>Scottish Labour said the admission increased their concerns that deaths outside hospitals and \u201cpresumed deaths\u201d were not being properly recorded after GPs and families warned that cases were being missed.</p> <p>Monica Lennon, Labour\u2019s health spokesman, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Irrespective of where people have died, be it in their own house, a nursing home or a hospital, we need the full facts about this virus.

Following a week in self-isolation, the health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, returns to Westminster today and will unveil a <strong>new five-point plan</strong> for scaling up testing across the country, which the government calls its top priority. Hancock has recovered from a mild case of Covid-19 and will also front the daily news conference this afternoon. </p> <p>His plan proposes to boost testing capacity by paying private firms to carry out swab testing, roll out antibody tests, conducting randomised sampling of the population and building up Britain\u2019s long-term diagnostic capacity by working with pharmaceutical firms. However, the government\u2019s ambition of testing 25,000 people a day may not be achieved until the end of this month, while antibody is still yet to begin because none of the nine different testing kits ordered have been approved for use yet. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/01/government-unable-explain-coronavirus-testing-failures-lockdown/\">The Telegraph (paywall) has the story</a>. </p> <p>The government is absolutely lambasted across the front pages today, which includes a hammering from the usually doting Telegraph: \u201cQuestions but no answers\u201d accusing ministers of being repeatedly unilluminating on even basic questions about how the UK\u2019s testing regime is to be increased. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pmdfoster/status/1245475832925208577\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Absolutely brutal set of front pages <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID%E3%83%BC19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID\u30fc19</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> - first the heavies.

  "<p>Many chief executives have already worked out that their pay packets, and those of their senior executives, will have to take a hit.

Some want to reopen the domicile question.</p> <p>One can understand a few snorts of indignation over the dividend block. HSBC makes most of its money in Asia, and Hong Kong locals are big holders of the shares. But move the bank\u2019s legal home out of pique? The idea is absurd.</p> <p>Have the grumbling HSBC executives forgotten already what was happening on the streets of Hong Kong before the coronavirus crisis struck? The place was full of pro-democracy supporters protesting against creeping political interference from Beijing.</p> <p>The moral for a board with an eye to the long term should have been clear. An occasional dividend tickle from the Bank of England is vastly preferable to permanent overarching oversight by a Hong Kong regulator that could end up under the control of the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>Mark Tucker, the current HSBC chairman, should stamp on the nonsensical talk.

We asked four experts for their advice.</p> <h2>How effective are face masks at stopping transmission?</h2> <p><strong>Jeremy Howard </strong>The primary transmission [of coronavirus] is now known to be droplet-based, and we now know that that transmission largely occurs in the first seven days after infection, when people are largely asymptomatic. So that means that if you\u2019re highly infectious, you probably won\u2019t know it. So we should all assume that we are potentially lethal to people around us. The way we are potentially lethal to people around us is when we speak: that\u2019s when these micro droplets get ejected up to six feet.</p> <p>If you\u2019re speaking, and you put a couple of layers of cotton or paper towel in front of your mouth, the droplets go into that and not into the face of the person you\u2019re speaking to. That\u2019s why masks dramatically help reduce the spread of the virus.</p> <p><strong>Jessica Justman</strong> It\u2019s like a pitcher and a catcher at a baseball game. And the masks are all about trying to keep the pitcher from pitching the ball. There are more pitchers than we realized, and if we need to all wear masks in order to keep the pitchers from pitching their balls, then so be it.</p> <h2>Are masks more effective at protecting the wearer? Or everyone else?</h2> <p><strong>Howard </strong>There is some extra protection for the wearer, but it is imperfect. It\u2019s good to think about wearing a mask as protecting your community and asking your community to do the same for you.</p> <h2>Why have the WHO and CDC been reluctant to recommend masks for the general public?</h2> <p><strong>Howard </strong>They were trying to protect frontline healthcare workers from running out of N95 respirators. </p> <p><strong>Ben Cowling</strong> If the WHO were to consider modifying their current recommendations, they might go in the direction of saying: \u201cSave the surgical masks for the healthcare settings, and let\u2019s look into using homemade masks and cloth masks in the community to reduce transmission.\u201d</p> <h2>Are you concerned that people might use masks incorrectly, and that could make them less effective or give a false sense of security?</h2> <p><strong>Saskia Popescu</strong> I worry about someone who is sick wearing a mask, but then touching their mouth underneath, not washing their hands, and touching surfaces. I worry about the false sense of security, about people not wearing them appropriately, or cleaning them appropriately. So there are a lot of other pieces to [stopping transmission] that extend beyond the mask.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/03/covid-19-and-the-already-anxious-i-have-been-covertly-training-for-this-stress-marathon\">Covid-19 and the already anxious: 'I have been covertly training for this stress marathon'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, we want sick people to be wearing the mask, but if you tell everyone to go wear a mask right now, I think that could put a run on supplies.</p> <p><strong>Howard</strong> When we found that seatbelts keep people safe, we required people wear them. When we realized that condoms can protect you from disease, we told people to avoid unprotected sex. If there\u2019s something that could dramatically slash the transmission of disease, and our response is to tell people not to use it because they might do it wrong, that\u2019s incompatible with any other kind of policy decisions we make.</p> <h2>Do you have advice for individuals making face masks at home?</h2> <p><strong>Howard</strong> Cambridge University <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic\">has shown</a> that a couple of layers of cotton, like a T-shirt, would work great.

So unless you\u2019re planning on intubating patients at your own home or during your shopping trip, that\u2019s not an issue. Remember, the main thing we\u2019re doing is protecting those around you.</p> <h2>Is there any way to disaggregate the widespread use of face masks from other measures \u2013 like social distancing \u2013 to understand how effective they are?</h2> <p><strong>Howard:</strong> We absolutely can\u2019t. There are four measures \u2013 rigorous testing, contact tracing, quarantine of potentially infected persons and universal mask-wearing \u2013 that represent a known good recipe.

The impact Covid-19 is having on the service-led economy is devastating, with estimates of GDP contraction in Q2 as high as 34%. What\u2019s more, the unemployment figures are inevitably going to rise, as local labour offices process the backlog following a surge of new claims. The private nonfarm payrolls for March are expected to shrink for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>\u201cTo soften the impact, fiscal and monetary levers will need to be used in tandem, and speed is of the essence. The $2.2 trillion rescue package will help, but huge numbers of small and mid-size businesses will be looking to the treasury for further support. Similarly, consumers will benefit from the helicopter payments but are lacking the income support that we\u2019ve seen in the UK. Further questions arise over Federal independence; constitutional authority for public-health interventions lie primarily with the states, but any social or economic response needs to be co-ordinated or they risk failing.</p> <p>Now more than ever the Fed needs to be ready to take drastic measures in response to the data.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e85dee48f0866297e9f5aa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T12:49:06.522Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some snap reaction:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1245690214070263808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6.6M jobless claims.

  "<p>I\u2019ve seen a psychologist for most of my life. In that time, I\u2019ve never struggled to find something to talk about. But this week, when the appointment reminder lit up my phone, I paused. It had been a month between visits. During the last session I easily looped through a classic routine: moving from childhood, to parents, past relationships and patriarchy, barely pausing to let the professional talk. My self-actualisations were still bubbling out as I left the office. My therapist assured me we\u2019d pick up next session. I\u2019d already begun making notes.</p> <p>Then the entire world buckled under a once-in-a-century disaster. Every idea, plan, preconception and daydream I had about my future dissolved. The trust I held in my body was proven to be delusional hubris. I was more isolated, vulnerable, terrified and confused than ever. But reading the polite text outlining the no-show fees, I couldn\u2019t think of anything I needed to talk about.</p> <p>In a<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/818915030/comedian-marc-maron-we-need-groupthink-empathy-during-covid-19-outbreak\"> recent Fresh Air interview, </a>actor, comedian, and patron saint of chronic nerves, Marc Maron was asked about his anxiety levels during this stressful time. He admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not freaking out about too much of anything for some reason.\u201d Despite dealing with extreme anxiety for decades, he reasoned that his \u201cnatural propensity to dread\u201d has somewhat readied him for disaster. \u201cThe neural pathways of this type of thinking that everyone\u2019s feeling have been well-grooved over the years for me, and there\u2019s something almost like a Ritalin effect going on with me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/things-you-can-control-coping-with-radical-uncertainty-oliver-burkeman\">'Focus on the things you can control': how to cope with radical uncertainty | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Maron, I\u2019m at home with angst. My fears are built on the sandy foundation of \u201cwhat if\u201d. What if disaster strikes, my assets evaporate, the people around me disappear, or my loved ones are put in danger? But facing my apparent nightmare hasn\u2019t triggered the nuclear meltdown I imagined.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151229070643.htm\">2015 French researchers</a> looked at whether a history of anxiety prepared individuals to cope in a crisis. Comparing the brains of anxious and more laid-back subjects they discovered that the two groups detected threats in different regions. The anxious used the part of the brain responsible for action, while \u201clow anxious\u201d people used sensory circuits, responsible for face recognition.</p> <p>Maybe I have been covertly training for this stress marathon without realising it. But I\u2019m inclined to blame my uncharacteristically stable mood on a forced shift in perspective. Since adolescence therapy has been a safe space to explore the most painful and banal pieces of my life. I pay for advice and guidance, but also to be able to talk about myself for an hour without needing to balance the conversation with, \u201cSo anyways, how are you?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s a unique void where everything is briefly all about me, but that would be a lie. Until they said the word <em>pandemic</em>, my self-obsession was absolute. Everything in my life was about me. My home, friends, job and hobbies were curated to serve as edited facsimiles of the \u201creal world\u201d as I wanted to see it. Even consuming the news, global issues were viewed through the prism of, <em>what does that mean for me?</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In this new world, I\u2019m decentered in my own life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, day-to-day concerns have been elevated from personal to historical. The impact of habits, chores and behaviours carry so much weight it\u2019s like they don\u2019t fully belong to me anymore. My actions aren\u2019t my own; they\u2019re gestures within a massive group mobilisation effort.</p> <p>I used to worry about fading potential and collected regrets, now I worry if the number of cans I buy is throwing off the supply chain. In this new world, I\u2019m decentered in my own life. Less an individual than a dot on a curve that must flatten, a statistic that can\u2019t explode, a possible infection point that needs to be controlled, and a pair of hands to be washed like someone else\u2019s life depends on it.</p> <p>In her essay collection So Sad Today,<em> </em>Melissa Broder wrote: \u201cFor someone with anxiety, dramatic situations are, in a way, more comfortable than the mundane.

Speaking to loved ones, reading the news, or even eavesdropping on stranger\u2019s conversations allows you to witness your own brain splayed out and dissected en masse. With all of our fears and emotions being externalised, recognised and processed around us, every interaction starts to feel like therapy.</p> <p>I did end up going to that appointment. Although I knew it would probably be the last one for a while. Seated by an open window, three meters from my therapist, in a seemingly empty and lightly bleach-smelling building, the session started like normal with her asking how I\u2019m doing.</p> <p>I responded with that weird dance we\u2019ve all adopted lately.

One of them, a complete stranger, picked up some outdoor furniture for me because I don\u2019t have a car. I gave her a bottle of wine. We vowed one day to drink it together.</p> <p>A man in my street had us over last week and lit a large fire in his backyard. He made dinner that we ate on our laps, as the embers flew up in the cold wind. Maybe once upon a time the conversation might have been stilted, but we had something to talk about now.

  "<p>Russia is considering aggressive new surveillance methods as the country seeks to enforce mandatory shelter-in-place orders in cities including Moscow and St Petersburg and other regions across its 11 time zones.</p> <p>While the details of the new monitoring system have not been confirmed, official statements and leaked plans have indicated they could include mobile apps that track users\u2019 location, CCTV cameras with facial recognition software, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code\">QR codes</a>, mobile phone data and credit card records.</p> <p>The hastily developed patchwork to monitor individuals\u2019 movements could tell authorities whether Russians had broken coronavirus lockdowns for reasons other than those allowed: seeking medical care, visiting the grocery store, the pharmacy, or traveling to an authorised job. Leaked plans indicate that parts of the system may go online this weekend.</p> <p>While there remain questions about whether the technology is viable, opposition politicians have warned that the government is laying the groundwork for a \u201ccybergulag,\u201d with a new system of enhanced surveillance that could remain active even after the current crisis passes.</p> <p>On Thursday, Vladimir Putin told Russians that he would extend the country\u2019s \u201cnon-working\u201d days, saying they should stay at home until the end of the month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/coronavirus-is-a-chance-for-authoritarian-leaders-to-tighten-their-grip\">Authoritarian leaders may use Covid-19 crisis to tighten their grip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the same day, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, signed legislation that would allow city authorities to identify and fine people who had violated the shelter-at-home order. Supporters said that the law would maintain public safety during the coronavirus outbreak, while opponents said it gave the government dangerous powers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no certainty that the system for surveilling Muscovites deployed during the pandemic will ever be rolled back,\u201d said Maxim Kruglov, a municipal deputy for the opposition Yabloko faction.</p> <p>Russian officials like Sobyanin and Mikhail Mishustin, the prime minister, have promised technological solutions to enforce a self-isolation regime that could last weeks or months. But despite unrivalled political control, there are doubts about whether the government has the resources and coordination to develop the kind of mass surveillance system that has emerged elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">such as in China</a>.</p> <p>Alexander Isavnin of the Internet Protection Society said that many of the controls being discussed, such as the sharing of users\u2019 mobile data, were difficult to implement and unconstitutional. More importantly, he said, the heavy-handed measures would evoke public anger among Russians.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that a Chinese scenario is possible,\u201d said Isavnin, referring to that country\u2019s mass surveillance methods. \u201cPeople are going to react very poorly to [this technology]. They\u2019re probably going to find a way to sabotage it.\u201d</p> <p>One attempt has already sparked a backlash: a clumsy mobile application developed by Moscow\u2019s city government to monitor coronavirus patients\u2019 movements. The app, called Social Monitoring, was discovered last week in the Google Play store and requested access to a user\u2019s location, camera, telephone, sensors and other data to ensure they were complying with quarantine.</p> <p>Social Monitoring quickly disappeared from the online store. Eduard Lysenko, the head of Moscow\u2019s Department of Information Technologies, called the application a \u201ctest version\u201d released for professional feedback. It would be re-released, he said, and those opposed to installing the app on their phones could opt to receive a temporary device instead.</p> <p>Lysenko also said that Moscow is ready to roll out QR codes that would require Muscovites to register online and reapply each time they sought to leave the house. Citizens will be required to \u201cregister, fill out a simple form and a corresponding code will be generated, which can either be put on a telephone, sent by mail, or printed,\u201d he said. Those codes could then be checked by police officers and others with access to a central database.</p> <p>That system still has not been rolled out, amid concerns about enforcement and the lack of an official order from the Moscow mayor\u2019s office.</p> <p>For now, Moscow\u2019s quarantine has been lightly policed. That could soon change. Russian media leaked draft plans from the Moscow\u2019s mayor office to toughen enforcement of the quarantine beginning this weekend. The plans said the city would use cameras with facial recognition, banking data, QR codes, physical patrols on the streets and the social monitoring mobile application to keep tabs on people\u2019s movements.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s communications ministry has also said it plans to use mobile operator data to help enforce the self-isolation regime. The first time a person\u2019s phone leaves their permitted area, they will receive a text message, the agency said. \u201cIf the violations happen systematically, then the [mobile] operators will present the data to law enforcement.\u201d</p> <p>Russia\u2019s moves to strengthen surveillance measures mirror similar developments in other countries. On Thursday, Roskomsvoboda, a Russian NGO, released an <a href=\"https://pandemicbigbrother.online/en/?fbclid=IwAR3uEceyvbi5HtILjxpZgVJQQE0_5DeWJNMcAk_Yu_AvwdymaTmeLXphiX4\">interactive map</a> to chart \u201cviolations of digital rights\u201d around the world as a result of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.</p>",
  "<p>A transatlantic divide on how to use location data to fight coronavirus risks highlights the lack of safeguards for Americans\u2019 personal data, academics and data scientists have warned.</p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has turned to data provided by the mobile advertising industry to analyse population movements in the midst of the pandemic.</p> <p>Owing to a lack of systematic privacy protections in the US, data collected by advertising companies is often extremely detailed: companies with access to GPS location data, such as weather apps or some e-commerce sites, have been known to sell that data on for ad targeting purposes. That data provides much more granular information on the location and movement of individuals than the mobile network data received by the UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/plan-phone-location-data-assist-uk-coronavirus-effort\">from carriers including O2 and BT</a>.</p> <p>While both datasets track individuals at the collection level, GPS data is accurate to within five metres, according to Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, a data scientist at Imperial College, while mobile network data is accurate to 0.1km\u00b2 in city centres and much less in less dense areas \u2013 the difference between locating an individual to their street and to a specific room in their home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Additionally, legal safeguards on location data in the UK mean that the government only receives information from mobile carriers in aggregated form, which prevents individuals from being identified. \u201cMost of the time, you don\u2019t need to know who\u2019s behind the phone,\u201d said de Montjoye. \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing contract tracing, you\u2019re interested in aggregates: who\u2019s been moving between London and Edinburgh, say, or between London boroughs.\u201d</p> <p>According to the ICO deputy commissioner for policy, Steve Wood, the aggregation is crucial to the legal basis on which the government has access to the data. \u201cGeneralised location data trend analysis is helping to tackle the coronavirus crisis. Where this data is properly anonymised and aggregated, it does not fall under data protection law because no individual is identified.</p> <p>\u201cIn these circumstances, privacy laws are not breached as long as the appropriate safeguards are in place,\u201d Wood added.</p> <p>In contrast, the location data the CDC has acquired is pseudonymised, but not aggregated, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-tracking-how-people-move-around-in-coronavirus-pandemic-11585393202\">according to a report in the Wall Street Journal</a>. That means that identifying data such as names have been removed from the dataset, but the data has been left in a format that allows for an individual to be followed over a period of time.</p> <p>The power of such an approach is made clear in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TectonixGEO/status/1242628347034767361\">one demonstration</a> by the data visualisation company Tectonix GEO, using location data collected by the ad industry data provider X-Mode Social.

Knowing where someone was is enough to reidentify them 95% of the time, using mobile phone data. So there\u2019s the privacy concern: you need to process the pseudonymised data, but the pseudonymised data can be reidentified. Most of the time, if done properly, the aggregates are aggregated, and cannot be de-anonymised.\u201d</p> <p>The data scientist points to successful attempts to use location data in tracking outbreaks of malaria in Kenya or dengue in Pakistan as proof that location data has use in these situations, but warns that trust will be hurt if data collected for modelling purposes is then \u201csurreptitiously used to crack down on individuals not respecting quarantines or kept and used for unrelated purposes\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Countries have approached coronavirus testing in different ways, and in some places there was far earlier recognition than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/boris-johnson-restates-pledge-to-boost-uk-coronavirus-testing-capacity\">in the UK</a> of the need to develop tests and kits and to have sufficient numbers stockpiled. Here is how some countries got ahead of the curve.</p> \n<h2><strong>China</strong></h2> \n<p>With its experience of Sars at the start of the century and as the apparent source of origin of Covid-19, it is perhaps unsurprising that China is ahead of others on testing. By the end of March it had conducted well over 320,000 tests.</p> \n<p>One of the earliest tests was developed in mainland China by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and details of it were posted on the World Health Organization website on 24 January, just after the Wuhan lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown\">was announced</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A Hong Kong team that helped identify Sars worked to develop its own test. \u201cBecause we have gone through all these events in the past, we know how important it is to have a working diagnostic test,\u201d said Leo Poon, who led the team. \u201cThat\u2019s why we basically tried to get the work done as soon as possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>As one of the world\u2019s major chemicals producers, China was able to quickly accelerate production of kits.</p> \n<h2><strong>Germany</strong></h2> \n<p>Germany\u2019s preparedness was helped in part by a recognition that coronavirus was likely to become a global problem. While most countries were slow in dusting off pandemic preparedness plans, in early January a scientist in Berlin, Olfert Landt, recognised the similarity to Sars and realised a test kit would be needed.</p> \n<p>Lacking a gene sequence for the new coronavirus, Landt and his company designed their first test kit based on Sars and other known coronaviruses. The protocol was published by the WHO on 17 January, before the Chinese test. The British government passed on this test. By the end of February Landt had produced 4m kits and was making another 1.5m a week.</p> \n<p>As well as having an effective test in mass production, Germany signed up politically to mass testing from the beginning, resulting in it being able to do 12,000 tests daily.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-02T09:42:37/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-02T09:42:37/embed.html\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>South Korea</strong></h2> \n<p>South Korea has been among the most aggressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">when it comes to testing</a>. In contrast with the early stages in the UK \u2013 where Boris Johnson said coronavirus was likely to \u201cspread a bit more\u201d \u2013 South Korean health officials quickly learned the lessons from Wuhan that the new virus was extremely contagious and could spread rapidly over a wide area.</p> \n<p>The country prioritised identifying and isolating people testing positive for the disease, and developed capacity to run about 15,000 diagnostic tests a day. It has conducted more than 300,000 tests to date, free of charge, including in drive-through testing booths since replicated elsewhere.</p> \n<h2><strong>Iceland</strong></h2> \n<p>Small and relatively wealthy, the country has a few advantages when it comes to testing, and it has tested a higher proportion of its citizens than anywhere else in the world, including many showing no symptoms of the disease.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/uk-coronavirus-testing-what-ministers-said-and-what-stands-scrutiny\">UK coronavirus testing: what ministers said and what has happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIceland\u2019s population puts it in the unique position of having very high testing capabilities with help from the Icelandic medical research company deCode Genetics,\u201d Thorolfur Gu\u00f0nason, Iceland\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertonardelli/coronavirus-testing-iceland\">told BuzzFeed</a>. He said the testing effort was \u201cintended to gather insight into the actual prevalence of the virus in the community, as most countries are most exclusively testing symptomatic individuals at this time.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> \n<p>After Germany, Italy has done the most testing, with about 200,000 tests. These included all 3,000 residents of the town of V\u00f2, near Venice, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo\">a pilot project</a> designed to see if whole-community testing could help slow the spread of the disease.</p> \n<p>Italy showed how widespread testing could be as politically contentious as insufficient testing, with some including the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, initially appearing to blame the country\u2019s high number of infections on the policy of testing people without symptoms. \u201cWe have been the first ones with the most rigorous and accurate controls,\u201d Conte said on TV, adding that Italy appeared to have more people infected because \u201cwe did more tests\u201d.

  "<p>California has not seen the surge in coronavirus cases that have overwhelmed cities like New York and Detroit in the past week, which suggests that the state\u2019s early and restrictive shelter-in-place orders could be slowing the virus\u2019s spread.

The California governor, Gavin Newsom, said on Tuesday that \u201cthe current modeling is on the lower end of our projection\u201d. Last month, Newsom had warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-california-more-than-half-gavin-newsom\">more than half of the state could be infected</a> within two weeks. \u201cWe are in a completely different place than the state of New York,\u201d Newsom said at a briefing on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I hope we continue to be, but we won\u2019t unless people continue to practice physical distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the state\u2019s early and ambitious efforts to enforce shelter-in-place rules do seem to have prevented hospitals from becoming as overwhelmed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/new-york-coronavirus-elmhurst-hospital\">New York\u2019s system</a>, Robert Siegel, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, told the Guardian. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to accurately know the impact of your interventions if you don\u2019t have adequate testing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As of Tuesday, more than 86,100 tests had been administered in the state, and of those, 57,400 results were still pending. By comparison, New York, which has about half the population of California, has processed more than 200,000 tests. Washington state, which has less than a fifth of California\u2019s population, has processed 65,462 tests.</p> <p>Testing efforts in California have been set back due to a lack of swabs, vials and media for collecting patient samples, as well as a shortage of kits and bottlenecks at labs.</p> <p>Across the state, tests are in short supply and currently largely limited to people with severe symptoms and those with underlying health conditions, meaning large swaths of the state\u2019s population are left untested. \u201cThe general idea is that if somebody that has been to the hospital, and they have symptoms, then you assume they\u2019re infected,\u201d said Siegel. But by testing more, doctors and health officials could be more strategic and selective about who they isolate, he noted.</p> <p>Administering more than one type of test could also help California, and the country as a whole,<strong> </strong>better understand how the coronavirus spreads through communities. The tests being used in the US detect for the presence of viral RNA. Another type of test \u2013 called a serology or antibody test \u2013 can help detect if a person\u2019s immune system has faced off against Covid-19 and recovered from it. Antibody tests are not currently being done in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to test for immunity,\u201d Siegel said, because people who are immune could return to work without endangering themselves or others. \u201cThey could more safely work as frontline healthcare providers,\u201d Siegel said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4725f142923a607497993f57b7852fdd719eade6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4725f142923a607497993f57b7852fdd719eade6/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A homeless man pushes a cart full of his belongings along an empty street in San Diego.

Widespread, random testing in Iceland has similarly helped epidemiologists better understand how the virus affects people \u2013 data from the country found that half of those who tested positive are non-symptomatic, and overall a low population had been infected.</p> <p>The test shortage not only prevents people suspected of having Covid-19 from getting a diagnosis and being counted and traced, it also hampers officials\u2019 efforts to prevent an outbreak in the most vulnerable and high-risk communities.</p> <p>California has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/26/theyve-turned-their-backs-on-us-californias-homeless-crisis-grows-in-numbers-and-violence\">largest homeless population</a> in the US, with 40,000 people living in crowded shelters where advocates say testing access has improved over the last week, but continues to fall short.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impeding the ability of shelters to identify people who have been infected with the virus and remove them from this incredibly dangerous environment, where the virus has the potential to spread like wildfire,\u201d said Eve Garrow, the homelessness policy analyst with the ACLU of Southern California. She argued that all residents and staff should be tested, and noted that she recently heard from one shelter resident who has a fever, but was unable to get a test.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You need testing to make sure you quickly identify new outbreaks and trace contacts.

Sport has been paralysed by coronavirus, with events and seasons dropping from billboards one by one. It is fanciful to suggest the Kent coast can \u2013 or should, in respect of public services \u2013 host 200,000 visitors and global competitors in a golf event in little over three months\u2019 time. The R&amp;A, for its many faults, cannot be ignorant over a pandemic.</p> <p>At the very least, if not providing a full explanation of contingency, the R&amp;A should have put a public line through Sandwich in its standard slot long before now; spectators alone deserve that much. Augusta National is still to issue detail of a 2020 Masters alternative but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/masters-golf-tournament-becomes-the-latest-event-to-be-postponed-augusta-coronavirus\" title=\"\">it was swift in postponing</a> when coronavirus took hold.

St Andrews, Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon are already set in stone as venues for the three following years.</p> <p>The R&amp;A has a weird obsession with anniversaries; St Andrews was to stage the 150th playing of the Open, with 2023 marking 100 years since Troon\u2019s first one. The calendar can of course be shuffled around but it\u2019s messy, including in respect of Hoylake, where vast ticket sales send the R&amp;A\u2019s bean counters into a state of delirium.</p> <p>We assume that, by next weekend, overdue clarity will have been provided by the R&amp;A.

  "<p>You\u2019ve rewatched The Wire, seen every episode of Friends at least twice and are starting to wonder if this is what it feels like to \u201ccomplete\u201d Netflix. But wait: there\u2019s a world-changing, cultural juggernaut of a TV show that \u2013 while hugely popular \u2013 you may well have missed.</p> <p>This week, Money Heist \u2013 or, to use its Spanish title, La Casa de Papel \u2013 begins another eight-episode run on Netflix, where it is the streaming giant\u2019s most-watched non-English language show worldwide. The first season of the full-throttle thriller saw its gang \u2013 all code-named after major cities and memorably clad in revolutionary-red overalls and Salvador Dal\u00ed masks \u2013 break into the Royal Mint of Spain, taking 67 people hostage and literally printing money: 2.4bn euros, to be exact. It\u2019s fair to say that the plot doesn\u2019t quite go to plan, though it does result in three raunchy romances and an island escape. Season three, an even wilder ride, proved that for this gang loyalty is as much a motivation as loot.</p> <p>The show\u2019s Madrid-based creator, \u00c1lex Pina, believes the latest season has the power to \u201cinfuse some oxygen into this disturbing climate \u2026 it is a brutal journey to the limit, like a ride on a vertiginous rollercoaster. I can promise the audience will not think of Covid-19 while watching it.\u201d His previous show, the women\u2019s prison drama Locked Up is, along with teen thriller Elite and the 1940s-set mystery High Seas, part of a wave of Spanish dramas that have commanded large international audiences in recent years, all in part because of Netflix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"106a7b25ebdd0f6bf53c9f292751c6626e7ffbf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/106a7b25ebdd0f6bf53c9f292751c6626e7ffbf7/200_0_3000_1800/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Give her the gun ... \u00darsula Corber\u00f3 as Money Heist\u2019s Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Give her the gun ... \u00darsula Corber\u00f3 as Money Heist\u2019s Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Money Heist is on a different scale. Within months of arriving on the streaming service in 2017, the thriller had become the single most-watched series in countries including France, Italy, Argentina and Brazil, and its third series \u2013 released last year \u2013 was watched by 34 million households in its first week alone. Its impact has been huge: superfans send Pina photographs of tattoos of Tokyo and the Professor, and the gang\u2019s masks and overalls now rival The Handmaid\u2019s Tale bonnet for the most recognisable TV costume of recent years. They were even worn on political protests in Puerto Rico and during a real-life robbery in the French city of Nantes. In Argentina, where the show is particularly beloved, babies have been named after its protagonists.</p> <p>The reasons for Money Heist\u2019s appeal are obvious but also strangely ineffable, not least in episodes such as the season three opener, where characters switched between emotional extremes and glamorous locations with equally delirious speed. \u201cIt\u2019s pure rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d says \u00c1lvaro Morte, who plays the gang\u2019s meticulous mastermind, the Professor. \u201cOnce you see the first chapter of the show, you are lost in it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has something different, especially for non-Spanish people,\u201d says his co-star \u00darsula Corber\u00f3. She stars as Tokyo, the gang member whose irrepressible desire to drink rum and dance the salsa with strangers sets a shocking series of events in motion. \u201cWe have this way of expressing ourselves, of exchanging our feelings that goes through the screen.\u201d Pina agrees that cultural specificity is one of the show\u2019s main selling points: \u201cIn Money Heist, feelings, fraternity and love are as important as the plots. A perfect heist, rational and cool, becomes something else when spiced up with Latin emotions.\u201d The tragic dynamic between the Professor and his love interest-cum-arresting officer Raquel (Itziar Itu\u00f1o) is a compelling example of this contrast in action.</p> <p>If there is such a thing as a quintessentially Spanish heist drama, then, this is it. It\u2019s not grittily downbeat like its British equivalents or pared-back like Scandi crime shows. Rather, says Pina, Money Heist is rooted in Spanish literature\u2019s great foundational text: \u201cTo rise up against the system is reckless and idealistic \u2013 [it\u2019s] Don Quixote! Yet I think it\u2019s much more Latin than Spanish; more passionate. In that, it differs from the English \u2018perfect heist\u2019 genre, which is cooler, more restrained, more scientific.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_PJbmrX4uk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p_PJbmrX4uk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Restraint has hardly been necessary for Pina and his writing team, since Netflix once again upped the show\u2019s budget for the new season, enabling an exciting range of high-octane stunts and ever-more lavish production values (in July, Variety estimated the previous season to be Spain\u2019s biggest-budgeted series-per-episode ever).</p> <p>According to Corber\u00f3, Money Heist\u2019s passionate characters can be unpredictable even for their co-creators: \u201cIf, by this time, we didn\u2019t know our characters well, it would be unforgivable,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the scriptwriters still have the ability to surprise us.\u201d Indeed, at the end of season three, the Professor experienced a trauma that \u2013 it is strongly hinted in the trailer for season four \u2013 will lead the usually rational character to behave more erratically. \u201cI think characters should always develop and evolve. If they don\u2019t, they are flat,\u201d says Morte. \u201cI used to be the kind of actor that would read a script and I\u2019d think: \u2018Oh my God! My character would never say that!\u2019 Now I\u2019ve changed my mindset. All the characters, especially the Professor, still have many things to show.\u201d Fan sites are awash with speculation on what exactly that could be. Will he seek bloody revenge on the police? Or descend into madness?</p> <p>There is also a political edge to the series\u2019 \u201canti-system\u201d philosophy, which is invoked whenever we hear the gang\u2019s borrowed anthem, the Italian protest song Bella Ciao. \u201cFirst and foremost, the series is meant to entertain, but an idea runs underneath,\u201d explains Pina. \u201cScepticism towards governments, central banks, the system \u2026 This notion would not sink in unless it were formulated within an entertaining narrative. The action genre used to be considered shallow and superficial, and social movies as boring. Why not put these two concepts together?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1741ad67bbe05a1069e5e0002b98c19716b33024\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1741ad67bbe05a1069e5e0002b98c19716b33024/0_0_4588_2753/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator wears the red jumpsuit and Dali mask from the show during an anti-government protest in France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstrator wears the red jumpsuit and Dali mask from the show during an anti-government protest in France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G\u00e9rard Julien/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because the 2008 financial crash, which set the scene for Money Heist, was a global event, it\u2019s unsurprising that this escapist fable has resonated widely. For Morte, though, the show\u2019s impact hit home for him while he was watching the news one evening: \u201cOn the Mediterranean, an immigrants\u2019 boat was trying to reach the Spanish coast. When they were rescued, they started singing Bella Ciao. It\u2019s something that will stay with me for ever.\u201d</p> <p>Despite international acclaim, at the end of 2019, the UK was one of the few territories where the show did not feature in Netflix\u2019s Top 10. Latecomers would be well advised to catch up fast, though. While Pina won\u2019t set an end date, it\u2019s clear Money Heist is here for a good time, not a long time. \u201cWe\u2019re here to tell whatever we need to tell in the shortest way,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to shoot guns at close range, to empty magazines tirelessly \u2026 we\u2019d rather the audience switched off the TV with racing hearts than out of boredom.\u201d</p> <p><em>Money Heist: Part Four is on Netflix from Friday 3 April</em></p>",

They\u2019re meant as a stopgap measure, as a way to temporarily maintain a portion of income until someone can find a new job.</p> \n<p>Unemployment insurance provides on average $300 a week, about a third of the average wage in the US, and typically lasts about four months. The actual amount depends on a person\u2019s past earnings and the reason they stopped working.</p> \n<p>The federal government can also grant extensions if economic forecasts don\u2019t improve. Barack Obama extended benefits several times between 2009 and 2013 to deal with rising unemployment rates during the Great Recession.</p> \n<h2>What does the government\u2019s relief package mean if I\u2019ve lost my job?</h2> \n<p>In response to coronavirus fallout, national lawmakers are making a broader group of people eligible for unemployment relief, including workers who are sick or have been quarantined, those who have been laid off or had hours reduced due to the outbreak, and people who can\u2019t work because they have to care for children.</p> \n<p>The White House and Senate leaders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">agreed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">to</a> a $2tn rescue package for the US economy that includes a one-time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">$1,200 check</a> for many taxpayers, an increase in unemployment payments, and a broadening of the group of workers that would qualify for them.</p> \n<p>Workers will see an extra $600 a week layered on top of traditional unemployment benefits, thanks to the package.</p> \n<p>The bill also mandates 10 days of fully paid sick leave for employees of companies with 500 employees or less. Parents of those companies affected by their children\u2019s school closing and those leaving for medical reasons can get 12 weeks of pay at 67% of their salary. Companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions.</p> \n<p>And although typically the self-employed and independent contract workers \u2013 such as ride-share drivers and freelance writers \u2013 aren\u2019t eligible for unemployment benefits, they are under the new relief package. The aid will look a lot like benefits they would receive under <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/24418\">disaster unemployment assistance</a>.

States such as California are encouraging people to file online as a way to expedite claims.</p> \n<p>The department contacts a person\u2019s last employer to verify information and determines a weekly benefit amount <a href=\"https://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/PFL_Calculator.htm\">based on past earnings</a> and the reason the person stopped working.</p> \n<p>Californians who are sick or quarantined would see 60% to 70% of typical earnings, ranging from $50 to $1,300 a week. Those who have had hours cut would get less. The state\u2019s unemployment department has <a href=\"https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019.htm\">published additional guidance</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How long will it take to get paid?</strong></h2> \n<p>The department says that it generally takes a couple of weeks from the time a person files to when they can access money.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s the best-case scenario; it would most likely apply when cases are clearcut and doctors or employers are quick to respond and verify information.</p> \n<p>If doctors or employers delay, or if details are missed on paperwork, it could slow the process considerably, potentially adding weeks or months of wait time. The sudden surge in claims may also make it increasingly difficult to speak with a live customer service representative over the phone if a claim gets hung up.</p> \n<h2><strong>How many new claims will unemployment departments see?</strong></h2> \n<p>It\u2019s impossible to say for sure. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/steven-mnuchin-coronavirus-unemployment-treasury-secretary\">warned </a>the national unemployment rate could rise sharply from record lows and reach upwards of 20%.</p> \n<p>State unemployment systems <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-layoffs-america-unemployment-134819?nname=california-playbook&amp;nid=00000150-384f-da43-aff2-bf7fd35a0000&amp;nrid=0000016f-210f-de45-a7ef-a9af61150000&amp;nlid=641189\">were overwhelmed</a> by a sudden surge of new claims. A record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">6.6 million people</a> filed claims for unemployment in the US in the last week amid the lockdowns. </p> \n<h2><strong>How will coronavirus </strong><strong>affect the process?</strong></h2> \n<p>The federal government granted states <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20200312-0\">extra flexibility</a> on how to handle unemployment claims during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Those who aren\u2019t working because they\u2019re sick or quarantined must provide evidence from a healthcare professional who has treated them or ordered them to isolate.</p> \n<p>Someone who isn\u2019t sick or quarantined must generally still be looking for work and will be required to contact a certain number of employers, depending on the state.</p> \n<p>But hiring freezes, business shutdowns, and the ability to safely look for work could pose new challenges to those on the job hunt.</p> \n<h2><strong>How is the unemployment department preparing to meet a </strong><strong>surge in new claims?</strong></h2> \n<p>States across the country will face a flood of new unemployment claims, but California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, may be caught particularly off guard.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/Executive_Staff.htm\">Loree Levy</a>, the California unemployment department\u2019s top spokeswoman, said the surge is unique from those seen during the last recession, when state unemployment departments had time to prepare.</p> \n<p>\u201cTypically, claims ramp up. But this is a big slam all at once. It\u2019s a serious challenge. We\u2019re throwing everything we have at it,\u201d Levy said.</p> \n<p>Levy said department staffers have been working overtime and on weekends to process claims. The department is also shifting workers from other departments to help process claims and is looking to retirees who know the system to come back to work.</p> \n<p>The department is also looking to add new staff members, but Levy cautioned that this may not help in the short term. \u201cHiring is not an immediate fix,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes several months for someone to be efficient\u201d in processing claims, she said.</p> \n<p>Further complicating matters is the very reason for the unemployment deluge \u2013 a highly contagious disease \u2013 which will pose new and difficult staffing challenges to process claims.<strong> </strong>Levy said the department is looking to prepare more of its staff to work remotely.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s what made this so complex. We\u2019re concerned about our own employees, but we\u2019re also concerned about providing benefits in a timely manner,\u201d Levy said.</p> \n<h2><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong></h2> \n<p>Because funding for state unemployment departments \u2013 money that pays for staffing and infrastructure \u2013 is based on recent years\u2019 unemployment rates, and because those rates have fallen to record lows, states now face a unique challenge in responding to a crushing demand after years of paring down departments.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople have been saying for years that the systems are antiquated, and I think we\u2019re going to come to regret that,\u201d said <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jrothst/\">Jesse Rothstein</a>, a labor economist and professor at University of California, Berkeley.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/solvency.asp\">Unemployment trust funds</a>, which provide money to pay out benefits,<strong> </strong>could also go broke \u2013 a concern <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-downturn-that-costs-jobs-could-catch-the-u-s-unprepared-1524424830\">economists have raised</a> for years. If that happens, states would have to borrow funds from the federal government.</p> \n<p>To be ready to respond to a recession, a state should have<strong> </strong>enough money in its reserve to pay out benefits for a year.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nelp.org/expert/michele-evermore/\">Michele Evermore</a>, a researcher and policy analyst at National Employment Law Project, said that California may be <a href=\"https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/large_carousel.asp?slide=4\">the least prepared</a> of any state to stay solvent.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why Evermore said it\u2019s been crucial for Congress to act quickly to pass economic relief packages that include money to boost state unemployment departments\u2019 administrative funding and allow them to build up departments to meet demand.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re very much on the right track,\u201d Evermore said, but he added the government will need to soon make more support available.</p> \n<p>Lawmakers may free up additional relief in the weeks or months to come, and experts say it\u2019s important for the federal government to provide continued support throughout the crisis, beyond the one-off stimulus checks.</p> \n<p>Rothstein said: \u201cThis is going to be a tidal wave and we need the federal government to open up the checkbook.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Harvey was a family man, a father of seven, but in his last moments he was forced apart from them.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52131921\">57-year-old nurse</a>, who had been self-isolating at home with coronavirus symptoms, was found by paramedics who broke down a bathroom door to reach him, but sadly he could not be saved. It is impossible to know where exactly he was infected. But Harvey, the fifth NHS worker to die during this outbreak, reportedly told his wife he had been treating patients at Goodmayes hospital in Ilford equipped only with \u201ca flimsy apron, and no mask\u201d. He had devoted his life to the NHS, his daughter Tamira said and she felt he had been let down.</p> <p>The more stories emerge of doctors improvising masks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\">snorkels</a> and nurses using bin liners for aprons, as they struggle not only to protect themselves but avoid spreading infection to other patients, the clearer a nation\u2019s moral duty to those on the frontline becomes. A global pandemic is not a war, and military metaphors can be overdone. But the lesson of history is that governments are not forgiven for sending their people defenceless into the trenches, metaphorical or literal, and that\u2019s why historical parallels with the events of 1915 may be instructive.</p> <p>Less than a year into the first world war, reports began surfacing of British troops forced to attack heavily defended German positions armed only with shrapnel shells after stocks of more modern shells ran out. What the Daily Mail called <a href=\"https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/tragedy-shells-supplying-army-munitions-war-act-1915/\">\u201cThe Tragedy of the Shells\u201d</a> triggered a backlash on the home front from which Herbert Asquith\u2019s administration never recovered. Although a shortage of shells wasn\u2019t the only reason troops were struggling, fury at the failure of military and political strategists to anticipate the intensity of the fighting and gear up munitions production in response became a rallying point. The shell scandal helped trigger the formation of a cross-party national government, with David Lloyd George serving initially as its munitions minister before ultimately moving into Downing Street himself.</p> <p>Now, a century on, a tragedy not of shells but of masks and gowns and diagnostic testing looms, arguably exacerbated by a failure to anticipate how many people would be hospitalised with this virus. For Asquith, read a fledgling Conservative administration now under serious attack from the rightwing press for the first time; for that emergency national government, a question mark hanging over Labour\u2019s brand new leader.</p> <p>Until now, both the opposition and the unions have trodden a carefully constructive line through this epidemic. The TUC pitched in with the Treasury to ensure the rescue package for small businesses and the self-employed was comprehensive. Past Labour leaders chipped in where they hoped to help \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\">Gordon Brown</a> offering lessons learned from the 2008 banking crash, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-tony-blair-calls-for-mass-uk-testing-video\">Tony Blair</a> pushing the case for testing and refocusing his institute\u2019s work on coronavirus in Africa. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, has wisely sought not to exploit this crisis for cheap political reasons. But now that doctors and nurses are dying, the public mood is hardening. The TUC and unions representing care workers have called the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) a <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-latest-unions-warn-ppe-shortage-crisis-within-crisis-deliveries-covid-19-outbreak-2525801\">\u201ccrisis within a crisis\u201d</a>, warning that staff shouldn\u2019t have to work in unsafe conditions. The imminent coronation of a new Labour leader, meanwhile, brings functioning opposition back just as the gap between government promises and reality is widening.</p> <p>Nightly Downing Street press conferences revolve endlessly around the same questions: why aren\u2019t staff getting PPE, and why is Germany testing 10 times as many people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/why-uk-coronavirus-testing-work-catchup\">as Britain</a>? (The two are related \u2013 staff who aren\u2019t shielded are more likely to contract and spread infection, multiplying the need for testing). A Dunkirk-style armada of small ships, from scientific research institutes to veterinary testing labs, has been clamouring to help with processing tests for a while but Public Health England (the public sector body overseeing tests for infectious disease) has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/coronavirus-uk-labs-could-test-tens-of-thousands-more-people-says-expert\">reportedly</a> been reluctant to cede control. Arguments behind the scenes have centred on the risks of using an untried network versus the risks of failing to test in time, with the latter argument weighing heavily on the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Meanwhile medical staff face impossible dilemmas when masks and gloves run out: do they carry on helping patients anyway, or stop because it\u2019s unsafe?</p> <p>Ministers say they\u2019ve dispatched 390m pieces of PPE in only three weeks but that\u2019s meaningless without knowing exactly how much is needed (one New York hospital alone recently estimated that it would shortly be getting through 70,000 disposable masks a day). British hospitals are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/25/schools-asked-donate-science-goggles-nhs-use-face-shields\">scrounging goggles</a> from school chemistry labs and snapping up plastic visors made by volunteers on 3D printers, but the problem isn\u2019t just supply, it\u2019s distribution to the right people at the right time, across a jumble of private social care providers as well as the NHS. Over all this hangs the original failure to predict the pattern of this virus, leaving ministers racing to catch up with an outbreak not originally expected to peak until May.</p> <p>Ministers complain that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/michael-gove-appears-to-blame-china-over-lack-of-uk-coronavirus-testing\">China concealed</a> the true severity of the outbreak, meaning they only got reliable data once the virus hit Italy, yet that doesn\u2019t wholly explain why so many western governments responded differently. Why did we become the outliers, priding ourselves on having a smarter solution than everyone else? Is that really nothing to do with the personalities at the top of Downing Street?</p> <p>Boris Johnson was exactly the right leader for a Conservative party desperate to win a majority \u2013 that much became blindingly obvious in December \u2013 and he won it because many voters clearly thought him the right person to deliver Brexit. But Brexit isn\u2019t the defining issue in British politics any more, and handling a deadly epidemic demands a cautious leader excelling at logistics and detail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/uk-hospitals-being-sent-untested-coronavirus-protection-say-medics\">UK hospitals being sent untested coronavirus protection, say medics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in 1915, the solution to a nation losing faith in its leader mid-crisis was a national government of all the talents, an idea often dismissed these days either as a soppy centrist fantasy or a means of stifling dissent by absorbing critics inside the tent. Right now it still feels like a stretch, when the idea of an emergency cross-party administration didn\u2019t get off the ground even at the height of paralysis over Brexit.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/corbyn-takes-share-responsibility-defeat\">departure of Jeremy Corbyn</a>, a figure so polarising that some of his own MPs didn\u2019t trust him with power, is a pivotal moment nonetheless.

At the very least, some gesture of humility and willingness to listen to different viewpoints is now required from Johnson as he emerges from self-isolation.

  "<p>The approval ratings of democratic leaders around the world have soared during the coronavirus crisis, but political scientists say it will not last \u2013 and warn that populist opposition parties, in particular, will bounce back strongly as it subsides.</p> <p>Will Jennings, a professor of political science at Southampton University, said the increases were due to an effect first identified in 1970 by a US political scientist, John Mueller, in a paper examining the popularity of US presidents in times of crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIn the context of the cold war, Mueller looked at presidential approval data dating back to the 1940s. He observed that it spiked significantly at major moments of tension like, say, the Cuban missile crisis,\u201d Jennings said.</p> <p>\u201cHe defined this \u2018rally round the flag\u2019 effect as coming from an international event that directly involved the president, and was \u2018dramatic, specific and sharply focused\u2019.

More recently, they have suggested it may be because politics and the media become less partisan, or when people feel threatened, they look to an authority figure to protect them.</p> <p>\u201cOne school believes that when partisan differences are set aside, and the media coverage becomes more unified \u2013 when the cues people are getting change \u2013 that creates a space for the leader to be viewed more positively,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cThe other explanation is more based on social psychology.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever it is that drives it, \u201crally round the flag\u201d generally has the effect of pushing opposition parties and their leaders \u2013 particularly those, such as western Europe\u2019s far-right populists, who habitually attack governments aggressively \u2013 out of the spotlight.</p> <p>France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini and the leaders of Germany\u2019s AfD have lost ground in the polls: Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, is down three points <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elabe_fr/status/1245669569701830656\">according to the latest Elabe barometer</a>; Salvini\u2019s Lega has shed between two and four.

But we risk seeing a big resurgence.\u201d</p> <p>Europe could well see \u201can economic crisis after this health crisis \u2013 with a social crisis as a consequence\u201d, Fieschi said. \u201cPeople without jobs, high unemployment.

Salvini will jump on it.\u201d</p> <p>Jennings agreed. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time for populist leaders to attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be seen as going against the flow, as unpatriotic \u2013 undermining the very principles they stand for.

  "<p>Some British sporting bodies, including those sending athletes to next year\u2019s Olympics, fear they could go under because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>A handful of national governing bodies have privately told UK Sport that they face an existential threat because of the crisis, while at least a dozen more say they are facing a severe financial hit with events being cancelled and other sources of revenue being slashed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/01/uka-urged-to-gift-tokyo-anniversary-games-to-ease-tension-with-west-ham\">UKA urged to gift Tokyo Anniversary Games to ease tension with West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One chief executive admitted that his sport would lose more than \u00a31m in the next six months if the shutdown continues, and said his situation was not unique.</p> <p>Last month UK Sport sent a spreadsheet to every Olympic sport to find out the likely financial damage to medal programmes from Covid-19, and to identify which bodies are in distress or could face an insolvency risk in the next three months.</p> <p>Each organisation was asked to use a traffic light system to conduct a financial health check to assess the scale of the problem \u2013 with red being on the brink of going bust, amber having a significant financial impact on the organisation, and green meaning they were fairly sustainable.</p> <p>Sports bodies were also asked what the implications might be if the crisis lasted for six months, and to outline what financial help they would require. It was also emphasised that UK Sport wanted to ensure that they were still able to support medal-winning performances in Tokyo.</p> <p>UK Sport\u2019s approach appears to have been widely welcomed, with one chief executive praising them for taking a \u201cproactive approach in these absolutely unprecedented times\u201d. However, he also admitted: \u201cThere are a lot of concerns in the sector that income is being turned off.\u201d</p> <p>Another senior figure said that sports face a delicate balancing act, on the one hand trying to stay alive while also not wanting to appear in any way demanding given the stress the NHS and economy is under.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an incredible sensitivity around this issue,\u201d he added. \u201cClearly funding for the NHS and getting through this as a nation is far more important. But at the same time, if we don\u2019t get support, then sports like ours will find it very difficult to recover.\u201d</p> <p>Bodies who get most of their funding from UK Sport, which has given Olympic and Paralympic sport \u00a3374m over the past four years, are not thought to be under great threat. However, sports with more diverse income streams, such as athletics, cycling and badminton, face being hit much harder because they rely on a combination of TV money, hosting events, membership fees, and sponsorship, much of which will not kick in if sport remains on lockdown.</p> <p>One chief executive said he expected that sport would not get back to normal until September at the earliest and said there was added pressure because \u201cthe sponsorship market for Olympic and Paralympic sports is not strong right now\u201d.</p> <p>Other organisations, such as England Athletics and Scotland Athletics, are said to be concerned about a drop in membership fees from runners unable to use facilities or coaching at their local clubs for the foreseeable future.

And a bug discovered this week <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/zoom-doom/\">would enable hackers</a> to take over a Zoom user\u2019s Mac, including tapping into the webcam and hacking the microphone.</p> <p>The company said on Thursday it had issued a release to fix the Mac issue, but the number of security issues with Zoom in the past make it as bad as malicious software, said Arvind Narayanan, an associate computer science professor at Princeton University.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s make this simple,\u201d he said. \u201cZoom is malware.\u201d</p> <h2>In-app surveillance measures</h2> <p>Zoom has been criticized for its \u201cattention tracking\u201d feature, which allows a host to see if a user <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/zoom-tracks-not-paying-attention-video-call_l_5e7b96b5c5b6b7d80959ea96\">clicks away</a> from a Zoom window for 30 seconds or more.</p> <p>This feature would allow employers to check if employees are really tuned into a work meeting or if students are really watching a classroom presentation remotely.</p> <h2>Selling user data</h2> <p>A report from Motherboard found Zoom <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account\">sends data</a> from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes, even if the user does not have a Facebook account.</p> <p>Zoom <a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/29/zoom-privacy-policy/\">changed some </a><a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/29/zoom-privacy-policy/\">of its</a> policies in response and said on Thursday that the company \u201chas never sold user data in the past and has no intention of selling users\u2019 data going forward\u201d.<strong> </strong>But the Motherboard story was cited in a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/454166545/Zoom-Lawsuit\">filed</a> in a federal court in California this week, accusing Zoom of failing to \u201cproperly safeguard the personal information of the increasing millions of users\u201d on its platform.</p> <p>This privacy flaw was also mentioned in the letter from James, which noted such privacy violations could be of particular concern as schools migrate to Zoom for class.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Zoom has remediated specific reported security vulnerabilities, we would like to understand whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices,\u201d the letter said.</p>",

  "<p>The beaming, ebullient, fast-talking comedian and impressionist Eddie Large, who has died aged 78, having contracted Covid-19 while being treated for heart failure, was half of a double-act that partially eclipsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/morecambe-and-wise\" title=\"\">Morecambe and Wise</a> on British television in the late 1970s and early 80s.</p> <p>After years of success with the BBC had turned them into a national institution, Eric Morecambe and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/22/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Ernie Wise</a> were enticed to ITV in 1978, but through a combination of inferior scripts and Morecambe\u2019s deteriorating health the switch proved to be a disappointment, and marked the decline of Britain\u2019s top double-act.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the BBC groomed Little and Large to take their place in 11 series of extremely popular sketch/standup shows, which lasted from 1977 until 1991 and became a staple of Saturday evenings, attracting audiences of up to 18 million at their peak.</p> <p>While subtlety was hardly the forte of Little and Large, the basis of their comic relationship was nevertheless intriguing. The Syd Little half of the act was a bespectacled, timid, feeble-voiced singer and guitarist with \u201closer\u201d written all over him. Large believed \u2013 or pretended to believe, for his own and the audience\u2019s amusement \u2013 that Little was possessed of immense talent and poised on the brink of superstardom. There have been far worse comic dynamics than a hectoring, deluded hustler and the dim-witted and ill-at-ease target of his attentions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e446addd1a477e64cb4c62e7db10ed5c4b80d68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e446addd1a477e64cb4c62e7db10ed5c4b80d68/0_0_2849_1710/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Large, right, and Syd Little in 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Large, right, and Syd Little in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photonews Scotland/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The premise behind the relationship may have been unusual, but the shows were mostly simple knockabout slapstick and musical parody, unchallenging fare performed with style and often surprising grace \u2013 Large was a fine mimic, and the pair\u2019s contrasting physiques resulted in some charming recreations of Laurel and Hardy dance routines.</p> <p>Eddie Large was born Edward McGinnis in Glasgow. When he was 10, his family moved to Manchester \u2013 to a terraced house opposite Manchester City football club\u2019s Maine Road stadium. He attended Claremont Road school and, after leaving, tried various menial jobs. From early childhood he had liked the idea of being a professional comedian, but had no idea how to go about it.</p> <p>His comedy relationship with \u201cSupersonic Syd\u201d was grounded in reality and turned out to be his entry into the business. In 1963 Large was in the audience at the Stonemason\u2019s Arms in Wythenshawe, Manchester, when Little (born Cyril Mead) was performing his song-and-guitar act.</p> <p>Large, an intelligent and articulate man who always had finely tuned comic instincts, found the spectacle of the diffident and awkward Little irresistibly funny, and started to heckle him. They met for a drink after the show and discussed the comic possibilities of developing an act based around Little\u2019s efforts to entertain the public despite constant interruptions from his portly partner.</p> <p>Little and Large \u2013 there was a vogue at the time for double-acts adopting such names; Cannon and Ball were another example \u2013 began to appear at Manchester venues, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/19/guardianobituaries.obituaries1\" title=\"\">Bernard Manning</a>\u2019s Embassy Club in Harpurhey. They slogged around the clubs for years until they won a 1971 edition of Opportunity Knocks. But even after this, major success did not come immediately.</p> <p>Over the next few years they were occasional guests on other artists\u2019 television shows. In 1976 Royston Mayoh, a producer at Thames, persuaded his bosses to give the pair their own vehicle, The Little and Large Tellyshow, with Morecambe and Wise\u2019s writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/21/eddie-braben\" title=\"\">Eddie Braben</a> contributing to the scripts.</p> <p>In 1977 they moved to the BBC, where they stayed until 1991. Large, under his real name, wrote some of the material, and many other well-known writers joined Braben in providing scripts for the duo, including David Renwick, Raymond Allen, Barry Cryer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/08/broadcasting.obituaries\" title=\"\">John Junkin</a>. Now firmly established as stars, Little and Large capitalised on their television fame with sellout tours. They also appeared in a Royal Variety Show in 1977.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"470c155a2995423bd05ab81c7bb614e55db6c2a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/470c155a2995423bd05ab81c7bb614e55db6c2a3/0_136_5384_3232/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Large, left, and Syd Little the 1970s, at the time of their appearance on the TV talent show Opportunity Knocks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Large, left, and Syd Little in the 1970s, at the time of their appearance on the TV talent show Opportunity Knocks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fremantle Media/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It exasperated Large when members of the public sometimes told him he was more talented than his dithering and hapless partner and that he should abandon him and go it alone. \u201cDon\u2019t they get it?\u201d he would ask. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of the act!\u201d</p> <p>But backstage tensions were beginning to build. Large was a perfectionist, constantly checking props and cues, while Little took a more laidback approach. Years after the act split up, Large revealed that he was constantly worried that Little would forget his lines on stage.</p> <p>As time went on, their amiable and undemanding act started to look stale. It had about it a whiff of the northern clubs, while a new generation of talent was being forged in universities and comedy clubs. In 1988 and 1989 they appeared in the televised Comic Relief shows, but were missing from the next one, in 1991. The stars of that show \u2013 French and Saunders, Jonathan Ross, Paul Whitehouse, Harry Enfield, Vic Reeves \u2013 made Little and Large seem very much a part of the previous decade\u2019s entertainment scene. Little and Large were dropped by the BBC in the same year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3fa196faa7464c1e89d0dfb21919c232cafdba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3fa196faa7464c1e89d0dfb21919c232cafdba2/0_0_5100_3355/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Large, centre, and Syd Little, right, performing a scene from the musical Grease as part of a sketch for The Little and Large Show, 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Large, centre, and Syd Little, right, performing a scene from the musical Grease as part of a sketch for The Little and Large Show, 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radio Times/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They continued to tour theatres and clubs, but the law of diminishing returns had set in and Little and Large became bywords for everything that was uncool in British comedy, a sad fate for two skilled entertainers who had earned millions at the pinnacle of their success.</p> <p>In 2003, Large underwent a heart transplant operation at Papworth hospital, Cambridge. It marked the end of Little and Large as a regular team. In an interview with TV Times in 2010 Large revealed that they had not spoken for the previous eight years: \u201cHe lives up near Blackpool and I live near Bristol, so I haven\u2019t spoken to him in a long time.\u201d</p> <p>When fully recovered from the transplant, Large would never again operate at the hectic pace of the Little and Large heyday. His recent years were spent as a successful after-dinner speaker, an occasional TV actor in cameo roles, and a guest star on quiz and game shows.</p> <p>In spite of their estrangement, Little and Large did eventually become friends again and reunited for a couple of TV appearances \u2013 on Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway (2018) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjZz39AESnk\" title=\"\">Pointless Celebrities</a> (2019). </p> <p>Large was a lifelong fan of Manchester City and a keen golfer.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Patsy (nee Scott), whom he married in 1983, and by a son and two daughters, and three grandchildren.

  "<p>I first became aware of James Bond in 1989, which was not, I have since learned from Bondologists, a vintage Bond era. Two film posters were ubiquitous that summer: the first was for Batman, starring Michael Keaton, and the second was for Licence to Kill, starring Timothy Dalton. In the months leading up to the release of these films, I watched their trailers seemingly hundreds of times: they were both franchises about a superhero (because, really, what else is the ageless, unkillable Bond by this point?); both featured a good guy with a gun killing a lot of bad guys with guns; both lightened the bloodshed with a sprinkling of winking jokes. Yet while I queued up to see Batman the day it was released and have watched it about 3,000 times since, I not only never saw Licence to Kill but I have never watched a single Bond movie, ever. Honestly, the whole Bond thing repelled me then and repels me now.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get this out of the way: it\u2019s not the sexism. I don\u2019t care that the character is a tedious sexist anachronism who shags everything, especially, if <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I63XGBqRsmw\">he\u2019s played by Roger Moore and said thing is 30 years younger</a> than him. He\u2019s from a different era \u2013 I get it. But he\u2019s such a little boy\u2019s idea of sexy machismo, with those absurd dinner jackets and perfect hair and all that wankiness about martinis. He\u2019s an issue of GQ come to life, and you know he smells of terrible Armani colognes, just like GQ does. The comedy in Batman was genuinely funny and self-satirical: \u201cCan somebody tell me what kind of world we live in where a man dressed up as a <em>bat</em> gets all of my press?\u201d. But Bond\u2019s humour is self-serving and self-satisfied, the kind beloved by people who belong to private members\u2019 clubs. In short: \u201cLet me tell you a joke that will make me look marvellous and all the rest of you stupid and little.\u201d In his 2006 book on Bond, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/08/film\">The Man Who Saved Britain</a>, Simon Winder claims this is a reflection of Britain\u2019s psyche after the loss of empire: a desire to believe that Britain \u2013 in this case, represented by Bond \u2013 was still the coolest cat in the room. I\u2019m sure Winder is right, that Bond is basically Britain in breakdown mode. But like all breakdowns, it\u2019s painful to watch.</p> <p>How do you know when you\u2019ve never actually watched a Bond, I hear you ask? First, if you live in Britain, Bond is as unavoidable as the Premier League, or Carol Vorderman. Second, because irony of ironies, I ended up living with a strong Bond enthusiast, so at least twice a week I wander into the sitting room and he will be there watching a Bond movie. But it turns out one doesn\u2019t develop an appreciation for something by osmosis. After all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/05/the-guardian-view-on-test-match-special-60-years-of-tacit-pleasure\">Test Match Special</a> is on in pretty much every other room of our house and I still think cricket is an elaborate practical joke the world is playing on Americans.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw77HagbeHM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qw77HagbeHM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So fine, I said to the Guardian film desk, I\u2019ll watch a bloody Bond film, from opening shooting sequence to the end credits rolling while Bond shags another babe. The film desk decreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/sep/28/bond-spy-who-loved-me\">The Spy Who Loved Me</a> is \u201cthe Bondiest Bond\u201d, and so on a self-isolating night, with nothing else to do in the whole world, I finally watched my first Bond movie.</p> <p>Did it change my mind? Reader, it did not. I enjoyed the Carly Simon song, obviously. In fact, the opening was rather promising, especially Roger Moore\u2019s all-in-one yellow ski suit and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw77HagbeHM\">that </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw77HagbeHM\">entire incredibly enjoyable sequence</a> \u2013 even if Moore\u2019s stunt double looks endearingly nothing like him. But I spent the rest of the movie feeling confused. Why does Jaws kill people by biting their necks, instead of strangling them with his giant hands? And why is there no blood when he bites them? Why are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlYqQBKgQpo\">people watching a light show at the pyramids</a>? Do the pyramids need jazzing up? How good a kisser is Bond that, in 17 seconds, he can turn a woman from trying to kill him to trying to seduce him to sacrificing herself for him? And how does Moore keep his linen suits so clean? Oh yes, and there was some plot about a submarine tracking system or something that was so boring I fell asleep towards the end when I realised the movie was now entirely submarine-focused (as opposed to its superior ski-focused beginning).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epRVg9n0fD4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epRVg9n0fD4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Then there\u2019s Bond himself. Men of Britain, is this what you aspire to? And Moore is supposed to be the amusing smoothie of the Bond stable, right? \u201cTry reverse \u2013 that\u2019s backwards,\u201d he smirks to Barbara Bach, as she tries to drive them away from Jaws. \u201cMust go, something\u2019s come up,\u201d he smirks to another woman. He\u2019s a combination of Alan Partridge and the guy in the Far Side cartoon, Nerds in Hell, who asks the people around him: \u201cHot enough for ya?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/303500462371902140/\">as they enter Satan\u2019s lair</a>. He\u2019s not cool; he\u2019s the king of the dad joke, trapped in the most formulaic franchise ever. I went to see Batman because, thanks to director Tim Burton, it looked like nothing I\u2019d ever seen before. With Bond, originality is death, as over the years various directors have discovered to their misfortune. The best Bond, according to the fans, is one that looks like you might have watched it on ITV on a Sunday afternoon in 1985.</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry, Bond fans. Maybe you have to grow up with Bond to get Bond, because I cannot see the appeal beyond nostalgia. But I\u2019m equally willing to accept the fault lies with me. After all, I love plenty of stupid movies, and yet I could not have cared less about that stupid submarine plot, even though every single character tried to explain its importance to me in detail in every scene, in classic Basil Exposition style. So maybe Bond and I are both stupid. Just stupid in different ways.</p>",

It also remains within the UK\u2019s customs territory to allow it to benefit from any future trade deals secured by the British government. But the full EU customs code has to be enforced on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. All goods deemed at risk of travelling from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland would attract tariffs.</p> <p>The messy compromise allowed for the avoidance of a border on the island of Ireland but brings with it a host of potential flash points.</p> <p>The issue of a Belfast office was raised on Monday during the first teleconference meeting of the EU-UK joint committee, set up to supervise the operation of the withdrawal agreement. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, is the UK\u2019s senior figure on the committee.</p> <p>Under article 12 of the Northern Ireland protocol, the UK government is \u201cresponsible for implementing and applying the provisions of [EU] law\u201d but EU officials \u201cshall have the right to be present during any activities\u201d relating to checks and controls.</p> <p>The UK is obliged to \u201cfacilitate such presence of representatives and shall provide them with the information requested\u201d. The EU wants a base for its customs and veterinary experts.</p> <p>A European commission spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm that we have sent letters to the UK regarding a proposal to open a technical office in Belfast with specific technical capabilities to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. This issue was raised in the joint committee on Monday. We remain in contact with the UK on this point.\u201d</p> <p>A cross-party group of members of the Northern Ireland assembly has written to the prime minister backing the commission\u2019s proposal.</p> <p>Michelle O\u2019Neill of Sinn F\u00e9in, who is the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, along with the leaders of the Greens, the Social Democratic and Labour party and the Northern Ireland Alliance, wrote: \u201cAs party leaders representing a majority of citizens who voted to remain within the EU, we feel strongly that an office in Belfast is necessary to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland which you negotiated with the EU \u2026</p> <p>\u201cTo oppose the opening of such an office by the EU in Belfast represents an act of bad faith by your government and a breach of trust at this critical stage of the process.\u201d </p> <p>A spokesman for the UK government said it was considering the issue. He said: \u201cWe received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February. We have since received a follow-up letter to which we will respond in due course.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The US has agreed on a $2tn stimulus package, the largest economic stimulus in US history, in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19. While corporations will be the biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-bailout-what-you-need-to-know\">recipients of the bailout</a>, some of that money will be paid directly to Americans hit by the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Most taxpayers will get a check in the mail, while those directly affected by the economic effects of Covid-19 are slated to receive robust government support. </p> \n<p>Here\u2019s what we know so far about how the new stimulus package will directly affect Americans in the coming weeks:</p> \n<h2><strong>Who\u2019s eligible for a check from the government?</strong></h2> \n<p>Congress will spend about $250bn for checks up to $1,200 per person that will go directly to taxpayers.</p> \n<p>To be eligible for the full amount, a person\u2019s most recently filed tax return must show that they made $75,000 or under. For couples, who can receive a maximum of $2,400, the cutoff is $150,000.</p> \n<p>If a person makes more than $75,000, the amount given goes down incrementally by $5 for every $100 increase in salary. So a person who makes $85,000 would get $700 while a person who makes $95,000 would get $200.</p> \n<p>If a person makes above $99,000, or a couple makes above $198,000, no check will be given.</p> \n<p>There are some requirements and exceptions. Those getting a check must be living and working in the US and have a valid social security number. If a person is listed as a dependent on their parents\u2019 tax return \u2013 the case for many college students \u2013 they are excluded.</p> \n<p>The Tax Foundation, a DC-based thinktank, <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/cares-act-senate-coronavirus-bill-economic-relief-plan/\">estimates</a> that 93.6% of Americans will be eligible for a check coming from the stimulus package.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about parents?</strong></h2> \n<p>Taxpayers will be given $500 per child 16 or under listed as a dependent on their latest tax return.</p> \n<h2><strong>When will I get this money?</strong></h2> \n<p>That is still unclear. Experts <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/senate-deal-stimulus-checks-coronavirus/index.html\">say</a> that Americans will probably not get the money until May, given how long it takes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to send out checks. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-stimulus-checks-will-come-within-three-weeks-mnuchin-says.html\">said</a> those whose bank account information is already with the IRS from previous tax returns can expect a payment \u201cwithin three weeks\u201d.</p> \n<p>For those who still need to give the IRS their bank account information, a web-based portal will be opening soon to allow people to provide the IRS with their information. The IRS says this is to make sure people get their checks immediately, instead of sending them through the mail.</p> \n<p>This is not the first time the government has sent checks to Americans. The federal government <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/19/21185572/who-will-get-stimulus-checks-trump\">gave</a> up to $300 in 2001 and $600 in 2008 to taxpayers who met a certain income bracket to similarly stimulate the economy.</p> \n<h2><strong>What if a person did not file their 2018 or 2019 return?</strong></h2> \n<p>The IRS <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know\">recommends</a> people file their 2018 or 2019 tax return as soon as possible to get the payment. A check will be sent to any qualified person so long as they file their return within 2020.</p> \n<h2><strong>What if a person does not file their taxes?</strong></h2> \n<p>A person may still be eligible even if they do not file the taxes. The IRS <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know\">says</a> people who typically do not file taxes \u2013 low-income taxpayers and some veterans \u2013 will need to file a \u201csimple tax return\u201d in order to get the payment. Social security beneficiaries will not need to fill out the tax return, even if they do not file their taxes, to get the payment.</p> \n<h2><strong>Does the package help unemployed workers?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes, specifically the bill will increase unemployment insurance by $600 for 13 weeks \u2013 about four months \u2013 for every person, added to the existing unemployment compensation a person gets from their state\u2019s program. </p> \n<p>The length and amount of compensation varies from state to state. A majority of states providing a maximum of <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/policy-basics-how-many-weeks-of-unemployment-compensation-are-available\">26 weeks</a> of compensation, while average <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/some-states-much-better-prepared-than-others-for-recession#_ftn13\">weekly compensation</a> ranges from 20% of a person\u2019s wage to just over 50%.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about freelance and gig workers?</strong></h2> \n<p>While unemployment insurance typically does not cover people who are self-employed \u2013 freelancers, contractors and gig workers \u2013 the bill comes with a \u201cpandemic unemployment assistance\u201d measure that will extend insurance to those workers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"62e586ff-03e9-4a63-96be-8a47e65fc49b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xzfG7zApLT0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Ha</strong><strong>ve</strong><strong> there been any changes to paid leave?</strong></h2> \n<p>Not in this bill. Earlier last week, Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/16/paid-sick-leave-coronavirus-house-bill/\">bill</a> worth about $100bn meant to expand paid sick leave and emergency paid leave, but it came with major loopholes. Companies with over 500 employees were not mentioned in the bill, while companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions.</p> \n<p>The bill mandates 10 days of fully paid sick leave for employees of companies with 500 employees or less. Parents of those companies affected by their children\u2019s school closing and those leaving for medical reasons can get 12 weeks of pay at 67% of their salary.</p> \n<h2><strong>Will there be anything to offset healthcare costs related to Covid-19?</strong></h2> \n<p>Again, not in this bill. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act included a measure that mandated all Covid-19 testing is free, but treatment for any symptoms (there is currently no cure for the illness) still comes at a cost.</p> \n<p>A few states have reopened enrollment for their health insurance <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/uninsured-covid-19-health-care-coverage_n_5e739885c5b6f5b7c53fdfb8\">programs</a> to allow those concerned about costs to enroll, and three major health insurance companies said they will be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/30/824075753/good-news-with-caveats-some-insurers-waive-costs-to-patients-for-covid-19-treatm\">waiving</a> any high costs for treatment, but there are still stories of people getting bills for as much as <a href=\"https://time.com/5806312/coronavirus-treatment-cost/\">$34,000</a> to cover treatment of the virus\u2019s symptoms.</p>",

It also cited concerns about \u201cmultiple, new, and significant pending criminal and civil investigations\u201d.</p> <p>The Japanese conglomerate said it remained \u201cfully committed to the success of WeWork\u201d but \u201cseveral of those conditions were not met, leaving SoftBank no choice but to terminate the tender offer\u201d.</p> <p>The deal would have mostly benefited Neumann, who was lined up to sell $970m worth of shares even as thousands of WeWork employees were laid off with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/11/7/20953930/wework-adam-neumann-severance-laid-off-employees-layoffs-buyout-unicorn-ipo\">very little compensation</a>.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/23/wegeneration-work-rest-and-play-together-in-adam-neumanns-empire\">Adam Neumann</a>, his family, and certain large institutional stockholders, such as Benchmark Capital, were the parties who stood to benefit most from the tender offer,\u201d SoftBank said. \u201cTogether, Mr Neumann\u2019s and Benchmark\u2019s equity constitute more than half of the stock tendered in the offering. In contrast, current WeWork employees tendered less than 10% of the total.\u201d</p> <p>A special committee of WeWork\u2019s board said it was disappointed that SoftBank had pulled out of the deal and it was considering \u201call of its legal options, including litigation\u201d.</p> <p>The deal was hastily arranged in October 2019 as part of SoftBank\u2019s rescue of the office-space provider after its planned flotation on the stock market was scrapped. WeWork had repeatedly cut the price of the IPO as investors balked at its initial valuation of up to $65bn. Neumann could have made a potential $14.3bn paper fortune if the company had floated at the top end of estimates.</p> <p>Softbank\u2019s decision to pull out of the share deal means it will also no longer be obliged to provide WeWork with $1.1bn in debt financing, leaving the office space provider facing a cash crunch as many of its tenants across the world pull out because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 crisis</a> and government-imposed lockdown conditions.</p> <p>WeWork signs long-term leases with commercial landlords then rents that space to freelancers and small businesses, which have been particularly badly hit by the coronavirus crisis global economic shutdown. The company has warned its bondholders that it does not expect to hit its 2020 financial targets.</p> <p>WeWork has grown to become the single biggest office tenant in Manhattan, and the second-largest in London after the government. It has expanded from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/23/wegeneration-work-rest-and-play-together-in-adam-neumanns-empire\">offices to student halls-style communal living blocks</a>, private schools and luxury gyms and boot camps.</p> <p>The president of the Boston Federal Reserve bank, Eric Rosengren, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/28/hubris-of-a-high-flyer-how-investors-brought-wework-founder-down-to-earth\">warned in September</a> that the business model of co-working companies such as WeWork could make the next recession worse by sparking a run on commercial property.</p> <p>WeWork has signed long-term rental commitments worth $47bn with US landlords alone. If WeWork were to go bust its landlords would struggle to collect the promised lease payments they are owed. That could leave them unable to pay their bank loans, and in turn leave banks facing losses.</p> <p>At a company party in 2018 Neumann told his staff that WeWork\u2019s mission was to \u201cto elevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d and that \u201cthere are 150 million orphans in the world.

It warned potential investors: \u201cAdam\u2019s voting control will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate activities and, as a result, we may take actions that stockholders other than Adam do not view as beneficial.\u201d</p> <p>The prospectus demanded that each of \u201cAdam\u2019s\u201d shares should carry 20 times the votes of ordinary shares, and that his wife should have a say in selecting his successor should he die.</p> <p>He has also had to fend off damaging allegations about his conduct, including the revelation that he smoked cannabis on a private jet. The company said it would sell the $60m Gulfstream plane, which Neumann had used to attend tequila-fuelled parties with the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Will Smith\u2019s son Jaden.</p>",
  "<p>Only by coming together will the world be able to face down the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">ovid-19 pandemic </a>and its shattering consequences. At an emergency virtual meeting last Thursday, G20 leaders took steps in the right direction. But we are still far away from having a coordinated, articulated global response that meets the unprecedented magnitude of what we are facing.</p> <p>Far from flattening the curve of infection, we are still well behind it. The disease initially took 67 days to infect 100,000 people; soon, 100,000 people and more will be infected daily. Without concerted and courageous action, the number of new cases will almost certainly escalate into the millions, pushing health systems to breaking point, economies into a nosedive and people into despair, with the poorest hit hardest.<br><br>We must prepare for the worst and do everything to avoid it. Here is a three-point call to action \u2013 based on science, solidarity and smart policies \u2013 for doing just that.<br><br>First, suppress transmission of the coronavirus. <br><br>This requires aggressive and early testing and contact tracing, complemented by quarantines, treatment and measures to keep first responders safe, combined with measures to restrict movement and contact. Such steps, despite the disruptions they cause, must be sustained until therapies and a vaccine emerge. <br><br>Crucially, this robust and cooperative effort should be guided by the World Health Organization, a member of the United Nations family; countries acting on their own \u2013 as they must for their people \u2013 will not get the job done for all.<br><br>Second, tackle the devastating social and economic dimensions of the crisis. <br><br>The virus is spreading like wildfire, and is likely to move swiftly into the global south, where health systems face constraints, people are more vulnerable, and millions live in densely populated slums or crowded settlements for refugees and internally displaced persons. Fuelled by such conditions, the virus could devastate the developing world and then re-emerge where it was previously suppressed. In our interconnected world, we are only as strong as the weakest health systems.</p> <p>Clearly, we must fight the virus for all of humanity, with a focus on people, especially the most affected: women, older people, youth, low-wage workers, small and medium enterprises, the informal sector and vulnerable groups. <br><br>The United Nations has <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060702\">just issued reports</a> documenting how the viral contagion has become an economic contagion, and setting out the financing needed to address the shocks. The International Monetary Fund has declared that we have entered a recession as bad as or worse than in 2009. <br><br>We need a comprehensive multilateral response amounting to a double-digit percentage of global gross domestic product. <br><br>Developed countries can do it by themselves, and some are indeed doing it. But we must massively increase the resources available to the developing world by expanding the capacity of the IMF, namely through the issuance of special drawing rights, and of the other international financial institutions so that they can rapidly inject resources into the countries that need them. I know this is difficult as nations find themselves increasing domestic spending by record amounts. But that spending will be in vain if we don\u2019t control the virus.<br><br>Coordinated swaps among central banks can also bring liquidity to emerging economies. Debt alleviation must also be a priority \u2013 including immediate waivers on interest payments for 2020. <br><br>Third, recover better.<br><br>We simply cannot return to where we were before Covid-19 struck, with societies unnecessarily vulnerable to crisis. The pandemic has reminded us, in the starkest way possible, of the price we pay for weaknesses in health systems, social protections and public services. It has underscored and exacerbated inequalities, above all gender inequity, laying bare the way in which the formal economy has been sustained on the back of invisible and unpaid care labour. It has highlighted ongoing human rights challenges, including stigma and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/28/lockdowns-world-rise-domestic-violence\">violence against women</a>. <br><br>Now is the time to redouble our efforts to build more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and other global challenges. The recovery must lead to a different economy. Our roadmap remains the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\">2030 </a><a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\">agenda and </a><a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\">sustainable </a><a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\">development </a><a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\">goals</a>.<br><br>The United Nations system is fully mobilised: supporting country responses, placing our supply chains at the world\u2019s disposal, and advocating for a global ceasefire. <br><br>Ending the pandemic everywhere is both a moral imperative and a matter of enlightened self-interest.

  "<p>If Quentin Tarantino were to hand out a dollar for every \u201clost\u201d movie he never quite got round to making, he would soon find his wallet pretty light. The director of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood often resembles a gardener who has been blessed with fertile soil and a plentiful supply of creative seeds. He flings out ideas with cheery zeal, then sits back and waits to see which end up taking root.</p> <p>It\u2019s long been known that QT had considered a Luke Cage movie back in the 1990s, just after the film-maker had entered the public consciousness with his crime caper debut Reservoir Dogs. This makes sense: Cage was created in 1972, at the height of the blaxploitation era, and Tarantino has a passion for the genre that fed into his decision to plunge Pam Grier back into the limelight for the underrated Jackie Brown. The Marvel hero also teamed up in the comic books with Iron Fist, and we all know about Tarantino\u2019s penchant for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbDbOdKL9ZY\">kung-fu kicking </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbDbOdKL9ZY\">heroes with a thirst for bloody revenge</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/22/luke-cage-netflix-marvel-comics\">Luke Cage review \u2013 Marvel's powerful black superhero drama is bulletproof</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Appearing on Amy Schumer\u2019s podcast, 3 Girls, 1 Keith, <a href=\"https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/quentin-tarantino-talks-luke-cage-movie-he-almost-made/\">Tarantino revealed this week</a> that he considered casting Laurence Fishburne as Cage, otherwise known as Power Man. \u201cThere was a time before all this Marvel shit was coming out,\u201d Tarantino said. \u201cIt was after Reservoir Dogs, it was before Pulp Fiction, and I had thought about doing Luke Cage. Growing up I was a big comic-book collector, and my two favourite [comic books] were Luke Cage: Hero for Hire, later Luke Cage: Power Man, and Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu. </p> <p>\u201cWhat dissuaded me \u2026 was my comic-geek friends talked me out of it,\u201d Tarantino went on. \u201cBecause I had an idea that Larry Fishburne would\u2019ve been the perfect guy to play Luke Cage. But all my friends were like, \u2018It\u2019s got to be Wesley Snipes.\u2019 And I go, \u2018Look, I like Wesley Snipes, but Larry Fishburne is practically Marlon Brando. I think Fish is the man.\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, but he\u2019d have to get in shape in a big way. Snipes is that way already!\u2019 And I go, \u2018Fuck that! That\u2019s not that important! Fuck you, you ruined the whole damn thing!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Regular readers of this column will be well aware that it only took a <a href=\"https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/12/04/quentin-tarantino-on-what-he-wants-to-do-with-star-trek\">2015 interview on the Nerdist podcast</a>, in which Tarantino talked up the idea of directing an R-rated Star Trek movie, for him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/25/quentin-tarantino-star-trek-final-frontier\">to be offered the chance to do just that</a>. But while that project still seems to be alive, albeit with the Death Proof film-maker <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/6308346/quentin-tarantino-steering-away-from-star-trek-movie/\">currently playing down the prospect of his full involvement</a>, the chances of a Tarantino-directed Luke Cage movie ever happening are probably up there with the prospects of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2mmNcbuZPA\">\u201cSweet Christmas\u201d</a> becoming a popular youth expression. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/quentin-tarantino-final-film-theories-rumors\">QT purportedly only has one movie left to direct before he enters self-enforced retirement</a>, and Marvel isn\u2019t exactly the ideal employer for directors unwilling to toe the party line, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/16/ant-man-kevin-feige-rejects-marvel-criticism-over-edgar-wright-exit\">as Edgar Wright once found out to his cost</a>.</p> <p>Still, the prospect of jumping in a Hollywood time machine to go back and green light Tarantino\u2019s film is a tantalising one. While the Marvel Cinematic Universe would have been a very different beast, QT\u2019s idea of asking an actor of Fishburne\u2019s pedigree to bulk up to play a superhero, rather than employing the established action star Snipes, is exactly the kind of trick Marvel pulled off when casting Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. Instead it took Fishburne another two decades to make his first Marvel turn in 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/02/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-buzzing-micro-caper-with-a-sting-in-its-tail\">Ant-Man and the Wasp</a>. Meanwhile, Snipes got the role of vampiric antihero Blade in a trilogy of pre-MCU Marvel films, with mixed results.</p> <p>Luke Cage did end up making it to the screen, via Marvel\u2019s now-forgotten deal with Netflix to produce TV shows based on some of its lesser-known, New York-based superheroes. And perhaps herein lies the way for Tarantino, perennial culture vulture, to pursue his comic-book dream. After all, he <a href=\"https://collider.com/quentin-tarantino-western-tv-show-bounty-law/#images\">has already </a><a href=\"https://collider.com/quentin-tarantino-western-tv-show-bounty-law/#images\">hinted at loopholes to his </a><a href=\"https://collider.com/quentin-tarantino-western-tv-show-bounty-law/#images\">10-movie retirement plan</a>. Surely a TV show wouldn\u2019t count towards that total, and with the Netflix deal (and the Luke Cage show itself) now dead in the water, perhaps there\u2019s room for an R-rated Tarantino-led revival? Just don\u2019t mention that it would probably have to screen on Disney+.</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Marre, who has died aged 76, was a British documentary maker specialising in films about popular music of every possible kind. Widely travelled, and with eclectic taste, he had a lengthy career that included adventurous documentaries about music in Africa, the Americas, the UK and the US, and profiles of artists such as Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0395mzx\">Youssou N\u2019Dour</a> and Count Basie.</p> <p>His first major success was <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/roots-rock-reggae-a-jeremy-marre-documentary\">Roots Rock Reggae</a> (1977), which grew out of an earlier commission on the British reggae scene for the ITV arts programme Aquarius. Deciding that he needed to go to Jamaica to fully understand the music, Marre \u201cscraped together some money\u201d and travelled to Kingston, filming in lawless areas of the city. Threatened by some locals who accused him of being a CIA agent, he convinced them he was English only after they quizzed him about cricket. He returned with historic footage of artists including Bob Marley, Sly &amp; Robbie and Jimmy Cliff, but still had difficulty in placing the film. As Marre explained in an interview with <a href=\"https://frootsmag.com/\">fRoots magazine</a> in 2014, \u201cthe BBC said it was boring, and you can\u2019t mix music and politics, while PBS in America turned it down as communist propaganda. But it won a documentary prize at Cannes and then the BBC wanted to show it. It was different to anything, with no presenter and no commentary.\u201d It is now regarded as a classic film of the genre.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txwk5LE1sN0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Txwk5LE1sN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Mark Cooper, the former head of music television at the BBC, who worked with Marre on many of his films from 2005 on, called him \u201cone of the key architects of the \u2018rockumentary\u2019 and music films\u201d. \u201cWhat all his films had in common,\u201d Cooper said, \u201cwas great journalism, a desire to listen to the artist and a desire to give voice to the artist.\u201d</p> <p>Marre also had a knack of being in the right place at the right time. As a result he did not just chronicle popular music history, but helped to make it. He was in South Africa during the apartheid era, where he filmed black musicians long before the growing interest in world music brought them popularity in the west. Among those featured in Rhythm of Resistance (1979) was the Zulu choir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/14/joseph-shabalala-obituary\">Ladysmith Black Mambazo</a>. Paul Simon saw Marre\u2019s film and was so impressed that he decided to record with the group and other black South African musicians \u2013 and the result was his acclaimed 1986 album Graceland.</p> <p>Albert Mazibuko, the group\u2019s eldest surviving member, said: \u201cEveryone points to our work with Paul Simon as the moment we became well known around the world. However most people do not realise that if it wasn\u2019t for Jeremy Marre and his Rhythm of Resistance documentary, Paul Simon would never have known there was a Ladysmith Black Mambazo.\u201d</p> <p>Simon \u2013 with whom Marre would work later on a film about Graceland \u2013 said: \u201cJeremy had a deep curiosity and knowledge of a great deal of interesting music around the planet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97d5a7a87a455044544b3090aaa17f6f2b755696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97d5a7a87a455044544b3090aaa17f6f2b755696/0_97_1940_1164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ladysmith Black Mambazo in a Durban township church during the Rhythm of Resistance shoot in 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ladysmith Black Mambazo in a Durban township church during the Rhythm of Resistance shoot in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Marre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in north London to Ivan Marre, a consultant dermatologist, and his Russian-born wife, Olga (nee Shlain), Jeremy was educated at Highgate school, north London.

Over seven years he made 14 one-hour films, including Roots Rock Reggae and Rhythm of Resistance, that explored, as Marre put it, \u201cthe dynamic and often controversial role music plays within distinctive societies around the world \u2026 This music, sometimes called world music, is \u2013 in the words of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff \u2013 \u2018the cry of the people\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The series covered popular music styles from Latin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/12/lijadu-sisters-kehinde-taiwo-lijadu-nigeria-pop-music\">Nigerian</a>, Gypsy and Chinese. For <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cv8EK1bQXU\">Shotguns and Accordions (1983)</a> he travelled to the marijuana-growing areas of Colombia. Many of the films were shown on Channel 4, all of them were released on DVD and video, and they were accompanied by Marre\u2019s book of the same name.</p> <p>Marre made his reputation through world music films but moved on to cover a wide range of subjects. His prolific output included The Left-Handed Man of Madagascar (1990), which explored ancestor spirit festivals and which won a New York film festival award, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3aaHHMUUog\">On The Edge (1992)</a>, a four-hour C4 series on improvised music from around the world. Reigning in Hell (2006) investigated the feared American prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood. Marre also tackled more conventional subjects, such as with Classic Albums, a series that spanned 1997 to 2018, but always retained a distinctive film-making style. <br></p> <p>Towards the end of his career, Marre made a series of profiles of musical celebrities, such as Otis Redding (2013) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/may/07/count-basie-jazz\">Count Basie</a> (2018). He used as little voiceover and commentary as possible, and never appeared in his own films, but instead used such techniques as getting an actor to voice the artist\u2019s diaries. \u201cHe liked the films to breathe \u2026 and the subjects and contributors and archive to speak,\u201d said Cooper. He was good at \u201cwinning the trust of his subjects because he was genuinely interested in them\u201d. So he was able to persuade Redding\u2019s wife and daughter to contribute to his profile, and discovered unseen archive from Count Basie\u2019s estate \u201cthat gives a sense of Basie the man and the human being \u2013 and that\u2019s vintage Jeremy\u201d, said Cooper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/11/jeremy-marre-obituary-letter\">Letter: Jeremy Marre and the Grateful Dead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The singer Pauline Black of the British Ska revival band The Selecter, who was involved in Marre\u2019s programmes Soul Britannia (2007) and Reggae Britannia (2011), said that \u201cJeremy\u2019s singular skill was allowing British black folks to tell our own story in our own words\u201d.</p> <p>Marre even made an impression on \u201cthe godfather of soul\u2019\u201d, James Brown.

  "<p>The number of potential modern slavery victims identified in the UK has risen by 52% in a year to a record high, official figures have revealed.</p> <p>In 2019, 10,627 potential victims of modern slavery were referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), the official system through which victims of modern slavery are identified and provided with support. This was up from 6,986 in 2018.</p> <p>Of these, officials decided there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe 8,429 were victims of modern slavery, meaning they were provided with at least 45 days of specialist support including in some cases accommodation. Just over 1,000 of the referrals were determined not to be cases of modern slavery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-record-51-rise-in-modern-slavery-offences-in-a-year\">UK police record 51% rise in modern slavery offences in a year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But all 8,429 who received a \u201creasonable grounds\u201d decision are awaiting a \u201cconclusive grounds\u201d decision, the next stage in the process. This means around 80% of 2019 referrals are awaiting a conclusive decision, compared to just 38% of referrals for 2018 as of 10 February 2020.</p> <p>Modern slavery includes human trafficking, slavery, servitude or forced labour.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cGrowing awareness of modern slavery and better training for first responders has improved the way this abuse is tackled and led to more referrals of potential victims.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office data shows that just over half of referrals were for individuals who claimed they had been exploited as adults.</p> <p>Of the potential victims referred in 2019, two-thirds claimed that the exploitation occurred in the UK only.</p> <p>The most common type of exploitation in 2019 for both adults and minors was labour exploitation.</p> <p>However, in the final quarter, officials started splitting a new category of \u201ccriminal exploitation\u201d from labour exploitation.</p> <p>The change revealed the majority of potential child victims of modern slavery were for criminal exploitation and this was being driven by an increase in the identification of county lines cases, the Home Office said. County lines is used to describe drug gangs in large cities expanding their reach to small towns.</p> <p>Law enforcement in the UK is utilising modern slavery legislation against county lines offenders; alongside charges for drugs offences, gang members are increasingly facing human trafficking charges.</p> <p>The three most common nationalities of potential victims referred to the NRM were UK, Albanian and Vietnamese.</p> <p>The UK last week became the first country to publish a government modern slavery statement, which sets out how the UK government is tackling the crime in its own supply chains.</p> <p>Thousands of businesses are currently required to publish annual modern slavery statements under the Modern Slavery Act.</p> <p>The UK government published its own statement, which assessed the risk of modern slavery across around \u00a350bn of its annual spending. Individual ministerial departments will publish their modern slavery statements from 2020-21.</p>",

I mean, we have been humbled in a way that we could have never imagined,\u201d said Lopez, who is one of the doctors operating the Covid-19 unit. \u201cThe fact is that we serve such an enormous population.\u201d</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic spreading exponentially across the world is pushing hospitals in rural Georgia, already limited in resources and staff, to the brink. In the past decade, <a href=\"https://www.ivantageindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CCRH_Vulnerability-Research_FiNAL-02.14.20.pdf\">seven hospitals</a> in rural communities have closed across the state, with 2019 being the worst year in seeing closures nationwide, according to a report from Chartis Center for Rural Health. It has left tens of thousands of Georgians without access to medical care in their communities.</p> <p>Dougherty is already strained, with only <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-widely-millions-of-older-americans-live-in-counties-with-no-icu-beds/\">50 ICU beds</a> in the entire county, according to data compiled by Kaiser Health News. Of the 38 beds at Phoebe Putney Memorial, 35 were filled with Covid-19 patients one Monday evening in March, a spokesperson for the hospital told the Guardian.</p> <p>The hospital has two drive-thrus to test those potentially infected. Phoebe Putney Memorial is also surrounded by four counties with no hospital. Even before potential cases of coronavirus appeared in the community three weeks ago, healthcare struggles were commonplace in the majority African American county, like they are in much of rural America.</p> <p>The county commissioner in Dougherty has asked residents to shelter-in-place, similar to mandates issued in California and New York, as medical staff at the hospital work long hours with shortages of N95 masks, ventilators, dialysis machines, medication and even nursing staff.</p> <p>As the tally of cases spike each day, rural counties like this one in Georgia struggle to take care of the hundreds of people who worry they may have the coronavirus. Many of them are already dealing with serious health issues. A third of the population lives in poverty and the median income is just over $37,000.</p> <p>\u201cThe patients have multiple comorbidities [and] they don\u2019t have enough money for their heart failure medications, they\u2019re on dialysis [and] with their strong religious beliefs they want everything to be done. And it is, it\u2019s an enormous amount of work, even before this,\u201d said Lopez.</p> <p>The third ICU at Phoebe Putney, the surgical care unit, has now become the third Covid unit, said Dr Steven Kitchen, chief medical officer at Phoebe Putney.</p> <p>\u201cA matter of great concern is Phoebe Putney is approaching its capacity,\u201d said Bo Dorough, the Albany mayor, in a recent <a href=\"https://www.walb.com/2020/03/22/watch-live-dougherty-co-leaders-address-covid-latest-sunday-press-conference/\">live-streamed press conference</a> as the county commissioner, Christopher Cohilas, pleaded with people to stop holding large cookouts during the shelter-in-place. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent a medical officer to the hospital to investigate the explosion of cases in the county.</p> <p>As his colleagues who test positive are quarantined, Lopez and others continue on for the community.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very dark time in our history, and it\u2019s going to go down in the history books but, you know, it\u2019s bringing out the best in all of us. The fact that we stand together. And we\u2019re fighting for our own patients [and] we\u2019re fighting for our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Dr James Black, the medical director for emergency medicine, who is operating the Covid-19 command center, said volunteers have mobilized to sew hundreds of mask covers due to the N95 mask shortage because there is no way to restock supplies for the dozens of staff working around the clock.</p> <p>On the hospital\u2019s Facebook page, someone from the official account posted instructions to sew together makeshift mask covers from linens.</p> <p>Even the chief medical officer pushes around a cart full of treats and food and goes to every unit, whether a coronavirus unit or not, to raise spirits, Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Lopez continues to report to work, sleeping in a cramped section of his home, living in isolation as he continues to treat patients, speaking to his family through the door, he says, replaying those hours of work at night. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I lie there thinking to myself, others have died fighting this thing. Am I next?\u201d he asks.</p>",

  "<p>In these times when \u201ctoo, too solid flesh\u201d is something we long for, this meta-textual production of Hamlet proves both a fascinating and frustrating exploration of live performance.</p> <p>This is a show preoccupied with ghosts, especially those of Hamlets past. In 1964, Richard Burton starred in John Gielgud\u2019s Broadway production, which, in a pioneering move, was recorded with multiple cameras and shown in cinemas across the US. \u201cThe immediacy,\u201d Burton said in a trailer, \u201cthe sense of being there, is unlike any experience you have ever known.\u201d The master tapes were meant to be destroyed after the four scheduled showings, but two copies survived. Forty-two years later, New York-based avant-garde company the Wooster Group edited and reconstructed Burton\u2019s production on stage. In 2013 they filmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/12/hamlet-wooster-edinburgh-2013-review\">their production</a>, at Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Lyceum theatre, and in light of the shutdown have made it <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/402174311/c2aa32a43d\">freely available online</a> until 7 April.</p> <p>We watch through a single static camera. On a largely undressed stage, a projection shows the grainy black-and-white 1964 film. Scott Shepherd, playing Hamlet, explains how he has edited the original film, plucking out pauses he dislikes and controlling Burton\u2019s performance like one of his players. Synchronising their words and movements to the edits, the Wooster Group\u2019s performances are jagged, jolting comically to keep up with the jump-cuts and fast-forwarded scenes. It\u2019s a striking spectacle, a challenging provocation and a playful demonstration of control, but the unnatural metre untethers the words from their meanings, and the lack of emotion gradually becomes tiresome.</p> <p>The ideas beneath the layers of performance \u2013 how long should a legacy last? Are all performances haunted by their predecessors? Can a camera capture the rapture of an audience? \u2013 are easier to engage with in a theatre or cinema, where attention is undivided. At home, it\u2019s easy for distractions to win out, particularly when the one-shot archival recording lacks the multi-camera richness of the NT Live or other screen versions. The static nature of both camera and performance seems to strip away the sense of immediacy, and as a result, it all feels <em>less</em> like actually being there.</p> <ul> <li><p>Online (<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/402174311/c2aa32a43d\" title=\"https://vimeo.com/402174311/c2aa32a43d\">Vimeo link</a>, until 7 April)</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>It can take a grave national crisis to fire a flare, revealing the ugliest features of a society defined by injustices that the wealthy and powerful would rather forget. It took the second world war to achieve what the Jarrow hunger marches of the 1930s struggled for: to illustrate the national shame that millions of people who were called upon to make grand sacrifices were afflicted by poverty and malnourishment. As child evacuees with hungry bellies arrived on the doorsteps of the relatively well-to-do, the other Britain could no longer be ignored. \u201cA revolutionary moment in the world\u2019s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching,\u201d declared William Beveridge as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/poor-report-75-years-william-beveridge-britain-inequality-tories\">laid the foundations for the post</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/poor-report-75-years-william-beveridge-britain-inequality-tories\">war welfare state</a>. Unprecedented state direction of the economy meant that Labour\u2019s ambitious programme of nationalisation no longer seemed quite so scary. The old order perished in the rubble of war-ravaged Britain.</p> <p>Coronavirus has done two things: it has magnified existing social crises and has proved that the government can act decisively when the will is there. Millions are only ever one pay packet away from destitution; the self-employed and gig economy workers lack security and basic rights; private tenants are at the mercy of their landlords; our welfare state is woefully inadequate; and many designated \u201ckey workers\u201d are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/07/second-class-nhs-workers-struggle-as-pay-gap-widens\">desperately undervalued and badly paid</a>. Who, in good faith, can<strong> </strong>now blind themselves to these grim truths?</p> <p>A party that has poured scorn on the idea of a magic money tree can uncover an entire forest of them, in the form of a multibillion-pound stimulus, \u00a3350bn-worth of support and writing the paycheques of millions of workers. A government that has overseen surging homelessness can suddenly order the abolition of rough sleeping by decree. Years of slashing the welfare state give way to unilaterally hiking universal credit, albeit from a derisory sum to one that is merely paltry; and decades of worshipping at the altar of the market abruptly cease as rail franchising is suspended \u2013 half way to public ownership \u2013 while <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/commissioners/nhs-england-takes-over-ccg-powers/7027203.article\">the NHS\u2019s fragmentation is reversed </a>and there is even chatter about the <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/business/airline-industry-part-nationalised-rescue-plan-save-thousands-jobs-2504972\">partial nationalisation of the airlines</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/young-people-have-paid-enough-spare-them-from-footing-the-coronavirus-bill\">Young people have paid enough \u2013\u00a0spare them from footing the coronavirus bill | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Tories have not metamorphosised into Corbynites: these are drastic temporary measures to preserve capitalism, and state control should not automatically be confused with socialism, which is a project to democratise the economy and society. The question is: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/britain-covid-19-predictions\">what comes next</a>? Post-coronavirus Britain will bequeath a massive financial deficit. The Tories then have two choices. They could reject the need to balance the books through drastic cuts to public services, and thereby reveal that the post-2010 austerity was a political choice, not a necessity. The other is to reprise George Osborne\u2019s decimation of the public realm: but, this time round, they will face profound challenges. Consent, or at least acquiescence, for Osbornomics was founded on claims that reckless spending by Labour was at the root of Britain\u2019s economic ailments, fused with a narrative that valuable hard-earned taxpayers\u2019 money was frittered away on the undeserving poor, the \u201cscrounger\u201d and the \u201cshirker\u201d.</p> <p>But the voters who delivered Johnson his majority in 2019 in the so-called red wall areas \u2013 either by voting Tory or staying at home \u2013 are often socially conservative, but committed to economic interventionism. The Tories, therefore, have no electoral mandate for a renewed bout of austerity. Now with even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/britain-benefits-rishi-sunak-claimants-austerity\">middle-class people sucked into the welfare state</a> is a renewed onslaught against social security really politically palatable?</p> <p>A reshaping of British society is by no means an inevitability. Labour has just suffered a catastrophic drubbing, and an election is a distant prospect. Boris Johnson may troll Margaret Thatcher in her grave by declaring that \u201cthere is such a thing as society\u201d, but we have been fed a diet of rampant dog-eat-dog individualism for over a generation. This is why a \u201cblame the public\u201d strategy has had some success: by focusing scrutiny on individuals failing to abide by social distancing rather than the government\u2019s botched response.</p> <p>Much of the left mistakenly believed that they would become the obvious beneficiaries of the 2008 financial crash, even though previous crises of capitalism \u2013 in the 1930s and 1970s \u2013 principally benefited the right. As free market economist Milton Friedman aptly put it: \u201cOnly a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change.\u201d But his caveat was important: \u201cWhen that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.\u201d When Lehman Brothers imploded, the left\u2019s intellectual cupboard was bare.</p> <p>It is not macabre opportunism to debate what society looks like after the gravest crisis since the war: it is a necessity secondary only to overcoming the pandemic itself. This is a social and economic crisis, so who will pay is a question that must inevitably be asked and answered. The left is battered, bruised, demoralised, but its voice must be heard in this national conversation. While the Labour left will be ejected from the leadership, the democratic<strong> </strong>mandate of the inevitable winner, Keir Starmer \u2013 who has proclaimed the 2017 manifesto as the party\u2019s \u201cfoundational document\u201d \u2013 is rooted in policies championed by the left in its wilderness years. There is a thriving ecosystem of left thinktanks \u2013 such as the Institute for Public Policy Research \u2013 and left economists and intellectuals.</p> <p>Johnson and Dominic Cummings are wily operators, having proved that they were willing and able to raid both the rhetoric and substance of the left. Beveridge was right: these moments are times for revolutions, not for patching, and a looming danger is that the new populist right may understand this better than Labour or the US Democrats. It has taken the horror of a pandemic to expose deliberately ignored social ills. What comes next must cure them for good.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p> <blockquote> </blockquote>",
  "<p>As the plane descended into Guatemala City, Mar\u00eda tried to calm her six-year-old niece. \u201cMami, I feel like I\u2019m falling,\u201d the girl told her from the window seat next to her. Mar\u00eda, 26, was scared too, and not just because this deportation flight was her first time in the air. They were returning to Guatemala \u2013 the country they had fled after a gang murdered all their living relatives.</p> <p>The pair had been reunited in a Phoenix-area airport just a few hours before, nearly a year after border officials at an Arizona port of entry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/25/family-separation-trump-immigration-nonparents\">separated them</a>. Mar\u00eda had raised her niece as a daughter since the girl was an infant. But border officials did not recognize them as a family unit and sent the girl to foster care in New York and Mar\u00eda to an immigrant detention center in Arizona.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda, who could not shake the memory of her little girl being ripped out of her arms, had waited a year to hug her niece. They both wept. The moment was bittersweet.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda and her girl landed in Guatemala as the coronavirus was taking hold in countries around the world. On the day of their deportation flight, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">declared</a> the rapidly growing outbreak a pandemic.</p> <p>The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated concerns for immigrants held in detention centers across the US. At least four migrant children in government shelters in New York have tested positive for Covid-19, as have six adult detainees and five detention officers. Immigrant rights advocates, health experts, some members of Congress and even a former official for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) are calling for detainees to be released due to the risks of the virus spreading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0dda7d84133eb707857a832424d7e607aa6b885\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0dda7d84133eb707857a832424d7e607aa6b885/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Arizona state representative Kelli Butler calls on Ice to grant Mar\u00eda\u2019s parole in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Arizona state representative Kelli Butler calls on Ice to grant Mar\u00eda\u2019s parole in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jude Joffe-Block/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For deported asylum seekers like Mar\u00eda, the crisis means many are returning to even more dire situations than the threats they originally fled. In Guatemala, the local economy is paralyzed by the pandemic, with businesses and many government offices shuttered. For those arriving on deportation flights, finding jobs and housing has become all but impossible.</p> <p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> <p>The US has deported more than 11,600 people to Guatemala since the beginning of this year, according to data from Guatemala\u2019s Migration Institute. As the corona crisis intensified, concern grew among Guatemalan officials about deportation flights contributing to the spread of Covid-19. Within a week of Mar\u00eda\u2019s 11 March arrival, the Guatemalan government closed its borders and <a href=\"https://www.minex.gob.gt/noticias/Noticia.aspx?id=28628\">announced</a> no new deportation flights from the US could come in until Guatemala prepared new health protocols for repatriated citizens. The flights resumed a few days later but are now less frequent.</p> <p>Ice has begun taking the temperatures of immigrants before they board. Anyone testing above 100.4F gets referred to a medical screening. Guatemalan officials check again when the passengers deplane. The repatriated citizens are then instructed to self-quarantine. Still, a 29-year-old man on a 26 March deportation flight from Arizona tested positive for Covid-19 over the weekend, Guatemala\u2019s health ministry confirmed, and became the country\u2019s 36th case. (The country had confirmed 10 more cases, as of Wednesday night.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/25/family-separation-trump-immigration-nonparents\">She raised her niece like a daughter.

The agency said before he was deported, the man was booked into a Calexico, California, facility on 5 March and was transferred to a facility in Florence, Arizona, on 17 March.</p> <p>Officials at Guatemala\u2019s foreign relations ministry have said they will continue to receive deportation flights for now.</p> <p>When<strong> </strong>Mar\u00eda and her niece arrived at the Guatemalan airport<strong>,</strong> local authorities took their temperatures but didn\u2019t offer any further assistance or support, Mar\u00eda told the Guardian in Spanish.</p> <p>The pair\u2019s first days in Guatemala were confusing, she said.</p> <p>As she had no family left in the country, her former cellmate at the Eloy detention center offered her a place to stay. But American officials had failed to give Mar\u00eda back her Guatemalan ID before her flight, and with Guatemalan government offices closed amid the pandemic, she cannot replace it.</p> <p>She tried to bring a sense of normalcy to her little girl\u2019s life. They went to church, they celebrated the girl\u2019s seventh birthday and they had Guatemala\u2019s classic Pollo Campero chicken. Mar\u00eda was relieved to eat something besides the potato-based meals served in detention. But with the pandemic lurking, things were anything but normal.</p> <p>Eleven days after Mar\u00eda arrived, President Alejandro Giammattei, a former doctor, instituted a nationwide lockdown between 4pm and 4am every day. Since then, Guatemala\u2019s national civil police have detained more than 5,000 people for violating the rules. Public service announcements show images of deserted streets, bridges and bus stops.

Migrant shelters in Guatemala have reported requests for help from not only migrants and those recently deported, but also Guatemalans who have lost their livelihoods due to the shut-down economy. The global pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of populations already living on the fringes, said Father Mauro Verzeletti, director of Casa del Migrante, a shelter in Guatemala City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65b0042a87cc47589203c6242c1ca05bb285c59e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65b0042a87cc47589203c6242c1ca05bb285c59e/0_96_2903_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers wearing face masks wave the Guatemalan flag from a police truck on the streets of the Chacara neighborhood during a partial curfew ordered by the government, in Guatemala City on 27 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers wearing face masks wave the Guatemalan flag from a police truck on the streets of the Ch\u00e1cara neighborhood during a partial curfew ordered by the government, in Guatemala City on 27 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a recent tweet, Guatemala\u2019s ombudsman for human rights, Jord\u00e1n Rodas Andrade, called for a moratorium on deportations, or at least a slowdown, that would allow the country\u2019s system of shelters to ramp up to meet the needs of these populations. But deportation proceedings for many detained immigrants have continued. The US government is requiring immigration attorneys to bring their own N95 masks, eye protection and gloves at a time when those items are in short supply for healthcare workers. And under new border policies adopted by the Trump administration since the Covid-19 pandemic, most migrants and asylum seekers apprehended crossing the border are now swiftly returned to their countries.

Under the lockdown, she has had to put her search on hold.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda\u2019s options in Guatemala are limited, particularly since it is not safe for her to go back to her home town. She and her little girl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/25/family-separation-trump-immigration-nonparents\">fled Guatemala</a> for the US in late 2018 after the same gang that murdered Mar\u00eda\u2019s entire family over a land dispute, including the little girl\u2019s mother, killed Mar\u00eda\u2019s partner and shot at Mar\u00eda. Last summer, a US immigration judge found Mar\u00eda\u2019s account credible but decided her case did not meet the narrow legal standard for asylum. Mar\u00eda filed an appeal but could no longer endure being locked up away from her niece.

  "<p>The coronavirus is thought to spread largely via person-to-person contact, but it can also live on surfaces \u2013 including food packaging \u2013 for several days. While some how-to videos and articles are encouraging people to disinfect grocery containers, mail and other packages entering the home, experts say that is probably overkill.</p> <p>Below are step-by-step tips from experts about how to get what you need from the store and limit your exposure to the virus as much as possible.</p> <h2>Limit your trips and go when stores are less crowded</h2> <p>Experts advise limiting grocery trips to once every two weeks, if possible. This may mean stocking up on dry goods, and frozen or canned fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>If you can, plan to shop during off-peak hours. Some stores are setting aside times for older and immunocompromised people to shop with reduced crowds. Keep a distance of at least <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html\">six feet</a> from other shoppers.</p> <p>Plan what you need before you go to minimize your time in the supermarket.</p> <h2>Clean your hands and disinfect your cart</h2> <p>\u201cAs soon as you get there, use hand sanitizer, and touch only what you need to touch. Wipe down your cart handle, and then use the hand sanitizer again,\u201d said Elizabeth Eckstrom, professor and chief of geriatrics at Oregon Health and Science University. </p> <p>Shoppers should also avoid touching their phones or wipe them down after any possible contamination, said Julia Marcus, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor in the department of population medicine at Harvard Medical School. Gloves are not necessary, she said.</p> <p>\u201cGenerally when we use gloves outside of the healthcare setting and just in the community, they tend to become like a second skin. We end up touching our faces, and they may actually make us feel like we\u2019re not at risk but they themselves can become contaminated and may actually be a better surface for the virus to persist on than our own skin,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>You don\u2019t need to sanitize food packaging</h2> <p>While the coronavirus is not thought to be transmissible via food, it can live for several days on materials used to package food. Preliminary research shows it can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/how-long-coronavirus-lasts-on-surfaces-packages-groceries\">survive</a> on cardboard for 24 hours and on plastic for 72 hours. But the amount of the virus also quickly declines during that time period.</p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control currently does not recommend disinfecting packaging. And Marcus said shoppers should instead thoroughly wash their hands after handling any item that might have been touched by others.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no evidence that transmission is happening through food packaging. That said, we know the virus can remain viable on surfaces for hours or even days, so there\u2019s a hypothetical risk of transmission through touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cBetter than disinfecting, the thing we keep saying over and over again is to just wash your hands.\u201d</p> <p>Donald W Schaffner, a food microbiologist and professor at Rutgers University, has firmly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bugcounter/status/1243319180851580929?s=20\">pushed back</a> on viral advice for people to disinfect food packaging.</p> <p>\u201cRight now there\u2019s no evidence that [the virus is] spread through food. There\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s spread through food packaging. That doesn\u2019t mean that we might not learn new evidence tomorrow that would change our thoughts on that, but right now that\u2019s what we believe,\u201d Schaffner said.</p> <p>While the US government has provided a list of <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2\">cleaning products</a> that can kill the virus, most of them should not come into contact with food. Schaffner said people using them may expose themselves to chemicals that are designed for use on hard surfaces, not disinfecting groceries. <br><br>Food safety experts also say produce should be washed <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/do-not-wash-fruits-vegetables-with-soap.html\">only with water</a> and not household dish soap.</p> <h2>Do not go to the store, or any public spaces, if you have been exposed to the coronavirus or are experiencing symptoms</h2> <p>People are thought to be most contagious when they are exhibiting symptoms. But the virus can also spread from people who don\u2019t yet have symptoms or who have the virus but never get sick.</p> <h2>If you are 60 or older or have a compromised immune system, have your groceries delivered</h2> <p>Early statistics show that the older you are, the more likely you are to get critically ill or die if you contract the coronavirus, Eckstrom said. The CDC finds that the death rate for people 65 to 84 years old is 3% to 11%, and the death rate for people 85 and older is 10% to 27%.</p> <p>\u201cAge matters,\u201d Eckstrom said. \u201cAnd then if you\u2019ve got chronic illnesses \u2013 and those kind of boil down to heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, immunosuppressed status \u2013 then you\u2019ll also have to be much more cautious.\u201d</p> <p>If you have groceries brought to you, ask the delivery person or friend or family member to leave the bags outside. Tip electronically, if you can. Clean any surfaces the bags touch, and wash your hands thoroughly after storing food. Experts also advise frequently cleaning high-touch surfaces in the home, including door knobs and light switches.</p>",

The prime minister said he did not want parents to have to choose between feeding their children and having their children cared for and educated.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is going to take enough from Australians without putting Australian parents in that position,\u201d he said. </p> <p>From Monday, the government will start making payments to childcare centres at the rate of about 50% of the usual fees but based on attendance numbers in late February, before the numbers of children attending plummeted.</p> <p>The government estimates these payments will be worth $1.6bn over the coming three months. Centres may also be eligible to claim the new wage subsidies of $1,500 per worker a fortnight.</p> <p>In return for receiving the new government payments, childcare services will be prohibited from charging families a fee \u2013 including an out-of-pocket or gap fee \u2013 and must stay open unless forced to shut on public health advice. Centres have been told to prioritise care to essential workers, vulnerable and disadvantaged children and previously enrolled children.</p> <p>The education minister, Dan Tehan, said the government was \u201cturning off\u201d the complex old funding system because it was \u201cdrafted for a pre-pandemic time\u201d.

We can change the way we live, but it doesn\u2019t change who we are.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison became emotional as he recounted being told stories by his grandmother about what they used to do as a family to get through the Great Depression.</p> <p>While the prime minister said it was a great comfort to him that his family had joined him in Canberra, he added that it was difficult to \u201cimagine the world on the other side of this and to give your family some positive and encouraging news about how amazing Australia is and how we all come out of this\u201d.</p> <p>Parliament will return on Wednesday next week to pass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/australia-to-subsidise-wages-of-up-to-6m-workers-in-130bn-coronavirus-plan\">the $130bn wages subsidy package</a>, which aims to help up to 6m Australians who face an uncertain economic future, the latest in a series of stimulus and support measures.

As we need to call the parliament together, we will, and it will continue to do its job.</p> <p>\u201cEqually, our parliamentarians, while they may not be meeting here, I know they are working incredibly hard in their communities.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison suggested MPs were busy helping their constituents contend with challenges posed by the current crisis and \u201cfrankly, they have got a bigger job to do out there in their communities at the moment than they would have here [in Canberra]\u201d.</p> <p>On Thursday the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, wrote to Morrison asking for the creation of a joint committee with a non-government chair and 11 members: four from the Liberal and National parties, three from Labor, one Green and three crossbench MPs or senators.</p> <p>The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick who supports the plan, said a joint committee would \u201callow both houses to provide oversight, but a fallback position would be to have the Senate initiate a committee\u201d - a threat to proceed with or without government support.</p>",

With many falling through <strong>the </strong><strong>social security safety net they were relying on, these pay increases [are] to keep them afloat</strong>.</p> \n   <p>We have been fielding calls all day from concerned members who feel betrayed and abandoned. We will be holding meetings tomorrow to discuss the way forward while we continue to demand further information from the government about the background to the decision and how we can navigate a fairer outcome.</p> \n   <p>As it stands, <strong>the</strong> <strong>premier has single-handedly thrown out the rule book of negotiations and good faith</strong> by making decisions on the run without consultation. This decision, if implemented as stated, will deny frontline workers their rightful remuneration increases, which have been negotiated in good faith, with some taking years to achieve.</p> \n   <p>In <strong>something more akin to the Newman years</strong>, it seems the Labor state government has thrown hard-working frontline essential workers to the wolves at the very time we need them the most.</p> \n   <p>In one breath they talk about what a great job our frontline public services workers are doing, then in the next denying them wage increases that have been earned through productivity gains and improvements. Some of these workers have not had pay rises for two years.</p> \n   <p>These are the <strong>public sector workers who make sure ventilators and vital hospital equipment are safe</strong>, they ensure our rail and road networks are safe for commuters and our communities. And of course without power industry workers, there would be no working from home, no Netflix, no air conditioners and many other things our community often takes for granted.</p> \n   <p>Workers risking their lives to keep fellow Queenslanders safe <strong>deserve far better from a premier who seems to have gone weak at knees when attacked by a rabid rightwing media pack, cheered on by a former premier who sacked more than 12,000 public service workers.</strong></p> \n   <p>We believe we can find a way to work with the premier and treasurer to help bolster the economy, but suppressing wages is not the way.

But they\u2019re accountable to the people through the parliament. We\u2019ll talk to the crossbenchers in the House and the Senate. There\u2019s already been some of those discussions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Bowen is asked if this demonstrates a break from bipartisanship. Does Labor believe the government is failing? Bowen replies:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No. Bipartisanship does not mean being silent. Bipartisanship does not mean walking away from parliamentary accountability. It means giving the government support for everything they want to do and appropriately as the opposition, calling for more, calling for accountability and transparency and more action. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. A breakdown in bipartisanship would be refusing to cooperate with passing legislation or criticising actions they\u2019re taking. What we are doing is constructively suggesting what more could and should be done.</p> \n   <p>We think a parliament should be sitting and have been very cooperative in obviously coming up with ways where the parliament can sit more safely, with few staff and all those arrangements. But that doesn\u2019t mean we think the parliament should shut up shop.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T05:41:31.774Z\">at 6.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8577728f0866297e9f56d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T05:32:57.650Z\">6.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The ABC\u2019s <strong>Patricia Karvelas </strong>has spoken to education minister <strong>Dan Tehan </strong>following the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-update-live-news-australia-nsw-victoria-queensland-qld-tas-act-sa-wa-nt-covid19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e854d578f087564da1e4288#block-5e854d578f087564da1e4288\">announcement earlier today that around 1 million families will receive free childcare</a>. Karvelas asks how the measure would apply to parents working from home \u2013 would they receive free care too? Tehan says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> So the idea is that we will, as of Monday next week, be moving to a new system. And if parents have an existing relationship with the childcare centre, and their child is attending that centre and they\u2019re working from home, yes, they will get free childcare. We want as many people being able to work as we possibly can and we want them to be able to access childcare as they need to make sure that their children are being looked after while they\u2019re working and helping us deal with the pandemic.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He confirms <strong>that parents don\u2019t have to be working. If they\u2019ve got an existing relationship with the centre and their children are attending that centre, then they\u2019ll get it for free under the arrangement. </strong>Tehan is asked to respond to comments from Early Childhood Australia that even with assistance, jobs from the sector may go. Tehan responds:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> We are doing everything we canto put in place new arrangements which mean that as many centres can stay open as they possibly can and as many workers will keep their jobs. So, for instance, with the jobkeeper, 60% of a centre\u2019s cost on average are wages. So with the jobkeeper payment in place, plus this, we think that centres should be able to remain open and they should be able to keep holding on to their work force.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T05:36:00.224Z\">at 6.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8575b88f08532a0e666639\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T05:19:43.300Z\">6.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Victorian Labor to donate pay rises to Covid-19 effort</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BrendanDonohoe7/status/1245579634424438792\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING NEWS: All 71 Victorian Labor MPs will donate their pay rise amounts to Coronavirus causes from July this year to July 2021.

The man in charge of pursuing the ensuring integrity union busting bill, is now publicly praising unions and their leadership.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Behind the scenes in a quiet and cooperative way, there have been a series of reforms to modern awards and the IR system. </p> \n   <p>That has been done cooperatively and quietly, but it has been utterly critical to saving what I believe to be tens of thousands of jobs. </p> \n   <p>It probably is fair to say that there has been the type of change in three weeks inside the award system that you might otherwise wait 30 years to see. </p> \n   <p>The reform has been temporary. It is meant to last for as long as this crisis lasts. It is critical and ultimately it has been incredibly cooperative. </p> \n   <p><strong>So, there are 121 modern awards. There have been very significant changes to three:</strong> <strong>restaurants, hospitality and what is known as the clerk\u2019s award.</strong> </p> \n   <p>While that is only three of 121, they correspond to about<strong> 2 million workers</strong>. </p> \n   <p>These have been applications by agreement between the employers and the unions in each of those sectors and they have been approved in record time by the Fair Work Commission. </p> \n   <p>The changes to those three awards have meant things like this: An individual worker who was performing one type of duty in one type of classification can go and move and perform another type of duty in another type of classification. </p> \n   <p>They have facilitated working from home arrangements. So, remarkably, some of the awards were so inflexible it was actually unlawful to work from home. </p> \n   <p>Of which of course there is a great amount occurring in Australia at the moment. They also have allowed for, by agreement, things such as taking longer durations of annual leave at reduced rates. </p> \n   <p>Those types of changes are absolutely critical. <strong>They would have saved tens of thousands of jobs. </strong></p> \n   <p>It is not a matter of the government claiming credit for those changes. <strong>We are here to thank the parties who have facilitated those changes. That is the ACTU, the Australian Industry Group, individual employer associations, individual unions like the SDA, have changed terms and conditions for 2 million workers to ensure that tens of thousands of jobs have been saved. </strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T02:36:37.145Z\">at 3.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e854bb38f087564da1e427e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T02:21:58.887Z\">3.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The education minister, <strong>Dan Tehan</strong>, explains how the free childcare initiative will work (it\u2019s free for parents and will cost the government $1.6bn).</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The way it will work is that we will look at what 50% of the fees up to the rate cap were in the fortnight before 2 March <strong>and we will pay you that amount on a fortnightly basis. </strong></p> \n   <p>We will also make sure that it it is calibrated with jobseeker. </p> \n   <p>Now 60% of the costs of a childcare centre are the wages. </p> \n   <p>So with jobkeeper we are helping to support the sector to the tune of over $1bn.

  "<p>Sixty years ago, two writers decided on a book explaining the history and unique features of French rugby before the national side\u2019s tour to New Zealand the following year. The upshot was The Rise of French Rugby, written in English by Alex Potter and Georges Duthen and published in Auckland.</p> <p>It is a time for spring cleaning and dusting volumes that have been deprived of light for too long but this book has remained close to hand. Written in a style all of its own, as if translated too literally and enthusiastically, it had an early hook: \u201cChase the natural away and it comes galloping back.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/01/eddie-jones-set-to-sign-new-england-contract-rugby-union-world-cup-2023\">Eddie Jones agrees new England contract until World Cup 2023</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors were reflecting on a debate that, then as now, divided rugby followers in France: style of play. When France toured South Africa in 1958, the year before they won the Five Nations for the first time, they were feted there for what one writer called \u201cchampagne rugby\u201d. The blue glass overflowed, effervesced by running, handling and passing the locals were not used to.</p> <p>Potter and Duthen reflected it had not been so long ago the game in France had been condemned as \u201ctrench rugby\u201d, defensive and unambitious. Philippe Struxiano, a scrum-half who captained Les Bleus in the 1920s, once said he wanted eight mules at in the pack rather than gambolling forwards and neither the fact France became the first team to win a series in South Africa since 1896 nor the style with which they achieved the feat convinced everyone he was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cOur forwards are too much like acrobats and conjurors,\u201d was one opinion. \u201cIn their eagerness to caper they forget their first role is to win the ball.\u201d And another: \u201cEight brilliant individuals do not make a pack. We must get back to fundamentals and insist forwards sink their personalities and submit to collective discipline.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1c17f121c827c2381e9442913cfee07276e404d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c17f121c827c2381e9442913cfee07276e404d/1191_834_2695_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lean years: despair for S\u00e9bastien Chabal and Jean-Baptiste Poux as France are beaten again by England in the World Cup semi-finals, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201cwhat is natural?\u201d debate has persisted, although in the 2010s it was hard to figure out what France stood for. \u201cMuch of the Frenchmen\u2019s rugby in recent years has been more instinctive, more spontaneous and more inspired than that of their opponents in the British Isles,\u201d wrote Potter and Duthen, \u201cwhich in general has been more classical, methodical and scientific. The Frenchmen\u2019s Latin temperament evidently has something to do with this.\u201d</p> <p>It was a temperament Bernard Laporte tried to stifle when he was the coach for eight years from the end of 1999 and tried to make Les Bleus whiter than England. Discipline was his keyword, in charge of players who struggled to stick to a script and were reluctant to shrug off the disciplinary code of the amateur era when players tended to sort out differences themselves, unfettered by laws, referees or citing officers.</p> <p>Pugilistics, as Potter and Duthen, in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger fashion, refer to foul play. Forty years earlier, France\u2019s then chief selector, Adolphe Jaur\u00e9guy, a Basque, had warned against trying to ape England or any of the other home unions. \u201cIt would be wrong to damp our players\u2019 temperaments with streams of technical hints and imperative commands,\u201d he said. \u201cRugby\u2019s crowning factor is speed. Play is so much faster than it was 30 years ago and it will get even faster. We must have forwards with the speed of three-quarters.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/30/lions-tests-will-not-overlap-with-rescheduled-tokyo-olympics\">British and Irish Lions allay fears over 2021 tour's clash with Tokyo Olympics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As in Wales, rugby in France has been more popular in the south than in the north. \u201cSeventy per cent of the fans are in the south, where most of the wine grows,\u201d noted Potter and Duthen. \u201cWhy the game throbs and thrills in France\u2019s most radiant region yet just ticks along, or doesn\u2019t tick at all, in other areas is a mystery.

Local rivalries were white hot. Nothing was barred. Brutal play grew. Brawls and worse broke out everywhere. Fans invaded grounds. Referees were jostled and \u2018if necessary\u2019 beaten.

They were both young, in their early 40s and 20s, and lived in west Texas during one of the biggest oil booms in American history, one that brought tens of thousands to the towns where they lived, and where the plague spread like grassfire.</p> <p>For the longest time I\u2019d thought of this family history as merely tragic \u2013 a pin placed along a timeline of calamities we\u2019ve endured through the generations. Their deaths from influenza had existed as an unlived abstraction. That is, until I found myself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-center-us-coronavirus\">fleeing New York City</a> with my wife, children and dog on the heels of another plague. The city had already begun to close in on itself.

With the car stuffed with everything it can hold, including camping gear and the contents from our pantry and medicine cabinets strapped to the roof, we head west, back home toward Texas. Later that week the governor would order New Yorkers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/new-york-coronavirus-streets\">stay indoors and self-isolate</a>.</p> <p>As we cross the George Washington Bridge I find a prayer of gratitude for the ability to even leave. Yet despite this privilege, I know we are not truly safe no matter the distance. And this fear is one I recognize not from my own experience but from those I\u2019ve covered as a journalist, people who fled places such as Congo and Somalia and Guatemala and for whom these decisions are tragically commonplace. If anything, the plague has a way of showing us that our exceptionalism is a myth. It shakes us awake with terrifying perspective and shows us who we truly are. As we flee New York and abandon our work and seemingly important plans, I know that I am but a speck of dust beneath a deadly settling fog. I am history made new. Out on the road, I enter communion with the ghosts of my kin.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>My great-grandparents were homeless when the first cases of influenza reached Texas in September 1918. Already it had ripped through Europe, killing thousands of servicemen training and fighting the war. By the end of summer, the plague had reached cities along the eastern seaboard, where it would kill more than 30,000 New Yorkers. In Philadelphia, bodies would be stacked so high in the morgues that \u201cveteran embalmers recoiled and refused to enter\u201d, as one historian noted. At the same time, the virus traveled west on the railroads the same way that we and many others are doing now along the interstate highways, unsure if we\u2019re spreading it from town to town when we pump our gas or hand our credit cards through the drive-thru windows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5563723130640cd4889c579481eebb12aba26d99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5563723130640cd4889c579481eebb12aba26d99/0_0_1200_1600/750.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Bateson, who died in 1918.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Bateson, who died in 1918.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mealer family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It reached Texas in the midst of a crippling three-year drought, one that had wiped out my family\u2019s farm along with countless others. After the bank foreclosed on their 71 acres near the town of Eastland, my great-grandfather John Lewis Mealer and his wife, Julia, had packed their four children and belongings into a horse-drawn wagon and joined thousands of other refugees seeking shelter.</p> <p>By summer 1918, the roadside between Eastland and Dallas swarmed with homeless families who were broke, hungry and desperate. A layer of dust covered everything, only deepening the misery.</p> <p>\u201cThey have exhausted their own resources and now the people are brought to the point of starvation with no further hopes in the west,\u201d the state representative DJ Neill warned the Texas legislature that August. \u201cMany thousands have turned their faces eastward, homeless, friendless, moneyless \u2026 The people must be fed or leave the country or die.\u201d</p> <p>Yet as thousands fled eastward, many more were coming the other way. In January 1917, a major oil discovery near the town of Ranger, just 10 miles from my family\u2019s land, had sparked the biggest oil boom in the world. Its timing couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for the ongoing war in Europe, where allied forces were dangerously low on fuel, so much that Walter Long, the British secretary of state for the colonies, had told the House of Commons that fall that \u201coil is probably more important at this moment than anything else\u201d.</p> <p>The oil boom swelled the population of Ranger from 1,000 to 30,000 in less than a year. Tent cities and tar-paper shacks rose near the rigs and along the outskirts of town. In the boarding houses, men slept in shifts for lack of beds. Trainloads of boomers and servicemen pulled in each day, some clinging to the roofs. When the plague arrived in September it had easy pickings. In less than a month Ranger reported more than 2,500 cases. El Paso had 4,000 cases and over 400 deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2396041947a406266ef2cc71c8fcaee7be38bf71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2396041947a406266ef2cc71c8fcaee7be38bf71/0_0_3000_1990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Red Cross nurse with a gauze mask over her nose and mouth, 1918.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Red Cross nurse with a gauze mask over her nose and mouth, 1918.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Thompson/Illustrated Current News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By October, the American Red Cross issued a bulletin that was printed in newspapers throughout west Texas listing the various symptoms: bloodshot eyes and high fever, pain in the eyes, ears, head or back, and dizziness. It advised caregivers to wear aprons over clothing and use rags or paper napkins for any sputum or running of the eyes and nose, and to burn them straightaway. It warned against large gatherings and overcrowded homes and offered a jingle for easy memory: \u201cCover up each cough and sneeze, if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll spread disease.\u201d</p> <p>In Abilene, 65 miles west of Ranger, an estimated one in three residents came down with the flu. In many of the bigger towns, movie theaters, churches and schools closed for weeks. Engines went quiet as the workforce was laid up in bed. \u201cWalking canes are very popular among the victim of the \u2019flu\u2019,\u201d the Abilene Reporter wrote, noting that lingering pain in the lower extremities had left legions of hearty and capable fellows hobbling like old men. Recoverees jokingly referred to their new fraternity as the Ancient and Honorable Society of Influenza Victims.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>As we flee New York and abandon our work and seemingly important plans, I know that I am but a speck of dust beneath a deadly settling fog</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Just as Donald Trump and Texas\u2019s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, have prioritized the economy over public health, there\u2019s no indication that places like Ranger and the surrounding boom<strong> </strong>towns closed shop now that money was pouring in. Officials in nearby Brownwood kept schools and businesses open, defying warnings. Local doctors issued conflicting protocols, and in place of real information many newspapers ran paid editorials that pushed \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bchs.us/BTales_198404.htm\">a powerful reconstructive tonic</a>\u201d called Tanlac to ward off the plague.</p> <p>By the end of October, state health officials reported that more than 6,000 Texans had died.</p> <p>Disinformation bred fear.

According to relatives, amid this rampant fear and confusion my great-grandparents found shelter at a house in a nearby town. But when the neighbors discovered their presence, a mob formed outside the home and some men dragged out Julia\u2019s belongings to burn in the street. It took the local sheriff arriving to restore peace. The story had always confused me. According to relatives, Julia may have had tuberculosis toward the end of her life, which was fairly common at the time, but I wondered, why would a mob try to burn her clothes?</p> <p>But after having to explain to our kids why so many people were wearing masks on the streets of New York and why they couldn\u2019t touch the subway railings or their faces, or why the apartment always smelled of bleach and our hands were cracked from so many washings, that story about Julia began to make perfect sense. You burn something in order to kill it, to neutralize it into ashes.</p> <p>She died sometime after that incident. The only story about her death that survived is that her coffin was placed on a table wherever they were staying, and their youngest boy, my grandfather Robert Odell, who was four at the time, had crawled beneath it and cried himself to sleep.</p> <p>For years I looked in vain for her grave or any record of her death. One of my uncles says they most likely buried her on the road, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what people did back then\u201d. People who were poor and landless and thus more vulnerable. I\u2019m not sure where John Lewis took his four children after burying his wife, but it was far. Perhaps he was running from the thing that had stalked his family and wanted to protect his children. But his efforts were in vain.</p> <p>In early January 1919, he received word that his oldest daughter, Goldie, who was 24 and married, had fallen ill in Desdemona, a town not far from Ranger. Desdemona was the latest bonanza where gushers were left to blow unattended and oil ran ankle deep through the streets and filled the creeks and gullies. It took two weeks of hard travel for John Lewis and the kids to reach Desdemona. But by the time they arrived she was already dead and buried, having succumbed to pneumonia brought on by the flu.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The Cracker Barrel restaurant in Crossville, Tennessee, is packed on a Friday night. I sit there waiting for our to-go order and try not to breathe or touch anything, listening as one party after another pays their check with the chatty cashier and never once mentions the virus.</p> <p>That evening at our hotel, the clerk tells my wife the media is overblowing the whole thing in order to bring down Trump, while on Fox News the hosts are still excusing Covid-19 as a hoax and a death knell to a booming economy. I know that during the influenza epidemic some publishers in west Texas were reluctant to report death tolls in their newspapers for fear it would scare away investors to their boom towns, and as a result thousands continued to pour in to make fortunes and eat steaks in the new hotels, while others like John Lewis buried their wives and daughters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"99b9ef1c5dfd9d5d0658ab65d58810a7facc5faa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99b9ef1c5dfd9d5d0658ab65d58810a7facc5faa/0_0_318_447/318.jpg\" alt=\"John Lewis Mealer.\" width=\"318\" height=\"447\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lewis Mealer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mealer family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I drive I find myself communing with this man, asking what he told his children as their mother lay dying in a wagon bed, what words he used to comfort her in her last moments. Could they even afford a doctor, or was their poverty such that Julia just died only to be buried in a field or culvert because that was the fate of the poor?</p> <p>We seek answers from the dead through what Abraham Lincoln called \u201cthe mystic chords of memory\u201d, which connect human experience through the ages. The plague that now stalks our country connects me with John Lewis just as it tethers me to folks half a world away. It gives me sudden new perspective of the Congolese parents I so often interviewed in displacement camps during the war, men and women who described the stress and anxiety that clawed at their guts from having to surrender to a great unknown, not knowing if they or their loved ones would ever see the other side. I\u2019m reminded of the Central American families <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/26/migrant-caravan-disabled-children\">I walked alongside last year</a> in the migrant caravan, who one day held jobs and ran businesses and the next found themselves in a strange country waiting in food lines to feed their children.</p> <p>Yet I know that compared with John Lewis and the people I described, most Americans like me will fare remarkably better. We have the resources that allow us to leave places like New York City or afford homes replete with the necessary groceries, laptops and streaming devices that make quarantine a relatively comfortable ordeal. And if and when we get sick, we\u2019re fortunate to have a healthcare system that, while currently overstressed, is comparatively superior.</p> <p>And still thousands will die in our cities and home towns. The poor and dispossessed will suffer disproportionately, and people we know and love will get sick and not make it. And when this happens we will curse an absent God and blame our leaders. Facebook and Twitter will register the grief and anger, but in the end it will connect us in ways we can\u2019t foresee. For this virus is a hard truth coming down the pike, the way hard truths have done for centuries. They reveal to us the absurdity of our presumptions, the bankruptcy of our entitlement. That our borders are meaningless and the stories we have told ourselves are only stories. When stripped away, we are collectively naked and lonely and afraid under the sun, driving a minivan through Dallas for the first time with no traffic. That we have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be vulnerable and to hurt and to see that in others, which is where God will always be found.</p> <p>Or this is my prayer anyway as I drive seeking counsel from ghosts, looking in the rearview every so often to find that everyone is sound asleep.</p>",
  "<p>As New York City has become the center of the coronavirus crisis in the United States many citizens, especially wealthier ones, have fled the city to second homes or rentals \u2013 but they have been met with hostility, fear and blame for potentially spreading the illness.</p> <p>The flood of potentially disease-bearing city folk into countryside communities has even seen threats of violence and pleas from local politicians for them to stay away.</p> <p>In Rensselaer county, a three-hour drive north of New York City, \u201cmany, many, many\u201d people have recently arrived, the county executive, Steve McLaughlin, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming up and they\u2019re occupying hotel rooms, Airbnbs, that type of thing,\u201d McLaughlin said.</p> <p>Rensselaer county had 51 cases as of Tuesday, McLaughlin said, \u201cseven at least that are direct from New York City\u201d.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rensselaercounty/photos/pcb.1346517175551938/1346515888885400/?type=3&amp;theater\">McLaughlin appealed</a> to the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, to ban all non-essential travel from New York City to upstate New York.

It remains to be seen if this will calm locals\u2019 fears about New Yorkers spreading infection.</p> <p>\u201cYou get a lot of people who are just plain scared who say: \u2018Keep them out, keep them out,\u2019\u201d McLaughlin said.</p> <p>\u201cI take the more middle-of-the-road approach.

A charismatic and handsome male leader has assembled a group of subservient female followers living together in the wild, hanging on his every word. Like most cults, it\u2019s one based on a rigid and regressive set of gender norms. He speaks, they listen. He demands, they comply. He takes, they give.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/30/elephant-review-meghan-markle-adds-schmaltz-to-disney-yarn\">Elephant review \u2013 Meghan Markle adds schmaltz to Disney yarn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The many fascinating questions such a dynamic raises \u2013 the hows and whys, logistically and psychologically \u2013 have given cults an ongoing prominence on screen, from The Wicker Man all the way through to Wild Wild Country. How does a collective belief in something so outwardly unhinged sustain itself, and how long can that realistically last? In the English-language debut from the acclaimed Polish film-maker Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska, we join a group already steeped in its own traditions, dictated by the Shepherd (Michiel Huisman). There are wives and sisters, all of whom are guided by his word, his control of their narrative so suffocating that even stories not told by him are forbidden.</p> <p>As one of the sisters, Selah (Raffey Cassidy), comes of age, the love and respect she\u2019d always held for her leader starts to show cracks. The atmosphere he\u2019s created doesn\u2019t allow for independent thought or for women to possess any agency, but the more she starts to learn about the Shepherd and what happens when he deigns to give a chosen follower his \u201cgrace\u201d, the more her entire belief system starts to unravel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gjvyfjeJKM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gjvyfjeJKM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Gliding close to genre tropes but moving more comfortably as an uneasy drama about the alarming power of blind faith, The Other Lamb is an intriguing mood piece, strikingly made and well-performed if not quite as powerful as it could have been. It\u2019s a slow burn, flickering quietly as it shows us Selah\u2019s gradual, horrifying realisation of what she\u2019s a part of and Catherine S McMullen\u2019s spare script does a nifty job of likening a certain form of religious fervour to being in an abusive relationship. There are dream sequences that err further toward horror territory but it\u2019s ultimately a tale of sadness, of women duped by a monster, one who fooled them into thinking he knew something they didn\u2019t. In one of the more poignant moments, Selah asks one of his wives, now deemed \u201cbroken\u201d and forced to live close to yet separate from the group, why she\u2019s stayed for so long. \u201cBecause \u2026 I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she replies. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for so long, I don\u2019t know who I am any more.\u201d</p> <p>The women are judged by their age, submissiveness and desirability and as we learn more about the Shepherd\u2019s sexual proclivities, we learn that his calmness hides something more sadistic. His control over the women is absolute and Selah\u2019s journey toward understanding the truth requires her to learn the importance of her own independence. Without forcing the point, the film sews the thread between the cult we see and between the gender dynamic in many relationships even now, of men who treat women like property and of women who confuse this for love. But it\u2019s a slight movie and the central relationship between Selah and the Shepherd is thinly etched, which makes their final confrontation that much less impactful. The ending itself is too abrupt and falls back on the film\u2019s less successful lurches into horror.</p> <p>With sparse dialogue, Cassidy, who impressed in The Killing of a Sacred Deer before getting lost in the mess of Vox Lux, and Huisman, who played a similarly nefarious figure in The Invitation, are both required to base the majority of their performances on the unsaid. Like the film surrounding them, they\u2019re aesthetically magnetic if a little underpowered. Szumowska is a visually confident director capable of constructing some magnificent imagery, but it\u2019s a film that\u2019s forever threatening to be more style than substance. By the end, there\u2019s just about enough to stop that from becoming the case but for it to haunt further than the end credits, it really needed more.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Other Lamb is released to stream in the US on 3 April and in the UK later this year</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>If, during an election campaign, you heard one candidate described as \u201cbrave\u201d and another candidate described as \u201cstrong\u201d, which of the two would you be more likely to vote for? If the answer to this question seems obvious to you, that\u2019s because logically it is.

That\u2019s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in.</p> <p>\u201cNever before have we had the capability to analyse language in such a meaningful way at such massive scale,\u201d says Rich Wilson, owner of Deviance (a technology company that focuses on language analytics). \u201cThis represents a huge opportunity for broad areas such as cultural or gender research,\u201d he continues, which means that \u201cevidence is now indisputable and quantifiable rather than just anecdotal.\u201d</p> <p>It was precisely this thinking that inspired a recent media coverage study conducted by a female-led marketing agency, Mac+Moore, with the support of Deviance. As marketeers, the brand\u2019s founders, Jess MacIntyre and Natalie Moores, spend a large portion of their time discussing the power of language and messaging with their clients. \u201cWe work closely with companies to craft and shape the way they communicate with their audience,\u201d Moores says, \u201cso we know better than most how language can be a very powerful and persuasive tool \u2013 and has the ability to shape people\u2019s perception.\u201d</p> <p>The difference in the media\u2019s treatment of men and women is a topic that has been growing in coverage over the past decade. Savvy brands such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gillette-metoo-ad-on-toxic-masculinity-cuts-deep-with-mens-rights-activists\">Gillette</a> have been using their marketing campaigns to highlight \u2013 and challenge \u2013 gender discrimination and how it damages women. But Mac+Moore wanted to take this one step further. \u201cWe wanted to produce a data set that irrefutably demonstrated how gendered language is used in the media,\u201d says Moores, \u201cso that we had hard evidence that couldn\u2019t just be dismissed as \u2018an opinion\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Using a technique known as comparative linguistics (where two data sets are analysed in relation to one another), Deviance\u2019s software would enable them to analyse in a detailed way any linguistic differences in the way men and women are described in the source material. Not only this, but it would enable the analysis of articles by publications from all across the UK\u2019s media landscape at a volume higher than humans alone have ever been able to process \u2013 and in only a matter of hours. \u201cAI is perfect because it allows the analysis to be completely removed from any bias that we may have \u2013 it allows for complete neutrality,\u201d says MacIntyre.</p> <p>\u201cWe chose the Labour leadership race as source material because it\u2019s so topical and, what\u2019s more, there\u2019s never been a female leader of the party, but the odds of one being elected in this contest were four to one,\u201d says Moores. \u201cStatistically, it is more likely than ever that a woman will be elected, which would enable us to see with more clarity how gendered language is affecting the candidates\u2019 chances \u2013 for better or for worse.\u201d</p> <p>And so they fed 145,000 words through the software, sourced from recent coverage of all five candidates from a broad cross-section of the media\u2019s online content \u2013 amounting to 250 articles in total.</p> <p>The results were startling: articles covering the only man in the race, Keir Starmer, were 4.4 times more likely to describe him using words meaning \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201cfavoured\u201d, whereas the female candidates were 1.9 times more likely to be described using words such as \u201cbrave\u201d (arguably patronising in this context), \u201csad\u201d, \u201cviolent/angry\u201d, and \u201cdislike\u201d.</p> <p>Moreover, the results show that there is a huge focus on gender through the use of titles such as \u201cMs\u201d or \u201cMrs\u201d, which they were three times more likely to use for female candidates, whereas Starmer was referred to mostly by just his surname or the honorific \u201cSir\u201d, which holds a positive connotation. Finally, Starmer was 1.6 times more likely to be discussed in terms of professional employment, politics, law and order, and belonging to a group, whereas the female candidates were much more likely to be discussed in relation to their families and, particularly, their fathers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2020/jan/02/ten-years-on-why-are-there-still-so-few-women-in-tech\">Ten years on, why are there still so few women in tech?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not just this, but the web scraper tool used on the first analysis picked up the content of digital advertising on each website. \u201cThis revealed that whenever a female candidate was discussed, ads were served against the content for clothing, fashion and beauty,\u201d says MacIntyre. \u201cThis never happened for Keir Starmer \u2013 the adverts served in articles for him were much more gender neutral.\u201d This, they believe, indicates an entrenched data bias in the software used by digital ad services that could potentially influence who consumes the content, \u201cthe implication being that articles written about female candidates are only relevant for female readers\u201d, says MacIntyre.</p> <p>\u201cThere is strong evidence to support the theory that women are being portrayed and represented within the media in an overly negative and gendered way, which could be impacting the outcome of election campaigns,\u201d says Moores, \u201cand the implications of this are potentially huge both in politics but also wider society.\u201d</p> <p>The two women are energised by the research and plan to use the results to push for companies to think more carefully about how content is presented. \u201cAlthough these results tell the story of one leadership election, the problem of gendered language is universal,\u201d says MacIntyre.</p> <p>More than anything, the study demonstrates how AI can drive forward our awareness of the scale of the problem of gendered language: the first step to addressing the issue. \u201cThe media has a responsibility to contribute to an equal society,\u201d says Lupu.

Stories came a decade into a career in which she\u2019d swung between blues rock, gothic balladry and the anarchic spirit of punk, dressed up in her gorgeously deep, occasionally West Country-tinged, Americanised vocals. It was also a much more direct, immediate proposition of who she was, turning up the colour on her extraordinary palette of styles and emotions.</p> <p>Stories is also one of the best albums ever made about the madness and intensity of new love. It is cinematic and high octane throughout. Big Exit begins proceedings like a lusty, full-throttle Bonnie and Clyde homage, Harvey\u2019s character feeling immortal with her lover and desperate for a gun. Good Fortune is more tender, speaking of the erotic surrender that arrives when you\u2019re falling for someone. Bad luck gets thrown off tall buildings. Little Italy and Chinatown glow behind love-fuelled hangovers. Harvey\u2019s protagonist becomes a bird of paradise. The lovely production takes us there with her, our hearts full in our mouths.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a record where a woman is articulating her sexual hunger without apology. We\u2019re given characters on rooftops, in bed, on the bed, telling us how immediate these feelings feel. The first line of This Is Love sums it all up: \u201cI can\u2019t believe life\u2019s so complex / When I just want to sit here and watch you undress.\u201d</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>To Bring You My Love (1995)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbq4G1TjKYg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lbq4G1TjKYg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>PJ Harvey: Down by the Water \u2013 video </figcaption> </figure>   <p>The artwork for Harvey\u2019s breakthrough album says a lot about its sound. Here\u2019s a pre-Raphaelite Ophelia in the lake, but rail-thin, and in heavy drag: Harvey\u2019s creating classic art, essentially, but giving it a fierce, distressing twist. For this album, Harvey was without Steve Vaughan and Rob Ellis, her original band, for the first time, and wrote these songs in the remote countryside. Her new solo personality rages from even its softest corners. The echo of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/16/patti-smith-hyde-park-london-gig-july-interview\">Patti Smith</a>\u2019s raw poetry mixes with ragged blues, and folk\u2019s obsession with lost sons and daughters rubs against earworm melodies.

This overlooked album sees Harvey learning piano for the first time, her singing high, strange and eerie, resulting in her saddest, most despairing collections of songs. When Under Ether suggests a female, gnarly twist on TS Eliot\u2019s Prufrock (\u201cWhen under ether / The mind comes alive\u201d). Broken Harp, featuring the instrument in question, is its bleak flipside (\u201cPlease don\u2019t reproach me for how empty my life has become\u201d).

The failures included allowing a customer to lose \u00a3323,000 in a year, despite clear signs of gambling addiction such as playing for five hours on more than 30 occasions.</p> <p>Another customer who was known to have signed up to \u201cself-exclude\u201d from gambling was allowed to start playing again, losing \u00a3240,000 over a 13-month period. Another person, a self-employed nanny, told Caesars she had spent her savings and was borrowing from family and using her overdraft to gamble but the company still allowed her to lose \u00a318,000 in a year.</p> <p>A retired postman also lost \u00a315,000 in 44 days without being properly asked for information about the source of his funds.</p> <p>Caesars was also guilty of failing in its efforts to prevent money laundering, failing to check on the source of funds of someone who wagered \u00a33.5m in three months, or a politically exposed person (PEP) who lost \u00a3795,000 in just over a year. In money-laundering rules, a PEP is someone who is at higher risk of being involved in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position.</p> <p>The Gambling Commission chief executive, Neil McArthur, said the incidents were extremely serious. \u201cIn recent times the online sector has received the greatest scrutiny around VIP practices but VIP practices are found right across the industry and our tough approach to compliance and enforcement will continue, whether a business is on the high street or online.\u201d</p> <p>Caesars Entertainment UK said it \u201cacknowledges falling short of its standards and accepts the settlement reached with the British Gambling Commission]\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince discovering, immediately addressing, and reporting deficiencies in 2018, we have enhanced our compliance policies and procedures and are complying with the license conditions and commission\u2019s guidance for best practice.

  "<p>Among the adjectives applied to the Resident Evil games over the franchise\u2019s 20-year history of frenzied zombie-slaying, we perhaps never expected to find the words \u201crelevant\u201d or \u201cinstructive\u201d. However, this modern-technology reimagining of 1999\u2019s Resident Evil 3 charts the immediate aftermath of a devastating viral outbreak \u2013 in this case the T-Virus, created by the evil Umbrella Corporation \u2013 in a small city, so it is perhaps uniquely apposite. </p> <p>In the current circumstances, it is also faintly reassuring: at least <em>our </em>streets aren\u2019t ablaze and teeming with undead monsters.</p> <p>Resident Evil 3 differs considerably from the first two titles in the series, discarding the original\u2019s branching narrative, which forced you to take decisions at certain points, instead adding sequences in which you control UBCS (Umbrella Corporation\u2019s security force) operative Carlos Oliveira, in addition to much-loved main protagonist Jill Valentine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b66d550ce18ee2a646090f8c4c5dc8794bef7d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b66d550ce18ee2a646090f8c4c5dc8794bef7d3/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Resident Evil 3.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Resident Evil 3.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That adds to the game\u2019s sense of ebb and flow: Carlos is armed with a powerful assault rifle, so his more action-oriented sequences involve coping with large amounts of zombies at a time, whereas Jill\u2019s sequences judiciously mix puzzle-solving and more traditional survival-horror gameplay, in which she must make the most of scarce ammo and whatever firepower is at hand.</p> <p>But the game has another central character: the seemingly indestructible Nemesis, who relentlessly pursues Jill and provides a number of boss-battles, each of which forces her to take advantage of different environmental quirks, and after which he mutates into ever-more terrifying forms.</p> <p>The game provides plenty of the franchise\u2019s staple elements, against a backdrop of gloriously modernised versions of familiar locations such as the Raccoon City Police Station (here seen 24 hours before the events chronicled in Resident Evil 2). But this time the emphasis is on storyline rather than archetypal scary horror sequences, though there a few, including a creepy switch-finding puzzle in an area infested by giant spiders (that inject Jill with maggots which she vomits up when healing herself) and the first encounter with a new enemy in the sewers.</p> <p>Despite cleverly tweaking the original game\u2019s story in such a way that it feels more logical and coherent than before (which may offend Resident Evil purists), and providing a general gameplay experience that displays a bit more variation, it doesn\u2019t feel quite as groundbreaking, or as meaty, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jan/22/resident-evil-2-review-genre-defining-horror-loaded-with-dread\">Resident Evil 2</a>. This is quite a short game (as was the original), and while you can just about spin a play-through out for 15 hours or so, the presence of an achievement for speed-running through the story in less than two hours tells you a lot.</p> <p>Capcom has tacitly acknowledged this fact by bundling the game with a separate multiplayer mode named Resident Evil Resistance. Past attempts to add multiplayer to Resident Evil have been patchy, but Resistance has promise. It is certainly distinctive, featuring four-versus-one asymmetric play, in which a group of Survivors must escape each location, while a Mastermind attempts to thwart them by spawning traps, zombies and bosses.</p> <p>Survivors are placed under extreme time-pressures, but can buy time through positive actions such as killing enemies or healing team-mates. Resistance expands its gameplay by, for example, introducing characters who are melee specialists, and giving each Survivor a skill with a long cool-down, and there\u2019s much Machiavellian fun to be had as the evil Mastermind.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wghn3tYYVNw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wghn3tYYVNw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Resistance is recognisably part of the Resident Evil universe, but its gameplay is fresh, distinctive and highly tactical. You have to work at it a bit, learning the layout of the levels intimately via its Practice Mode, and pre-launch, its matchmaking system wasn\u2019t working (which should have been fixed by now). If Capcom can continue to evolve it post-launch, with new levels, characters and gameplay mechanics, it should prove an enduringly popular addition to the Resident Evil universe.</p> <p>Resident Evil 3 doesn\u2019t quite hit the heights achieved by last year\u2019s reworking of Resident Evil 2 \u2013 it fails to gloss over the shortcomings of its forebear.

  "<p>Even before the pandemic there were postponements. Before that, there were protests. From a large armchair positioned beneath his own portrait, the 82-year-old president of Guinea is not answering the key question preoccupying his country whether or not he wants to remain in situ until he is 94.</p> <p>In the Sekhoutoureah presidential palace in Conakry, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and trousers, Alpha Cond\u00e9 is flanked on one side by a large photograph of himself alongside Barack Obama in the White House. On the other, framed photographs on a table show him shaking hands with the Turkish leader, Recep Erdo\u011fan, and with China\u2019s Xi Jinping. There\u2019s also a golden bust of Chairman Mao and a hefty book about the Beninese politician Robert Dossou.</p> <p>On 22 March, Guinea <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-guinea-election/guinea-referendum-backs-constitutional-changes-that-may-extend-presidents-rule-idUKKBN21E387?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews\">voted in a referendum</a> on allowing Cond\u00e9 to change the constitution. The electoral commission said almost 92% voted in favour of the changes. At least 42 people died in violent protests that preceded the vote.</p> <p>The new constitution will enshrine gender parity and wealth distribution in law, ban child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), and provide a \u201cspecific fund\u201d for young people, women and people with disabilities, Cond\u00e9 says. Critics fear it will also give the president the opportunity to serve two more terms in office.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mission is to make Guinea one of the most developed countries in Africa</p> <footer> <cite>Alpha Cond\u00e9</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI want to give Guinea a constitution which puts it at the vanguard of African countries,\u201d says Cond\u00e9, who spent decades in opposition before becoming the first democratically elected president in 2010.</p> <p>The referendum was initially scheduled for 1 March. But with two days to go it was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51689308\">unexpectedly postponed</a>. \u201cGuinea, homeland of pan-Africanism, cannot isolate itself from its fellow countries,\u201d the president told the nation in a sober television address.</p> <p>The vote finally went ahead on 22 March, but has been mired in controversy. The opposition, who reject the result, have boycotted the electoral register and removed 37 deputies from legislative elections that took place on the same day. After months of violent and peaceful demonstrations, international concern is also high.</p> <p>Questions have been raised by the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) about the legitimacy of 2.5 million names on the electoral register, and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) and the African Union (AU) withdrew election observers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ecedc0ee54cb631718165c21e75e0b7dae3ad6f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecedc0ee54cb631718165c21e75e0b7dae3ad6f5/0_51_4635_2781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters confront the army in the streets of Conakry on 22 March, the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters confront the army in the streets of Conakry on 22 March, the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cellou Binani/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cond\u00e9 is adamant the opposition\u2019s boycott was unjustified. \u201cOne cannot block a country,\u201d he says defiantly. \u201cTo speak for the people, one must have a mandate from the people.\u201d<br><br>The new constitution permits the president to sidestep his two-term limit, and questions linger. Will he now run for president again? And how could Cond\u00e9 \u2013 a former law professor at the Sorbonne who was opposition leader for more than four decades who was exiled and imprisoned by dictators, and welcomed as a champion of change by international leaders \u2013 consider undermining the still fragile system of democracy that he helped implement?</p> <p>Before Cond\u00e9\u2019s arrival, Guinea had a history of leaders outstaying their welcome. Sekou Tour\u00e9 ruled a one-party state modelled on Maoist China from independence in 1958 till he died in office in 1984. His successor, Lansana Cont\u00e9, was just as tenacious, hanging on, with increasing senility, until 2008. Moussa Dadis Camara, a military captain, then ruled for barely a year, orchestrating elaborate show trials on television before he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/16/guinea-aide-shoot-camara\">shot in the head</a> by an exasperated bodyguard in 2009.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 seemed like an improvement. Once condemned to death by Tour\u00e9 and imprisoned for two and a half years by Cont\u00e9, he was elected with 52.52% of the vote and re-elected in 2015 with almost 58%. But many Guineans are not so much against him as against a third mandate.</p> <p>Guinea is a country of great natural resources. The coastal area is lush with mangroves and fertile farmland for pineapples, mangoes, rice and potatoes. Inland there are generous deposits of iron ore and Guinea is the biggest exporter of bauxite to China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d6617cfb1884e4895189da4d4e4010091b9b62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d6617cfb1884e4895189da4d4e4010091b9b62/0_184_5520_3312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A broken ballot box on the ground outside a polling station in Conakry on the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A broken ballot box on the ground outside a polling station in Conakry on the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cellou Binani/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But poverty levels are extremely high. Even in the capital, Conakry, the electricity supply is capricious, with frequent power outages. Sometimes there is running water; more often, a trip to the local well. Less than two-thirds of the population can read, and the average income is less than $900 (\u00a3727) a year. Guinea also has one of the highest rates of economic migration in Africa. Young people are often unemployed, while 90% of women undergo FGM in some form.</p> <p>On assuming power, Cond\u00e9 famously remarked that he had inherited a country, not a state. Now he defends his record with reminders of the situation in 2010. \u201cWhen I arrived, Guinea was on its knees. Completely on its knees,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had never completed a programme with the IMF. They called us the \u2018basket case\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Reforms included an overhaul of the army. There was an attempted coup in 2011. Then there was Ebola. The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/\">first case identified </a>was in Guinea in 2013. Three years later, and after more than 2,500 deaths, Guinea was declared Ebola-free.</p> <p>\u201cI did not have the time to draw up a new constitution,\u201d says Cond\u00e9.</p> <p>Under his rule, Guinea has seen undeniable improvements. In 2016 and 2017 the mining industry grew by 50%. The 240- megawatt Kaleta hydroelectric facility should provide Conakry\u2019s residents with stable power. The 450-megawatt Souapiti dam is due to open next year and could provide the energy required for factories.</p> <p>Refining bauxite into aluminium rather than simply exporting the raw material would add far more to the state\u2019s coffers and in theory trickle down to the population: <a href=\"https://www.anafic-gn.org/#\">Anafic</a>, one of the president\u2019s landmark policies, implemented last year, guarantees that 15% of mining revenues will go towards local infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0212a034c824f0d18dbbb5432fa6c233c5fa14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0212a034c824f0d18dbbb5432fa6c233c5fa14b/0_900_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alpha Cond\u00e9 pictured at the People\u2019s Hall in Conakry in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alpha Cond\u00e9 pictured at the People\u2019s Hall in Conakry in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked if his time in power has changed him, Cond\u00e9 says circumstances remain the same as when he was in opposition. \u201cSince my youth I have wanted to serve my country, and serve Africa,\u201d says the president, who believes he doesn\u2019t get the recognition he deserves. \u201cPeople in Guinea have a short memory.\u201d</p> <p>Since October more than 40 people have died in protests organised by the Front National pour la D\u00e9fense de la Constitution (FNDC), an organisation consisting of civil society, politicians and activists.

Many of the inhabitants are Peuhl, an ethnic group related to the Fulani. On the day of the vote, 10 people died according to the FNDC (the government <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2020/03/31/des-milliers-de-guineens-sont-alles-voter-on-ne-les-a-pas-forces_6035037_3212.html\">says it was six</a>).</p> <p>\u201cInvestigations are happening,\u201d says Cond\u00e9. He blames tensions on the opposition: \u201cWhen one doesn\u2019t have a credible political programme, one can lower oneself to the subjective: race or ethnicity.\u201d</p> <p>But, he says, the tears in the social fabric can be repaired. \u201cIt will disappear with the next generation. The more young people have work, the less they will be manipulated.\u201d</p> <p>Four decades in opposition gave Cond\u00e9 time to nurture a grandiose vision for his legacy. \u201cMy mission is to make Guinea one of the most developed countries in Africa. I want the person who comes after me to no longer have to resolve the problems of electricity, nor the problem of water, nor the problem of roads,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In elections in Guinea, when you put in \u2018yes\u2019, it comes out \u2018no\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Restaurant owner, Conakry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe countries that develop the fastest \u2013 how long have their leaders been in power?

They confirmed the OIF\u2019s findings that approximately 2.5 million votes are in doubt, cast by people who are either dead, too young or have been counted twice. The coronavirus pandemic meant elections went ahead on 22 Marchwithout international observers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the voters have been removed,\u201d says Dram\u00e9. \u201cThere is no guarantee that the recommendations of Ecowas have been respected.\u201d</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 believes the ballot box is the best way to solve the impasse. Should he stand again for president, his main rivals will likewise be familiar faces. Diallo, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea party, and Sidya Tour\u00e9, head of the Union of Republican Forces, were prime ministers under Lansana Cont\u00e9. They do not symbolise a fresh start. \u201cThey aren\u2019t a new generation of politicians but former civil servants,\u201d says Cond\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019ve won elections; none of them have.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, Cond\u00e9 announced a curfew because of coronavirus. So far, the number of cases in Guinea remains low, with fewer than 40 cases.</p> <p>As the president talks of infrastructure, there is little mention of leaving Guinea with the democratic infrastructure that term limits established.</p> <p>Forty years fighting in opposition do not seem to have trained Cond\u00e9 in the art of letting go. One thinks of his memoir, in which he was asked about football, one of his great passions. \u201cI would dribble, but never pass the ball,\u201d he answered.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe the first mistake was the timing. With the rest of the sports world effectively shut down, the Los Angeles Rams decided that it was the ideal time to launch their updated logo. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t take into account that sports fans were desperate for anything to distract them from the nonstop glut of doom-and-gloom that currently makes up the rest of the news. The launch was met with a barrage of ridicule, much of it coming from their own fanbase, and the negative reaction could send the team back to the literal drawing board.</p> <h2>Why did the Rams feel the need to change the logo at all?</h2> <p>Well, the Rams are still working on finding their own identity \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/07/away-fans-nfl-los-angeles-rams-chargers-home-crowds\">and a market</a> \u2013 following their return to Los Angeles after spending 21 seasons as the St Louis Rams.

Also, let\u2019s not ignore the fact that a new logo means an opportunity to sell truckloads of updated merchandise at a premium. In the NFL, money is a contributing factor in nearly every decision.</p> <h2>So, when did things start to go wrong?</h2> <p>Almost immediately. First, images of a Rams hat made by New Era for the upcoming draft leaked online to near-universal disgust.

In fact, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28953905/eric-dickerson-speak-rams-fans-logo-concerns\">he claimed</a> that if the Rams raise more than $2m in a virtual telethon for coronavirus relief, he would read the top 10 mean tweets made about the redesign. <a href=\"https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2020/03/25/la-rams-kevin-demoff-mean-tweets-logo-telethon/\">They eventually raised $2,045,000</a>, so one would guess that this is forthcoming.</p> <h2>Will the team keep the logo?</h2> <p>We\u2019ll see. While there is already <a href=\"https://ramsnation.com/rams-fans-create-petition-for-organization-to-change-new-logo/2020/03/25/\">an online petition</a> to force the team to change the logo, Demoff seems confident that fans will simply get used to it: \u201cI think it\u2019s a change that our fans will come to know and love over time.\u201d He may be correct. There is a backlash nearly every time a team makes a bold change and fans usually adjust. Heck, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/sports/flyers/gritty-philadelphia-flyers-mascot-social-media-reaction-fans-20180924.html\">even Gritty was met with derision</a> when introduced and he\u2019s become one of the most beloved mascots in sports.

Since the move to Los Angeles, the Rams have been rather anonymous, which is quite a feat considering that they made the Super Bowl just last year (although, given everything that\u2019s happened since, it does feel like decades ago). While playing in a new stadium may change their fortunes, they have had issues with opposing teams\u2019 fans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/07/away-fans-nfl-los-angeles-rams-chargers-home-crowds\">crowding out their own</a>. For one day, they were the biggest topic in sports. So what if it wasn\u2019t for anything football related? At this point, they\u2019ll take it.</p>",
  "<p>Ellis Marsalis, the jazz pianist who fathered two of America\u2019s most celebrated jazz performers in Wynton and Branford Marsalis, has died aged 85. He is suspected to have died from the Covid-19 virus, after being admitted to hospital with symptoms. His test results are pending.</p> <p>LaToya Cantrell, mayor of his home town New Orleans, described Marsalis as: \u201ca legend, the prototype of what we mean when we talk about New Orleans jazz\u201d.</p> <p>Marsalis was an acclaimed pianist who helped bring the bebop style south to New Orleans, where swing and big-band jazz had dominated. He played alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/11/ornette-coleman-ourage-and-rightness\">Ornette Coleman</a>, featured on a recording alongside hard bop stars Nat and Cannonball Adderley, and recorded 20 solo albums. In 1987, he composed music for a recorded version of the King Midas tale, narrated by Michael Caine and featuring cellist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/07/facing-the-music-yo-yo-ma-cellist\">Yo-Yo Ma</a>.</p> <p>But he was most celebrated as a teacher, training, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/05/jazz\">Harry Connick Jr</a> and Terence Blanchard, as well as mentoring his famous sons.</p> <p>His younger son, Wynton, became a trumpeter who straddled jazz and classical music, and in 1997 was the first jazz performer to win the Pulitzer prize for music. Branford, a saxophonist, would go on to play with Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie and crossed over into pop , playing with Sting and recording the saxophone part for Public Enemy\u2019s Fight the Power. Both brothers cut their teeth in one of the great mid-century groups, Art Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers.</p> <p>Two more of Ellis\u2019s six sons also became jazz performers: Jason, a drummer, and Delfeayo, a trombonist.</p> <p>Branford said in a statement: \u201cMy dad was a giant of a musician and teacher, but an even greater father. He poured everything he had into making us the best of what we could be. My friend and Harvard Law professor David Wilkins just sent me the following text: \u2018We can all marvel at the sheer audacity of a man who believed he could teach his black boys to be excellent in a world that denied that very possibility, and then watch them go on to redefine what excellence means for all time.\u2019\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Footage which appears to show Irish calves being beaten and kicked at a French feeding station has been published by animal campaign groups.</p> <p>The video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFTiYf0flPw\">published by Eyes on Animals (EoA) and French welfare organisation </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFTiYf0flPw\">L214</a>, appears to show workers repeatedly beating calves that are a few weeks old with sticks. One is kicked and another is dragged away, unable to stand. The calf was euthanised by a vet, said an EoA observer.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s dairy sector, which earned the country \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33.9bn) in export revenues last year, relies heavily on veal farms in mainland Europe to buy unwanted male dairy calves. Dairy cows must produce calves in order to continue producing milk, but male calves are no use to the industry: they are known as \u201cshipping-calves\u201d in the Irish agricultural press.</p> <p>The latest figures from Ireland\u2019s national agricultural body, Teagasc, show there are just over 1.4 million dairy cows in Ireland this year, each of which will calve once, producing approximately 700,000 male calves. <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/animalhealthwelfare/animalidentificationandmovement/AIMBovineStatisticsReport2018100519.pdf\">Figures from the agriculture ministry</a> show almost 247,000 cattle were exported from the country in 2018.</p> <p>Last month animal welfare campaigners followed calf trucks from the Irish port of Rosslare to the French port of Cherbourg. They documented a number of welfare and transport infractions.</p> <p>EU law obliges calf transporters to feed and rest calves after nine hours of travel, \u201c\u2018if necessary\u201d. After a second nine-hour journey, or a total of 18 hours\u2019 transport, calves must be fed and rested for 12 hours.</p> <p>But Lesley Moffat of EoA said that from what her team had witnessed, \u201cincluding the time it takes to move calves to and from ports, plus a boat journey of about 18 hours, the calves had been on the road for an estimated 23 hours without milk or milk replacer, well above the legal maximum of 18 hours.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/07/secret-footage-live-exports-calves-brutality\">Live export: Secret footage shows young calves being beaten and kicked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Campaigners described the handling of calves on arrival at Couville, France, as brutal. \u201cThe four Irish trucks would be carrying about 1,200 calves and when they arrive, they\u2019re desperate for milk. The workers get impatient because they won\u2019t leave the feeders. Calves were kicked and whacked repeatedly, particularly around the head with sticks. We saw one collapse, either because of the brutality or because of exhaustion and hunger. Or both.\u201d</p> <p>A year ago the two groups covered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/07/secret-footage-live-exports-calves-brutality\">calf mistreatment </a>at another Cherbourg feeding facility, Qualivia.

It breaks a range of EU laws and increases the risk of infections and diseases being transferred from one country to another. There is no automatic quarantine for truckers. On this trip the drivers moved from Rosslare to France through Belgium, up to Holland, and then they go home,\u201d said Moffat.</p> <p>In a statement, L214 described the transport of calves as \u201can ordeal\u201d in normal times, and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d. They called on the EU and the French agriculture ministry to \u201curgently stop\u201d veal transports.</p> <p>A lawyer for another welfare organisation, currently preparing a court case that could end unweaned calf exports from Scotland and possibly the rest of the EU, agreed about the welfare and disease risks.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why we\u2019re asking the Scottish courts to declare it unlawful to allow unweaned calves to be exported. If we win our case, it will hopefully have repercussions throughout the EU,\u201d said Peter Stevenson of Compassion in World Farming.</p> <p>Stevenson said he was shocked to see the Scottish and UK governments preparing to defend calf exports by appointing Queen\u2019s Counsel barristers. He said the UK government and Boris Johnson, had \u201cboth said they want to end live exports\u201d, making their defence \u201chypocritical\u201d.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, the director of the feeding facility where the calf mistreatment was filmed, said the mistreatment allegedly shown in the video was \u201cnot possible\u201d but refused to comment further.

  "<p>We think of spring as the time of blossom and fresh new green growth, but it is often the most polluted time of year in western Europe. Last week, as winds turned easterly, particle pollution once again spread across western Europe. Spring smogs can cause particle pollution to reach the top value of 10 in the UK air quality index, but four to nine is more typical.</p> \n<p>With the lockdown in place, the increases were less than normal. The air quality index peaked at three over most of England and Wales. A few places in south-east England, Yorkshire and north Wales reached four, the level where health advisory messages are issued. After three days, a welcome change of wind direction at the weekend pushed the polluted air southwards.</p> \n<p>In March 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/16/parisians-driven-revolt-smog-car-ban\">Paris and many other French cities banned half their cars</a> to control a spring smog. Most of the UK was also affected, but actions here <a href=\"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/air-pollution/daqi\">are limited to advising</a> elderly and vulnerable people to refrain from outdoor exercise. A second smog struck that April and the then prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/03/cameron-uk-smog-pollution-europe\">David Cameron was heavily criticised</a> by opposition MPs and European officials when he tweeted that the bad air quality in London was harmless Saharan dust.</p> \n<p>It was not. Later, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412016302847\">Public Health England estimated</a> these two smogs led to around 600 early deaths in England and Wales. <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/8/4/e018732.full.pdf\">Spikes were also seen</a> in people arriving at hospital emergency departments in London and Paris, especially in young people with asthma.</p> \n<p>Like Paris, many cities across Europe restrict traffic, reduce speed limits and subsidise public transport during severe smogs. These types of actions <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718309094\">have been found to reduce air pollution</a> by around 15%-20% in areas with a lot of traffic. However, during spring smogs, polluted air spreads from country to country, so it is hard for any city to completely control these episodes on its own.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

These were devised for the 2008 Olympics, but have since been used for other high-profile events. Industry around Beijing was curtailed and <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015JD023652\">traffic cut by half for the Asia Pacific Economic Conference</a> in 2014, and the 2015 parade to mark 70 years since the end of the second world war.</p> \n<p>Suddenly, the people of Beijing could see the true colour of the sky without the customary haze. It was nicknamed \u201cAPEC blue\u201d and later \u201cparade blue\u201d. These controls took place over an area of around 500,000 km<sup>2</sup>, covering a population of nearly 300 million people.</p> \n<p>I have often wondered what would happen if we did the same in Europe, but I thought I would never find out. In 2017 a team of French scientists <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11869-016-0427-y\">used a computer model to predict what might happen</a> if all of Europe shut down for a day to control a springtime smog. Particle pollution would fall by about 20%-40% in major cities. Last week we saw Beijing-scale measures implemented across Europe for the first time.</p> \n<p>But with countries in lockdown, why was air pollution still as high as three or four? <a href=\"http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/Default.aspx\">Measurements from King\u2019s College London</a> provide the answer. Chemical analysis of the pollution particles showed traffic sources along with gas combustion for power generation by industry and for home heating, as you might expect. Wood burning in London\u2019s homes added to the mixture.</p> \n<p>Many particles also included ammonia in their make-up.

This is on top of the jobkeeper wage subsidy, and is estimated to cover around 1 million workers needing childcare for their children.</p> <p>The existing means testing arrangements are no longer in place, so anyone who is working can access childcare during the pandemic.

The main two changes are to provide two weeks\u2019 unpaid pandemic leave for all employees and an ability to take double leave at half pay.</p> <p>Burke told an Australia@Home lunchtime briefing, hosted by Essential Media director Peter Lewis, there was an \u201cissue for permanent full-time and part-timers\u201d that emerged from a treasury briefing to Labor on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re stood down, it\u2019s already the case that employers can say you\u2019ve got to use up your leave first, and they start running down your leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it looks like will be possible is: if the employer gets the wage subsidy, instead of passing it through to you as a wage, they collect it and still have you running down your leave entitlements.</p> <p>\u201cSo effectively, instead of the government subsidising someone\u2019s wage, they\u2019re subsidising the balance sheet for an employer while the employer simply runs down all the leave entitlements of their employees.\u201d</p> <p>Burke said he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d by the revelation \u2013 because Labor thought the jobkeeper payment was \u201cmeant to flow through to the workers to give them an extra payment, not [flow] through as they collect entitlements they had already earned\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt might seem technical but there are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of permanent workers, who at the end of this will either have some of their leave entitlements or won\u2019t, based on whether this loophole survives.\u201d</p> <p>Burke said this was what the government was \u201ccurrently contemplating\u201d, although it \u201cmight not turn out this way in the legislation\u201d.</p> <p>Labor is also concerned that casuals with less than 12 months\u2019 service with their current employer \u2013 including many workers in retail and hospitality, teachers who move between schools, entertainment and arts workers on forward contracts and many construction workers \u2013 are set to miss out.</p> <p>Unveiling the jobkeeper payment on Monday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said it was one of many measures to help \u201cbuild a bridge to the recovery\u201d by pursuing a \u201chibernation strategy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis payment will give working Australians their best chance of keeping their job and keeping them connected to their employers so that they can bounce back in the recovery phase,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday Porter summarised a raft of industrial relations reforms achieved \u201cbehind the scenes in a quiet and cooperative way\u201d between employers and unions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/real-estate-agents-criticised-for-suggesting-tenants-consider-using-superannuation-to-pay-rent\">Real estate agents criticised for suggesting tenants consider using superannuation to pay rent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Temporary changes to the restaurant, hospitality and clerks award would change work conditions for 2m Australians during the Covid-19 crisis, allowing workers to move to perform another type of duty in another type of classification and facilitate working from home.</p> <p>\u201cRemarkably, some of the awards were so inflexible it was actually unlawful to work from home,\u201d Porter said. Some 103 modern awards would be changed to provide two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave for all employees, including casuals, and to allow employees to take double the duration of leave at half the pay, he said.</p> <p>\u201cNow, you can see how those common-sense changes would allow the flexibility in a number of businesses, which \u2026 could well make the difference between survival of the business and preservation of the jobs or the failure of the business and the loss of the jobs. So these are incredibly important changes.\u201d</p> <p>Porter thanked the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Industry Group, other employer associations and unions and the president of the Fair Work Commission, justice Iain Ross.</p>",

There is so much to admire in Savage\u2019s literary style: in The Museum of Rape, for instance, Savage curates and exhibits fragments of writing about assault, including a section about a man on the internet who catalogues false claims. Unwed Teen Mum Mary is framed around a questionnaire Savage fills out to be considered for the role of taste-testing new snacks at 7-Eleven.</p> <p>Savage deftly shifts between stylistic devices, narrative voices and time, and the result is breathtaking.

To do this, he argues that we need to build the capacity of Indigenous communities to get involved in fire management, and bring together Indigenous practitioners from all states in order to consolidate their leadership. \u201cYou have to know how to read the country and learn the knowledge before you can light a fire,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>Mentored by elders who wanted children to learn the language and get back onto country, Steffensen offers insights into the differences between western hazard reduction and Indigenous fire management. His frustration and sadness is palpable, particularly in his depiction of elders constrained from acting on their traditional knowledge on their own country.

In crisp and delicious prose, she tells the story of a community rocked by change, particularly as many men on the island are losing their jobs, and the corresponding loss and violence. Hannah starts teaching at the school on the island, where one of her students goes missing.

On small islands and in deserts at the edges of wealthy regions \u2013 Greece\u2019s Aegean islands, the Negev Desert in Israel, the Pacific Ocean near Australia, the southern Mediterranean coastline \u2013 various types of large holding centres for would-be migrants.</p> <p>The scale and purpose of these places vary considerably, as do the political regimes that have created them, but they share certain things in common. Most were established as temporary or \u201cemergency\u201d measures, but have outgrown their original stated purpose and become seemingly permanent. Most exist thanks to a mix of legal ambiguity \u2013 detention centres operating outside the regular prison system, for instance \u2013 and physical isolation. And most, if not all, have at times been described by their critics as concentration camps.</p> <p>We tend to associate the idea of concentration camps with their most extreme instances \u2013 the Nazi Holocaust, and the Soviet Gulag system; genocide in Cambodia and Bosnia. But the disturbing truth is that concentration camps have been widespread throughout recent history, used to intern civilians that a state considers hostile, to control the movement of people in transit and to extract forced labour. The author Andrea Pitzer, in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/one-long-night-9780316303569.html\" title=\"\">One Long Night</a>, her recent history of concentration camps, estimates that at least one such camp has existed somewhere on Earth throughout the past 100 years.</p> <p>The definition of a concentration camp is sometimes fuzzy, but at root, such camps represent a combination of physical and legal power. They are a way for modern states to segregate groups of civilians by placing them in a closed or isolated location via special rules that are distinct from a country\u2019s main system of rights and punishments. Many have been set up under military jurisdiction \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/09/paulharris.theobserver\" title=\"\">by the British</a> during the Boer war, for instance \u2013 while others, such as the Soviet gulags, have been used in peacetime to deal with social \u201cundesirables\u201d.</p> <p>Cruelty and the abuse of power have existed throughout human history, but concentration camps have not. They are little more than a century old. The earliest began as wartime measures, but on numerous occasions since then they have become lasting features. They are a product of technologically advanced societies with sophisticated legal and political systems and have been made possible by a range of modern inventions. Military technologies such as automatic weapons or barbed wire made it easier for small groups of officials to hold much larger groups of people captive. Advanced bureaucracy and surveillance techniques enabled states to watch, count and categorise civilians in ways they couldn\u2019t have done in earlier eras. As Pitzer writes, such camps \u201cbelong in the company of the atomic bomb as one of the few advanced innovations in violence\u201d.</p> <p>This innovation haunts the political imagination of liberal democracies. The concentration camp is a symbol of everything such societies are supposed to stand against: the arbitrary use of power and the stripping of people\u2019s rights, the systematic removal of liberty; dehumanisation, abuse, torture, murder and genocide. When it is used to refer to contemporary places, the term \u201cconcentration camp\u201d is often reserved for the locations of the most serious human rights abuses, as when Amnesty International used it in a 2017 report estimating that 13,000 people had been murdered by Syria\u2019s Assad regime in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/07/saydnaya-prison-assad-slaugterhouse-amnesty-report-torture-mass-hangings\" title=\"\">Saydnaya military prison</a> outside Damascus. But politicians, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among them, have also <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-unimaginable-reality-of-american-concentration-camps\" title=\"\">used the term</a> to describe camps such as the ones the Trump administration has been running on the US border with Mexico.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>To some, these comparisons minimise the use of concentration camps by Nazi Germany in its effort to exterminate Jews. For others, the comparisons are a necessary warning, not least because one kind of camp can easily transform into another. Pitzer gives the example of a refugee camp: if people are not allowed to leave, and are systematically denied their rights, then it starts to resemble more sinister creations. As authoritarians and rightwing populists reach positions of power in various parts of the world, liberals are voicing fears that history is repeating itself.</p> <p>Surveying what he called \u201ca century of camps\u201d in the mid-90s, the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman warned that the temptation for governments to use them would always be strong \u201cwhen certain humans are declared redundant or forced into a superfluous condition\u201d. There is no shortage of threats in the current century \u2013 from environmental catastrophe to the unfolding coronavirus pandemic \u2013 that are creating such conditions. The question is how to ensure that the concentration camp is not the state\u2019s inevitable response.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It is tempting to regard the concentration camp as an anomaly, but for some observers, such camps are a grim reflection of the way modern states work. After the second world war, as knowledge of the Holocaust became widespread, leading theorists sought to offer explanations for the genocide that had taken place, and the methods used to carry it out. Writing in 1950, the Martiniquan poet and politician Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire argued that the Holocaust \u201capplied to Europe colonialist procedures\u201d that until then had been reserved exclusively for people of colour.</p> <p>Concentration camps were indeed colonial in origin. Their earliest uses came at the turn of the 20th century \u2013 by the Spanish in 1896 to put down a rebellion in Cuba, by the US in 1899 to do similar in the Philippines, and by the British empire in southern Africa during the Boer war of 1899-1902. The first use of concentration camps for a deliberate policy of extermination was not in Europe but in German South West Africa \u2013 modern-day Namibia \u2013 between 1904 and 1907. (Germany only recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/germany-moves-to-atone-for-forgotten-genocide-in-namibia\" title=\"\">officially acknowledged</a> its treatment of the Herero and Nama tribes as genocide.)</p> <p>For C\u00e9saire, the appearance of camps in Europe itself was a direct result of the way in which Europeans had attempted to dehumanise their colonial subjects in order to exploit them, but ended up dehumanising themselves. \u201cColonisation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cworks to decivilise the coloniser, to brutalise him in the true sense of the word, to degrade him, to awaken him to buried instincts, to covetousness, violence, race hatred and moral relativism.\u201d</p> <p>The German-Jewish political theorist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/01/totalitarianism-in-age-donald-trump-lessons-from-hannah-arendt-protests\" title=\"\">Hannah Arendt</a> also turned her attention to camps after the war. Like C\u00e9saire, Arendt drew links between the behaviour of European powers in their colonies and their conduct at home, but she also highlighted how some of the tools wielded by authoritarians had been put in place by democracies before the rise of fascism. In her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt pointed out that when France was occupied by Nazi Germany, for instance, the Gestapo was able to make use of draconian police powers already in existence to round up and detain civilians. These existed because France, like many other states in Europe, had been unable to deal with the mass displacement of people in the aftermath of the first world war and had instituted harsh measures to deal with unwanted migrants.</p> <p>In 1940, Arendt had her own direct experience of this relatively novel form of containment. After fleeing Germany for France, she was placed in an internment camp at Gurs, near the Pyrenees. The camp had been established a few years earlier to detain republican refugees from the Spanish civil war; it was repurposed in 1939 for \u201cenemy aliens\u201d \u2013 a practice instigated by the British in the first world war and subsequently copied by many countries. The inmates had to endure overcrowding, disease and insufficient food rations, and were made to live together regardless of the fact that some were Nazi party members and others, like Arendt, were Jewish refugees. It was partly the memory of this that led Arendt to place internment on a continuum with the Soviet gulags and the Nazi death camps \u2013 as she saw it, the \u201cHades, Purgatory and Hell\u201d of state violence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8900bf8b4737485bc903be41072732c1f172512\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8900bf8b4737485bc903be41072732c1f172512/0_0_4866_3228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Klamka/SOPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That the British, Americans, Spanish, French and Germans, among other nations, had all used concentration camps led some thinkers to ask whether such camps were inevitable features of the modern state. Perhaps the most provocative answer comes from the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, whose ideas have grown in prominence in the past two decades. For Agamben, the existence of the concentration camp reveals something fundamental about power \u2013 who holds it, and what gives them the authority to wield it. His work is dense, ranging across ancient Greek and Roman law, Biblical texts and Renaissance literature, but it has been influential on a generation of scholars and activists in the past two decades \u2013 particularly among those who wanted to understand the camp established by the US at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/13/saifullah-uzair-paracha-guantanamo-bay-al-qaida-war-on-terror\" title=\"\">Guant\u00e1namo Bay</a>, under an emergency policy after 9/11, or the growing phenomenon of immigration detention at the borders of the rich world.</p> <p>Sovereignty, as Agamben sees it, is founded on absolute power over human life, and has been since ancient times. The sovereign has the power not only to kill, but to strip people of rights through forms of banishment, reducing them to a state of what he calls \u201cbare life\u201d. In the past, sovereignty would have been concentrated in the figure of the monarch; modern states are supposed to have improved upon monarchy by restraining the arbitrary use of power through democratic checks and balances. But, according to Agamben, the tendency to banish and dehumanise keeps on coming back in the form of the concentration camp: a space where people are outside the law, yet more subject to its power than anywhere else.</p> <p>For Agamben, this reveals the basis on which power is exercised by modern states. In his words, the concentration camp is the \u201cnomos\u201d or fundamental principle of modern societies, the \u201chidden matrix\u201d of politics in our age. While they may only sometimes use it, governments retain the power to declare emergency measures \u2013 a \u201cstate of exception\u201d in Agamben\u2019s words \u2013 to strip us of rights, and confine us to spaces in which we live a kind of exile. The camp\u2019s logic, he implies, pervades seemingly free societies through modern state techniques of surveillance, bureaucracy, violence and other forms of coercion.</p> <p>Grand theories such as those of C\u00e9saire, Arendt and Agamben are valuable, but risky. By seeking to identify common patterns across specific societies, at different moments in history, they warn that all modern states have the potential to set up concentration camps. Misconstrued, however, they can end up obscuring crucial differences \u2013 such as the distinction between camps used in a deliberate policy of extermination, and those where people die through neglect. Holocaust deniers, for instance, or people who seek to downplay the severity of colonial massacres, often try to muddy these distinctions.</p> <p>When theory becomes dogma, it can also limit our understanding of the present. Agamben\u2019s own recent trajectory offers a cautionary tale: in late February 2020, he published a short essay in the leftwing Italian newspaper <em>Il Manifesto</em> criticising his government\u2019s draconian restrictions on public freedoms aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus. The piece referred to \u201cthe invention of an epidemic\u201d, and went further than merely questioning the long-term impact of these restrictions; it condemned them as \u201cfrenetic, irrational, and entirely unfounded\u201d, arguing the virus was \u201cnot too different from the normal flu\u201d. The piece has been widely criticised, and provoked a retort from the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy that had he listened to Agamben\u2019s advice not to have a heart operation 30 years ago, he would now be dead.</p> <p>Agamben is hardly the only person to have underestimated the threat posed by the coronavirus in recent months. As more governments pass emergency laws to deal with the pandemic, in some cases including draconian surveillance measures and the establishment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/pakistan-coronavirus-camp-no-facilities-no-humanity\" title=\"\">segregated quarantine camps</a>, it is right to ask where these might lead, and whether states will be willing to give up their new powers once the immediate danger to public health has passed. But that shouldn\u2019t obscure the fact that some emergencies are real: in these situations, the most important question is whether societies can respond to them without permanently destroying people\u2019s rights.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Concentration camps are uniquely dangerous spaces. Their effects may vary considerably, from the horror of Auschwitz to the more mundane misery that Arendt experienced in Gurs, but the people caught up in them almost always end up being treated as less than human. And if the political and technological innovations of the late 19th century made them possible, does the 21st century make them any more likely?</p> <p>In 2014, the Chinese government launched an initiative it called the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/09/09/eradicating-ideological-viruses/chinas-campaign-repression-against-xinjiangs\" title=\"\">Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism</a>, focused on the province of Xinjiang, in the country\u2019s far west. In the English-speaking world, details of the programme remained scarce until 2017, when reports started to filter through that thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">people from Xinjiang\u2019s ethnic U</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">ighur population</a>, most of whom are Muslims, were being detained. The following year, researchers who trawled through Chinese government procurement documents and satellite imagery pointed to the existence of a vast, newly constructed complex of internment camps, which they estimated had the capacity to hold anywhere between several hundred thousand and 1.5 million people. Former inmates have given testimony to journalists and researchers that they were forced into \u201ceducation\u201d programmes, made to eat pork and drink alcohol, and given compulsory sterilisation and abortions.</p> <p>This is just one example of how globalisation and technology have added a new dimension to an old problem. China has a long history of running camps \u2013 the political \u201cre-education\u201d programme launched by Mao in the 50s was one of the world\u2019s most extensive gulag networks. But the latest crackdown has new features. First, the Xinjiang camps are backed up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/11/china-hi-tech-war-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighurs-surveillance-face-recognition\" title=\"\">state-of-the-art digital surveillance</a> methods provided by leaders in the global tech industry: a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html\" title=\"\">computerised CCTV network</a> developed by a state-run defence manufacturer, designed to \u201capply the ideas of military cybersystems to civilian public security\u201d, which tracks individuals and analyses their behaviour to anticipate potential crime; a tracking app that visitors to Xinjiang are obliged to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/3/20681258/china-uighur-surveillance-app-tourist-phone\" title=\"\">install on their smartphones</a>; DNA analysis equipment <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/19/china-xinjiang-surveillance-biosecurity-state-dna-western-tech/\" title=\"\">partly supplied by US biotech firms</a>. Second, China has justified its crackdown to the rest of the world by adopting the same rhetoric that the US and its allies used after 9/11. In 2014, the Communist party launched its so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s war on terror\u201d in Xinjiang. China\u2019s methods may be extreme, but it is by no means the first country to have introduced policies that subject Muslims to collective suspicion and punishment, in response to violent Islamic fundamentalist groups.</p> <p>What else could tempt states to open camps? In her 2014 book Expulsions, the sociologist Saskia Sassen argues that the particular form of globalisation the world has experienced in recent decades \u2013 driven by a new form of laissez-faire economics \u2013 has unleashed a dangerous new dynamic that excludes large numbers of people from economic and social life. The global shift to \u201cprivatisations, deregulation and open borders for some\u201d has brutally punished the vulnerable and accelerated environmental destruction.</p> <p>In richer countries, Sassen argues, this leads to low-income workers being forced out of established welfare and healthcare programmes into more punitive systems (such as the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/23/million-families-cut-universal-credit-benefits-debts\" title=\"\">universal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/23/million-families-cut-universal-credit-benefits-debts\" title=\"\">credit scheme</a>), the impoverishment of sections of the middle class through austerity policies, and more and more people being locked up in prison. In poorer parts of the world, this means mass displacement and the warehousing of migrants as they try to move elsewhere.</p> <p>One result of these global pressures has been the rise of political movements that promise to shore up national, religious or ethnic identities. But identities are ambiguous, and when governments start using the tools of state power to reinforce the line between insider and outsider, there are always large numbers of people who get caught in between. In India, the government of Narendra Modi has been trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks\" title=\"\">reshape the country</a> along Hindu nationalist lines, undermining the secular and pluralist principles that have held sway since independence. The emerging camps in Assam, a north-eastern state on the border with Bangladesh, are a result: they target thousands of mainly Muslim residents who may have lived in India for decades, but because they originally came from across the border in Bangladesh \u2013 a legacy of partition \u2013 have never been registered as citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"328a035019c9f4df1c293edb8f017415f32e81f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/328a035019c9f4df1c293edb8f017415f32e81f9/0_264_5100_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detention centre under construction in Assam, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detention centre under construction in Assam, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The understandable response when confronted with injustice is to look for someone to blame. It\u2019s easier to do so when oppression is perpetrated by villainous leaders, or in other people\u2019s societies. But particularly in liberal democracies, the chains of responsibility can be complex. Who, for instance, is responsible for the arbitrary imprisonment, torture and slave-labour conditions that migrants and refugees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration\" title=\"\">in Libya</a> are subjected to? The immediate answer seems fairly simple: the state officials and local militias, some linked to trafficking networks, who run the detention centres. Thousands of people, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, are imprisoned in a network of these centres where they are regularly subjected to starvation, disease, torture, rape, and forced labour.</p> <p>But the reason those detention centres exist is because a range of European governments have been trying to get Libya to act as a block on unwanted migration across the Mediterranean for almost 20 years. The system was built with European support, both from national governments and at EU level \u2013 first through agreements with the government of Muammar Gaddafi, then, as the country collapsed after he was overthrown by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/23/nothing-moral-nato-intervention-libya\" title=\"\">Nato-backed uprising</a>, a patchwork of arrangements with state officials and local militias.</p> <p>There is no shortage of information about what happens in Libyan detention centres \u2013 and European governments frequently profess their horror at the atrocities committed there. Yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/05/eu-deal-libya-refugees-libyan-detention-centres\" title=\"\">system persists</a>, because those governments broadly agree that the goal of limiting migration is more important than dismantling Libya\u2019s detention system. The political consensus in most European countries, including the UK, is that limiting unwanted migration is a reasonable and desirable aim, and large numbers of their citizens have voted in support of it.</p> <p>When Zygmunt Bauman turned his attention to camps in the 90s, he argued that what characterises violence in our age is distance \u2013 not just the physical or geographical distance that technology allows, but the social and psychological distance produced by complex systems in which it seems everybody and nobody is complicit. This, for Bauman, works on three levels. First, actions are carried out by \u201ca long chain of performers\u201d, in which people are both givers and takers of orders. Second, everybody involved has a specific, focused job to perform. And third, the people affected hardly ever appear fully human to those within the system. \u201cModernity did not make people more cruel,\u201d Bauman wrote, \u201cit only invented a way in which cruel things could be done by non-cruel people.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When something today is described as a concentration camp, it almost always provokes an angry dispute. If camps aren\u2019t being used to exterminate people, as they have been in their worst instances, then the comparison is frequently condemned as inappropriate. But condemnation can be a way for governments to shield themselves from criticism of their decisions, and from criticism of the legitimacy of state power itself.</p> <p>In 2018, Donald Trump\u2019s government responded to a rise in the number of undocumented migrants \u2013 many of whom were asylum-seekers fleeing violence in Central America \u2013 crossing the US-Mexico border by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/detained-us-largest-immigrant-detention-trump\" title=\"\">drastically increasing</a> the use of long-term immigration detention. Reports of overcrowding, filthy conditions and the denial of due process for asylum claims soon followed, accompanied by measures that seemed intended to make a symbolic display of cruelty, such as the separation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jul/11/what-is-happening-to-migrant-children-at-us-border-facilities-podcast\" title=\"\">young children</a> from their parents. In June 2019, amid the outcry from opponents of this policy, congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez recorded a video for her Instagram followers: \u201cThe US is running concentration camps on our southern border,\u201d she stated, \u201cand that is exactly what they are \u2026 I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that \u2018never again\u2019 means something.\u201d</p> <p>This was a political intervention intended to shock people into challenging the Trump government\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 and in the row that ensued, some commentators objected that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reference to concentration camps and her use of the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d was an inappropriate Holocaust analogy. As the historian Deborah Lipstadt commented, \u201csomething can be horrible and not be like the Holocaust\u201d.</p> <p>But much of the response from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Republican opponents was to downplay the extent of abuses happening as a result of Trump\u2019s policies, or to portray what was happening as normal and routine. Some pointed out, for instance, that Trump was only making modifications to a system built by his predecessors: deportations of undocumented immigrants, for instance, reached their peak under Barack Obama. These sorts of equivocations have accompanied the use of camps from their inception, and they always try to give the same impression: that what\u2019s being done is normal and legitimate, that criticisms are overblown, marginal and extreme; and that states have the right to behave this way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5b3c37e194a935b407c437173123eb2de51b4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5b3c37e194a935b407c437173123eb2de51b4a6/0_0_4016_3012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Central Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, where people were detained after crossing the US-Mexico border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Central Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, where people were detained after crossing the US-Mexico border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story of Britain\u2019s concentration camps during the Boer war illustrates how a society that thinks of itself as liberal can make excuses for a mass crime. In 1899, when the British empire went to war against two breakaway Afrikaner republics in South Africa, it set up a network of camps that quickly expanded to detain several hundred thousand people. At first the camps were justified as \u201cprotection\u201d for Boer civilians who had signed an oath of loyalty; later, they were used to imprison Boer \u201cundesirables\u201d who had not signed the oath, as well as black South Africans who the British forced off their land to make them act as lookouts for troops. Due to poor sanitation, meagre food rations and overcrowding, diseases such as typhoid and measles frequently ripped through the camps; at least 28,000 white people and 20,000 black people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/10/focus.news\" title=\"\">were killed</a> by this system in just a few years.</p> <p>The two most prominent critics of Britain\u2019s camps \u2013 the feminist campaigners Emily Hobhouse and Millicent Fawcett \u2013 both had to struggle against political and public opinion that initially saw the camps as a wartime necessity, and both fought hard to alleviate suffering. But the grounds on which they did so were radically different, as the author Vron Ware <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09502386.2019.1638953\" title=\"\">has recently argued</a>. Fawcett, who visited South Africa with the government\u2019s approval to produce a report on the camps, saw her concern for the welfare of vulnerable civilians as compatible with the wider aims of the camps. \u201cSaving the children,\u201d for her, was \u201cas true a service to the country as that which men were rendering by going into the armies to serve in the field\u201d. But for Hobhouse, who was the first prominent activist to visit South Africa and expose conditions in the camps, British military values and the nationalism that underpinned them were the fundamental problem. She was challenging the legitimacy of state power itself.</p> <p>Hobhouse, who in her day was derided in sexist terms as a \u201cmad\u201d old lady, is now largely forgotten, while it is safe to say that Britain\u2019s concentration camps are not well remembered: last year the Conservative politician Jacob Rees-Mogg <a href=\"https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/concentration-camps-south-african-war-here-are-real-facts-fransjohan-pretorius-conversation\" title=\"\">defended their use</a> on an episode of Question Time, erroneously claiming that their mortality rate was only the same as that of Glasgow\u2019s at the time. But without Hobhouse\u2019s radical critique, it would have been harder to oppose the harm done by Britain\u2019s camps a century ago, and would be harder to understand why camps still appear in the world today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e0b4a87219837871e4dcae0f3df32ad2663b0c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e0b4a87219837871e4dcae0f3df32ad2663b0c2/0_227_1810_1085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A concentration camp for Boers during the Boer war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A concentration camp for Boers during the Boer war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The point of historical comparisons should not be to find identical situations \u2013 no two events in history are identical \u2013 but to alert us to potential dangers in the way states exercise power. Not everyone, for instance, reacted with outrage to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments last year. While she drew criticism from some Jewish organisations, including a rebuke from the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, the row also energised a US protest movement against Trump\u2019s immigration policy led by leftwing Jewish activists. The movement calls itself <a href=\"https://www.neveragainaction.com/\" title=\"\">Never Again Action</a>, explicitly drawing on a collective memory of persecution.</p> <p>In his final book, The Drowned and the Saved, the Auschwitz survivor and author Primo Levi reflected on the conditions that had made the Nazi camps possible, and wondered what lessons, if any, could be applied to a world that had moved on. The unique combination of factors that had unleashed the horror of Nazism was unlikely to return, he thought, but that should not obscure the danger of violence in our own time, or the politicians who seek to wield it. Violence, he wrote, \u201cis there before our eyes \u2026 it only awaits its new buffoon (there is no dearth of candidates) to organise it, legalise it, declare it necessary and mandatory and so contaminate the world\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the state as we know it is here to stay, then what can people do when governments start building camps? The history of the concentration camp has also been a history of people\u2019s resistance to camps, from both inside and out. Even in the most seemingly hopeless situations there are stories of people who have fought back against their treatment. The uprisings in the Nazi death camps of Sobibor and Treblinka are among the most famous; and the Soviet Gulag system was beset by strikes and revolts. On their own, these may not have been enough, but camps work by enforcing a rigid distinction between people on opposite sides of the barbed-wire fence. Those inside are kept silent and invisible, while those outside are encouraged to ignore or accept what is happening. Successful resistance aims at breaking down this distinction: governments know this, and even states that operate relatively mild forms of mass detention make significant efforts to obscure the conditions inside, and to deter their own citizens from prying too closely.</p> <p>One evening in February this year, I watched the Kurdish author Behrouz Boochani give a talk by video link to an audience at Birkbeck, University of London. Boochani, who currently lives in New Zealand, spent four years in Australia\u2019s \u201cregional offshore processing centre\u201d for asylum-seekers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/manus-island\" title=\"\">Manus Island</a>, Papua New Guinea. Australia has pioneered a type of long-term detention for unwanted migrants that is now becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/how-europes-far-right-fell-in-love-with-australias-immigration-policy\" title=\"\">more common</a> elsewhere in the world. Boochani and his fellow detainees were not merely being held for \u201cprocessing\u201d, but in harsh conditions intended to act as a deterrent to future travellers. The Australian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/doctors-freed-to-speak-about-australias-detention-regime-after-u-turn\" title=\"\">forbade</a> journalists to report on the full extent of these conditions, which included the beating and abuse of detainees, and introduced a law threatening doctors and social workers with up to two years in prison if they spoke in public about what they had witnessed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/05/five-myths-about-the-refugee-crisis\">Five myths about the refugee crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Boochani, however, smuggled out accounts of life in detention, via text messages sent to his translator by WhatsApp, that were turned into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/16/behrouz-boochani-manus-says-simply-i-did-my-best\" title=\"\">articles for the Guardian</a> and other outlets \u2013 as well as a memoir, No Friend But the Mountains. Boochani explained to us how he saw his detention as part of Australia\u2019s \u2013 and Britain\u2019s \u2013 longer history of treating non-white people as disposable. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than a prison,\u201d he said of the Manus camp. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where they take your identity and freedom from you, and try to destroy you.\u201d Detainees were given numbers, he said, which the guards used instead of their names; his was MEG45.</p> <p>The camp on Manus Island was eventually shut down by the Australian government, after widespread public criticism, although its broader asylum policies remain largely the same. For Boochani, writing was not simply a way to expose his conditions and link up with campaigners against detention on the outside, but to challenge the very basis on which the treatment of people like him was justified. \u201cI never use the language and the words that the [Australian] government use,\u201d he said. \u201cI say \u2018systematic torture\u2019, I say \u2018political prisoner.\u2019\u201d One of the things that gave him hope in confinement, he said, was the fact that animals could wander in and out of the spaces where human freedom was limited \u2013 a reminder that the structure which held him was built by people, and could therefore also be dismantled. \u201cNature,\u201d he said, \u201calways tried to reimpose itself on the prison.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>NSW Police\u2019s Marine Area Command has provided an escort for NSW Health and an independent medical team to board the stricken cruise ship, Ruby Princess, off the coast of Sydney earlier Thursday to assess the health of more than 1,100 crew and whether they are infected with Covid 19.</p> <p>The joint operation between Australian Border Force and NSW Police is part of the Australian government\u2019s efforts to deal with at eight cruise ships that are in Australian waters off the east coast and which have ignored an order to leave to their home ports.</p> <p>No police officers boarded the vessel, the police said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cDuring today\u2019s joint operation, a 66-year-old crew member was transported from the vessel requiring medical care,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSW Police Force is also assisting with a number of medical evacuations and transfers of Australian crew members from several cruise ships anchored off Sydney,\u201d the police said.</p> <p>NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller, who is in charge of the cruise ship situation in NSW will provide an update on the evolving operation regarding the management of cruise ships on Friday morning.</p> <p>Earlier in the day the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia had an obligation to provide healthcare to people who are sick and within our territorial waters, and that the government would take doctors from a private company to review health of about 8,500 crew, mostly foreigners, are onboard the ships owned by Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean.</p> <p>The prime minister said in his midday press conference that the ships off the New South Wales coast had been \u201cvisited for the purposes of health checks very, very recently\u201d .</p> <p>The Australian government ordered the vessels to leave Australia waters during the Covid-19 pandemic but they have so far refused to do so and some sick crew members have had to be medically evacuated to Australian hospitals.</p> <p>Fuller has the final say on who can disembark cruise ships.</p> <p>On Thursday morning Fuller said he feared that \u201cbringing 9,000 people off the cruise ships\u201d could \u201coverload\u201d the state\u2019s health system. \u201cWe know around the world that when the hospital systems become overwhelmed, then lots and lots of people die.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-calls-to-repatriate-15000-crew-members-from-cruise-ships-off-australias-coast\">Coronavirus: NSW government considers military-style operation to test crew on cruise ships off Australia's coast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>NSW police also forced another cruise ship, the Pacific Explorer<em>,</em> to leave Sydney harbour and anchor off the coast.</p> <p>Sture Myrmell, the president of Carnival Australia, which operates the Pacific Explorer, said in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Af1oWtHll6Y\">statement posted to YouTube</a> that the decision was \u201cparticularly sad and disappointing\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBeing able to send home those crew members who are not required for the safe operation of the ship is the right thing to do both from a humanitarian point of view and Australia\u2019s international standing as a maritime nation that looks after foreign nationals in its care,\u201d Myrmell said.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain concerned that it is not safe for the ship to sail away from Australian while there are crew members on board who are ill. </p> <p>\u201cAustralia has maritime obligations to protect the welfare of seafarers and as such we need to care for foreign nationals as we would expect other nations to care for Australians in similar circumstances abroad.\u201d</p> <p>But Morrison made it clear Australia would honour its international obligations to assist the sick in its waters.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are people who are sick and need healthcare, then whether it is a foreign national off our shores or an Australian somewhere else, then countries have been respecting that and that is the position of the Australian government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat has been respected, that has been honoured, as recently as we have seen in Western Australia with the cases that are there. We are provisioning those ships, so they will be able to move on their way.\u201d</p> <p>Support to reach the ships and process any people evacuated is being provided by the defence forces.</p> <p>A defence department spokesman said: \u201cAt the request of the New South Wales government, Defence is planning to provide land-based logistics and additional quarantine compliance at some NSW ports in support of NSW police.\u201d</p> <p>The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said on Thursday that non-Australian residents who were trapped on the ships could be \u201cextracted\u201d and \u201cflown back to their country of origin\u201d.</p> <p>Six crew members from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has now had more than 500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, had already been taken to Australian hospitals after falling ill.

Following the success of that operation, we were contracted to undertake similar work onboard the Grand Princess off San Francisco,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The details of the contract with Australian Border Force in relation to cruise ships off the coast was being finalised now, he said.</p> <p> The Maritime Union of Australia has urged the federal government to urgently repatriate all crew members, other than those directly responsible for marine operations, to address the growing humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>That would mean bringing crews onshore and organising charter flights to countries such as Philippines, India and China, where many of the crew originate.</p> <p>But the presence of the novel coronavirus will potentially open up a legal quagmire, particularly if the captains of the ship declare their ships in distress or refuse to leave Australian waters. There may also be difficulties getting countries to accept repatriated crew.</p> <p>Dutton said the Australian Border Force commissioner had already issued directions for a number of vessels to depart Australian waters \u201cand we\u2019re working through that with each of the companies now\u201d.</p> <p>But Dutton added: \u201cWe\u2019ve also got to be cautious about the fact that if you force these boats to set sail, and they end up having people die or people who are seriously sick by the time they get a couple of hundred nautical miles off the coast, they\u2019d turn around and come back.

The figures highlight how the pandemic has created a surge in demand for gun ownership, with some gun stores finding themselves inundated with panic-buyers, including, at least anecdotally, many Americans purchasing a gun for the first time.</p> <p>The record-breaking week of 16 March was when California residents were photographed lining up by the dozens outside local gun stores, as the Bay Area and then California as a whole announced the first emergency stay-at-home orders to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the United States.</p> <p>Friday 20 March broke records for the highest number of firearms background checks conducted nationwide in a single day: <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_top_10_highest_days_weeks.pdf/view\">210,308</a>.</p> <p>Americans can buy multiple guns from a licensed gun dealer with a single background check, meaning that the number of checks conducted does not reflect the total number of guns sold.</p> <p>In most states, private citizens can also sell guns to each other without a background check, and these private sales are not included in the FBI\u2019s numbers. There is no way to track how many guns were bought and sold in private sales over the past month. Some states also allow residents who have a license to carry a concealed firearm in public to buy guns without a background check, another category of gun sales not included in the FBI\u2019s statistics.</p> <p>Federal firearms background checks are also conducted for reasons other than gun sales, including for validating permits to allow people to carry a concealed firearm in public, and, in California, for ammunition sales.</p> <p>The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade group for the American firearms industry, produces regular \u201cadjusted\u201d estimates for gun background checks that subtract out background checks that the FBI tags as related to concealed carry permit applications, or to period checks by officials to make sure permits are still valid. This produces a lower number that is a closer proxy for gun sales.</p> <p>The trade group\u2019s adjusted numbers for March are still \u201csimply eye-popping\u201d, Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the industry group, wrote in an email.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d686fbabde9990cde98efe60b5b058bdfc5cc90a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d686fbabde9990cde98efe60b5b058bdfc5cc90a/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wait in line to purchase guns and ammunition in San Bruno, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait in line to purchase guns and ammunition in San Bruno, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_top_10_highest_days_weeks.pdf/view\">second-highest week</a> of total firearms background checks on record was 17 December 2012, the week after a mass shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, left 20 children dead, and sparked fears that the United States would pass sweeping national gun control measures.</p> <p>More than 950,000 firearms background checks were conducted that week, though US lawmakers ultimately failed to pass any additional gun control legislation after resistance from gun rights activists and many Republican politicians.</p> <p>While the FBI statistics do not include any information on what kind of purchasers are driving the spike in gun sales, some gun sellers have said they are seeing increased numbers of new gun owners.</p> <p>\u201cRetailers have been telling us that the overwhelming majority of those buying firearms over the last month have been first-time gun owners,\u201d Oliva, the spokesman for the firearms industry trade group, wrote in an email.</p> <p>American gun control advocates said they found the statistics on record-breaking numbers of firearms background checks concerning, and urged Americans to think twice before panic-buying a gun, particularly if they had never owned one before.</p> <p>Concerns have also been raised about children sheltering at home in houses where they might have access to guns, as well as the risk of gun suicide, which amount to approximately two-thirds of US gun deaths each year.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to prepare for the increased risk of more firearms in untrained hands,\u201d David Chipman, a senior policy adviser at Giffords, a leading gun violence prevention expert, said in a statement. <strong>\u201c</strong>If you didn\u2019t think you needed a gun prior to March of this year, you certainly don\u2019t need to rush out and get one now.\u201d</p> <p>Activists said that the number of guns sold in the past month could have been<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CamEdwards/status/1245431878334758912\"> even higher</a>, if some cities and states had not told gun retailers to close during stay-at-home orders, deeming them non-essential businesses. However, some of these orders have been changed under pressure from gun rights activists, particularly after the Trump administration included firearms manufacturers, retailers and shooting ranges as part of the national\u2019s \u201cessential critical infrastructure workforce\u201d.</p>",

They were also allowed to paint the flag on their vehicles, which rolled into Paris emblazoned with names such as Guernica and Don Quichotte (Don Quixote). Spanish was the common language within the company. All had fought during the liberation of French north Africa. </p> \n  <p>The company, also known as La Espa\u00f1ola because of the number of Spanish soldiers, was the first to enter Paris on 24 August 1944. While awaiting the surrender of the German governor of occupied Paris, La Nueve troops were sent to occupy public buildings and those taken over by the German military command as well as Place de la Concorde. </p> \n  <p>Allied troops led by GenCharles de Gaulle entered Paris the following day.

This involves plugging one extension into another in order to reach further or plug more appliances in, but is advised against in all circumstances.</p> \n  <p>And more than half said they sometimes place an electrical item such as a laptop or phone on their bed while it is charging as part of their WFH set up. The charity says electrical items should only ever be left on hard, non-flammable surfaces unless switched off and not charging to avoid the risk of overheating.</p> \n  <p>Electrical Safety First is recommending those working from home take advantage of its <a href=\"https://www.electricalsafetyfirst.org.uk/guidance/safety-around-the-home/overloading-sockets/\">Socket Overload Calculator</a> to check they\u2019re not plugging too many appliances in at once, and to pay extra attention to their electrical safety during their period of remote working.</p> \n  <p>Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With 70% of those currently working from home doing so for the first time due to Covid-19, it\u2019s unsurprising that not everyone will have a had a chance to ensure their work stations are free from electrical hazards. \u201cTake a few minutes to make sure you\u2019re not daisy-chaining extension leads of overloading your plug sockets and that you are charging your devices on hard, non-flammable surfaces.
