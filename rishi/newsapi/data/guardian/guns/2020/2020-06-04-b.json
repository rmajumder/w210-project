class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>UK </strong>researchers have called for the use of additional coronavirus symptoms to detect new cases, reduce infections and save lives.</p> \n  <p>In a letter published in The Lancet journal, the King\u2019s College London team discussed how loss of taste and smell should form part of screening measures for the virus.</p> \n  <p>The researchers, led by Professor Tim Spector, previously reported that loss of smell and taste is a key predictor of Covid-19 in addition to the most established symptoms of a high temperature and a new, continuous cough.</p> \n  <p>On May 18, the symptoms were added to the NHS coronavirus symptoms list, weeks after experts first raised concerns that Covid-19 cases were being missed.</p> \n  <p>However, the importance of the symptom was disputed by some.</p> \n  <p>The researchers\u2019 additional analysis of the Covid Symptom Study app data and its 3.7 million users sought to quantify the clinical value of recording loss of smell in the population.</p> \n  <p>They said: \u201cAs countries slowly emerge from lockdown measures, it is imperative to correctly contact-trace infected individuals.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe believe that having added loss of smell and taste to the list of Covid-19 symptoms is of great value as it will help tracing almost 16% of cases that otherwise would have been missed.\u201d</p> \n  <p>From 76,260 people with symptoms who tested positive for coronavirus up to May 19, 28.5% never reported any fever or cough and 16% reported loss of smell but not fever or cough.</p> \n  <p>Researchers say the prevalence of loss of smell and taste was three-fold higher in individuals testing positive (65%) than in those testing negative (22%), the strongest single predictor of being infected.</p> \n  <p>They suggest this means people with loss of smell and taste should self-isolate for at least seven days or until they can be tested.</p> \n  <p>Prof Spector said: \u201cWe believe that loss of smell and taste is a very common Covid-19 symptom, and in fact occurs more often than fever and lasts longer (five days on average compared to only two for fever).</p> \n  <p>\u201cInfections could be reduced and lives saved now that this non-flu-like symptom is widely recognised and actions are taken.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The researchers suggest that policymakers should consider these findings and their implications for mass screening as part of other public health measures in key areas such as schools, hospitals, airports and care homes.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed976798f0831e23dc1967d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

<strong>Brazil\u2019s</strong> indigenous populations with deaths caused by the disease increasing more than five-fold in the past month, according to data.</p> \n  <p> Many epidemiologists had hoped remote locations might protect the tribes, but the virus, which first took hold in state capitals of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, is increasingly devastating these far-flung communities where basic healthcare is often precarious.</p> \n  <p> Deaths among Brazil\u2019s indigenous populations rose to 182 by June 1, from 28 at the end of April, according to the Articulation of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Peoples (APIB), a national umbrella association that brings together the country\u2019s 305 tribes.</p> \n  <p>In the village of Soror\u00f3 in southeastern Par\u00e1, tribesman Itamar\u00e9 Suru\u00ed said one elder had died and people were falling ill but the government had not provided tests to confirm whether they have COVID-19.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

possible in the <strong>UK</strong>, the British Medical Association (BMA) said.</p> \n  <p>Transport secretary Grant Shapps announced that wearing a covering will be mandatory on public transport in England from June 15.<br></p> \n  <p>However, face-covering measures can help prevent the spread of Covid-19 and \u201cshould not be restricted to public transport\u201d, according to BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul.</p> \n  <p>Dr Nagpaul said the risk of the virus would be \u201cmuch less\u201d if the public wears face coverings straight away instead of waiting for the mid-June start date.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cThe BMA recently advocated the wearing of face coverings by the public several weeks ago in areas where they cannot socially distance and believes it is right that people should be required to wear face coverings on public transport.</p> \n  <p>\u201cGiven there remains a considerable risk of infection, with thousands of new cases every day, wearing masks can reduce the spread of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNot only will this afford greater protection to the public, importantly it will protect the lives of the staff working on public transport who, as evidence suggests, are at greater risk of infection.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese important measures should not be restricted to public transport but to all areas where social distancing is not always possible - the risk will be much less if the public adopts this now - not mid-June.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed96e038f0854eb54d99115\" class=\"block\"

and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread of coronavirus and urged protesters to get tested.</p> \n  <p>He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. <br> Officials in <strong>Chicago </strong>this week expressed similar concern, and asked protesters to quarantine themselves for 14 days.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo said his

economic activity.</p> \n  <p>With more people wearing face coverings, the state has made significant progress in halting the spread, as reflected in a drop in the rate of people testing positive for the virus over the past six weeks to 2% from 26%, he said.</p> \n  <p>The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients also continued trending lower, he added.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo said: \u201cI\u2019m not a

If found to be clear at the end of a week those cleared of the virus will be free to go. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe incident has shown how complicated tourism is,\u201d said professor Sypsas. As of 15 June blanket testing of plane passengers will be replaced by random \u2018spot\u2019 testing, he explained, because Greece simply didn\u2019t have the capability of testing everyone flying in and the EU had decided against endorsing such a move. </p> \n  <p>\u201cPlaying with this virus is like playing with fire,\u201d the expert lamented saying it was vital that countries were separated into categories of risk. </p> \n  <p>Both Albania and north Macedonia, Greece\u2019s northern neighbours, had seen a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases as a result of relaxing precautionary measures, he noted. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe biggest danger, as far as the epidemic is concerned, is complacency.

The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to underestimate the scale of the pandemic.</li> \n   <li><strong>A survey has shown increasing scepticism over governments\u2019 handling of the coronavirus crisis, with the UK suffering the biggest slump in confidence</strong>. In May, in G7 nations as a whole, 48% of respondents approved of how authorities had handled the pandemic, down from 50% in April and 54% in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil registered a record number of daily deaths from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day on Wednesday</strong>, even as city and state authorities move to open back up.

The authorities closed the borders to everybody but Spaniards, cross-border workers and truck drivers from mid-March when the country went into lockdown.</li> \n   <li><strong>China on Thursday said foreign airlines blocked from operating in the country over virus fears would be allowed to resume limited flights, lifting a de facto ban on US carriers</strong>, Agence France-Presse reports. This comes a day after Washington ordered the suspension of all Chinese travel into and out of the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico overtook the United States in daily reported deaths from coronavirus for the first time on Wednesday</strong>. The health ministry registered a record 1,092 fatalities and attributed the increase to improvements in documenting the pandemic.

An EU official said it was necessary to do as the United States was doing, even if this meant losing money as many of the vaccines under development are unlikely to be eventually successful.</p> \n  <p>The bloc is ready to take higher financial risks as it fears otherwise not having rapid access to a vaccine against the virus that has killed 385,000 people worldwide. The ESI fund is run by the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which acts on behalf of the 27 EU states.</p> \n  <p>German Health Minister Jens Spahn and his colleagues from France, Italy and the Netherlands wrote to the Commission saying they had joined up to \u201cachieve the fastest and best possible outcome in negotiations with key players in the pharmaceutical industry\u201d, German newspaper Handelsblatt wrote on Thursday.<br></p> \n  <p>The paper cited government sources as saying Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands were talking to several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca about government research funds and purchase guarantees.<br></p> \n  <p>AstraZeneca was not immediately available for a comment.<br></p> \n  <p>The four were also talking to Britain, Norway, Singapore and Japan about possible cooperation.</p> \n  <p>The EU is also worried that not enough doses might be available to rapidly vaccinate its population of nearly 450 million if a vaccine against the new coronavirus is developed. It is working on a vaccination strategy to give priority to the people most in need, like medics, nurses and the elderly. It remains unclear how the EU initiative will be coordinated with plans by individual member states to secure vaccines from pharmaceutical companies. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8af3f8f0893539f4cfd51\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T08:31:08.709Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ddb1c21a02b2565888a961744535a89f27c7f73\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ddb1c21a02b2565888a961744535a89f27c7f73/0_176_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36c3305adddd0b9a69007f59f0304cb50a07e708\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36c3305adddd0b9a69007f59f0304cb50a07e708/0_300_4495_2697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue to refill their empty oxygen cylinders in Callao, Peru.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a8e98f082107f453a7de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T08:01:41.386Z\">9.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Interesting and important thread here by John Burn-Murdoch of the Financial Times, on the coronavirus data being released by the <strong>Spanish </strong>government.

In an attempt to bolster their narrative that they can run Afghanistan better than the struggling administration, the Taliban launched a campaign to tackle the virus in March. They posted images online showing insurgents distributing masks and soap to villagers - albeit without any social distancing. In one image, masked militants wearing white protective suits check residents\u2019 temperatures and explain about personal hygiene as a machine gun is seen on a nearby table.</p> \n  <p>The virus entered Afghanistan as infected migrants returned from neighbouring Iran, the region\u2019s worst-hit country, and the Taliban ordered hundreds of returnees into quarantine.<br></p> \n  <p>In some areas they controlled, the insurgents allowed government health officials to monitor the virus\u2019s spread, rare for a group blamed for the deaths of dozens of medics over the years. But in recent weeks, residents from provinces such as Kunduz, Helmand, Uruzgan and Kandahar - where the Taliban hold sway over large areas - complain they have been abandoned to their fate.</p> \n  <p>In Kunduz, where the militants fought a fierce night battle before a short nationwide ceasefire last month, insurgents have barred medics.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey said they would handle the virus on their own,\u201d said Sebghatullah, a doctor from a nearby district, worried about the residents\u2019 lack of awareness when it came to personal hygiene. </p> \n  <p>Haji Qudratullah, a resident of Helmand, said he recently saw a group of Taliban fighters film a promotional video at a neighbourhood clinic, but they never returned. \u201cI have not seen anybody do anything to raise awareness about the virus here,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1f25605d3d6c4ff37e254d2168c03456c42ebcf\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f25605d3d6c4ff37e254d2168c03456c42ebcf/0_79_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Afghan tailor distributes free masks to the prisoners in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muhammad Younis, right, an Afghan tailor distributes free masks to the prisoners in Kandahar, Afghanistan, last month.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Muhammad Sadiq/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Taliban commanders insist they are helping fight the virus. \u201cPeople who are suffering from high fever, cough and body pain ... are taken to Trinkot,\u201d said Hafez Mohammad, a Taliban commander, referring to the capital of Uruzgan province.</p> \n  <p>The disease is also sweeping through the Taliban itself, with several high-level militants believed to be sick, according to international media reports.

Andrei Kogankov is seven months into a four-month contract and was supposed to be replaced in mid-March in Qatar. But a few days before he arrived, Qatar imposed a lockdown and banned international flights. From there to South Korea, Japan, South Korea again and on to Singapore and Thailand, each time the same story: Lockdown. No flights. No going home.</p> \n   <p>The open-ended extension of his contract \u2014 and with it the responsibility for his 21-man crew and a ship carrying flammable cargo \u2014 is taking its toll.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWhen you are seven months on board, you are becoming physically and mentally exhausted,\u201d Kogankov said by satellite phone from Thailand. \u201cWe are working 24/7.

No, the vessel is running all the time.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Officers sign on for three to four months, the rest of the crew for around seven months. But they always have an end date. Take that away, and suddenly the prospect of endless workdays becomes a strain.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gravely worried that there could be a higher increase of incidents and accidents. But we also are seeing a high level of what I would describe as anxiety and frustration,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to get off a ship, that adds to a high level of anxiety that really is quite demoralizing.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Unless governments facilitate crew changes, Cotton warned, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for us to convince the seafarers not to take more dramatic action, and ... stop working.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed88f988f082107f453a72c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T06:07:25.113Z\">7.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone.

It was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that the EHRC had received no response from the minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, he said.</p> <p>Isaac said he had had no reply to a letter sent to <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/briefing-letter-to-government-covid-19-coronavirus-19-march-2020.pdf?utm_campaign=EHRC+e-newsletter+%7C+March+2020&amp;utm_source=emailCampaign&amp;utm_content&amp;utm_medium=email\">Boris Johnson on 19 March</a> urging the government to \u201cconsider carefully the specific impacts [lockdown restrictions] may have on groups who are already disadvantaged in other ways\u201d.</p> <p>The letter warned about potential increases in domestic violence, the risks to gig workers, who tended to \u201cbe younger, from an ethnic minority, or have caring commitments\u201d, and stated that the burden of caring would be more likely to be shouldered by women, whose careers would be more likely to be damaged \u2013 which has been borne out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/working-mothers-interrupted-more-often-than-fathers-in-lockdown-study\">the evidence</a>.</p> <p>Asked if he thought the UK had become more unequal during the pandemic, Isaac said that good progress had been made in bringing equality up the agenda, but that the pandemic should act as a \u201ccall to arms\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like equality is a top-table issue at the moment, and it has to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus on equality has not been escalated in way that the severity of the situation requires.\u201d</p> <p>Isaac said the pandemic had shone a light on long-standing, structural race inequality in Britain, and raised serious issues that remained unanswered. Black and minority ethnic people have been disproportionately affected and have been two to three times more likely to die from Covid-19, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/may/bame-groups-two-three-times-more-likely-die-covid-19\">a UCL study</a>.</p> <p>A government-commissioned <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes?utm_source=2e046dd4-5550-4042-b5a7-372873716a2a&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate\">Public Health England (PHE) investigation</a> found that&nbsp;people of Bangladeshi background in England were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">twice as likely as white Britons</a> to die if they contracted Covid-19, and other BAME groups faced an increased risk of up to 50%.</p> <p>But the report was criticised for simply restating facts already &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">highlighted by other research</a>,&nbsp;rather than explaining the reasons for the stark disparity, or making recommendations to tackle it. The British Medical Association, which represents Britain\u2019s doctors, described it as \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d to instigate urgent action.</p> <p>Under the Equality Act, public bodies must show they have taken the needs of protected groups into account before policies are implemented and the EHRC has asked government for evidence of this, and is now considering using legal powers to force the government to act.</p> <p>\u201cOur frustration is the framework, under the Equality Act, already exists,\u201d said Isaac. \u201cConsidering the equality impact of policy decisions is not an optional extra \u2013 it\u2019s integral to getting us out of this crisis, but sadly it\u2019s being ignored.\u201d</p>",

There is a sense too that recent progress owes something to the unflinching stance of the TV broadcasters, whose hard-nosed position on payments due will be vividly familiar to anyone who has ever had their direct debit fail.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"66d0072f-2969-4949-9e13-d9ee563ee59b\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At which point the Premier League can enter its next phase, Project Fingers Crossed And Hope For The Best. The final stages in the return to action will be about logistics and finessing the details, not to mention the good health of everyone concerned, in ways that go beyond the rounds of Covid-19 testing carried out so far.</p> \n<p>There is now a shared urgency to return, ironing the details as and when they come up along the way. No consensus has been reached yet on a backstop curtailment provision should the season fail again, which no one seems ready to contemplate right now. Neutral venues will remain an option, to be used as and when required.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Marcelo of Real Madrid reported that for the first time during an extended break he felt his ball control suffering</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We can expect fixture lists to be produced in the next day or so, with details on exactly how the broadcasts will be styled also left to emerge as events move along. Most significantly the champions (whoever that may be) will lift the trophy as soon as it is mathematically confirmed, which is entirely sensible.</p> \n<p>There are probably three things worth taking from this right now. First, it is correct that the option of neutral venues is still open. There has been a tendency to respond to this angrily, as though people who watch football are being singled out and insulted by the suggestion they might be tempted to gather in groups at home grounds.</p> \n<p>This is in itself a failure of logic. The various types of existing lockdown breakers often mentioned in such arguments: the crowds at beaches and public parks. But these are just people in the same way football supporters are people \u2013 no doubt often the same people.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/six-premier-league-restart-problems-meeting\">Relegation, repayments and pileups: six Premier League restart problems | David Hytner</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The evidence is clear enough on this. Given the right motivation some humans in the UK will gather in groups against government advice. It\u2019s not offensive to a porous and non-exclusive subset of this society to suggest additional large events will make this more likely to happen. It is a shared bad habit that needs to be mitigated where possible.</p> \n<p>In any case, what difference does it make? There are no crowds present inside. Home or neutral ground: it is all essentially irrelevant, just as right now grandstanding, tribalism and the reflex taking of sides is not an appropriate response.</p> \n<p>The other major issue relates to the main on-field change agreed. For the remainder of the season five substitutes will be allowed, with nine reserve players permitted on the bench.</p> \n<p>This makes a lot of sense. The evidence of the Bundesliga suggests confinement has had a debilitating effect, with a significant amount of muscular strain injuries sustained in the early games.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78d84b4553c57876cad87a0581276195c76127f9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78d84b4553c57876cad87a0581276195c76127f9/196_571_3450_2071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Premier League has been keeping a keen eye on the Bundesliga, which restarted on 16 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Premier League has been keeping a keen eye on the Bundesliga, which restarted on 16 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Swen Pf\u00f6rtner/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is hardly surprising. Players are required to possess a rare combination of attributes at the elite level: speed and endurance, but also strength and flexibility, the ability to spring sideways, to leap and land properly, the necessity of contorting tired muscles into positions of unnatural strain.

There is perhaps even a case for rolling substitutes, or for built-in rest periods, although that would have required a preoccupation with wellbeing that is alien to football\u2019s governance. It is to be hoped no serious, pressure-induced injuries are sustained as a result.</p> \n<p>The other side to this is a loss of sharpness in basic technique. This week the French newspaper L\u2019\u00c9quipe ran a study on this subject, with input from players across Europe who have noted a loss of basic ball skills during confinement. Marcelo of Real Madrid reported that for the first time during an extended break he felt his ball control suffering. Players reported puzzled laughter at mistakes in training that just wouldn\u2019t normally happen. Patience will be required on all sides.

Perhaps we are now discovering exactly what the government means when it states that the return of football will \u201craise national morale\u201d. As the nation begins to boil in confinement, gripped with rage, dissent and some painful self-analysis, it is tempting to hear the hooves of the cavalry at the gate.</p> \n<p>So this is what happens when you take away the circuses. Or when people don\u2019t have VAR or a confected tribal identity to offer a little soothing release. Just when you needed something to defuse the mood of anger, racist abuse and online tribal rage. Here comes football. Hmm.</p> \n<p>It will take patience, and perhaps even a mild suspension of disbelief. But for better or worse, the great national distraction is back.</p>",
  "<p>A few days ago, the prime minister announced that he was doing away with the daily coronavirus briefings at weekends. It was just getting too hard to find cabinet ministers who were prepared to give up their Saturdays and Sundays \u2013 even the ever loyal \u201ccut out and keep\u201d Tory boy pastiche, Robert Jenrick, was playing hard to get \u2013 and Boris Johnson sure as hell couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it himself.</p> <p>It can\u2019t be long before No 10 pursues its dream of reducing the number still further, if Thursday\u2019s showing is anything to go by. One \u2013 two at a push \u2013 a week would be just about ideal. A win-win situation that would cut the workload and save the daily embarrassment of a minister having to explain that the government really didn\u2019t have much of a clue what it was doing and was just making up policy on the hoof.</p> <p>This is no reflection on Grant Shapps, the delegated fall guy for Thursday\u2019s press briefing. Shapps may not be the brightest kid on the block, but he\u2019s always been one of the more enthusiastic and by cabinet standards has so far had a reasonable coronavirus war. He\u2019s by and large managed to curb his natural tendency to smile when reading out the death statistics and he\u2019s put in more than his fair share of shifts in trying to make news out of something that is either a non-event or a government PR disaster.</p> <p>But even the transport secretary is now running on fumes. The sheer pointlessness of his existence is now getting to him. And understandably so. Though he tries to maintain the jaunty, upbeat exterior of a man who just can\u2019t wait to upgrade the A66, his shoulders are now permanently slumped and he looks dead behind the eyes. Too much more of this and he\u2019s going to crack and do a runner. Luckily he\u2019s got plenty of aliases lined up for his new life. Bye, bye Grant. Hello Michael Green.</p> <p>Having rattled through a few slides \u2013 astonishingly the one that showed that on the previous day the UK death total had been higher than the rest of the EU27 combined had gone missing \u2013 Shapps moved on to his \u201cbreaking news\u201d announcement. It had just come to his attention that there was a nasty disease called coronavirus going round, so from 15 June&nbsp;\u2013 might as well let a few more people die rather than doing it immediately \u2013 everyone on public transport was going to have to wear face coverings.</p> <p>Well, hello. Not only had many people, including London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, been calling for such measures for weeks now, most other countries had made it law a month ago. But Grant was adamant. The UK had a reputation to maintain as the country that took measures long after they had become blindingly obvious to everyone else. It was this kind of inaction that made the UK a \u201cworld beater\u201d in international stupidity.</p> <p>Still, Shapps could see some light at the end of the tunnel. One way out of these daily press briefings would be simply to broadcast those of other European countries that had taken place weeks ago. Just imagine the possibilities. Rather than wasting his time today, we could have replayed the press conference of a month ago in which the Spanish transport secretary announced the compulsory wearing of face masks on public transport only dubbed into English with Grant\u2019s voice. Put like this, no minister would ever need to appear in public again.</p> <p>There was a caveat, though. Face coverings alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop the coronavirus, so it was still necessary for people not to make unnecessary journeys, and to work from home wherever possible. This from a man who had literally queued for 90 minutes on Tuesday afternoon to take part in a vote to deny fellow MPs from having a vote or taking part in parliamentary proceedings because they had health issues, caring responsibilities, large distance to travel or were self-isolating. And all this just to indulge Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s ongoing public school fantasies of entitled omnipotence.</p> <p>Even when challenged on this by journalists, Shapps didn\u2019t seem to think there was anything wrong in the government implementing a three-line whip to break its own public health guidelines and put MPs and parliamentary staff at risk. \u201cEr,\u201d said Shapps. \u201cWe were getting behind with secondary legislation.\u201d Then learn to use a Zoom meeting like almost everyone in the country. There\u2019s nothing to stop a committee of MPs from scrutinising legislation online. But what Jakey wants, Jakey must have. After all, whose fault is it if you don\u2019t have a second London home and a fleet of nannies?</p> <p>Grant had no answer to any of the other questions. He didn\u2019t know what advice the government may have for BAME people. He didn\u2019t know why we had still been sending hospital patients into care homes without being tested in the middle of April. </p> <p>There was just time for the transport secretary to make it clear that no one was going anywhere anytime soon. Either home or abroad. For a start, people were forbidden from staying overnight in another home so UK holidays were out the question. And there was no point in people getting worked up about Priti Patel having introduced a quarantine on air travel at least six weeks too late at a time when it would be largely ineffective, because government advice was that no one should go anywhere by air anyway. So all summer holidays were cancelled and no harm had been done. That was the brilliance of having someone really stupid as home secretary.</p> <p>Shapps quickly curtailed any other questions. The Italian transport secretary was due on TV in a few minutes and it would be handy for him to know what he would be announcing in a month or so\u2019s time.</p>",

  "<p>American military force shaped the modern era. Sometimes it overthrew tyrannies and made the world safe, as in 1940s Europe. At other times it has made the world more dangerous, as in Vietnam and Iraq. In the civil war of the 1860s, the military preserved the Union at terrible but necessary cost. Since then, with a handful of exceptions and then mostly only at the request of state governors, the US military has been kept well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/george-floyd-protests-can-trump-deploy-federal-troops-onto-the-streets-in-the-us\" title=\"\">out of domestic politics</a>. America fiercely celebrates its military, but its laws place firm restrictions on military action within the United States itself.</p> \n<p>There is an overwhelmingly good reason for this caution. Military force, whether embodied in martial law or through the lethal power of arms and force, is incompatible with constitutional democracy, rights and justice. Poland discovered that in 1981. So did the democracy activists of China at Tiananmen Square in 1989. The people of countries like Egypt, Turkey, Thailand and Pakistan, where martial law has been common, know better than most what military rule entails. Lest there be any British smugness, remember also Northern Ireland, where the arrival of British troops in 1969 became as much the source of the nearly 40-year Troubles as their solution, especially after the Bloody Sunday shootings of civilians.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump is now actively agitating to dispatch American armed forces to crush protests on American soil. Whether he goes through with that threat depends on whether the protests, triggered by the police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis, continue at the level experienced in dozens of US cities during the past week. There are significant signs that the peak of the worldwide protests may have passed for now. But Mr Trump is in the provocation business. He thinks America\u2019s racial divisions may help his re-election campaign, badly damaged by his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nothing can be ruled out with this president.</p> \n<p>In Washington this week, Mr Trump gave Americans a taste of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/donald-trump-coronavirus-george-floyd-normalized\" title=\"\">what he may do</a>. Because he has more powers in the District of Columbia than in the states, Mr Trump mobilised military police, the 82nd Airborne Division, an army Black Hawk helicopter, and perhaps more shadowy groups, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\" title=\"\">shows of force</a> in the capital city. Having described the unrest, the majority of which has been peaceful, as domestic terror and promised to use \u201cthousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers\u201d, his forces used teargas to clear peaceful protesters from outside the White House. Then, accompanied by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, dressed in battle fatigues, Mr Trump staged a bible-waving photo opportunity.</p> \n<p>These posturings were so shocking that they sparked a rare political backlash within the military and beyond. The defence secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\" title=\"\">Mark Esper</a>, who had earlier called US cities a \u201cbattlespace\u201d, backed away from using force. His predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\" title=\"\">James Mattis</a> said Mr Trump was the first president in his lifetime who was a divider, not a uniter. Gen Milley, who three years ago expressed support for \u201cdisciplined disobedience\u201d for the sake of a \u201chigher purpose\u201d, issued an order to uphold equality, freedom of speech and the right to dignity. In the past, Trump aides have stayed shamefully silent. This may mark an overdue change.</p> \n<p>Mr Trump is infatuated with military and political <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/world/americas/trump-strongman-george-floyd.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">strongmen</a>. He sides with authoritarians like Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and Rodrigo Duterte. He supported the Tiananmen repression. He goes out of his way to praise violent military officers. Though he evaded military service himself, he has a fetish about the forces. Early in the pandemic he egged on armed movements that protested against social distancing. It may seem incredible that a president might seek the killing of his own people for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/the-us-would-condemn-other-countries-who-acted-this-way-what-a-sad-state-of-affairs\" title=\"\">political advantage</a>. But as he battles to retain power, military officials and Republican candidates, as well as voters and foreign governments, will all have to decide which side they are on.</p>",
  "<p>Despite a police ban, and in the shadow of the pending national security law which Beijing is imposing, Hong Kong residents gathered on Thursday night to mourn the bloody 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. The massacre fuelled a passionate campaign to grant Hong Kong\u2019s residents British citizenship, doomed by opposition to increased immigration. Most were instead granted the right to the British National Overseas passport, or BN(O), which carries no right of abode and was soon nicknamed \u201cBritain says No\u201d. It left the region with little expectation of support from its former coloniser as Beijing tightened its hold, breaching promises that the city could maintain its freedoms until 2047.</p> <p>In Hong Kong about 350,000 residents hold BN(O) passports, which allow them to remain in the UK, while another 2.5 million are eligible for them. Now the prime minister has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/britain-could-change-immigration-rules-for-hong-kong-citizens\" title=\"\">promised</a> that if \u2013 in reality, when \u2013 the Chinese government imposes a draconian national security law, Britain will allow any holder to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and to work here, potentially placing them on a route to citizenship. \u201cWe will honour our obligations,\u201d he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hong-kong-crisis-we-will-meet-our-obligations-not-walk-away-zv7f70n29\" title=\"\">an article for the Times</a>.</p> <p>This is a welcome announcement, given Britain\u2019s previous failure, and surprising rhetoric from a party with such a shameful record on immigration. It may owe something to the fact that Hongkongers, many of them highly skilled, English-speaking and entrepreneurial, are more likely than others to be regarded by the right as \u201cgood\u201d immigrants who may be useful in post-Brexit Britain. (Strikingly, the Spectator this week <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/our-duty-to-hong-kong-the-case-for-granting-full-british-citizenship\" title=\"\">called</a> for full citizenship to be granted).</p> <p>But campaigners say they need to see the detail. Like others, BN(O) passport holders can already work here if an employer sponsors their visa; are they gaining new working rights? As others have found, there are plenty of obstacles and toll charges on the path to citizenship, including thousands of pounds in application fees. And the government\u2019s handling of the <a href=\"https://helprefugees.org/news/press-release-help-refugees-response-to-announcement-that-section-67-dubs-amendment-now-ended/\" title=\"\">Dubs amendment</a> to bring unaccompanied refugee children to the UK has shown that its promises cannot be counted upon.</p> <p>In reality, many in Hong Kong will want to remain there, despite their fears about China\u2019s tightened grip. Others will not be helped by this scheme: the right to a BN(O) passport cannot be inherited, and no one born after 1997 is eligible \u2013 ruling out many young protesters.</p> <p>While the government\u2019s promise is welcome, it is too vague and limited. It must also be accompanied by strong and coordinated international efforts to support those who will remain in the city, by choice or because they are among the millions not covered by this offer: \u201cThey only offer us an exit, and do not offer to stand by us in our fight for Hong Kong,\u201d said the veteran activist Lee Cheuk-yan.</p> <p>With the US, Australia and others taking a tougher line towards China, Britain has finally begun to harden its previously feeble response to clear breaches of the Sino-British joint declaration, which laid out Hong Kong\u2019s future. Seven former British foreign secretaries have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/seven-former-foreign-secretaries-urge-uk-to-take-lead-on-hong-kong\" title=\"\">called</a> for the UK to lead the international response to the security law.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has not yet received the results of his coronavirus test, the PM\u2019s spokesman said.</strong> Sharma was tested after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/business-secretary-alok-sharma-coronavirus-test-speech-commons\">falling ill while delivering a speech to MPs from the dispatch box in the Commons yesterday.</a> The spokesman said that, if Sharma did test positive, he would work with the government\u2019s new test and trace system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman played down the likelihood of Boris Johnson being asked to self-isolate if Sharma does test positive - even though the two men attended a meeting together yesterday - but did not rule it out</strong>. The 45-minute meeting, which was also attended by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, took place in the cabinet room at No 10. The spokesman said that the meeting, like all meetings at No 10, was \u201cproperly socially distanced\u201d and that the participants stayed more than 2 metres apart. The spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#people-who-develop-symptoms-of-coronavirus\">the test and trace guidance </a>was \u201cnot as simple as saying if you have been in a room with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you are required to self-isolate\u201d. People have to self-isolate if they have had face-to-face contact, at a distance of less than 1 metre, with someone who tests positive, or if they have spent more than 15 minutes within two metres of that person. But the spokesman did not go as far as saying that he was confident that Johnson would not be asked to self-isolate if Sharma tested positive. Asked if Johnson would comply if he were asked to self-isolate, the spokesman said: \u201cWe would follow the advice given by the medical experts.\u201d The spokesman also said that the cabinet room was \u201cvigorously cleaned\u201d yesterday, but that that was usual practice and happened every day.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street is not reconsidering the government\u2019s move to abandon virtual sittings of the House of Commons in the light of Sharma\u2019s illness, the spokesman said.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to deny a report on Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches last night saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac#block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac\">Johnson told his Italian counterpart on 13 March that he wanted \u201cherd immunity\u201d.</a></strong> Asked about the report, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The position of the government is that herd immunity has never been its policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the spokesman did not deny that Johnson had said the words attributed to him in the programme and, when asked if he was willing to clarify this directly with the PM, he suggested there was no need because he had made the position clear.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said 171,829 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday.</strong> But the government had the capacity to carry out 220,213, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-tens-thousands-covid-19-tests-voided-decision-send/\">the Telegraph story (paywall)</a> saying that tens of thousands of coronavirus tests were returned void after being sent to a US laboratory for analysis.</strong> He said 67,000 tests had been sent to the US, and 29,500 were returned void.

He said in total 4.2m tests had been carried out.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman denied<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/03/exclusive-hairdressers-could-reopen-month-plans-barbers-stylists/\"> a Telegraph report (paywall) </a>claiming hairdressers in England could be allowed to open as early as 15 June.</strong> He said the ambition was to reopen them from July at the earliest.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman did not challenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/03/two-in-five-schools-in-england-yet-to-reopen-to-any-more-pupils\">a Guardian report</a> saying that in some areas up to 90% of primary schools remained closed this week, even though schools in England are meant to be reopening for some year groups.</strong> One survey suggests 44% of English primaries remained closed. The spokesman said that what happened this week was \u201cbroadly ... in line with expectations\u201d and that \u201cwe expect that attendance will grow over time\u201d. He said official attendance figures would be published next week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government has ruled out running the school meal voucher system in England over the summer holidays.</strong> But there will be a \u00a39m programme offering some pupils activities and meals, said the spokesman, who also hinted it might be expanded.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government did not agree with the suggestion from Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, that the Covid-19 virus was man-made.</strong> Dearlove made the claim <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-coronavirus-began-accident-disease-escaped-chinese/\">in an interview with the Telegraph.</a> \u201cWe have seen no evidence that the virus is man-made,\u201d the spokesman said.

In an email to constituents sent out on Thursday 28 May, after Durham police gave their view, he adopted a tone that was very different from the one taken by Braverman a few days earlier.

That may be because some politicians are calculating that what the public really wants most at the end of all this is not change, but something approximating to what life was like before. Boris Johnson has said nothing at all about how the crisis could be a catalyst for progressive change.

  "<p>Ensuring that every passenger on public transport wears a face covering will require a significant change to current behaviour \u2013 and potentially an uphill battle.</p> \n<p>A Guardian survey suggests that fewer than four in 10 people currently wear one, with young and middle-aged men the least likely to use them on trains, buses, trams and the tube.</p> \n<p>The survey of almost 800 travellers in Manchester, Glasgow and London carried out this week found that in some areas as few as 10% of passengers wear face coverings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It also showed that outside London, the use of face coverings fell dramatically, although most of the public transport used was still quiet, reflecting the current status of lockdown restrictions.</p> \n<p>Of 465 passengers on London tube carriages and buses on a variety of routes on Tuesday , less than a third of men and half of women were wearing face coverings. White men in particular were less likely to cover their faces.</p> \n<p>In Manchester on Wednesday, only 10% of travellers on trams and buses surveyed \u2013 22 out of 212 \u2013 wore face coverings. And on trains and around the subway in Glasgow on Thursday, fewer than one in five \u2013 18 out of 98 \u2013 were wearing face coverings.</p> \n<p>Phoebe, a 20-year-old Chinese student, said she didn\u2019t understand why more people were not wearing face coverings. \u201cI\u2019m staying in London with my grandma while I\u2019m studying here,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put her at risk so I always wear a mask when I travel. Wearing a mask is about being considerate towards others. That takes no effort at all. I don\u2019t understand why some people believe it is not a good idea to wear a mask.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unlike countries such as France, Vietnam and the Czech Republic, where mask-wearing is compulsory in some or all public spaces, the government\u2019s advice has until now appeared hesitant and uncertain.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/09/young-men-more-like-than-women-to-break-lockdown-rules-uk-survey\">Research</a> has shown that young men are more likely to breach lockdown rules than young women - and according to the Guardian\u2019s research, they also seem less likely to wear face coverings than other groups.</p> \n<p>Young and middle-aged white men in London were least likely to be wearing a face covering among those we surveyed, with just 18% wearing them.</p> \n<p>One mask-wearing hospital consultant interviewed by the Guardian while on the tube to work at the Whittington hospital in north London, expressed alarm at the low numbers of people wearing masks while travelling. \u201cIf two people are close to each other on public transport and both are wearing masks the risk of transmitting the virus is reduced by 90% ,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>The consultant, from an Asian background, condemned the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic as chaotic, saying that it had only recently acknowledged the increased risk the virus poses to black and minority ethnic communities. He said that its refusal to learn from other countries in terms of policies like mask wearing in public was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.</p> \n<p>Among the 265 men in the London survey 70% \u2013 186 \u2013 were not wearing masks. The figure for the 192 women surveyed who chose not to wear masks was 100 out of 192 \u2013 52%.</p> \n<p>A minority of passengers on buses and tubes in London who we surveyed were older people; the vast majority were young and middle-aged. We broke down our data into three ethnic groups \u2013 black, white and Asian. Only 18% of all the 126 white men we observed travelling \u2013 29 \u2013 wore masks, compared with 39% of Asian men \u2013 17 out of 43 and the 29% of black men \u2013 14 out of 48.</p> \n<p>Frazer Blackley, 55, travelling on London Underground\u2019s Northern Line, said that he did have a mask but didn\u2019t wear it when the tube was quiet, only if it got crowded. One man, a retired psychologist, said he wasn\u2019t convinced of the efficacy of masks, but carried one in his pocket which he put on sometimes \u201cto provide reassurance\u201d to other members of the public.</p> \n<p>Mask-wearing among women from all ethnic groups was higher than for men and more consistent across ethnic groups with 43% \u2013 48 out of 111 white women travelling \u2013 wearing masks, along with 43% of Asian women \u2013 17 out of 39 \u2013 and 37% of black women \u2013 nine out of 24 women travelling.</p> \n<p>Of the 212 people surveyed in Manchester, travelling from Whitefield in north Manchester to affluent Didsbury in the south through the city centre and including MediaCity, 190 people from all ages and backgrounds were not wearing face coverings. Of the 22 that did, 13 were men with three appearing to be middle-aged. Of the women surveyed, young white women were the most likely to wear a face covering.</p> \n<p>In Glasgow, out of 98 travellers, 18 were wearing face coverings, usually ready-made reusable masks rather than scarves or other cloth items. They were worn by an equal number of men and women, and mainly by middle-aged people. Of the travellers observed, the sexes were evenly split; around half were younger people, and the vast majority were white. Of those not wearing masks, similarly around half were younger people and just over half were men. </p> \n<p>While different scientists have reached different conclusions about the efficacy of masks, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/2020/04/13/masks-summary/\">consensus</a>&nbsp;is in favour of mask wearing.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the findings of the Guardian survey, Prof Trish Greenhalgh from the University of Oxford said: \u201cThe evidence on face coverings is contested but my own interpretation is that is stacks up strongly in favour. SARS-CoV-2 is spread by droplet infection, and droplets are stopped by cloth face coverings.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think this small survey indicates that this policy [of compulsory face coverings on public transport] is needed. After all, my mask mainly protects you and yours protects me, so to be fair on everyone, all of us should be wearing a face covering.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Jonathan Fluxman of the campaign group&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.masks4all.org.uk/\">#Masks4All</a>, urged everyone to wear a mask in public. \u201cThe findings of the Guardian survey are not at all surprising given the government\u2019s dreadful messaging around face coverings. To describe them as \u2018marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure\u2019 totally undermines their importance and effectiveness, as demonstrated in numerous other countries.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIf 80% of people wear them, we can drive down transmission.&nbsp;Please do wear one whenever you encounter other people.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

However, these robust masks have to be combined with goggles or a visor, and they are costly, in limited supply, and uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The evidence around homemade masks or face coverings, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">public in England will now be required to wear on public transport</a>, is less clear cut.</p> <p>Studies in laboratories have shown that they can reduce the distance and number of droplets spread by coughs, but the impact of masks in \u201cfield conditions\u201d has been harder to assess. The ambiguity around the science probably explains the different approaches different countries have taken \u2013 and the evolving rules around wearing face masks.</p> <h2><strong>Was advice to wear face masks previously considered in the UK?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. As early as 3 February one of the key bodies advising the government on its approach to tackling the pandemic, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) concluded there was some evidence to support the wearing of masks by those with symptoms to prevent transmission. The group recommended to the Department of Health and Social Care that symptomatic people should wear fluid-resistant masks \u201cif tolerated\u201d.</p> <p>This never became a recommendation to the general public. The same group said there was limited evidence of the benefits of the general public wearing face masks as a preventative measure.</p> <p>Separately, in April, behavioural scientists sitting on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) considered the pros and cons of recommending face masks. The group highlighted the risk that wearing masks could make people feel invincible and therefore be less likely to adhere to other rules around socialising and staying at home. At the time, some also had concerns that recommending the wider use of face masks could exacerbate the acute shortages of PPE among healthcare workers that the UK was grappling with earlier in the pandemic.</p> <h2>Has the science on face masks changed?</h2> <p>Previously, the government has defended its decision not to recommend the use of face masks \u2013 while other countries have urged people to adopt masks \u2013 saying: \u201cFor the majority of people in more general settings, there is little evidence of widespread benefit of using face masks to prevent transmission.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">Thursday\u2019s announcement</a>, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: \u201cThe evidence suggests that face coverings offer some, albeit limited, protection against the virus.\u201d</p> <p>So has the science changed? Although there have been concerted efforts to answer the question of whether face masks make a difference, there has not been a dramatic shift in the science: there is some evidence of a benefit, but it remains fairly weak.</p> <p>This week, the Lancet <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext\">published the most comprehensive paper</a> to date on the subject, a systematic review of 172 studies looking at the role of physical distancing measures, face masks, and eye protection to prevent transmission. It found weak support for the use of face coverings, with the risk of infection or transmission when wearing a mask being estimated at 3% versus 17% when not wearing a mask. Evidence in the study was looking mainly at mask use within households, rather than on public transport, and the authors note that the certainty of the evidence is low and other measures, such as physical distancing, are by far the most effective at reducing the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The science is still uncertain, but as the most robust infection control measures are lifted, the more marginal gains that may be achieved through the use of face coverings may have simply become more relevant.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on&nbsp;5 June 2020 to clarify that the requirement to wear face masks on public transport applies in England, not the UK.</p>",
  "<p>Gypsy and Traveller communities around the country have been left without water and sanitation facilities during the coronavirus lockdown, prompting concern from politicians and charities.</p> <p>Families in England have no access to sanitation, refuse collection, or water for drinking, cooking, showering and washing clothes, the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma (GRT) said in a letter to the Local Government Association.</p> <p>Some local authorities have directed vulnerable Travellers to uncleaned public toilets with no hand-washing facilities, the letter said, while others are attempting to evict camps. It stressed that these basic facilities were needed for communities to physically distance, self-isolate and follow guidelines on hand washing and hygiene.</p> <p>One Irish Traveller, Catherine*, who lives with her sister and two children, aged 12 and two, in south-east England, moved from an overcrowded site because she was worried about the risk of catching the virus from others.</p> <p>The family are now on public land outside a transit site closed due to Covid-19, and are struggling to access water and toilet facilities.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other families on there, so we could use it to isolate, but the local authority won\u2019t let us. We have to drive to get to the water, and the toilets close at 6pm. We\u2019re&nbsp;usually fine with a public toilet, we\u2019ve used them hundreds of times before, but we don\u2019t want to risk infection,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re worried about not having water for the kids now it\u2019s getting warmer. &nbsp;It feels very depressing, we\u2019ve got no toilet, no nothing. We can\u2019t drive anywhere, because we don\u2019t have anywhere to go.&nbsp;It feels like they just don\u2019t care about us.\u201d</p> <p>The issues mainly affect those living on canals and waterways, or roadsides in unauthorised encampments, which national charity Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) estimates to be around 25,000 people. Many are struggling to get support from councils already overstretched as a result of the Covid-19 response.</p> <p>\u201cYou can get stuck in bureaucratic processes, which obviously, if you\u2019re sitting next to a water butt that is emptying out as you drink and you wash your hands and cook dinner, then that can be quite stressful,\u201d said Sarah Sweeney, FFT policy and communications manager.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the conditions that are more prevalent in Gypsy and Traveller communities include things like asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], so those hand in hand create a perfect storm in terms of the impact [Covid-19] could have on Gypsies and Travellers.\u201d</p> <p>Travellers on unauthorised sites often struggle with water and sanitation facilities, but the closure of leisure centres, churches and petrol station toilets, which are often used for water supply, as well as recycling centres, has exacerbated the situation.</p> <p>FFT stressed that the majority of people on unauthorised encampments would prefer to be on a site, but are unable to do so because of a chronic shortage of pitches caused by the failure by local authorities to identify land in local plans where Travellers can stop.</p> <p>Alison Blackwood, manager of Southwark Traveller Action Group, has been involved in getting a water stand pipe set up at a Traveller site in Hertfordshire, which had no access to running water.</p> <p>\u201cIt does seem in this day and age, and in the middle of a crisis like this, that for some people not to have access to running water is quite shocking,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In April the communities minister, Stephen Greenhalgh, wrote to all local authorities highlighting the vulnerability of Travellers during the pandemic. \u201cSome Gypsies and Travellers are particularly vulnerable and have the potential to be disproportionally impacted by Covid-19, and some will already have been asked to shield for 12 weeks due to high-risk underlying health conditions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kate Green, the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for GRT, said: \u201cTravellers are a group protected under equality law, and they are entitled to expect that public protection measures that are applying to the settled community are working effectively, with any necessary adaptations, for them too.\u201d</p> <p>The letter to the LGA noted that some local authorities, including Leeds and Bristol city councils, have taken action to support Traveller communities during the lockdown.</p> <p>Bristol city council has set up temporary sites with safely distanced pitches for the GRT community and vehicle dwellers, with shared facilities disinfected on a daily basis. A council spokesperson said the local authority was working with the GRT community to \u201censure everyone has a safe place to rest and access basic necessities through this difficult time\u201d.</p> <p>*Name has been changed to protect anonymity.</p>",

The question today is whether it will be expanded or whether the central bank will hold fire until July.<br></p> <p>Many analysts expect the ECB to up buying by \u20ac500bn, as purchases at their current rate are expected to run out by October. <br></p> <p> <strong>Derek Halpenny</strong>, head of research at <strong>MUFG</strong>, an investment bank, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We think today is the day in which the ECB needs to reinforce the perception of European authorities finally getting to grips with the scale of the Covid-19 hit with further QE action.</p> <p> A failure to act today would imply consideration is being given to only running the program until September which would result in considerable anxiety amongst investorsthat would result in an immediatetightening of financial market conditions. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Seema Shah, </strong>chief strategist at <strong>Principal Global Investors</strong>, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the ECB only having spent a third of the \u20ac750bn [Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme], anything less than a \u20ac500bn expansion will be a disappointment and could undo the recent weeks of market strength. Although equity markets seem to believe a V-shaped economic recovery is underway, the reality is that the euro area economy continues to struggle under the weight of the coronavirus crisis and the ECB cannot afford to delay additional stimulus. </p> </blockquote> <p>Focus is also on whether the bank will expand purchases to include \u201cfallen angels\u201d - companies that have lost their investment-grade ratings during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>That would give the ECB more room for manoeuvre and help parts of the economy that might need it more.<br></p> <h2>Thoughts on the eurozone\u2019s fiscal stimulus<br></h2> <p>The EU is wending its way towards a recovery fund to pull together governments across the bloc into a massive fiscal stimulus. But with sensitivities around the politics of risk sharing (opposed by some northern European countries), Lagarde has a delicate balance to strike.<br></p> <p><strong>Commerzbank </strong>told clients that the desire to keep pressure up on governments could lead to the ECB delaying its QE announcement:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will be a very close call with the hawks potentially swaying a consensus-minded President Lagarde to defer the announcement, also to keep pressure on the politicians to deliver on the EU Commission\u2019s \u20ac750bn Next Generation EU Fund. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Donovan</strong>, an analyst at investment bank <strong>UBS</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB President Lagarde will be happy that someone is doing fiscal stimulus (as the pandemic is a problem for fiscal policy, not central bank policy). Today\u2019s meeting should continue to emphasise the need for quantitative policy to support financial markets and ensure sufficient liquidity in the economy. <br></p> </blockquote> <h2>Updated economic forecasts</h2> <p>Everyone and their dog knows that the eurozone economy is in recession, but the question is how deep is it. </p> <p>Lagarde has already dismissed the \u201cmild\u201d scenario of a 5% fall in output this year. That leaves a decline of between 8% and 12% in GDP - twice as deep as after the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>If inflation forecasts are also weak that would support the case for more stimulus from the ECB.<br></p> <h2>The German court ruling</h2> <p>Looming over the ECB\u2019s bond purchases is the German constitutional court ruling that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\">may have exceeded its mandate</a> by directly financing government spending. The Karlsruhe court said the ECB must carry out a \u201cproportionality assessment\u201d within three months in its 5 May ruling.<br></p> <p>Lagarde has insisted the ruling will leave the bank \u201cundeterred\u201d in battling the crisis. Acting now could make it less likely that any support is withdrawn at a later date.<br></p> <p>Principal\u2019s Shah said:<strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Close attention will also be paid to any hints that that last month\u2019s German Constitutional Court ruling will tie the ECB\u2019s hands in future, with the euro\u2019s longest winning streak in six years at risk.

In the following days, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, laughed off claims in an interview with Sky News that he had rushed to introduce the system amid the political row over the alleged breach of lockdown rules by Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.</p> \n<p>Initially, an app was supposed to be part of a national rollout of the test-and-trace programme, but this element has been beset by problems and instead the tracing system started without it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prestedge said he expected test and trace to be running for 24 months and that initially test results would take two to three days to arrive, with the hope this would improve over time.</p> \n<p>A leaked message from Rupert Soames, Serco\u2019s chief executive, also revealed his own concerns about the early months of the programme. Serco is among a number of companies that are recruiting, coaching and managing contact tracers who do not have clinical training.</p> \n<p>They have taken the bulk of the work, recruiting 10,000 of the new 25,000 contact tracers after being awarded an initial fee of \u00a345.8m, which could rise to \u00a390m.</p> \n<p>In an email forwarded to staff, which was then immediately recalled, a message from Soames said: \u201cThere are a few, a noisy few, who would like to see us fail because we are private companies delivering a public service. I very much doubt that this is going to evolve smoothly, so they will have plenty of opportunity to say I told you so.\u201d</p> \n<p>It continued: \u201cIf it succeeds \u2026 it will go a long way in cementing the position of the private sector companies in the public sector supply chain. Some of the naysayers recognise this, which is why they will take every opportunity to undermine us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Soames also asked managers to make sure employees behave in a way to survive the \u201cDaily Mail test\u201d, explaining that this meant \u201cthat you would not mind their behaviour being described on the front of a national newspaper\u201d. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt is inevitable that someone somewhere is going to behave badly,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to know immediately to resolve the issue.</p> \n<p>He continued: \u201cAt Serco we have a fair amount of experience managing difficult issues and one of the hard lessons we have learned is that the truth we can manage, it\u2019s the evasion or cover up that destroys you.\u201d&nbsp;<br><br>Serco said the message from Soames was not recalled but may have been forwarded to a wider group of employees in an email that was recalled.</p> \n<p>Madders said: \u201cThe government\u2019s own scientific advisers have said that an effective track, trace and isolate system must be fully operational before the lockdown is relaxed&nbsp;further so any suggestion that we may be months away from that is deeply concerning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need assurances from ministers that they urgently ensure an effective system is in place and working effectively. To move ahead with further easing of the lockdown without this vital system working fully would be a huge gamble that no responsible government should take.\u201d</p> \n<p>Those working for test and trace have raised concerns about a slow start. The Guardian was shown an email dated 2 June from one provider to their team that said: \u201cWe did experience some teething issues yesterday particularly with CTAS [the contact&nbsp;tracing&nbsp;and advice service software] and this feedback has been shared with the clients.\u201d</p> \n<p>It told those working for the service that the data volumes were still very low and there would be times when no records were available. Staff were advised to concentrate on e-learning at this time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On 1 June, an email told staff their hours would be reduced owing to a lack of cases coming through.&nbsp;Another email said: \u201cWith the operations in its early stages, the data volume at the moment is not at full capacity, and as such you may experience prolonged periods of waiting for a case.\u201d</p> \n<p>One anonymous worker said: \u201cThe communication and training have been terrible from the start and I\u2019m yet to know anybody who has made a call to a member of the public.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have been paid to do nought and been dossing all day every day on government money. I have personally been sat in my garden sunbathing, drinking and chilling with my pals for two and a half weeks now, occasionally coming inside to stop my computer going to sleep and check my emails. Normally I would be happy about this but when the country\u2019s public health is at risk. It is a tragedy.\u201d</p> \n<p>A&nbsp;Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe new NHS test and trace service is up and running and is helping save lives.&nbsp;Anyone in this country can now&nbsp;book a test and&nbsp;the majority who book a test get the results back within a day.&nbsp;We have over&nbsp;25,000 contact tracers in place, who have all been trained and are fully supported in their work&nbsp;by public health experts.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As a Conservative voter of, until recently, 37 years\u2019 standing, I am appalled at what has been done by the leader of the house (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\" title=\"\">MPs join 90-minute-long queue to vote to end virtual voting</a>, 2 June). It is so obviously and completely wrong, unfair, unjust and anti-democratic, with scenes reminiscent of voter suppression in the US, where voters in gerrymandered states often have to queue for up to five hours to vote, and with those MPs being disenfranchised not even being allowed a vote on the matter, in the manner of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. There can therefore only be one conceivable reason for it: to avoid debate in parliament, and to reduce opportunities for ministers to be held to account \u2013 especially, I assume, the PM, whose performances have been appalling and who is the one most in need of being \u201cshielded\u201d from scrutiny \u2013 and as a power grab by the executive at a critical time.</p> <p>This measure undermines all that the Conservative party is supposed to stand for. It was also wrong that a measure so fundamentally affecting our democratic process should be whipped through by the government, again suggesting it was done for partisan political advantage. This makes me fear for our democracy, and I very much hope that the courts will be able to overturn it.

  "<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) broke the law in approving agricultural weedkilling products sold by Bayer and two other chemical giants, ignoring clear evidence that the new herbicides would cause widespread damage to crops, a federal court ruled on Wednesday.</p> <p>The decision by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit invalidates the registrations for dicamba-based herbicides made by Monsanto, which is owned by Bayer AG,&nbsp;BASF and Corteva Agrisciences that are designed to be sprayed on genetically engineered soybeans and cotton. The court order effectively makes it illegal for farmers to continue to use the dicamba herbicides this summer as they tend to millions of acres of crops.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a stinging rebuke, the court said it had no choice but to cancel the EPA\u2019s approval of the herbicides because the agency had strayed so far from its duty to properly assess the dangers presented by the \u201cnew use\u201d of dicamba.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe EPA made multiple errors in granting the conditional registrations<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Court-decision-on-dicamba.pdf\">,\u201d the court said. </a>&nbsp;</p> <p>The petition seeking to overturn the EPA\u2019s approval was brought by the National Family Farm Coalition, Center for Food Safety, Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network North America.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a massive win for farmers and the environment,\u201d said George Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety, lead counsel in the case. \u201cIt is good to be reminded that corporations like Monsanto and the Trump administration cannot escape the rule of law, particularly at a time of crisis like this.

Previously, farmers used dicamba sparingly and were largely restricted from using dicamba during the growing season because the chemical can easily drift long distances, killing or injuring a wide array of crops and other plants it settles on.&nbsp;</p> <p>Monsanto, BASF and Corteva Agriscience told the EPA that their herbicides would have low volatility and if farmers followed instructions on the product labels, they could prevent drift. But since the introduction of the new dicamba crops and herbicides, farmer complaints have been filed with state agricultural officials, reporting dicamba damage across several million acres in at least a dozen states.</p> <p>The Guardian reported in March that Monsanto&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/monsanto-crop-system-damage-us-farms-documents\">predicted its dicamba crop system</a>&nbsp;would lead to thousands of damage claims from US farmers but pushed ahead anyway, and risks were downplayed to the EPA.</p> <p>The court found that the EPA \u201crefused to estimate the amount of dicamba damage\u201d, failed to acknowledge that restrictions it placed on the use of the dicamba herbicides would not be followed,&nbsp;and did not acknowledge evidence that the&nbsp;new use of dicamba herbicides would \u201ctear the social fabric of farming communities\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/monsanto-crop-system-damage-us-farms-documents\">Revealed: Monsanto predicted crop system would damage US farms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The court said it knew its decision could be costly for farmers who planned to use dicamba on their GMO soybeans and cotton fields, but said the EPA\u2019s failure to acknowledge and address risks to other crops left the court no choice.</p> <p>\u201cWe acknowledge the difficulties these growers may have in finding effective and legal herbicides to protect their (dicamba-tolerant) crops \u2026\u201d the ruling states. \u201cThey have been placed in this situation through no fault of their own.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Bayer,&nbsp;BASF and Corteva&nbsp;each&nbsp;issued statements saying their herbicides were important farmer tools that could be used safely and they disagreed with the court\u2019s decision.&nbsp;The&nbsp;companies said they were assessing options in response.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cIf the ruling stands, we will work quickly to minimize any impact on our customers this season,\u201d Bayer said.</p> <p>BASF called the court order \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said it \u201chas the potential to be devastating to tens of thousands of farmers\u201d.</p> <p>Farmers could lose \u201csignificant revenue\u201d if they are not able to kill weeds in their soybean and cotton fields with the dicamba herbicides, the company said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will use all legal remedies available to challenge this order,\u201d BASF said.</p>",

  "<p>It was Don DeLillo, the novelist, who in the wake of 9/11 said of America, \u201cthe culture absorbs almost everything\u201d.

For the last few months, Covid-19 has been ruthlessly exposing fictions in the American ideal. All of a sudden, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/28/unemployment-claims-coronavirus/\">40 million</a> jobless Americans have no healthcare and the lie about \u201cchoice\u201d in the \u201cinsurance marketplace\u201d appears ludicrous. As wealthy, white Americans fled Covid-19 hotspots for their second homes, and low-income workers \u2013 the majority from communities of colour \u2013 bore the brunt of the death rate, the lie that the only difference between rich and poor is hard work and enterprise started to ring a little hollow.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">death of George Floyd</a>, in this context, cannot be readily absorbed into existing myths. There is a lot of talk about this time being different, which always feels like the first step towards ensuring it isn\u2019t. But I have lived in the US for more than 10 years, and this feels like the first time that the killing of a black man by police has not been met with equivocation and evasion. </p> <p>Six years ago, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown was shot dead </a>by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, there was instant scepticism in the conservative press and elsewhere. What had Brown been doing to excite police interest in the first place? Are we sure the officer was at fault? There was no video, that time. But in the same year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">the killing of Eric Garner</a> by police officers in Staten Island was captured on video. There were large-scale protests in the wake of these killings \u2013 but the protests were accompanied by a lot of chatter, not just on the right, about the deaths being at the hands of bad apple police officers, rather than an expression of systemic racial injustice.</p> <p>That is not happening now. No one who isn\u2019t on the white nationalist fringe is suggesting Floyd brought this on himself. It feels, this time, as if a line has been crossed and not only because Floyd\u2019s death occurred during a time of stark exposure of American inequality. It\u2019s that it followed on, in short succession, from the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">Ahmaud Arb</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">ery</a>, a black man gunned down by white vigilantes while going for a run in Georgia, and from a superficially trivial encounter in Central Park, in which a black man who asked a white woman to put her dog on the leash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">watched as she called the cops</a> to say an African American man was \u201cthreatening\u201d her.

  "<p>Rubaiyat Hossain\u2019s latest film, Made in Bangladesh, opens with a scene of pure, visceral panic: young garment workers trapped in a burning factory.&nbsp;Alarms blare, women scream and smoke fills the stairwells.</p> <p>\u201cA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/bangladesh-factory-fires-fashion-latest-crisis\">fire</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/rana-plaza-collapse-murder-charges-garment-factory\">building collapse</a> is every garment worker\u2019s greatest fear,\u201d says Hossain.&nbsp;When filming the scene, the women seen desperately running for their lives didn\u2019t need much direction.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMost of the extras we used were former garment workers who had lost their jobs so they had lived out this moment in their imaginations themselves many times when they were at work; it was a risk they all knew came with the job. The emotion they were conveying was very raw and very real.\u201d</p> <p>The factory floor of a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is the background for Hossain\u2019s third feature film, currently being <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/made-bangladesh\">screened online </a>as part of the Human Rights film festival.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f3705adb07072e9566cf9ddb8d94cca1bed3e09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f3705adb07072e9566cf9ddb8d94cca1bed3e09/0_0_3544_5000/709.jpg\" alt=\"Director Rubaiyat Hossain, who based the film on interviews with hundreds of garment workers.\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Rubaiyat Hossain, who based the film on interviews with hundreds of garment workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images for BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It tells the story of Shimu Akhtar, played by Rikita Nandini Shimu, a young woman making clothes for western clothing companies whose indignation at the working conditions she is forced to endure leads her to try to unionise the factory.</p> <p>Akhtar\u2019s rage at the treatment of herself and her co-workers by a factory management that refuses to pay them, and the brands that make easy profits off their cheap labour, is the driving force of the film.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to show that if you grow up in a society where you are pushed and shoved around and told you are not enough, you are going to grow up very angry inside,\u201d Hossain says. \u201cAt some point that rage will come out but I wanted to show that it can be a driving force for change.\u201d</p> <p>Hossain is one of Bangladesh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3960381/\">few female film-maker </a>to have broken through to the international festival circuit. Made in Bangladesh, like her other work, focuses on the struggles and intimate relationships of Bangladeshi women pushing against the constraints of their domestic and public lives.&nbsp;Her first feature, Meherjaan, was banned in cinemas in Bangladesh for its critique of nationalism and anti-war narrative. Her second, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1220063257?playlistId=tt4163094&amp;ref_=tt_ov_vi\">Under Construction</a>, won international accolades for its depiction of the unravelling of a middle-class Bangladeshi marriage.</p> <p>When writing Made in Bangladesh, Hossain says she wanted to smash through the stereotype of the poor, exploited factory worker.&nbsp;\u201cI wanted to show that these women are active agents, fighting for their rights and demanding to be heard,\u201d she says.&nbsp;\u201cToo many people think of Bangladeshi women as victims sitting behind a sewing machine, but it is thanks to female garment workers that Bangladesh is now a middle-income country.&nbsp;And these young women are not victims, they are often feisty, young, spirited women who are fearless and brave. All that beauty and dignity had to be the starting point of this film.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Hossain based her film on the stories of hundreds of garment workers she interviewed over the three years she spent researching and writing the script.&nbsp;The character of Akhtar is based on the<a href=\"https://www.cphpix.com/news/meet-rubaiyat-hossain\"> life </a><a href=\"https://www.cphpix.com/news/meet-rubaiyat-hossain\">of Daliya Akhter</a>, one of the first women to start a garment workers\u2019 union in 2013.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uCtl_2nIyU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5uCtl_2nIyU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Made in Bangladesh trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDaliya\u2019s story spoke in so many ways to the struggles women still face, both here in Bangladesh and across the world, to be treated and respected as workers,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hossain says that anger has been a defining element of her own life. \u201cI always remember that about being small, the feeling that being a girl wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom a young age me and my sister were always being asked when we would get a brother and become a proper family and the anger I felt at that only became clear when I started making films.\u201d</p> <p>Hossain used an almost entirely female crew when shooting Made in Bangladesh, including as many of her countrywomen as possible.&nbsp;\u2018There are few opportunities for women to make films, there are no fully equipped film schools, in meetings I\u2019m always the only woman in the room,\u201d she says.&nbsp;\u201cBut this is changing. For this movie I couldn\u2019t find a Bangladeshi woman director of photography but one day I will.\u201d</p> <p>Hossain\u2019s depiction of life as a Bangladeshi garment worker is also damning of the relentless downwards pressure exerted by the global fashion industry on the workers at the bottom of their supply chains.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot of effort made by fashion brands to distance themselves from the women who make their clothes,\u201d says Hossain. In one scene the women calculate that they make more than 1,600 T-shirts a day, yet two or three will be sold for more money than they make in a month.&nbsp;</p> <p>She is aghast at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/02/fashion-brands-cancellations-of-24bn-orders-catastrophic-for-bangladesh\">devastation wreaked on the garment industries </a>not just in Bangladesh but in other countries across the global south by the Covid-19 virus. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen brands cancel over $3bn of orders in just Bangladesh,\u201d she says.&nbsp;\u201cFactories are closing and people are losing their jobs.&nbsp;They can\u2019t get paid if the brands don\u2019t pay.&nbsp;If they go into work they are not safe from the virus.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/11/bangladesh-garment-factories-reopen-despite-coronavirus-threat-to-workers\">Bangladesh garment factories reopen despite coronavirus threat to workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As workers across the garment sector warn that the virus is providing cover for union busting, she says this must be a turning point.</p> <p>\u201cPeople always say after they\u2019ve seen my film, I\u2019ll never buy clothes from Bangladesh, but this isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe answer is that the women are respected and bad conditions not tolerated.&nbsp;Only a tiny percentage of Bangladeshi factories are unionised.&nbsp;These jobs have the potential to redefine life for young women in Bangladesh and the struggle of garment workers to be able to collectively work towards realising their rights must be supported by everyone who wears the clothes they make.\u201d</p> <p><em>Made in Bangladesh can be seen online until 5 June 2020 as part of the <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-made-in-bangladesh-online\">Human Rights Watch Film Festival</a></em></p>",

Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted.

The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Germany showed the rest of Europe what was needed to limit the spread of the virus: a decentralised testing programme; a manufacturing sector capable of producing medical equipment quickly; and a political system that prizes results over grandstanding. Now it is showing other countries how to do the recovery.</p> \n<p>It is not just a question of money, important though that is. The package is a well-crafted mixture of a short-term spending boost, targeted support for those parts of the economy that need it and measures that will help lay the foundations for long-term sustainable growth.</p> \n<p>There is a time limited cut in VAT lasting from July until the end of the year, which should persuade German consumers to spend some of the euros they have accumulated during lockdown. There is recognition of the pressure on families, with a payment of \u20ac300 per child, extra incentives to buy electric cars, and grants worth \u20ac25bn for small businesses in those sectors, such as hospitality, that will take longest to recover from lockdown restrictions.</p> \n<p>All that will ensure Germany will be one of the first countries to get output back to its pre-crisis levels. Yet, the package also included \u20ac50bn for investment programmes, with a focus on making the transition to a greener economy.</p> \n<p>All this is a bit of a contrast to the UK experience. So far, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak </a>has administered large amounts of expensive sticking plaster to the economy but not much more. As he contemplates options for a summer mini-budget, the chancellor could do worse than to study what the Germans have come up with. A lot worse, in fact.</p> \n<h2>Business as usual when it comes to corporate behaviour</h2> \n<p>After a little bit of pressure, the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England </a>has revealed the names of the big companies that have been taking advantage of its coronavirus corporate lending scheme and how much they are in for. An interesting list it is, too.</p> \n<p>For those a little confused by the blizzard of government schemes designed to keep business going through the pandemic crisis, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid </a>corporate financing facility (CCFF) allows a company to sell its short-term bonds to Threadneedle Street in exchange for cash.</p> \n<p>Few would quibble with the basic principle behind the CCFF. The government stopped planes from flying, football clubs from playing and shops from opening so it was obliged to give the likes of British Airways, Tottenham Hotspur FC and John Lewis a helping hand. The alternative was to turn Britain into a tumbleweed economy.</p> \n<p>So far, the Bank has lent \u00a316bn to more than 50 businesses. To qualify, a company need not be UK-owned. It merely has to have sizeable revenues in this country and be a sizeable employer. That explains why the German chemicals company BASF came to be the biggest borrower from the Bank under the scheme, with \u00a31bn outstanding, and that Nissan has borrowed \u00a3600m.</p> \n<p>Clearly, it would be foolish to deny a company help because it is foreign-owned, since all the evidence is that German, French, Japanese and US run companies are more productive than indigenous businesses.</p> \n<p>A much more serious criticism is that the money has been provided with no strings attached. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/ba-to-press-ahead-with-job-cuts-plans-despite-furlough-extension-willie-walsh-coronavirus-airline\">BA has announced 12,000 job losses</a> despite securing \u00a3300m from the scheme. EasyJet tapped the CCFF for \u00a3600m but said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/easyjet-plans-to-cut-up-to-30-per-cent-of-staff-because-of-covid-19-crisis\">it will axe 4,500 jobs</a> \u2013 30% of its workforce.

The audience erupts with laughter at the punchline, satiated by the clear ridiculousness of Britons marching for a problem that doesn\u2019t concern them.</p> \n<p>British solidarity with American victims of racial violence didn\u2019t seem so funny when thousands of protesters recently gathered in Hyde Park in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the crowd was much larger than expected \u2013 and much, much larger than in 2016. The visceral horror of George Floyd\u2019s slow public execution under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has cut through the global consciousness in a way not seen since the police attack on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZV1w5uLcE\">Rodney King</a> in 1991.

The idea that the issues BLM are protesting about are specific only to the US is farcical, as though race or policing are not global phenomena by their very nature; as though we don\u2019t see similar dynamics in Brazil, or Australia, or even Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there are certain force multipliers in the US that increase the scale of its problems; we do not have prisons the size of small towns or police officers walking around with AR-15s in Britain.

The officers had taken to abusing Oluwale whenever he was spotted, and famously wrote \u201cWog\u201d by his nationality on his arrest sheet. When Oluwale died after being in their custody, they faced charges of manslaughter. During the trial these charges were dropped to assault. The police officers were convicted and sentenced to just three years in prison. Half a century later, there has not been a single successful prosecution for anyone who died in police custody since.</p> \n<p>Though the numbers of deaths following police contact are thankfully not as bad in the UK as in the US, we should be anything but complacent when it comes to our own structural problems with racism or policing.

Trump wants to get back to business as usual in the physical world while Biden and his staff are navigating a new world mostly online.</p> <p>Even as America cautiously reopens from its most quarantined pandemic days, Trump has traveled across the country and been plotting campaign events and an upcoming in-person fundraiser.</p> <p>Biden has been far more cautious, continuing to host online fundraisers while his team have said they are listening to health experts on how quickly to revert back to pre-coronavirus campaigning.</p> <p>When he has delivered speeches or made public appearances, Trump has refused to wear a mask. Biden has made a point of appearing masked in public, a deliberate contrast to Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Biden\u2019s interest that the campaign is a referendum on the president and not a choice,\u201d said Republican David Kochel, who was a top adviser for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cSo if I was Team Biden I would probably be doing the same thing, which is being as low-key as possible, sending a more calm and reassuring message.

Both have delivered remarks addressing those protests. But where Biden\u2019s public appearances and comments have largely been about calling for reform, Trump has pushed a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda \u2013 although he has publicly acknowledged Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Biden is reportedly expected to attend Floyd\u2019s funeral next week. On Friday Trump is slated to travel to Maine to tour where he will tour a nasal swab facility.</p> <p>The differing approaches extend to fundraisers as well. According to a list obtained by the Guardian, all of Biden\u2019s upcoming fundraising events are virtual. By contrast, Trump and his team are plotting in-person fundraisers, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/29/trump-schedules-in-person-fundraisers-as-shackles-come-off-289798\">Politico</a>.</p> <p>Ignoring the pandemic is also handy for a president whose response to a disaster that has killed 100,000 Americans and seen 40 million people lose their jobs has been widely slammed as chaotic and ineffective. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s caution emphasizes the reality that the coronavirus remains an ongoing challenge for the government.</p> <p>\u201cProtesting aside, it\u2019s a tricky time because as we\u2019re seeing, yes some states are starting to open back up but, as we\u2019re seeing, the number of cases is going back up in those places. Just from a campaign perspective, trying to assess what you can do without putting people in danger [is important],\u201d said the Democratic strategist Karen Finney, who served as a senior communications adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>Finney added that she doubted voters would rally around Trump\u2019s approach to campaigning like the pandemic never happened. Americans are having to accept that this entire election cycle will be unlike other ones, Finney said.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is also part of us accepting that it\u2019s all going to be very different, voting is going to be different,\u201d Finney added. \u201cWe may have to settle in and be prepared that we may not have a set answer on election night. It may be a two- or three-day process.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump team and the president himself have wanted to turn Biden\u2019s social distancing and virtual campaigning into a liability. Trump has dinged his likely rival as dotty and out of touch. Trump allies hope that if the president is confidently crisscrossing the country without a mask, doing campaign events, that will also offer a stark contrast with Biden. They hope he will appear weak to voters.</p> <p>Finney, though, said the reason Trump has been attacking Biden on the Democrat\u2019s caution is because so far it has helped Biden develop a healthy lead in the polls.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason Trump is attacking [Biden] is because the basement strategy has been very successful and effective,\u201d Finney said. Biden, Finney said, has been able to create virtual events that have been effective. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to deliver a clear, consistent message that actually is resonating with what people hear in this time of crisis and speaking to our fears and our concerns but also trying to put forward a positive message.\u201d</p>",

He died in the same metro area as Philando Castile. He uttered the same final pleas as Eric Garner.&nbsp;</p> <p>The nationwide unrest that follows Floyd\u2019s death is undoubtedly more intense than in 2014; the leadership from the White House immeasurably more reckless, insensitive and life threatening.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet, here the country is again.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s response was a marked departure from the Obama administration\u2019s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Violence against black men and women at the hands of white authority is foundational to the United States, and continues to influence its policing culture to this day.</p> <p>Precursors to modern-day American police departments include violent <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0021934717702134\">slave patrols utilized in </a><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0021934717702134\">southern states</a> before the civil war, then the legal enforcement of racist Black Codes, followed by Jim Crow laws.

  "<p>When the next pandemic hits \u2013 and it\u2019s a question of when, not if \u2013 it will be vital that we did all we could at this moment to learn the lessons taught to us by coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> <p>One key lesson has been the effectiveness of travel bans. Countries that managed to contain the virus effectively implemented immediate health screenings of new arrivals, 14-day quarantines for those entering the country and even full travel bans. Of the world\u2019s population, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/01/more-than-nine-in-ten-people-worldwide-live-in-countries-with-travel-restrictions-amid-covid-19/\">91%</a> live in countries with current travel restrictions, and 39% of people live in countries whose borders are completely closed to non-citizens and non-residents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Travel bans were seen as only delaying the inevitable spread and thus not worth the disruption and economic cost</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In mid-March Australia noted that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-51969498\">80% of cases</a> being detected were linked to returning travellers. The government quickly introduced a border-closure policy in which only nationals were let into the country, who then needed to spend two weeks in mandatory quarantine in a hotel room.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/borders-to-stay-closed-travellers-urged-to-see-australia-first-once-curbs-ease-20200410-p54iw4.html\">Despite the cost to the economy</a>, roughly $4bn per month from international travellers and $5bn from domestic travellers, who are restricted from crossing state borders, the government felt it was imperative to get a handle on the number of new cases. This policy has paid off with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">complete crunching of the coronavirus curve</a>: Australia has had <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/australia/\">102 deaths</a>, and has only a handful of daily new cases. Life is slowly returning back to normal, with thethreat of coronavirus pushed beyond its borders. A similar story can be told about New Zealand, Greece, Iceland and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/vetinary-scientist-hailed-faroe-islands-lack-covid-19-deaths\">Faroe Islands</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The UK is implementing its own restrictions, but what took us so long? To understand this delay requires a delve into the minutes of Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) that the government points to as evidence of it \u201cfollowing the science\u201d.&nbsp;On <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888770/S0371_Third_SAGE_meeting_on_Wuhan_Coronavirus__WN-CoV__.pdf\">3 February</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888787/S0386_Eighteenth_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19_.pdf\">23 March</a>&nbsp;travel restrictions were discussed by Sage but were seen to have a negligible effect. Modelling noted that \u201cif the UK reduces imported infections by 50%, this would maybe delay the onset of any epidemic in the UK by about 5 days; 75% would maybe buy 10 additional days; 90% maybe buys 15 additional days; 95% maybe buys a month.\u201d </p> <p>This fits with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/06/01/1591001732000/Making-sense-of-nonsensical-Covid-19-strategy/\">Sage\u2019s initial advice</a> from January to March to develop a strategy based on the 2011 Pandemic Flu Plan. It recommended that coronavirus be treated like the flu and <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888783/S0383_Fifteenth_SAGE_meeting_on_Wuhan_Coronavirus__Covid-19__.pdf\">allowed to spread</a>, while keeping the number of cases within the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sage-minutes-coronavirus-covid-19-response-16-march-2020\"> NHS\u2019s capacity</a> and protecting <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888783/S0383_Fifteenth_SAGE_meeting_on_Wuhan_Coronavirus__Covid-19__.pdf\">the elderly and vulnerable</a>. </p> <p>Therefore travel bans were seen as only delaying the inevitable spread of the virus within the UK, and thus not worth the associated disruption and economic cost.</p> <p>When the UK went into lockdown on 23&nbsp;March, people living within the country were instructed to stay home and not travel farther than a few miles from their homes and only for essential journeys. At the same time, passengers from countries such as Italy, Spain, the US, Brazil and Russia could arrive at Heathrow and take the tube straight into London with no checks, screening or monitoring. It is ironic that the government that ran on \u201ctaking back control of our borders\u201d was so reluctant to implement border controls when they were actually needed to protect its citizens and residents.</p> <p>The current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/priti-patel-urged-to-publish-scientific-advice-behind-uk-quarantine-move\">UK plan</a> to quarantine all arrivals (except a small group of essential workers) for 14 days feels three months too late and too blunt an instrument. To stop the outbreak and limit the number of people exposed to the virus, the UK government should have moved quickly in late February/early March to implement border closure while moving to an early lockdown. This would have limited the number of imported cases, provided time&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/lockdown-buys-time-virus-mass-testing-coronavirus-uk\">to aggressively go after the virus through testing and tracing</a>&nbsp;anddrive down numbers to the dozens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/critics-round-on-no-10-over-ridiculous-rules-for-14-day-quarantine-coronavirus\">Critics round on No 10 over 'ridiculous' rules for 14-day quarantine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the new plans, arriving passengers and crew must self-isolate at their homes or a specified location. They are only permitted to leave the house to buy food or medicine, attend funerals and court hearings, and to access public services. This will be monitored by unannounced visits and a breach would result in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52907229\">\u00a31,000 penalty</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the overall idea to monitor importation of new cases is indeed a valid one that has been endorsed by the World Health Organization as countries exit lockdown, the implementation is problematic. It would make more sense if quarantine was mandated only for those arriving from countries with much higher rates of infection, and notthose that have a marginal number such as Greece, Australia, Norway, South Korea, Taiwan or Denmark. In addition, we should follow the example of countries such as Greece, Singapore, Hong Kong and Austria and test for Covid-19 on arrival.</p> <p>At this stage, minimising the number of imported cases should be a priority. But what should we do when the next pandemic hits? The key learning must be the need to halt the export of the virus at the early stage of the outbreak. In January 2020,&nbsp;China could have closed&nbsp;its borders once it became clear that coronavirus was spiralling out of control. The country clearly had sufficient resources, personal protective equipment, hospitals and health staff to manage the outbreak without external assistance. Instead, it delayed closing borders and as a result, coronavirus has infected more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105\">6 million people across 188 countries</a>. In a highly globalised economy closing borders may seem unpalatable, but perhaps we have now learned our lessons the hard way.</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to New York, rather than the US, in a list of countries that passengers could arrive from.

  "<p>Just under a fortnight ago, council leaders across England received an email containing three attachments.

Dido Harding, the former chief executive of the phone company TalkTalk, had been appointed to lead the test-and-trace effort. The outsourcing giant Serco and call-centre multinational Sitel were recruiting and training tens of thousands of people who would contact people by phone, while the smartphone app intended to be at the new system\u2019s core was being trialled in the Isle of Wight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c838201bbf856e019515e42d4d759ad41f0c20a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c838201bbf856e019515e42d4d759ad41f0c20a/0_362_7470_4485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dido Harding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dido Harding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given that new local outbreaks of the coronavirus would inevitably demand the attention of people on the ground, there had been rising frustration about the apparent lack of a role for councils in the government\u2019s approach. Now, though, there was to be a \u201ccentral\u201d role for local authorities in \u201csupporting the new test-and-trace service across England\u201d, and an extra \u00a3300m from Whitehall to fund their new responsibilities.</p> <p>The following week, Matt Hancock said future flare-ups would be met with \u201clocal lockdowns\u201d, an announcement that came on the same day that the health secretary also heralded the early launch of the national test-and-trace system.</p> <p>But many of the local politicians and officials who will apparently play a key role in making everything work say hugely important questions remain unanswered. Nick Forbes, the Labour leader of Newcastle city council, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this system looks like, we don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to cost, we don\u2019t know what money we\u2019re getting. The government is way behind the curve here. We\u2019ve only started to scratch the surface of what it all means.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I will accept the responsibility if they give me the powers\u2019</h2> <p>The new testing and tracing regime is branded with the logo of the NHS. It involves the government agency Public Health England, and official material on testing and tracing and local outbreaks identifies seven organisations and agencies that will also be involved, ranging from health protection boards and local strategic coordinating groups to outbreak engagement boards and local resilience forums. From the perspective of many people working at the grassroots, this is part of the problem. \u201cEverything feels so fragmented,\u201d one local government insider told me this week. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re trying to stick it all back together again.\u201d</p> <p>The basics of what testing, tracing and isolating entails are clear enough. If someone develops possible symptoms of the virus, they must self-isolate for at least seven days and register for a test. If that test comes back positive, leaving aside the possible operations of an app that will be introduced nationally \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, they will then have to share detailed information with the authorities.</p> <p>This will include details of the people they live with, anyone they have been within 2 metres of for 15 minutes or longer, and places they have recently visited. In turn, people who have been close to anyone infected \u201cwill be told to begin self-isolation for 14 days from your last contact with the person who has tested positive\u201d.</p> <p>Linked to these complicated arrangements are proposals for what the government calls \u201clocal outbreak control plans\u201d, so far focused on care homes, schools&nbsp;and places such as sheltered housing developments, and what&nbsp;official documents term \u201cdormitories for migrant workers\u201d. This is one of the areas where local authorities will seemingly be crucial, along with \u201csupporting vulnerable people to get help to self-isolate\u201d.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care is initially working \u201cintensively\u201d with 11 \u201cbeacon\u201d areas of England \u2013 including Leeds, Newcastle and Leicestershire \u2013 and has told local politicians and officials across England that they \u201cneed to develop local outbreak plans in June\u201d.</p> <p>Things seem to be moving. But inescapable truths hang over everything, not least that the lockdown has been loosened before many of the important elements of the testing, tracing and isolating system are in place.</p> <p>People in local government say they were encouraged by the appointment of Tom Riordan, the chief executive of Leeds city council, to a senior role in the testing and tracing system in mid-May. Nonetheless, big questions remain. Forbes says that as well as his uncertainties about local lockdowns (\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the power to close down a school at the moment, let alone lock down an area of a city\u201d), he has other worries.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a government which has tried to create a hostile environment. There\u2019s huge fear in many BAME communities that their data will be passed on. And if communities don\u2019t have the confidence to engage with the testing and tracing work, then it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2513abd17a158b73c27e809edabf4d4909d3ea97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2513abd17a158b73c27e809edabf4d4909d3ea97/0_136_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle council.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the River Tyne, Alice Wiseman is working flat-out in the borough of Gateshead, a coronavirus hotspot. She is a director of public health, and therefore charged by the government with defining how local authorities will \u201cidentify and contain outbreaks and protect the public\u2019s health\u201d. She too is still waiting for clarity on an array of issues.</p> <p>For weeks, Gateshead has run its own testing programme from labs in a local hospital. At the same time, a nationally run testing facility administered by the outsourcing firm Deloitte has been in operation \u2013 first from the car park of Gateshead\u2019s shuttered branch of Ikea, and then across the river in Newcastle. It has since been joined by a walk-in national testing centre three miles from the city centre.</p> <p>Wiseman says it has taken her eight weeks to access data from the nationally run testing system, and that even then the information is not detailed enough to be of much use. As of this week she can access information about Covid-19 infections across the whole of the north-east of England broken down by gender, age and some information about such \u201csettings\u201d as schools, hospitals and prisons. But she says she still has far too little information about cases in Gateshead from the national testing system, other than crude figures showing the number of people who have tested positive.</p> <p>She also says the testing results concerned are not available in anything like real time, which risks the virus spreading. Indeed, though the Department of Health insists that \u201capproximately 90% of people now receive a result within 48 hours of their test\u201d, she says she is still having conversations about results taking more than 72 hours to arrive with individuals, before they are then collated into official data. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a picture of the issues in our local area since the start, and we don\u2019t have one now.\u201d</p> <p>In Leicestershire, the Conservative leader of the county council is also awaiting answers. Nick Rushton says that when he has talked with ministers, a term he has heard is \u201clocal political accountability\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019ve got local accountability, I want local responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, for example, if I had an outbreak in a factory where there\u2019s a lot of people, I don\u2019t want to say: \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve got an outbreak and we need to shut the factory and isolate all those people,\u2019 and then have to phone up the secretary of state and ask them if I can do it. If they want me to do it, I will accept that responsibility if they give me those powers locally.\u201d</p> <p>In response to this point, the Department of Health said it \u201cwill shortly be issuing guidance on how local and national government can work to ensure local outbreaks can be contained\u201d.</p> <p>Rushton says Dorries \u201cseems very keen to help us, on a Zoom call. But we need to see the colour of her money. Because we don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to get to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Though the government has provided an extra \u00a33.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funding for councils, and the Department of Health insists they have the resources they need to \u201ctackle the immediate pressures they have told us they are facing\u201d, Rushton\u2019s authority has so far spent twice as much on the effects of Covid-19 as it has been given by ministers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning. Hopefully they\u2019ll realise just how dire the situation will be next year. What you\u2019ll have to do is cut services, it\u2019s as simple as that. If you don\u2019t have the money \u2026 you just have to stop doing things.\u201d</p> <p>Rushton says Leicestershire has enough reserves to cope with any financial crisis, but scores of councils do not. And if the government insists that they take on all these new responsibilities but does not adequately fund them, the combination could tip many places into bankruptcy.</p> <p>In Leeds, the city council leader, Judith Blake, says the financial gap left by the virus on her finances will be around \u00a3160m. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very serious indeed,\u201d she says. She also expresses scepticism about whether she and her colleagues will be able to respond to crisis as they would like. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that the government is going to be giving us the powers we need any time soon. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s in their DNA. It\u2019s a cultural issue.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The government doesn\u2019t seem to want to let go\u2019</h2> <p>A source within the new national testing and tracing system says the involvement of councils came \u201ctoo late, without a doubt\u201d, but that over the last few weeks the government\u2019s turn towards local authorities has made a \u201cpalpable difference\u201d.</p> <p>They speak with guarded optimism, but also say there is an ongoing tension between what ministers say in public and how people working locally have to put plans into practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cEvery night you hear from a secretary of state or the chancellor or the prime minister, and they want an announcement to make. So they almost manufacture things. If they consulted with people, they would still end up doing things, but at least there\u2019d be buy-in, and warnings to people on the ground,\u201d the source says.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Daily Telegraph reported that \u201ca shake-up in Downing Street will see the government\u2019s entire approach to the pandemic run by two centrally run committees\u201d. This was not the kind of news that people trying to get cities, counties and boroughs through this crisis wanted to hear.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019ve only recently been seen as a resource to help the country get through this crisis,\u201d says Forbes. \u201cAnd even now, the chains of centralisation are still being rattled. The government doesn\u2019t seem to want to fully let go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Asked about these issues, the Department Of Health provided a statement. \u201cWe have now&nbsp;launched NHS Test and Trace which will help stop the spread of the virus and save lives \u2026 Eleven cross-party beacon councils have formed an advisory group to establish methods of best practice and to assist with the development and introduction of local outbreak plans which will be in place by the end of June,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, local infection outbreak plans will be utilised where necessary. We\u2019ve made \u00a3300m available to local authorities, and are giving them support with Public Health England to fight infections in care homes and help tackle wider outbreaks in businesses and the community.\u201d</p> <p>Forbes says:&nbsp;\u201cThe virus is still real. We\u2019re not on top of it. We don\u2019t yet have the systems in place to know where it is. Nor do we have the mechanisms to deal with an outbreak, yet. But we\u2019ll move heaven and earth to try and do as much as we can.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Iran is reluctantly confronting the possibility of a renewed political crisis as well as a health one after the latest figures showed the number of new coronavirus infections at a record high.</p> <p>The government appeared to have brought the virus under control a month ago, but a second wave of the virus has steadily been gathering pace. According to data released by the health ministry on Thursday there were 3,574 confirmed new infections in 24 hours \u2013 an increase of 440 on the previous day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/iran_second_wave/giv-39020d7LW53uJ9Zf/\" data-alt=\"Graphic: Daily cases in Iran\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/iran_second_wave/giv-39020d7LW53uJ9Zf/\">Graphic: Daily cases in Iran</a> </figure>  <p>The previous daily record in Iran was 3,186 on 30 March. The country was one of the first in the Middle East to be gripped by the disease.</p> <p>In spite of a steadily rising infection rate, authorities have been progressively lifting controls on shops, mosques, schools, offices and travel. The border with Turkey was also being opened for haulage traffic on Thursday.</p> <p>In recent days government spokesmen have been increasingly critical of the public, accusing them of ignoring the continued restrictions, especially in workplaces.</p> <p>Hassan Rouhani, the country\u2019s president, said: \u201cIf the rules are not obeyed the government would be forced to restore the quarantine situation again, disrupting normal life and inflicting serious damage on the entire national economy.\u201d</p> <p>There was little immediate domestic coverage of the record infection figure.</p> <p>The chief solace for the health ministry was that the number of daily deaths has not risen at the same rate as new infections, giving some credence to the argument that the increased level of infections is partly a result of more widespread testing and better recording. The number of deaths recorded in the previous 24 hours was 59, taking the death toll to 8,071. The highest number of daily deaths was 158 on 4 April.</p> <p>Officials now face a dilemma over whether to reimpose controls, a move that will be unpopular and damage the sanction-weakened economy, or hope that the second wave will somehow peter out. Only 10 days ago the number of new infections was below 2,000, and the rapid rise in the last five days cannot be explained solely by widespread testing.</p> <p>The virus was reported as being worst in the provinces of Khuzestan, Hormozgan, Kurdistan and Kermanshah. All people in those regions were advised to wear face masks in public.</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence from Hormozgan&nbsp;suggested women were contracting the disease while shopping.&nbsp;Nearly 25% of those with the disease were classified as \u201chousewives\u201d.</p> <p>In a sign of the competing pressures facing the government, the Iranian parliament research centre produced figures to show per capita income in the country had fallen by 34% over the last three years, partly because of inflation. Nearly 60% of employees were not covered by social insurance.</p> <p>In other coronavirus developments around the world:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Spain</strong>&nbsp;wants to welcome back British tourists from 1 July, but said that would depend on the&nbsp;UK\u2019s 14-day quarantine&nbsp;plan for arrivals, including returning UK citizens, and on the British authorities rescinding&nbsp;advice on non-essential foreign travel.</p></li> <li><p><strong>France</strong> said it would cancel its traditional 14 July Bastille Day military parade and replace it with a ceremony to pay tribute to care workers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia</strong>\u2019s relatively low official death toll was further brought into question after St Petersburg issued 32% more death certificates in May than in the same month last year.</p></li> <li><p>The number of confirmed cases in <strong>Afghanistan </strong>passed 18,000, with more than 300 deaths,&nbsp;amid a continued surge of transmissions in Kabul.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Pakistan</strong>&nbsp;reported a record single-day high in coronavirus deaths (82) and new cases (4,688), saying it was due to increased testing.</p></li> <li><p>The World Health Organization\u2019s director for&nbsp;<strong>Africa</strong>&nbsp;said the continent\u2019s 162,622 confirmed coronavirus cases and 4,604 deaths was \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, but the African Union&nbsp;health agency said the continent needs to triple its testing.</p></li> <li><p>A further 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the <strong>US</strong> last week, bringing the total number of claims to more than 42m since the pandemic hit.</p></li> <li><p>In <strong>Japan, </strong>Tokyo\u2019s<strong> </strong>governor said it may be necessary to stage a \u201csimplified\u201d Olympics next year owing to the impact of the pandemic.</p></li> <li><p><strong>China </strong>said foreign airlines blocked from operating in the country could resume limited flights, a day after Washington suspended all Chinese travel into and out of the US.&nbsp;</p></li> <li><p>In&nbsp;Latin America, <strong>Mexico</strong> announced more than 1,000 deaths in a day for the first time and <strong>Brazil</strong>, the region\u2019s worst-hit country, reported a record 1,349.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Public Health England was unable to make any recommendations in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">report on BAME people and coronavirus</a> because some of the data needed to do so was not available, a minister has said.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, told the Commons she wanted any action the government takes to be driven by evidence, and it was not \u201ceasy to go directly from analysis to making recommendations\u201d.</p> <p>The government-commissioned investigation found that&nbsp;people of Bangladeshi background in England are twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contract Covid-19, and other BAME groups face an increased risk of up to 50%.</p> <p>The report, published on Tuesday, was quickly criticised for failing to&nbsp;investigate possible reasons&nbsp;for the disparities or make recommendations on how to address them.</p> <p>Responding to a Commons&nbsp;urgent question&nbsp;on the matter, Badenoch said that while it was important that the government understands the key drivers of these disparities, it was also vital that \u201cwe\u2019re not taking action which is not warranted by the evidence\u201d.</p> <p>Gill Furniss, the shadow women and equalities minister, was one of several politicians to criticise the report for failing to make any recommendations. She asked Badenoch whether she agreed that \u201cit is now time to address underlying socioeconomic inequalities facing BAME communities\u201d and confirm that the government would take action to do so.</p> <p>Last month Labour urged all employers to risk-assess their workers to give them appropriate work or protection given the higher Covid death rates among black and other minority ethnic groups.</p> <p>Furniss asked whether the government would be backing that call. \u201cCoronavirus thrives on inequality and there is no more important time to tackle racial injustices in our society to save lives during this crisis. It is now up to the government to take action and show its commitment that black lives matter,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Badenoch replied: \u201cThe PHE did not make recommendations and that\u2019s because they were not able to do so. Some of the data needed is not routinely collected and acquiring this data will be extremely beneficial, and as I said in my response that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to be taking the work forward to fill the gaps in our understanding and review existing policies, develop new ones when needed, off the back of this.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThis is a review conducted in a short period of time which sets up firm conclusions. As the author of the report said on Tuesday night, there is a great deal of background and detailed information we think will be helpful. It is not easy to go directly from analysis to making recommendations and we need to get the report widely disseminated and discussed before deciding what needs to be done.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> near parliament. Badenoch said: \u201cAs a black woman and the equalities minister, it would be odd if I did not comment on the events in the US and protests in London yesterday. Like all right-minded people, regardless of their race, I was profoundly disturbed by the brutal murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police.\u201d</p> <p>She told the Commons that \u201cduring these moments of heightened racial tension, we must not pander to anyone who seeks to inflame those tensions. Instead we must work together to improve the lives of people from BME communities.\u201d</p> <p>Badenoch\u2019s statement came as a group&nbsp;of 15 race equality organisations , the Coalition of Racial Equality (Core) has written to the health secretary,&nbsp;Matt Hancock,&nbsp;expressing its dismay at the report\u2019s lack of recommendations about how to tackle disparities.&nbsp;</p> <p>It says any recommendations from the&nbsp;promised second&nbsp;phase report being led by the junior equalities minister \u201cwill almost certainly be too late and could amount to the government kicking the issue into the long grass\u201d.</p> <p>Core&nbsp;has put forward its own recommendations,&nbsp;including ensuring all key&nbsp;workers have access to personal&nbsp;protective&nbsp;equipment, scrapping the no&nbsp;recourse to&nbsp;public&nbsp;funds condition imposed on migrants with limited leave, or those without leave to remain,&nbsp;and abolishing data sharing between the NHS and Home Office.</p> <p>Separately, Black Lives Matter UK has called for people to take part in a doorstep protest at the disproportionate death of BAME&nbsp;people from Covid-19 by playing Jimmy Cliff\u2019s The Harder They Come at 7pm on Thursday.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p>",

So he was intrigued by the study, which was published on 14 April in a version known as \u201cpreprint\u201d, which means it was made available online before it had been peer-reviewed or accepted by a medical journal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0057139de25a7e87f75868f2a1333f3024700a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0057139de25a7e87f75868f2a1333f3024700a5/0_452_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Carlos Chaccour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Carlos Chaccour says doctors latched on to the ivermectin study because they were desperate for something to treat Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ISGlobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI saw the researchers had looked at this huge database \u2026 they included 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America and 1,900 Covid-19 patients seen by hospitals in those countries by 1 March,\u201d Chaccour says.</p> <p>The study methodology said its data had been obtained from Surgisphere. The Surgisphere website says it owns a data analytics system called QuartzClinical which monitors global healthcare in real time through data collection from 1,200 international hospitals. Promotional material says the database \u201chas led to advances in care for kidney failure, aneurysms, lymphedema, peripheral artery disease, colon cancer, and cardiovascular disease\u201d.</p> <p>The database sounded incredible.</p> <p>But as Chaccour and other researchers began to look more closely, they quickly found some concerning anomalies. Over the next weeks those doubts would only increase. Surgisphere itself came under greater scrutiny, culminating in two of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals reconsidering studies based on its data, an about-turn from the World Health Organization on research into a potential Covid-19 treatment, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">Guardian investigation that uncovered worrying inconsistencies in the Surgisphere story</a>.</p> <h2>\u2018It was so weird\u2019</h2> <p>Chaccour\u2019s first surprise was that the study had found 52 Covid-19 patients who had received ivermectin. At the time, ivermectin was not being widely discussed as a potential Covid-19 treatment. Yet the study said patients around the world had already been receiving it.</p> <p>The study also included data from three patients in Africa who, as of 1 March, were on mechanical ventilation and receiving ivermectin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">Governments and WHO changed Covid-19 policy based on suspect data from tiny US company</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut there were two patients in the entire continent alone at that time, let alone people on ventilators,\u201d Chaccour says.</p> <p>Chaccour, who has worked throughout Africa and knows African healthcare systems well, believes many hospitals there are not equipped with the electronic health systems required to be a part of such a database.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re supposed to be connected to a fancy automatic thing that gives all this data to a corporation in the US?

The world had gone crazy</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Carlos Chaccour</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 2 May, two weeks after the study appeared online, a doctor in Peru wrote a white paper for the government about the use of ivermectin to treat Covid-19, heavily citing the preprint Surgisphere study as evidence. Peru&nbsp;reported its first&nbsp;Covid-19&nbsp;case on 6 March, but by the beginning of May it was in a state of emergency, having recorded 42,000 cases and about 1,200 deaths. Less than a week after the white paper was published, the Peruvian government included ivermectin in its national Covid-19 therapeutic guidelines. Projects involving ivermectin around the world received thousands of dollars in grants.</p> <p>Chaccour was concerned. He knew ivermectin well and was shocked at how quickly it was being adopted as part of treatment protocols without rigorous research to back up its use. He believes more studies should be done first, as<a href=\"http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0271\"> he wrote in an editorial in which he was lead author</a>, published on 16 April. He sent the lead researcher on the preprint paper an email with some questions and concerns about the data, which were forwarded to a co-author of the paper, the Surgisphere founder and chief executive, Dr Sapan Desai.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c6f85a0ccacf8831d5ec6e848e659940aaea9cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c6f85a0ccacf8831d5ec6e848e659940aaea9cf/79_0_2697_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sapan Desai of Surgisphere\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sapan Desai of Surgisphere talking on his Vimeo page.

The renowned Harvard University vascular surgeon Dr Mandeep Mehra was the lead author, Desai the second author. The study also based its results on the Surgisphere QuartzClinical database, including data from Covid-19 patients from 169 hospitals in 11 countries in Asia, Europe and North America. It found common drugs given for heart disease were not associated with a higher risk of death in Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>Chaccour thought this might explain his concerns about the ivermectin study. \u201cI thought, [maybe the ivermectin study] was just a side project while they were busy working on this big New England Journal of Medicine study. I didn\u2019t look closely at the study, because cardiovascular disease is not my area.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, another drug, an anti-malarial called hydroxychloroquine, a derivative of&nbsp;chloroquine<em><strong>, </strong></em>was gaining traction as a potential Covid-19 treatment<strong> </strong>in the US after Donald Trump described it as possibly \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s not going to kill anybody\u201d. Soon after,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2020/03/23/man-dead-from-taking-chloroquine-after-trump-touts-drug-for-coronavirus/#739ef3ba72e9\">a US man died after he drank chloroquine found in fish tank cleaner because he was scared of getting sick</a>. Nigeria also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-21/nigeria-reports-chloroquine-poisonings-after-trump-praised-drug\">reported chloroquine poisonings</a>. Drug regulators around the world urged people not to attempt to source and ingest the drug, emphasising it was unproven as a Covid-19 treatment and came with potentially toxic side-effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11fb40bcd6687dee7c6f77cd61236136d63ccd3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11fb40bcd6687dee7c6f77cd61236136d63ccd3a/0_0_5148_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US president Donald Trump tells reporters he is taking zinc and hydroxychloroquine to try to prevent illness from Covid-19\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president Donald Trump tells reporters he is taking hydroxychloroquine to try to prevent getting ill from Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a royal mess,\u201d Chaccour says. \u201cThere was huge political polarisation about hydroxychlorioquine, politics became mixed in with policy. So there\u2019s people defending hydroxychloroquine because they like Donald Trump, and people opposing it because they don\u2019t like Donald Trump. This should be about data, not opinions, and absolutely not about politics.

The ivermectin preprint paper had been downloaded more than 15,000 times, its abstract viewed 90,000 times. Bolivia went a step further than Peru, announcing on 19 May that 350,000 doses of the drug would be distributed. \u201cDemand goes up hugely, so much so that a blackmarket of ivermectin emerges,\u201d Chaccour says. \u201cSo ivermectin threatens to become the new hydroxychloroquine in Latin America.\u201d Researchers in Latin America who found hydroxychloroquine <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30383-2/fulltext#.XtCzFgjDxfs.twitter\">was not effective for Covid-19 began receiving death threats</a> after their findings <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2765499\">were published in a US medical journal</a>.</p> <p>On 22 May, the Lancet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">published a hydroxychloroquine study involving 96,000 patients around the world</a> which found the drug was associated with a higher risk of heart problems and death in those with Covid-19. The authors again included Mehra and Desai, and again, Surgisphere\u2019s QuartzClinical global database was used, this time to obtain the data from 1,200 hospitals. The study involved so many hospitals and people that its findings, to many, seemed definitive. Hydroxychloroquine did not work for Covid-19, and in fact could be dangerous in those patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16385d5c007880719867c61630009f70308e4fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16385d5c007880719867c61630009f70308e4fe5/0_0_4466_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pharmacist holds a bottle of the drug hydroxychloroquine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pharmacist holds a bottle of the drug hydroxychloroquine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Lancet study was published on a Friday. In less than 24 hours, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">the World Health Organization [WHO] had stopped the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial they\u2019re sponsoring</a>,\u201d Chaccour says. \u201cThis had massive consequences. There are 131 hydroxychloroquine Covid-19 trials registered. Many national funding agencies stopped or paused these trials. Many patients read the news about the study. Thousands of patients enrolled in these trials feel fear and anguish. How can you continue these trials now? When patients just read this drug is not good?\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, following growing concern from the medical community about the Lancet study and the database, the WHO reversed the decision to halt hydroxychloroquine trials. It too had reviewed the study, and found there was no reason to discontinue trials based on the data. However, WHO officials also reiterated there was as yet no evidence that hydroxychloroquine, or any drug, reduces the mortality in patients who have Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chaccour was baffled that Mehra and Desai were publishing these large studies in prestigious journals every few weeks. It was research that would take months, at least, to write up, longer than the pandemic has been around.</p> <h2>\u2018I have serious concerns with the database\u2019</h2> <p>This time, Chaccour was not alone in his concerns. His questions about the paper were echoed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-surgisphere-hydroxychloroquine-study-lancet-coronavirus-who-questioned-by-researchers-medical-professionals\"> by scientists around the world who had also identified serious and potentially fatal flaws in the study</a>.

Our healthcare data analytics services started about the same time and have continued to grow since that time.\u201d However, information about the database has appeared publicly only since 2019. Before that Surgisphere appeared to publish medical education tools, such as textbooks. Of the database, Desai said: \u201cWe use a great deal of artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate this process as much as possible, which is the only way a task like this is even possible.\u201d</p> <p>He did not explain how the artificial intelligence worked to gather the data, or how hospitals went about putting the system in place and feeding data into it.

We never receive any protected health information or individually identifiable information.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is more crucial than at any other point in modern history that results are transparent, fully assessable and accurate</p> <footer> <cite>Research scientist James Heathers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chaccour had the same questions about Surgisphere. How was it collecting its data? And which hospitals were taking part? \u201cMy to-do list was completely on hold, for a week I looked at nothing else,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as a result I have serious concerns with the database that I believe may have major flaws.\u201d He found race data was reported in the studies that used the database. \u201cIt is not clear how Surgisphere gets race data, since collecting it is uncommon in most countries, and illegal in some,\u201d Chaccour says. Surgisphere did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how race data was collected.</p> <p>It also surprised Chaccour that the company behind one of the largest and fastest hospital databases in the world had almost no online presence. Its Twitter handle had fewer than 170 followers when he checked it, with no posts between October 2017 and 2020; its LinkedIn page has fewer than 100 followers and six employees, which now appears to have reduced to three, with no posts before March 2020; its YouTube page has few subscribers, two videos, and no videos posted in the last decade.</p> <p>It is also unclear where the company is based. Its address is listed in Chicago\u2019s John Hancock Center. The privacy policy of QuartzClinical refers to a residential address in Illinois. Nor is its ethics policy transparent. Despite the Surgisphere database collecting patient data including lab data and physical exam findings, the study published in the Lancet said \u201cthe data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review\u201d.</p> <h2>A history of ambitious claims</h2> <p>But why do it? Why would Desai allow questionable data to be relied on by prestigious journals and run the risk that the errors would be picked up by editors, or by other researchers around the world once published?</p> <p>\u201cThis guy is flying high,\u201d Chaccour speculates. \u201cAnd he\u2019s enjoying the view from up there.

Eight years ago, he launched a crowdfunding campaign on the platform Indiegogo promoting a device called Neurodynamics Flow. The device, Desai wrote on the campaign page, \u201cis a next generation human augmentation device that can help humans achieve what was never thought possible. Unlock human creativity. With over a decade of research into fine-tuning the device, Flow\u2019s sophisticated microprocessor precisely stimulates various areas of the brain to create a higher level of function.\u201d</p> <p>For a donation of US$100, backers of the project were promised an exclusive, signed 8x10 fine art print of the blueprint for the actual prototype. For US$500 project backers were offered a \u201cNeurodynamics Flow in your choice of colour with suede microfiber carrying case and accessories. All electronics and microprocessor are sewn into a wearable device. Machine washable.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The campaign raised about US$300 of its US$10,000 goal. One of Desai\u2019s project backers asked on the website: \u201cWhat happened to the project? Where is my perk?\u201d There was no visible response on the site from Desai. It appears the device never eventuated.</p> <p>Surgisphere\u2019s <a href=\"https://surgisphere.com/research-tools/mortality.php\">Covid-19 \u201cMortality Prediction Tool\u201d</a> has also come under fire. Surgisphere claims that its tools are based on machine-learning algorithms and derived from real-time data. But when different ages are entered into the tool, it appears to simply divide them by 20 to get the predicted mortality, rounded up to the nearest 0.1%. For example, a 10-year-old would have a 0.5% risk of death, according to the tool.</p> <p>A senior London infectious diseases doctor concerned by the tool told the Guardian: \u201cWe know that this is not what happens in Covid-19, where there is an exponential relationship between age and mortality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c6e27d312f7ffc6aa172e2d894e862bad80af05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c6e27d312f7ffc6aa172e2d894e862bad80af05/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A health worker wearing a protective medical equipment extracts a blood sample from a patient\u2019s finger to make an antibody test for patients suspected of being infected with for the coronavirus (COVID-19) at the Center Health Teixeira de Freitas, in Niteroi, Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A health worker wearing a protective medical equipment extracts a blood sample from a patient\u2019s finger to make an antibody test for patients suspected of being infected with for the coronavirus (COVID-19) at the Center Health Teixeira de Freitas, in Niteroi, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUnfortunately Surgisphere\u2019s tool appears to be a public-facing shell without real data driving it,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the clear data flaws pointed out by many readers of the Lancet article, it is reasonable to conclude that that publication also suffers from the same fundamental problem.\u201d Desai did not respond to questions about the tool.&nbsp;</p> <p>Desai is also facing larger issues. In November 2019, two medical negligence claims were filed to the Cook County court. Desai said in <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/disputed-hydroxychloroquine-study-brings-scrutiny-to-surgisphere-67595\">an interview with the Scientist</a> that he deemed any lawsuit against him to be \u201cunfounded\u201d. He told the Guardian and the Scientist that he stands by the studies, but did not explain how hospitals join and sync their data.</p> <h2>\u2018There are definite doubts\u2019</h2> <p>James Heathers, a research scientist with Northeastern University in the US, said major results in large medical journals can affect medical policies in a matter of days, both at the level of changing local hospital practice and changing governmental health policy. That means it is critical that data is transparent and easy to clarify, especially amid a global pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIf serious problems are found with data in a paper such as this, apart from the potentially catastrophic consequences for the authors, it speaks to a problem with how we aggregate and understand evidence,\u201d Heathers said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is more crucial than [at] any other point \u2026 in modern history that results are transparent, fully assessable, and accurate. This means open analytical code, well-specified methods, and inspectable data set \u2013 even if they&nbsp;are proprietary \u2013 should be considered mandatory as conditions of publication at present.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82a773536db3ae0a285ba526218ed7a996979cbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82a773536db3ae0a285ba526218ed7a996979cbc/0_192_5755_3453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New England Journal of Medicine website\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New England Journal of Medicine issued an expression of concern: \u2018We have asked the authors to provide evidence that the data are reliable.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Postmodern Studio/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cThere are definite doubts about the integrity of&nbsp;the Lancet&nbsp;paper.&nbsp;In retrospect many readers and decision-makers may well have placed too much reliance on that paper.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Lancet <a href=\"https://marlin-prod.literatumonline.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S0140673620312903.pdf\">conceded that</a> \u201cimportant scientific questions have been raised about data reported in the paper\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough an independent audit of the provenance and validity of the data has been commissioned by the authors not affiliated with Surgisphere and is ongoing, with results expected very shortly, we are issuing an Expression of Concern to alert readers to the fact that serious scientific questions have been brought to our attention,\u201d the editors said. The NEJM<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2020822?query=featured_coronavirus\"> issued a similar expression of concern stating</a>: \u201cWe have asked the authors to provide evidence that the data are reliable.\u201d</p> <p>Surgisphere data is used for retrospective observational studies, a type of study which can be problematic because of the presence of variables that were not controlled for, and selection bias. Scientists worldwide and the World Health Organization have repeatedly said randomised control trials are needed to show which drugs, if any, are effective for Covid-19 and that these should be made public. Randomised control trials are seen as the gold standard of science due to limited opportunities for bias.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0af89610a2744c7bd1513c47cae035ea40993ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0af89610a2744c7bd1513c47cae035ea40993ef/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crosses which are placed over graves, are pictured in Sao Francisco Xavier cemetery during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crosses which are placed over graves, are pictured in Sao Francisco Xavier cemetery during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mehra has called for more such trials before conclusions are drawn from the hydroxychloroquine study.

Yes, the Roosters are the reigning premiers. But few could have foreseen a result of this magnitude. The Roosters were dominant from go to whoa, passing with fluency and monstering the Broncos with their attacking muscle. Ten tries to nothing tells part of the story, but there isn\u2019t a chapter that speaks well of the Broncos. Sixty-four percent possession to the visitors and 39 completed sets to 20 are other takeouts that highlight the Roosters\u2019 supremacy.</p> <p>Just one spot on the ladder separated these teams before the game but now one team is heading north and the other south. This was the Broncos\u2019 biggest defeat, the first time they\u2019ve been held scoreless at Suncorp Stadium and, just for good measure, the first time in NRL history we\u2019ve seen a 59-0 scoreline. It was just one of those nights. And to think The Chooks did all this without the game\u2019s best player, James Tedesco. Scary.</p> <p>Thanks for your company. Let\u2019s do it all again tomorrow when the Storm host the Rabbitohs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22a1db51b9cf32173da45714f2030c093a98b7ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22a1db51b9cf32173da45714f2030c093a98b7ea/0_179_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane Broncos v Sydney Roosters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sydney Roosters celebrate yet another try in their record-breaking win over Brisbane Broncos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren England/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed8df648f0893539f4cff69\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T11:51:20.646Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FT: Brisbane Broncos 0-59 Sydney Roosters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Broncos can\u2019t get a late try and nor did they deserve to.

Although it lives on an entirely different dancefloor, it\u2019s reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/29/lady-gaga-chromatica-review-ariana-grande-elton-john\">Chromatica</a>, which, after some creative misfires, restored her to the Eurodance that made her name. In her early aesthetic, Gaga found a safe space to explore her previously hidden pain, although critics questioned whether it fit her otherwise always-forward project. Ware doesn\u2019t have such a rigid brand, and so slips commandingly back into plush post-disco. Seemingly freed from commercial expectations and intent on embracing fantasy, the only point is having a good time.</p> <p>Unlike Glasshouse\u2019s stately side, having a good time suits Ware\u2019s voice. She excels at window-steaming intimacy and has the genuinely sultry lyrics to carry it off. \u201cIs this love too hot to handle? / Make a wish, blow out my candle,\u201d she gasps on the title track, a skin-to-skin account of mutual satisfaction. She\u2019s poised, too, slipping around Read My Lips\u2019s clipped funk as if darting down a hall of mirrors. It\u2019s a deliciously flirtatious and commanding performance, if mostly an understated one. What\u2019s Your Pleasure? is all about anticipation, leaving climax tantalisingly out of reach. The fleeting moments in which Ware flashes her vocal power become all the more striking. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLIESvLSDKA\">Save a Kiss</a> layers tremulous string parts on throbbing gridded synths, the warmth swelling until the track seems to hover in mid-air; Ware sings about learning to be patient, and then cracks: \u201cSave a little bit of your love!\u201d she calls urgently.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLIESvLSDKA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cLIESvLSDKA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Jessie Ware: Save a Kiss \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Rare for a modern major-label pop album, What\u2019s Your Pleasure? focuses on one sound. It feels more modern than Ware\u2019s references to Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and US R&amp;B staple Teena Marie \u2013&nbsp;closer to Moloko, or indeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/roisin-murphy\">R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy</a> in contemporary disco mode. It\u2019s sleek yet intensely physical: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw56LGfrf4A\">Spotlight</a> vibrates with momentum; the bell-like synths of Adore You are as cool as pond ripples. It also probably couldn\u2019t exist without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/robyn\">Robyn</a>\u2019s Honey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/28/how-robyn-transformed-pop-music-honey\">another grown-up disco album</a>.&nbsp;(That album\u2019s core personnel, Metronomy\u2019s Joe Mount and Adam Bainbridge, both pop up alongside main producer James Ford.) In very Robyn fashion, Mirage (Don\u2019t Stop) teases its own remix potential, as synth lens-flare, background party chatter and Ware\u2019s silk drape of a voice melt into a juicy reverie. There\u2019s a wealth of great Ware remixes, and What\u2019s Your Pleasure? demands the full club revamp treatment.</p> <p>Those idiosyncratic textures earn Ware her cheeky pastiches. The skittish Ooh La La is so brazenly rooted in early 80s New York that its insouciant funk not only echoes Rapture and Wordy Rappinghood, but its synth speckles wriggle like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/02/public-has-right-to-art-keith-haring-tate-liverpool-exhibition\">Keith Haring</a> art works come to life. Last track Remember Where You Are jumps back earlier into the city\u2019s music history, all velveteen disco gospel, golden vocal harmonies and crackling instrumentation. It\u2019s the curtain call, Ware\u2019s lyrics shifting from sex to comfort as the fantasy fades. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take me home?\u201d she sings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/15/jessie-ware-music-new-album-food-podcast-with-mother-recipe-book\">Jessie Ware: \u2018Music was my bread and butter.

Home life, as in domesticity, doesn\u2019t feature here as it did on Glasshouse: Ware has questioned whether people \u201cwant to hear about struggling mothers\u201d. Pop should make room for such subjects, although given the industry\u2019s confusion about what to do with older female artists, that feels a long way off. But the superb What\u2019s Your Pleasure? makes a case to reimagine so-called comfort zones as potential lanes of expertise: free pop\u2019s women from the pointless commercial burden to reinvent, let them hone their craft, and you get assured marvels like this.</p> <p>\u2022 What\u2019s Your Pleasure? is released on 19 June.</p>",

It envisions millions of Palestinians living in demilitarised enclaves, mostly surrounded by Israel.</p> <p>Even so, some settlers have argued Israel should unilaterally annex territory without agreeing to any of the clauses in Trump\u2019s plan that they see as concessions to the Palestinians.</p> <p>Netanyahu, who met settler leaders this week to hear their grievances, has expressed irritation with Elhayani. \u201cPresident Trump is a great friend of Israel\u2019s. He has led historic moves for Israel\u2019s benefit,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt is regrettable that instead of showing gratitude, there are those who are denying his friendship.\u201d</p> <p>The speaker of Israel\u2019s parliament, Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally, said Elhayani\u2019s remarks were \u201crude and irresponsible\u201d.</p> <p>Under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">a unity government deal</a> signed with his former political rival Benny Gantz, Netanyahu has pushed to bring plans for annexation&nbsp;to the cabinet for discussion as soon as 1 July.</p> <p>Speaking in the Knesset before being sworn in last month, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">said</a> the move would be \u201canother glorious chapter in the history of Zionism\u201d.</p> <p>However, much uncertainty remains around whether Netanyahu will move ahead swiftly, and whether he wants to take such a controversial and potentially explosive step so soon after retaking office.</p> <p>Israeli forces captured the West Bank from Jordanian forces in 1967, although Palestinians have limited self-rule over some parts. Today, Israel retains control over the West Bank areas it plans to annex, and settlers enjoy the same rights and most of the services as Israelis living in Israel \u2013 some argue Israel has de facto annexed the territory already.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the country is enjoying a period when many world powers, including some Arab states, are curtailing their public criticism following half a century of occupation.</p> <p>Netanyahu has long boasted that <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/netanyahu-israeli-ties-to-arab-world-stronger-without-the-palestinians-574509\">he sidelined</a> the Palestinians on the world stage, and annexation could threaten that. The Palestinian leadership, which pre-emptively rejected Trump\u2019s plan as biased, has recently launched a campaign to draw up international pressure.</p> <p>Anshel Pfeffer, a journalist for the Haaretz newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-on-annexation-netanyahu-and-the-settlers-have-never-been-on-the-same-page-1.8891365\">wrote</a> that Netanyahu might in fact welcome the settler disagreements as he could use it as a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to postpone the move.</p> <p>\u201cHe talks of July 1 as an \u2018unmissable\u2019 date but won\u2019t detail how he plans to extend Israeli sovereignty. There\u2019s no map. No draft legislation. No timetable,\u201d said Pfeffer, who wrote a biography on Netanyahu. \u201cUltimately, the difference between Netanyahu and the settlers\u2019 aims are that his is a personal-political project dedicated to perpetuating his hold on power.\u201d</p> <p>Questions have also been raised around whether Washington backs unilateral moves. While the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said annexation is ultimately \u201can Israeli decision\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-talks-annexation-with-kushner-us-said-to-want-to-slow-the-process/\">local media</a> have reported that US officials want to slow the process while it deals with domestic protests and the coronavirus pandemic.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThis year we have to drink all the beer,\u201d Joshua Kimmich says, his tone deadpan as he ponders how weird it would be for Bayern Munich not to have their traditional beer-throwing celebration in front of their supporters if they win the Bundesliga this season. \u201cI cannot imagine it now. I just know that it is strange if you win a game at the Allianz Arena and cannot celebrate with your fans. But we don\u2019t have the choice now.\u201d</p> <p>Bayern\u2019s outstanding midfielder can be forgiven for his confidence. The German champions were motoring before the coronavirus pandemic brought football to a halt in March and they have effortlessly picked up the pace since the Bundesliga season resumed last month, gliding seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table since returning to action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/joshua-kimmich-wants-white-players-to-join-black-teammates-protests\">Joshua Kimmich wants white players to join black teammates' protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Kimmich suggests that Bayern are not quite up to full speed, the numbers suggest otherwise: four successive victories, 13 goals scored, only two conceded. Hansi Flick\u2019s side are closing in on an eighth consecutive title and could still emulate the treble-winning class of 2013. Kimmich has been pivotal to their awesome form, knitting everything together in midfield and surprising even himself when he scored a lovely chip in the crucial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/26/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-bundesliga-der-klassiker-report\" title=\"\">1-0 away win against Dortmund</a> last week.</p> <p>Yet it was a disorienting occasion when the two biggest sides in Germany met at the Signal Iduna Park, with the match behind closed doors and the Yellow Wall empty.

Normally when there are fans you are focused just because of that. You feel mistakes more. Also you feel more if you score a goal. It\u2019s more emotional when there are fans.\u201d</p> <p>The Germany international thinks it is harder for home teams \u2013 there have been 18 away wins in 36 games since the Bundesliga returned \u2013 and players have had to adjust to follow physical distancing measures. \u201cWe are in the hotel with face masks,\u201d Kimmich says. \u201cOn the bus when we drive to the game, when we sit together in the hotel and restaurants, everyone sits alone. It\u2019s really different. In the locker room, we have two-metre distance, or more than one metre.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u00a0play\u00a0football\u00a0to have fun, and we have fun as a team. It is not just about winning 1-0</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Premier League is due to resume this month and it has been noticeable that players in Germany are sustaining more muscle injuries, though Kimmich is unsure if the lay\u2011off has changed the pattern during games. \u201cIt was OK for us because it was like a third pre\u2011season. We worked a lot, first at home with the cyber-training and after in smaller groups, then with the whole team. Now we have the benefit. </p> <p>\u201cThe physical factor is really important for us. I don\u2019t know the difference between the normal games and these matches, if we run more or less, or it\u2019s more intensive or less. We haven\u2019t had muscle injuries yet, but I think it could be a problem when the new season starts because we won\u2019t get a long holiday.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmich, who feels football\u2019s return has lifted morale in Germany, was not worried before the big restart. \u201cThere was a health protocol. We knew at first that social life was resuming and then it was possible to play football again. We had the green light from the government. We are tested every three or four days and every day before the games. It is really safe.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the role model for other countries. Not everybody thinks that it\u2019s good football is back. But the system is good.

You can hear what the coach is screaming on the touchline. It is really different when you walk on the pitch. It is like a friendly, or the under-17s. You\u2019re just on the pitch and you start. </p> <p>\u201cNormally I enjoy it when you walk out and see the atmosphere. This is maybe what I miss the most but the positive thing is you can speak to everybody and the focus is more on the game. There is no big show from the players any more \u2013 lying on the ground and screaming.</p> <p>\u201cI can feel that I am less emotional when I speak to the referee. Maybe I am not that \u2018pushed\u2019 from the fans. When they are screaming you are more emotional and maybe you speak in another way with the referee. Now you can be more calm and speak in a normal way. You don\u2019t have to shout at him and he doesn\u2019t have to shout back.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmich rarely looks ruffled on the pitch. The 25-year-old burst on to the scene at right-back but was a midfielder in his youth. He has flourished in that position under Flick, who has revived Bayern since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/bayern-munich-niko-kovac\" title=\"\">replacing Niko Kovac last November</a>. \u201cThe coach gives us a good feeling, we press high,\u201d Kimmich says. \u201cWe want to have good possession and most of all it is fun. You play football to have fun and you can see this on the pitch \u2013 we have fun as a team. With our style of playing, it is not just about winning 1-0.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmich\u2019s partnership with Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara sets the tone and he displayed his confidence when he caught Dortmund\u2019s goalkeeper, Roman B\u00fcrki, off his line with that clever chip. \u201cIt was not planned and I have never scored a goal like this before. I thought about it. We did a lot of shooting in training, where we worked in smaller groups. The angle is easier for the goalkeeper when he goes out, so in training I saw that maybe this was possible to try in the game.

It said the massacre was essential for China\u2019s future order and prosperity. It claimed only 241 people died, when unofficial estimates are many times higher. Then it outlawed any further mention of the event.</p> <p>The message to the Chinese people was: the mass movement never took place; those peaceful protesters were thugs. Only the party can restore order and make you rich. Keep quiet, forget the past. Forget democracy and freedom.

If the Chinese government had been as open and transparent as it professed, how many of the current <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">388,000 deaths</a> worldwide could have been avoided?

But the CCP are now intent on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">stubbing out</a> this last pocket of freedom.

Today I am more concerned than I have ever been that the CCP will enact another Tiananmen on Hong Kong\u2019s streets. Whether it happens dramatically with armoured tanks, or more covertly, over years, as it has in Tibet and Xinjiang, Hong Kong\u2019s unique spirit and character will be assailed as the CCP attempts to draw it deeper into its net.</p> <p>All around the world, people are finding it hard to breathe as the virus that originally emerged in Wuhan spreads through the air, and the boots of demagogues everywhere stamp down on human necks. In China and Hong Kong, the only source of hope will be the stubborn refusal to forget, and the fierce clinging to the humane ideals of the peacerful protesters who filled Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p> <p>\u2022 Ma Jian was born in Qingdao, China.

It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges.</p> \n  <p>During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.</p> \n  <p>Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.</p> \n  <p>Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. </p> \n  <p>The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a3848f082107f453a7bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T07:42:57.226Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination.

In San Francisco, protesters took the streets by foot and by horse. And in Seattle, demonstrations continued as the mayor announced that the curfew would be lifted.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former defense secretary, James Mattis, who quit over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria, condemned the president\u2019s handling of protests in DC and around the country. </strong>Mattis, like other former military and defense officials, excoriated Trump for having peaceful protestors gassed so he could pose for a photo. </li> \n   <li><strong>Additional charges were filed against the former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. </strong>The<strong> </strong>Minnesota attorney general, <strong>Keith Ellison, </strong>said that the murder charge against <strong>Derek Chauvin </strong>had been elevated to second-degree murder, and three other officers had been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.</li> \n   <li><strong>Kayleigh McEnany signaled defense secretary Mark Esper\u2019s job may be in trouble. </strong>Asked during her White House briefing about whether the president still has faith in Esper, the press secretary said, \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d The comment came after Esper said he would not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen protests, as <strong>Trump </strong>has suggested.</li> \n   <li><strong>A prominent US police chief called for a nationwide ban on chokeholds </strong>in response to Floyd\u2019s death.<strong> </strong><strong>Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis</strong>, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, said on Good Morning America, \u201cThe emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated.

But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. </p> \n  <p>His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos</a>, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. </p> \n  <p>It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church</a>, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind.

He is optimistic, he says, that \u201cthis country\u2019s going to get better\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The young of America have witnessed too much violence and death, he says, and \u201ctoo often that violence has come from folks supposed to be serving and protecting you\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Obama also acknowledges \u201cthe folks in law enforcement that share the goals of reimagining policing\u201d, who he says he knows are just as outraged as many of the protesters out on the streets across the country. He is heartened, he says, by seeing police and other officers who have engaged with the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n  <p>Obama discusses his <strong>task force on 21st-century policing</strong>, which was formed after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014. </p> \n  <p>Its report, he says, \u201cshowcased a range of proven strategies and aims\u201d meant to be used for reforms. Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct.</p> \n  <p>Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201c<strong>voting vs protest</strong>\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change. Unsurprisingly, Obama doesn\u2019t agree. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is not an either-or,\u201d he says, having noted the local positions above are by and large voted for.</p> \n  <p>He says he is <strong>urging every mayor in the US to review use-of-force policies</strong> with their communities and commit to reforms they can make.</p> \n  <p>He also thinks every city in the US should \u201cbe a My Brother\u2019s Keeper community\u201d, aiming to expand opportunity for young men of colour, because the programme can make a difference.</p> \n  <p>Obama closes these remarks by saying people are reminded of the 60s by the current unrest and discord. There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified. The country must use this momentum for change, he says.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed812cd8f08cadb60400993\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T21:20:34.298Z\">10.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama speaks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Barack Obama is speaking now.

But contrast is not a vision, say activists, scholars and strategists, echoing calls from protesters for changes to the economic and political conditions that led to the death of another black man in police custody.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the last several days, the official death toll of the Covid-19 outbreak, which has been disproportionately affecting black communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-victims-stories\">surpassed 100,000 Americans</a>, while the economic turmoil left more than 40 million people without jobs \u2013&nbsp;all before Minneapolis erupted in furious protest, sparking demonstrations in cities across the country and the globe.</p> \n<p>The compounding crises present a critical test of leadership for the 77-year-old presumptive Democratic nominee who has cast his candidacy as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has to be about more than beating Donald Trump,\u201d Akunna Cook, the former president of the Black Economic Alliance. \u201cIt is not enough to just be better than Trump.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0768e714e975e9f1c07b08445ea7bf77370f4788\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0768e714e975e9f1c07b08445ea7bf77370f4788/0_198_6048_3628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Representative Lisa Blunt speaks with Joe Biden, along with members of the clergy and community leaders at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Delaware.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Representative Lisa Blunt speaks with Joe Biden, along with members of the clergy and community leaders at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Delaware.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So far, Biden, vice-president under Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president, has sought to demonstrate he is capable of listening and leading. On Sunday, he made an unannounced visit to a protest site in Wilmington. He hosted a virtual roundtable with mayors to discuss the upheaval. On Tuesday, he traveled to Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, to confront the \u201cracial wounds that have long plagued our country\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cook, now a senior fellow at the Democratic thinktank Third Way, is encouraged but challenged Biden to do more to address deep-rooted racial and economic disparities.</p> \n<p>\u201cBiden has the latitude to be a transformational president and to have a transformational presidency,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Biden won the Democratic primary on the strength of his support among black voters, particularly older, more moderate black voters who helped turn around his struggling presidential campaign starting in South Carolina.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet this coalition alone will probably not be enough to beat Trump. Biden\u2019s campaign has acknowledged he must also motivate younger and disaffected black voters who have lost faith in electoral politics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Many of them are in the streets protesting police killings and institutionalized racism at this moment, said Cliff Albright, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter. He fears Democrats are charting a path that is vulnerable to low turnout.</p> \n<p>\u201cCome November, Democrats are going to be trying to figure out what it takes to get them out to vote,\u201d Albright said. \u201cThey\u2019re telling you what it will take. Does he listen? That will be the real test.\u201d</p> \n<p>The support of African American voters is critical to the success of any Democratic nominee. In 2016, black voter turnout <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">fell</a> for the first time in two decades, the result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/this-was-the-election-of-disillusionment\">disillusionment</a>, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers\">voter disenfranchisement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">Russia interference</a> targeting African Americans online.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump has made a show of his efforts to peel away black support for the Democratic party, despite his long history of racist remarks and behavior. His campaign hosts online gatherings featuring African American surrogates and seized on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">Biden\u2019s comment</a> last month that African American voters torn between him and the president \u201cain\u2019t black\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since the protests began, Biden has sought to emphasize unity and solidarity, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump who characterized those demonstrating as \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d and threatened to deploy the military if governors failed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protests.

Entering the race for president in 2019, Biden said he was motivated by the president\u2019s failure to unequivocally condemn white supremacists in the wake of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Biden\u2019s record on matters of race is complicated. His treatment of Anita Hill during the 1991 supreme court nomination hearings for Clarence Thomas, and his authorship of a 1994 crime bill that many activists and researchers say led to an era of mass incarceration, are still points of contention.</p> \n<p>During the primary, his more liberal rivals attacked him over his past stances on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">mandatory school busing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/elizabeth-warren-biden-abortion-video-response-clip-msnbc-town-hall\">abortion</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1197364395204059136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197364395204059136&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fbooker-biden-marijuana-legalization-915725%2F\">marijuana legalization</a>.

  "<p>Good morning.</p> \n<p>The last two US secretaries of defense have both voiced stiff opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests.

Patients get a lot of the burden of interpreting a test result or knowing what to do once they get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was surprised by the fact that instead of utilizing established public health entities, we went to a company that has never been involved in diagnostics before,\u201d said Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt is unusual to do in the setting of a pandemic when we really want to use resources that are reliable.\u201d</p> <p>A Nomi Health spokeswoman disputed the suggestion that the company lacked expertise, and said its co-founder and COO, Josh Walker, had more than 20 years of healthcare experience and the company has partnered with hospital systems, leading disease detection technologies, and other established healthcare entities.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Nomi Health may be a new company, our partners executing on these testing programs are not,\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc4a86317a503c9be331829cf22f9f3c1b7dedce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4a86317a503c9be331829cf22f9f3c1b7dedce/0_0_3600_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Healthcare worker test a resident at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Healthcare worker test a resident at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iowa lawmakers, however, <a href=\"https://www.kcrg.com/2020/05/28/iowa-lawmakers-call-forinvestigation-of-test-iowa/\">are calling</a> for an investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that TestIowa failed to meet the goals outlined by Governor Reynolds. Iowa taxpayers are on the hook for $26m and they deserve to know whether their money is being spent wisely,\u201d representatives Ruth Ann Gaines and Chris Hall said in a letter last week calling for a government oversight investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWe trust what Iowans and local officials are communicating about their experiences with TestIowa. If Iowans can\u2019t get the answers they deserve regarding TestIowa, it may be time to cancel the contract,\u201d said the letter.</p> <p>Lawmakers are also concerned about the lack of transparency around how the TestIowa contract got awarded. A spokesman for the governor said decision was made in coordination with the Iowa department of public health and the state medical director and epidemiologist. He said Reynolds also spoke with the Utah governor, Gary Herbert, and his staff regarding its parallel program, TestUtah, before making her decision.</p> <p>Lawmakers in other states where Nomi Health is operating have called for similar reviews. In Utah, disease specialists have questioned the company\u2019s results after data showed far lower positive rates than those of other providers.</p> <p>And in Nebraska, the Journal Star <a href=\"https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/senators-call-on-governor-to-end-test-nebraska-contracts/article_b2176fbb-bae2-5fbd-b372-df08e9208b4c.html\">reported</a> the TestNebraska initiative results were showing a 2% positive rate, which is \u201cwell below the 18% average positive rate for all other tests conducted in Nebraska since testing began in early March\u201d.</p> <p>Nebraska lawmakers have asked the state\u2019s governorto <a href=\"https://kutv.com/news/coronavirus/nebraska-lawmakers-want-to-terminate-27-million-contract-with-test-utah-companies\">terminate the $27m contract</a> with Nomi<strong>,</strong> saying the company has no prior experience with epidemiology. \u201cPerhaps not the best entity to be dealing with this massive project, considering they aren\u2019t a healthcare company and they admittedly don\u2019t know anything about lab testing prior to March of this year,\u201d the Nebraska state senator Machaela Cavanaugh wrote.</p> <p>Nomi Health said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that \u201csome politicians have decided to use their positions to target a community health program run by the state to serve their own political agendas in the midst of a crisis, instead of directing their energy toward taking meaningful action to help the State\u2019s COVID-19 response\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also clear these politicians don\u2019t understand our role or what it takes to pull together an effective testing operation like this so quickly with no defined playbook,\u201d the company added.</p> <p>A Nomi spokeswoman said the backlog of results in Iowa has been resolved and were a normal part of the program ramping up its capabilities during a health crisis. \u201cIt is a herculean effort to launch a state-wide assessment and testing program in record time in the midst of a pandemic with no precedent for doing so,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"317478b99942c8d46943a57d84643d774a7d6e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317478b99942c8d46943a57d84643d774a7d6e76/0_0_2244_1494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyson Foods employee dons a second protective mask outside of the company\u2019s meat processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tyson Foods employee dons a second protective mask outside of the company\u2019s meat processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Today Sports/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Where TestIowa stands</strong></h2> <p>Despite the widespread concerns, Reynolds is<a href=\"https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/governor-stands-by-accuracy-of-testiowa-covid-19-tests\"> moving forward</a> with TestIowa, saying the state is approaching its original goal of 5,000 daily tests.

Nearly 60% of employees at one Tyson plant in Perry, Iowa \u2013 730 employees \u2013 reportedly were infected with the virus. Another Tyson plant, in Waterloo, Iowa, had 1,031 reported cases among about 2,800 workers.</p> <p>An additional outbreak was revealed in a news conference in May in Storm Lake where 555 of the plant\u2019s 2,517 employees have tested positive.</p> <p>In that announcement, the Iowa department of public health said it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrynard/status/1265679868471148544\">would not be</a> publicly announcing continuing outbreaks at meatpacking plants unless directly asked by reporters. The Iowa department of public health and the governor\u2019s office declined to respond to questions about the number of coronavirus hotspots in the state, and whether those would be tracked by TestIowa.</p>",
  "<p>On Monday when Donald Trump raised overhead a Bible \u2013 the Sword of the Spirit, to believers \u2013 he unwittingly cleaved his loyal Christian supporters into two camps.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His most ardent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/donald-trump-church-photo-op-evangelicals\">evangelical supporters</a> saw it as a blow against evil and described his walk from the White House to St John\u2019s Episcopal church, over ground violently cleared of protesters, as a \u201cJericho walk\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Rev Johnnie Moore, president of the Congress of Christian Leaders, described Trump in <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/johnniem/status/1267598242730192896\">shepherd-like terms</a> on Twitter:</p> \n<p>\u201cI will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly &amp; in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse&nbsp;across Lafayette Square to St. John\u2019s Church defying those who aim to derail our national healing by spreading fear, hate &amp; anarchy. After just saying, \u2018I will keep you safe.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>But evangelicals are not monolithic: some saw the gesture as cynical, a ploy by a president whose decisions, both private and public, do not align with biblical principles.</p> \n<p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a sort of Rorschach test, then,\u201d said Dallas pastor Robert Jeffress, who is one of Trump\u2019s most important defenders among the faithful. \u201cYou see what you expect to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not true, Trump\u2019s emerging evangelical critics say: an objective measure is contained in the very book Trump wielded.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers! Blessed are the merciful! It\u2019s right there in the Sermon on the Mount,\u201d said John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah College. \u201cJust read Jesus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s photo opportunity required police to attack and push away protesters against police brutality. He walked surrounded by key civilian and military advisers, some of whom later said they were caught unaware by the stunt and the violence that preceded it. Some evangelical leaders said they felt similarly aghast, watching the event unfold.</p> \n<p>\u201cPelting people with rubber bullets and spraying them with teargas for peacefully protesting is morally wrong,\u201d said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. \u201cWhat we need right now is moral leadership \u2013 from all of us, in the churches, in the police departments, in the courts, and in the White House. The Bible tells us so. So do our own consciences.\u201d</p> \n<p>The day\u2019s events left Moore \u201calarmed\u201d, he said.</p> \n<p>The staunchest of evangelicals, 90-year-old televangelist Pat Robertson, split from Trump on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>He told his television viewers of the president: \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m ready to send in military troops if the nation\u2019s governors don\u2019t act to quell the violence that has rocked American cities.\u2019 A matter of fact, he spoke of them as being jerks. You just don\u2019t do that, Mr President. It isn\u2019t cool!\u201d</p> \n<p>It could be far worse than uncool, politically.</p> \n<p>Trump can\u2019t afford to lose evangelicals, even by the handful. A record 81% of white evangelicals voted for him in 2016, and he only narrowly won the presidency, sometimes by just a few thousand votes in crucial areas. His gesture with the Bible outside St John\u2019s was meant to shore up that support, reminding his base of a tacit agreement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a contract between him and evangelical voters,\u201d Fea, the professor, who is a Christian, said. In exchange for their ballots, he said, Trump has packed the courts, including the supreme court, with conservative judges who agree with them on social issues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So while evangelicals lifted Trump to power by voting together, they may prove his undoing if a contingent breaks away. In which case his campaign might shudder to hear of evangelical believers like Anthony Kidd in Daphne, Alabama.</p> \n<p>During the week Kidd works at a salvage yard, and on weekends he does audio work during church services. He\u2019s conservative.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe past few years he has done things that are good for Christians, I\u2019ll grant that,\u201d he said. But when he saw Trump lift the Bible outside St John\u2019s, he said, \u201cIt made me want to throw up a little bit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fea said it was unclear what happens next: whether evangelicals will stay by Trump, or make a significant split. But whatever happens, he said, is unlikely to be peaceful.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking back through history, whenever you see someone in authority using the Bible to justify law and order, it ends badly.\u201d</p>",

The largest police force in the US, with its $5.6bn annual budget and 36,000 uniformed officers under the leadership of one of the most progressive mayors in the country, has responded to demonstrations about police brutality with more police brutality.</p> \n<p>The Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the city council, which makes up more than half of the legislative body, was swift and devastating in its criticism. In a <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/05/31/mad-as-hell-mayor-selectively-quotes-council-minority-leadership-silencing-their-narrative/\">statement</a>, it said that the NYPD had acted \u201cwith aggression towards New Yorkers who vigorously and vociferously but nonetheless peacefully advocated for justice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the caucus, told the Guardian the NYPD had tried to suppress legitimate anger felt by African American and other minority communities following years of police abuse. \u201cWe cannot allow people who have kept people of color down for decades to say now that we don\u2019t have the right to display our outrage,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Though that sentiment applies nationwide, Adams believes New York stands out as having a \u201chorrible history of police brutality\u201d. It was the NYPD that set the tone, she said, when Daniel Pantaleo, the officer implicated in the 2014 death by chokehold of Eric Garner in Staten Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">avoided prosecution</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen nothing happened to the police officers who were responsible for the death of Eric Garner, New York set the blueprint for what happened to George Floyd,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty, no consequence, so it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adams\u2019s framing of the Garner killing could equally be applied to a long string of notorious episodes of police misconduct that preceded it. In 1997, Haitian immigrant <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/twenty-years-later-look-back-nypd-assault-abner-louima-and-what-it-means-today/\">Abner Louima</a> was handcuffed by an NYPD officer and sexually assaulted with a broken broomstick.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f/0_0_3000_1755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police clash with demonstrators protesting the Staten Island, New York grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police clash with demonstrators protesting against the decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Two years later, <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/justice/2019/2/1/21211182/20-years-after-the-nypd-killing-of-amadou-diallo-his-mom-asks-what-s-changed\">Amadou Diallo</a> was shot near his home in a hail of 41 bullets after officers mistook his wallet for a gun.

In 2004 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/new-york-agrees-settlement-2004-republican-convention\">rounded up</a> more than 1,800 peaceful protesters rallying outside the Republican National Convention during the re-election bid of George W Bush and herded them into overcrowded pens on Pier 57 in Manhattan. In 2011 it was similarly criticized for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/02/occupy-wall-street-nypd-tactics\">heavy-handed tactics</a> during the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Cutting across all this, the force has consistently targeted its efforts on neighborhoods of the city with majority black or Latino populations, straying at times into overt racial profiling. Though stop and frisk has been reined back in recent years, the NYPD continues to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/tale-two-new-york-cities-when-it-comes-policing\">heavily and disproportionately police</a> those communities despite a historically low <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-citys-murder-rate-hit-new-low-in-2018-11546559793\">homicide rate</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite this long legacy of overreach, the force continues to be systemically resistant to public oversight. Under <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/law-makes-it-nearly-impossible-police-police-new-york\">Section 50-A</a> of New York state law, the disciplinary files of police officers are largely held in secret, making the task of holding them accountable almost impossible.</p> \n<p>Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney at the Cop Accountability Project (CAP) within the Legal Aid Society, told the Guardian that there were currently more than 200 police officers still being employed by the NYPD on full pay who should have been considered for termination following reports of misconduct.</p> \n<p>Data collected by CAP shows that where cases of misconduct arise they often involve escalation of low-level encounters into aggressive confrontations \u2013 something officers are supposed to be trained not to do.

  "<p>The word \u201cbreathe\u201d has never been more potent than at the moment.</p> <p>The instruction to breathe is something midwives say an awful lot to women in labour. It\u2019s also being said a great deal to patients on ventilators whose lungs have been taken over by Covid-19.</p> <p>In the hospital where I work as a midwife, there are double doors leading from our midwifery unit to a makeshift intensive care unit. On one side, I am involved with the unborn who are yet to breathe, while on the other there are people unable to breathe independently. The proximity of brand new life and end of life separated by double doors is very affecting for me and all my colleagues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/porters-story-hospital-reminds-me-disaster-movie-covid-19\">A porter's story: 'The hospital in Covid-19 times reminds me of a disaster movie'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The women I look after must be aware, but when they are allocated a delivery room, they are completely absorbed in giving birth. It\u2019s almost a holiday from the shitstorm. These are strange times we are working in, but I haven\u2019t felt frightened, and neither should the women I\u2019m helping.</p> <p>Antenatal classes are online and a lot of care is delivered by telephone; it seems to have worked very well. If a woman has to come in, our emergency obstetric unit is open, but anybody else attending must wait outside. Most birth partners have been incredibly understanding, given that we don\u2019t even provide chairs in the corridor outside. Often, there\u2019s a line of physically distanced people.</p> <p>More women have started asking to have an induction or elective caesarean section to try and gain a bit of control in the circumstances. Once someone is in established labour, the birth partner can stay until delivery. We try and keep people in there as long as possible, but it depends how many people are in at one time. Once the woman leaves and goes into postnatal care, it\u2019s goodbye to the birth partner at the doors. The only exceptions we\u2019ve made have been when the woman is experiencing mental health issues.</p> <p>More people have been delivering babies in the car park than usual. It\u2019s always been the third most popular place after the delivery suite and antenatal wards. People are leaving it to the last minute because of fears around coronavirus. More are coming in in advanced labour; some decide to stay at home until they get anxious and come into hospital.</p> <p>The postnatal ward is a lovely place to be at the moment. The curtains are open, and women are helping each other and bonding in a way that we thought was a thing of the past. One of the things we will probably review is how often partners are allowed in. Now that is not happening, there is a spirit of female empowerment and togetherness. Those who have had babies before are helping first-timers with breastfeeding, for example. There is also the ability to share stories and to come to terms with your birth experience.</p> <p>There have been cases of stillborn babies and the key thing that has changed is the way in which the death is registered. There\u2019s a lot more having to be done online. Once a child has been separated from the mother there is no further opportunity to see the baby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/nhs-doctor-enough-people-clapping\">I'm an NHS doctor \u2013 and I've had enough of people clapping for me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is difficult, but not necessarily in the most obvious way. Sometimes, at the point of delivery women don\u2019t want to see their stillborn baby; they\u2019re completely and utterly closed to the idea and then change their mind a day later. Managing that situation requires sensitivity. We have very good bereavement midwives who are experienced in helping women down this road.&nbsp;</p> <p>We\u2019ve been 20% down on the workforce generally, and have had to call in agency staff. It\u2019s a busy unit anyway but it has felt most of the time like we\u2019re slightly ahead of it going completely pear-shaped. We\u2019re nine weeks into this crisis. It\u2019s amazing what you get used to.</p> <p>We are wearing various degrees of personal protective equipment (PPE). For women with coronavirus, we wear full PPE. It\u2019s very hot. It\u2019s also alienating because a huge amount of our job, which has a massive bearing on the woman\u2019s experience, is done through eye contact, voice, movement and being able to read people\u2019s facial expressions.</p> <p>Panic has a huge impact on a woman\u2019s perception of her experience. If you\u2019re looked after by someone in a visor, where all you can see is a reflection of the window, you\u2019re not seeing physical cues. The lack of human touch is another unfortunate consequence of PPE.</p> <p>I became a midwife 10 years ago when I was in my mid-50s for political reasons, namely to support the NHS. Sadly, the biggest social change I have lived through has been the gradual denigration of the health service. I\u2019ve benefited my entire life from an excellent welfare system. My father died very young having had fantastic treatment, and my husband died of cancer aged 44. He also received brilliant care which didn\u2019t cost one penny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a midwife, every transaction I have with a woman and her family is a political one.

  "<p>The killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis was the latest tragedy illustrating a centuries-long history of racism in America, one so deeply ingrained that it endures despite the rights hard-won in the courts and Congress. Police brutality is, of course, just one of countless ways that African Americans and other people of color suffer from structural inequality and discrimination in America.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/weve-reached-the-mad-emperor-stage-and-its-terrifying-to-behold\">Trump has reached the 'mad emperor' stage, and it's terrifying to behold | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Faced with massive protests against this racism, President Donald Trump has responded like an autocrat. Trump has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704\">repeatedly</a> encouraged <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/02/867565338/governors-push-back-on-trumps-threat-to-deploy-federal-troops-to-quell-unrest\">violence</a> against protesters and threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops on US soil. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff \u2013 America\u2019s top military official \u2013 stood next to Trump as he talked about deploying troops, then <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/500626-joint-chiefs-chair-walks-dc-streets-amid-protests-we-protect-freedom-of-speech\">walked</a> the streets of DC in his combat fatigues to survey the scene like an occupying general.&nbsp;The US secretary of defense <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/esper-pushes-states-to-dominate-the-battlespace-to-end-unrest-2020-6\">told</a> governors to \u201cdominate the battlespace\u201d \u2013 the \u201cbattlespace\u201d meaning the streets of American cities.</p> <p>The breadth and depth of the structural problems at play can be seen in police forces\u2019 responses to protests, which often range from heavy-handed to outright dangerous. Police are shooting people with paint pellets and rubber bullets, running into protesters with cars, and shooting teargas and flash-bang canisters into crowds. A helicopter in Washington DC flew low over a crowd to disperse it with noise and wind, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1267676082028904448?s=20\">tactic</a> used in war zones against insurgents. And the police violently dispersed a group of peaceful protesters in front of the White House to clear a path for Trump to walk to a church for a photo op.&nbsp;</p> <p>If these events were taking place in any other country, a normal US government would express its outrage in statements and high-level phone calls and coordinate with allied countries and international organizations to pressure the offending government. From repression in the Soviet Union to the brutal suppression of protests in the Middle East during the Arab spring, the US has helped lead principled international responses to countries that violently oppress their citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America is, justifiably, the focus of intense anger, frustration, and disappointment from people across the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, in a truly sad state of affairs, dictatorships around the world \u2013 systems built on the repression of their own citizens \u2013 are able to give their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/world/asia/china-george-floyd.html\">propagandists</a> a break from fabricating stories about America because they can just post pictures and videos of current events. While there is no legitimate comparison between these dictatorships and what is happening in America today, the US\u2019s actions undercut its ability to stand up for what\u2019s right abroad. In the same week that America is trying to pressure China over its repression in Hong Kong and commemorating the anniversary of China\u2019s violent crackdown against citizens in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the American government is threatening violence against peaceful protesters at home.&nbsp;</p> <p>America is, justifiably, the focus of intense anger, frustration and disappointment from people across the world. United Nations officials have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/500807-un-chief-heartbroken-to-see-violence-in-nyc-amid-george-floyd-protests\">spoken</a> out about the murder of George Floyd. The pope called out <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/europe/pope-francis-george-floyd-intl/index.html\">racism</a> in America. Australia launched an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/500610-prime-minister-calls-for-investigation-into-alleged-police-attack-on\">investigation</a> into an incident in which a police officer attacked an Australian journalist covering the US protests. If the situation in America continues to escalate, one could easily imagine some of America\u2019s closest democratic allies beginning to consider steps like offering protesters asylum, criticizing America\u2019s state-sanctioned violence in international organizations, and even perhaps sanctioning US officials responsible.&nbsp;</p> <p>But something more is happening abroad \u2013 something that speaks to the best of America as well. Protests from New Zealand to the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-netherlan/thousands-chant-i-cant-breathe-at-amsterdam-rally-angry-at-george-floyds-death-idUSKBN23834M\">Netherlands</a> have shown an outpouring of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/31/21276031/george-floyd-protests-london-berlin\">support</a> for Americans standing up against racism and police brutality. As flawed as they are, America\u2019s democratic institutions are built to allow people to voice their opinions, vote out their elected leaders, take to the streets to protest peacefully, and improve policies. It is this capacity for change and improvement that has given inspiration to people across the world for decades.</p> <p>Today, America\u2019s protesters are its ambassadors to the world, reminding everyone of the ideals the country strives to embody.&nbsp;And even in these dark times, people around the world still believe in the vision of America that the protesters are struggling to build. Like the protesters at home, those taking to the streets around the world to speak out against racism in America \u2013 and to remember George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others \u2013 understand what makes America great far better than Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at&nbsp;7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is&nbsp;holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p>",

I really didn\u2019t want to see a recession ever again in Australia. And as a government, we worked so hard to bring the budget back into balance, to create one and a half million jobs. And there were many sacrifices that had to be achieved to get Australia\u2019s economy back on track and to see Covid-19 hit it like a torpedo is absolutely devastating.

They\u2019ve been hit by the same risks that we have. But Australia\u2019s resolve has been so much better and one of the reasons for that is that people were drawn together. As a government, we have brought people together. As a prime minister, I\u2019ve sought to bring people, the treasurer the same, all of my ministers in our federal cabinet, working with states, territories, industry, the various groups that are

date \u2013 and a definition \u2013 for eliminating Covid-19 from it\u2019s shores:</p> \n  <p>(via AAP)<br></p> \n  <p>New Zealand finally has a date for when it will achieve its lofty goal of elimination of Covid-19:<strong> June 15.</strong></p> \n  <p>After weeks of urging by public health experts and government wrangling, the country\u2019s Health Department has settled on a definition of elimination of the deadly virus.</p> \n  <p>New Zealand has followed an elimination policy path since the arrival of the virus, eschewing lighter approaches by countries including Australia.</p> \n  <p>The Kiwi approach, including a seven-week lockdown, is paying dividends.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday, health officials announced they had found no new cases of the virus for the 13th straight day, from thousands of tests.</p> \n  <p>Just one person in New Zealand has Covid-19, an Aucklander currently isolating who is due to be asymptomatic this week, should the virus follow a normal course.</p> \n  <p>Australia currently has 491 active cases.<br></p> \n  <p>However, the final Kiwi case is irrelevant to whether New Zealand has eliminated the disease.</p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Health now says elimination can be declared 28 days after the last case from a \u201clocally acquired unknown source\u201d, or community transmission, has completed their treatment and tested negative.</p> \n  <p>According to the ministry, New Zealand\u2019s last case of community transmission tested positive on 29 April, and was in isolation until 18 May.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs per the definition of elimination, the 28-day period would be counted from that person\u2019s exit from isolation,\u201d a department spokeswoman told AAP.</p> \n  <p>That means when director general of health <strong>Ashley Bloomfield </strong>holds his regular daily briefing on 15 June \u2013 28 days from 18 May\u2013 he will be able to say New Zealand has eliminated Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Of course, a subsequent discovery of another case of community transmission would restart the clock towards the elimination milestone.</p> \n  <p>The date has symbolic meaning but Bloomfield said it wouldn\u2019t stop the government\u2019s ongoing work to prevent new cases.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cElimination is an ongoing process,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt may well be there is no domestic onshore transmission or onshore infections of Covid-19. It would be great if we reached that point and it\u2019s increasingly looking like we are.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut our elimination strategy is ongoing because we clearly still have measures at the border and a desire to open up the border in a safe way.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf534f9bbe3cabf72871ef62ae131caae1e83ccd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf534f9bbe3cabf72871ef62ae131caae1e83ccd/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health and safety signage at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health and safety signage at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T02:13:40.762Z\">at 3.13am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8509d8f082107f453a5ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T01:39:23.296Z\">2.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services is also not thrilled with the homebuilder program:</p> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Service rejects the federal government\u2019s plan to provide large grants to home builders and renovators as a wasted opportunity to address the backlog of urgent social housing repairs and the shortfall in social housing stock. </p> \n  <p>Australian Council of Social Service CEO Dr <strong>Cassandra Goldie </strong>said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no argument that the construction sector needs a shot in the arm, but this money will not go where it is most needed.

The fall follows a rise of 8.5% in March 2020. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cCovid-19 continued to affect retail trade in April with many retail businesses closing their physical stores during April due to restrictions relating to social distancing,\u201d said <strong>Ben James</strong>, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThere were record falls in cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services (-35.4%), and clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-53.6%), as well as a large fall in department stores (-14.9%).\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Food retailing (-17.4%) led the falls in dollar terms this month following unprecedented demand in March. Spending in food retailing remains 5.1% above the level of April 2019, likely reflecting additional meals being consumed at home during April 2020. Other retailing (-14.4%) fell after a large rise in March, while household goods retailing (-0.1%) saw a minor fall in sales as falls from closures of some physical stores were offset by a rise in hardware, building and garden supply retailing. <br></p> \n  <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, there were falls in Victoria (-21.1%), New South Wales (-17.5%), Queensland (-15.7%), Western Australia (-16.8%), South Australia (-14.6%, Tasmania (-17.5%), the Australian Capital Territory (-14.9%), and the Northern Territory (-7.7%) in April 2020. <br></p> \n  <p>The closure of physical stores in some industries led to a rise in online retail turnover, which contributed 11.1% to total retail turnover in original terms in April 2020, up from 7.1% in March 2020. In April 2019, online retail turnover contributed 5.7% to total retail.

Yet, because there is little or no sunshine, this glow comes from the indoor lighting. There is an odd moment when Gatsby sits down at a baby grand piano to play a song (the Sinatra standard Everything Happens to Me) and he actually pauses beforehand to switch on a standard lamp, just to get a semi-circle of that all-important musty, orangey light, which spreads its airless pall everywhere.

Mum was patient and took great pains to make sure I knew that I could be whatever I set my mind to. In this way<strong> Amazing Grace by Mary Hoffman,</strong> illustrated by Caroline Binch, is no different. Grace, too, has a family that tell her she can be anything, absolutely loves reading and enjoys dressing up as her favourite book characters at home. So when a boy at school tells her she can\u2019t be Peter Pan because she\u2019s black, we witness one of Grace\u2019s first encounters with racism. We also see the conversation that so many black families have with their children, one that attempts to explain and prepare them for the prejudices they\u2019ll encounter. What I love about Amazing Grace is that it not only shows us that Grace can (of course) be Peter Pan, but makes us question where and when racist thoughts begin and who teaches us them.</p> <p>Through history there has been a systematic and deliberate approach to the promotion of racist ideas. Working through such a history can be overwhelming, and knowing where to turn to for legitimate accounts can be hard. <strong>Jason Reynolds</strong> is a master when it comes to speaking to young people, he doesn\u2019t sugar coat the truth or ever talk down to his reader, instead meeting them where they are. <strong>Stamped: Racism, Antiracism and You</strong> is the perfect place to direct our children.

The only country to supersede this index of misery \u2013 fatefully \u2013 was Germany.</p> <p>And yet there are features of that awful time that have disturbing parallels to now. Firstly, there were structural problems in our economy pre-existing the onset of external disaster. Before the last election, statistics were sounding loud alarms about instabilities fomented by government policy inaction. A year ago there was already <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/finance/finance-news/2019/03/07/retail-sales-flatline/\">a retail slump</a>, attributed to ongoing low wage growth.

Because the second sad parallel of the Depression-era past to now is that Australia has a government ideologically ill-equipped to manage the crisis.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s the Liberal-Nationals\u2019 committed neoliberal policy habit of low-wage labour exploitation that has eroded spending capacity within the economy.

The Liberal leadership have realised that only the application of Depression-ending Keynesian economic strategies can ameliorate their vulnerable political situation. They\u2019re trying to glean economic concepts and grab some policy ideas from McManus and the unions because they cannot risk elevating and vindicating parliamentary Labor\u2019s own Keynesians in the public policy conversation. Nor can the Liberals do nothing \u2013 they\u2019d just cede an economic leadership platform to Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese.</p> <p>This was the framework that informed the creation of jobkeeper \u2013 the income subsidy that originated from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/casual-and-migrant-workers-are-at-the-mercy-of-an-economy-that-punishes-its-victims\">explicit union demands</a>.

Authorities had declared martial law on 20 May, to stamp out the weeks of marches, sit-ins and hunger strikes led by students who had inspired sympathy and support across the country. Troops had tried to move into the capital where they were blocked by civilians.

  "<p>During the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the United States and Britain, a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/convincing-boomer-parents-to-take-the-coronavirus-seriously\">flurry</a> of media commentary centred around issues of generational difference in response to the pandemic. \u201cBoomer\u201d parents, although at heightened risk of deadly complications from contracting Covid-19, were apparently not taking the virus seriously enough. They flouted social distancing measures in favour of bridge games and cruise trips. The young, it seemed, were the adults in the room, begging for seriousness from their at-risk elders.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the most part, these stories were media <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/epgkb7/if-your-aging-parents-are-ignoring-coronavirus-risks-youre-not-alone\">trend</a> pieces and glossed anecdotes drenched in unspoken class assumptions. These reckless parents in their 60s and 70s had accrued enough capital to be cruise-tripping and golfing; they owned the homes where they should have been sheltering. And, as it turns out, the narrative of \u201cunserious boomers\u201d and \u201ccautious millennials\u201d obscured more than it revealed. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-baby-boomers.html\">reported</a> that a higher percentage of Americans born between 1946 and 1964 were practising social distancing than people born after 1980. Not to mention that many thousands of older essential workers, from nurses to supermarket workers, were left out of this tale of generational difference and indifference.</p> <p>There\u2019s an understandable appetite for generational analysis during this pandemic. The risk of dying from the virus is primarily determined along age lines, while most workers under 40, already shut out of capital ownership, face mass unemployment and an economic depression with little financial insulation. Yet the story of medically imperilled boomers and economically imperilled millennials, while largely valid, ignores the cross-generational divisions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/curse-poverty-coronavirus\">class</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/americas-racial-contract-showing/611389/\">racialised inequality</a> this pandemic has exposed and exacerbated.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/young-peoples-mental-health-hit-by-coronavirus-uk-poll\">UK poll finds young people's mental health hit by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We can argue about whether younger or older generations will suffer more and in what ways. Or we can recognise that our economic and political reality, forged in the service of capital, is incompatible with human flourishing for all but the wealthy. This reckoning need not pit the old against the young, but it will require a long overdue undressing of the economic ideology that defined the baby boomer generation and its legacy.</p> <p>Namely, that with a decent enough education, and by obtaining the necessary skills to produce value for a boss, you were ensured a materially secure future. This was already a boomer myth; in pandemic times, it\u2019s a cruel joke. Intergenerational solidarity during this crisis requires challenging the very value system that defined boomers and millennials as meaningfully distinct generations in the first place.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his 2017 book, Kids These Days: Human Capital and The Making of Millennials, the author Malcolm Harris defines millennials according to the material conditions that have defined the post-1980s decades in which they came of age. That is, a world where we were taught to accrue, indeed to become, \u201chuman capital\u201d, turning ourselves into walking investments in our future capacity to earn and produce value. While wages have stagnated in recent decades, even some of the most privileged young people have taken on unprecedented amounts of student debt to chase the promise of a sustainable future available to a vanishingly small number of people.&nbsp;</p> <p>These conditions apply as much to millennials as they do to members of so-called Generation Z. While the affective experiences of current teenagers differ to those of early millennials, we\u2019re in the same boat when it comes to the imperative of becoming human capital. \u201cAs it turns out,\u201d wrote Harris, \u201cjust because you can produce an unprecedented amount of value doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can feed yourself under twenty-first-century American capitalism.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This should not be surprising: that capitalism depends on human life as exploitable labour is a feature, not a bug. The boomer experience of postwar wealth and full employment on a living wage was the exception to the rule, which is nonetheless touted as proof of capitalism\u2019s ability to deliver a dignified life to workers. The pandemic and its attendant economic crisis are now exposing the horrifying stakes involved when life is reconfigured wholly in market terms. </p> <p>In late May, White House adviser Kevin Hassett <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2020/05/human-capital-stock-kevin-hassett-coronavirus.html\">cheerfully told CNN</a>, \u201cOur human capital stock is ready to go back to work.\u201d Everyone from 40-year-olds to teenagers were sold a promise that we were to accrue \u201chuman capital\u201d as an investment on returns for our own futures. But that promise was a myth. The capital was never ours. As Harris told me, in response to Hassett\u2019s comment, \u201cThat\u2019s giving away the game right there, admitting that human capital is something for capitalists and states to control and exploit, not a \u2018company of the self\u2019 that each worker has, which is what they\u2019ve been telling us it is for years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuman capital stock\u201d refers to the workers across generations who are being pushed back to work during a health crisis in order to produce more value for asset holders. It\u2019s a dystopian scenario that offers up poor, older workers \u2013 especially workers of colour \u2013 as a blood sacrifice as readily as any millennial or younger slice of \u201chuman capital\u201d.</p> <p>To be sure: it does not need to be this way. American billionaires have grown $434bn <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/american-billionaires-richer-since-coronavirus-pandemic-began\">richer</a> since the beginning of the pandemic. There are more than enough resources to go around. But the exposure of capitalism\u2019s brutal incompatibility with human and non-human flourishing is hardly new. It would be naive to presume that the highly visible unequal suffering caused by the pandemic will force a revaluation of values.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/boris-johnson-urged-to-publish-bame-covid-19-review-immediately\">Boris Johnson urged to publish BAME Covid-19 review immediately</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the same time, in the midst of this crisis, we\u2019re seeing what resistance looks like. Across the US and the UK, mutual aid networks have sprung up where young and able-bodied people are providing food and medical necessities to their elderly and infirm neighbours. These networks of mutual aid and community care are hardly thorns in the side of capital; for now, they fill gaps where the state and market are failing. But at their best, they transcend the ethos of charity and recognise how our current system designates certain lives as disposable, while organising towards liberation from within that system. The youth of the Navajo Nation, which spans four US states, have <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/26/navajo-nation-covid-19-youth-response-elders-health/\">self-organised</a> to provide for their elders as their communities are devastated by the pandemic and government neglect. This is life-affirming resistance in the face of an unbroken history of state violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The same can and should be said of the current wave of bold <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/30/21275507/minneapolis-george-floyd-protests-police-violence\">uprisings</a> across nearly every city in the US following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. The protests have shown a righteous anger and resolve that speaks to far greater needs and demands than the indictment of individual killer police officers. This movement is led by young people but informed by generations of black liberation struggle, responding to centuries of oppression. The battle to abolish the racist status quo has supporters of all ages, who share the urgent desire to see the old world die.&nbsp;</p> <p>If the pandemic has crystallised generational antagonisms along class lines, the space for intergenerational solidarity has been, as ever, created by the victims of our racist, capitalist society. We are now witnessing the sort of intergenerational and communal work through which we might begin to value ourselves and each other in new ways: more human than human capital.</p> <p>\u2022 Natasha Lennard is a contributing writer for the Intercept and the author of Being Numerous: Essays on Non-Fascist Life</p>",
  "<p>I first photographed Nirvana in 1992 for Rolling Stone magazine in the midst of the band\u2019s world tour for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/06/kirk-weddle-best-photograph-nirvana-nevermind-swimming-baby\">Nevermind</a>, their breakthrough album. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain\">Kurt Cobain</a> had something of a reputation, and the day before the shoot I asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/16/dave-grohl-i-never-imagined-myself-to-be-freddie-mercury\">Dave Grohl</a> [the band\u2019s drummer] and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/05/krist-novoselic-nirvana-emp-exhibition\">Krist Novoselic</a> [bass] if they would be so kind as to ask Kurt to wear a T-shirt without writing or slogans on it.&nbsp;</p> <p>The next day, the guys arrived for the shoot laughing. Kurt was in sunglasses, with a sweater all buttoned up. When he took it off, it turned out he was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nirvana-cover.jpg?w=250\">Corporate Magazines Still Suck</a>.\u201d Thankfully, Rolling Stone saw the humour in it and ran it on the cover.&nbsp;</p> <p>This photo came about in October 1993, when the band were touring the US after the release of the album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/31/nirvana-dave-grohl-krist-novoselic-in-utero\">In Utero</a>. Kurt remembered our previous shoot, and I think he was grateful that we hadn\u2019t tried to interfere. The shoot took place in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It was pretty smooth sailing, I think because we already had that bond.&nbsp;My sister helped me to order the dolls\u2019 heads from New York, and we arranged them on an altar with rose bushes I\u2019d picked up from a florist and left to wilt. The image was intended to be surreal \u2013 more of a still life than a portrait \u2013 but Kurt got it, and the band were really enthusiastic about the concept.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I only photographed him twice, but I always found him so generous and gentle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I tried variations with the whole band, but nothing worked quite so well as Kurt alone. There was something about him that pulled the image together. There was such intensity in his eyes and beauty in his face \u2013 even with the wear and tear of the road and the physical pain he had gone through.</p> <p>Great photography is not about lighting or technical stuff: it\u2019s about how to engage your subjects. Having your picture taken isn\u2019t necessarily easy, and in many ways it\u2019s very unnatural to sit in front of the camera. But you need your subject to trust you in what is, frankly, quite a weird experience. That connection is essential to your work.</p> <p>He was quiet, but things seemed to be going pretty darn well for him at the time. He had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/09/frances-bean-cobain-i-dont-really-like-nirvana-that-much\">his daughter</a> with him, and the tour was in full force. I was in total shock when I heard the news six months later that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1994/apr/09/obituaries.adamsweeting\">he had passed</a>. I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. But I don\u2019t think this image needs to be seen with a sense of foreboding. If anything, there\u2019s something life-affirming about where he\u2019s at, even if the framing is grotesque. It\u2019s overwhelmingly about the beauty of him as a man. I only photographed him twice, but I always found him generous and gentle.</p> <p>Shooting Nirvana taught me that sometimes it\u2019s better to allow the artist to direct where it\u2019s going to go. It doesn\u2019t have to be the photographer. And I think it distilled what this work is about for me: trying to interpret as closely as I can who my subject is, while at the same time staying loyal to my point of view. Marrying those two things is always the starting point.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nirvana changed modern music. Those transitions don\u2019t happen very often. They were as important as any musicians in the last century. Even now, when I have a conversation with a young person who wasn\u2019t alive during their years of stardom, they will know Nirvana and the various images of them. It\u2019s like the Stones, the Beatles, or Elvis Presley \u2013 they\u2019re milestones in culture.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This shot is on sale as part of an online <a href=\"https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/radart4aid/lots/1768?PID=en_hp_carousel_1\">auction in aid of charities combatting Covid-19</a> (bids close on </em><em>12 June</em><em>)</em><em>, organised by Christie\u2019s, </em><em>RAD (Red Carpet Advocacy)</em><em> and </em><em>Mark Seliger Studio</em>.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Mark Seliger\u2019s CV</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"748029e9f0ed58dea99c617b4b60fcef823a71bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/748029e9f0ed58dea99c617b4b60fcef823a71bd/0_119_1125_1381/815.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Seliger\" width=\"815\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Mark Seliger\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>Amarillo, Texas, 1959.</p> <p><strong>Trained:</strong> Houston\u2019s High School for Performing and Visual Arts and East Texas State University</p> <p><strong>Influences:</strong> \u201cMy 10th-grade teacher Don Lawson and my portrait and documentary teacher James Newberry.\u201d</p> <p><strong>High point: </strong>\u201cMaking my first book, <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/When-They-Came-to-Take-My-Father/Mark-Seliger/9781611455021\">When They Came </a><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/When-They-Came-to-Take-My-Father/Mark-Seliger/9781611455021\">to Take My Father</a>: Voices of the Holocaust, on a subject matter that was personal and unedited.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> \u201cAs far as I know I haven\u2019t had any \u2013 but I\u2019m open to suggestions.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Top tip:</strong> \u201cThere is no room in the middle and plenty of room on the top.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When we first spoke, in mid-April, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Due\u00f1as began weeping within seconds. Her parents\u2019 home town, Santo Domingo de La Calzada, had the worst death rate from coronavirus in Spain, she told me on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d she said. Due\u00f1as told stories of police clambering through windows to rescue the dying, who were too weak to open their doors. Regional politicians, meanwhile, refused to give town-by-town figures for the dead, stoking anxiety and encouraging conspiracy theories. Santo Domingo\u2019s locked-down residents, she claimed, were being deliberately kept in the dark as the virus silently stalked the town.</p> <p>Due\u00f1as does not live in Santo Domingo, a town of 6,300 people set among patchwork fields of cereal crops in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja. She was born there, but now lives 28 miles away in Logro\u00f1o, the capital of this wealthy region, best known for the rich red wines that bear its name. Her angry, sometimes wildly conspiratorial outbursts on local Facebook groups \u2013 some of which have been deleted against her will \u2013 mean not all her old neighbours will welcome her back.</p> <p>If Covid-19 increases tensions among neighbours in big cities, it can produce poisonous outbreaks of mistrust in small, more insular places like Santo Domingo. By the time Due\u00f1as and I spoke again, two weeks later, the abbot from the town\u2019s small cathedral had lodged a complaint against her for defamation. (She had claimed the church was covering up the role it had played in spreading the virus.) Even members of her own family were livid at the way she had aired Santo Domingo\u2019s sorry status as one of Spain\u2019s worst Covid-19 disaster zones.</p> <p>Due\u00f1as suggested I call Jorge S\u00e1nchez, a former town councillor and a well-known local figure, to get a sense of the scale of the disaster. On 9 March, he had met with a couple of friends, Enrique Ortega and Aldo Muga, at Muga\u2019s bar. They had chatted about Ortega\u2019s upcoming 51st birthday. \u201cNow I am the only one left alive,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told me. All three caught the disease, and the other two men both died at a hospital in Logro\u00f1o on 21 March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/spain-zip/giv-3902teJKzF4TU1mt/\" data-alt=\"map of Spain and La Rioja region\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/spain-zip/giv-3902teJKzF4TU1mt/\">map of Spain and La Rioja region</a> </figure>  <p>As news spread through town that I was trying to count the dead, I received a call from town councillor Diego Mendiola. He confirmed that regional officials were refusing to give precise figures for Covid-19 deaths in Santo Domingo. All that residents could do was try to keep a tally. While we spoke, Mendiola stopped to read an incoming WhatsApp message. \u201cThat\u2019s another one,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In recent months, television pictures have shown us the empty streets of the world\u2019s great metropolises \u2013 of Madrid, London, New York, Milan. All have suffered badly. But outside the confined spaces of care homes and cruise ships, Covid-19 has been at its most lethal in a handful of southern European country towns. In Santo Domingo, without sufficient data from the regional government, it has fallen to residents to make their own estimates. Based on the number of messages he has received from parishioners asking for deceased loved ones to be mentioned in mass, the abbot, Francisco Su\u00e1rez, now believes 42 people died in the six weeks after 16 March. It is impossible to know exactly how many were killed by Covid-19, as opposed to other causes, but a reasonable, possibly conservative, estimate \u2013 based on multiple sources including newspaper death columns, funeral home websites and interviews with the head of the region\u2019s local health districts \u2013 would be 35.</p> <p>That may not sound like much in the context of a pandemic, but to get a sense of how shocking this figure is, it\u2019s worth comparing it to the death rate in the world\u2019s worst-affected major cities. London had 86 deaths per <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19bylocalareasanddeprivation/deathsoccurringbetween1marchand17april\" title=\"\">100,000 by mid-April</a> (and is now likely past 100), the Madrid region was at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1110955/deaths-from-covid-19-disease-per-100-000-people-by-region-spain/\" title=\"\">131 in mid-May</a>, and New York City <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109867/coronavirus-death-rates-by-age-new-york-city/\" title=\"\">is currently 201</a>. The equivalent figure for Santo Domingo would be 550. Only the northern Italian province of Bergamo has experienced something similar. Towns such as San Pellegrino Terme and San Giovanni Bianco have the highest death rates of all, at around or above 1,000 per 100,000 from all causes during the worst weeks. \u201cThe pain becomes communal, precisely because, in these small places, everyone knows everyone,\u201d Vittorio Milesi, the mayor of San Pellegrino Terme, told me.</p> <p>It is easy for city folk to dream of escaping to the countryside, as they seek safe hideaways from close physical contact or the claustrophobia of a locked-down city apartment. Viewed through this lens, rural towns seem like the bucolic, Zoom-connected work centres of the future. I understand how tempting it is to slip into such reveries. During Spain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, I have been living near Candeleda, a town in the province of \u00c1vila, 100 miles west of Madrid and similar in size to Santo Domingo. I have enjoyed mountain views, flowering meadows and pure, fresh air. But I am also now familiar with the eerie experience of isolation within a normally tight-knit community. City friends are envious. In some ways they are right to be, but in others they are decidedly wrong. Nobody is safe from a global pandemic. Santo Domingo is proof of that.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Few countries have suffered as badly as Spain from Covid-19. In per-capita terms, it is believed to have the world\u2019s highest rate of deaths, according to a study of excess deaths from all causes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0?shareType=nongift\">by the Financial Times</a> \u2013 though Britain may soon overtake it. Some critics of Spain\u2019s leftwing coalition government have blamed the severity of the outbreak, in part, on the failure to cancel celebrations for International Women\u2019s Day on Sunday 8 March. Across Spain, at the end of a week that had seen the first coronavirus deaths reported in Madrid, the Basque country and Valencia, several million people took to the streets. Populists such as the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/wolf-pack-case-spain-feminism-far-right-vox\" title=\"\"> far-right party Vox</a> have accused prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of putting feminist politics above public health, but Vox also held a mass meeting at a Madrid bullring that day. The truth is that few politicians took the threat of Covid-19 sufficiently seriously at first, and while some scientists were warning of impending danger, most people in Spain did not realise that the dramatic explosion of cases that began a few weeks before in Italy was just about to happen here as well.</p> <p>In Santo Domingo, there were already clues about what was to come. On 8 March, two elderly inhabitants, Mar\u00eda Isabel Aizpur\u00faa and Valent\u00edn P\u00e9rez, passed away \u2013 part of an unusual five-day spike in deaths. In that short period, six people died, seven times higher than could usually be expected in that time period. It\u2019s possible that Covid-19 had claimed lives in the town even before then. Two deaths recorded earlier in the month now look suspicious, though it\u2019s impossible to know the cause for certain. \u201cThe dead weren\u2019t being tested,\u201d said a doctor who dealt with some of them, but asked not to be named. \u201cSo who knows?\u201d</p> <p>When Jorge S\u00e1nchez, the former town councillor, tested positive for Covid-19 on 10 March, he posted a video online telling everyone. It was, he said, a way of trying to wake the town up to what was happening, and of combating the stigma associated with the disease. \u201cPeople were treating it as something shameful,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"211a2d49c85698a5a16adc1ce28e5833952977af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211a2d49c85698a5a16adc1ce28e5833952977af/0_430_4625_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaza del Santo and the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plaza del Santo and the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Heusinkveld/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Santo Domingo lies on the famous pilgrim trail, the Camino de Santiago, which brings tens of thousands of international visitors through its cobbled streets and pebbled squares each year. Close to the centre of town, a stone\u2019s throw from the cathedral, is the town\u2019s only care home, the Hospital del Santo. On 11 March, doctors, nurses and family members \u2013 equipped with masks but little else to protect them \u2013 bustled around one of the home\u2019s ailing residents, 85-year-old Rosa Andr\u00e9s Rodrigo, in the hours before she died. She showed what we now see as classic Covid symptoms \u2013 a fever and shortness of breath \u2013 but which could also come from a winter flu. She died so quickly that there wasn\u2019t time to find out. \u201cAt that stage, we still didn\u2019t know,\u201d the care home manager, Sagrario Loza, told me, \u201cI myself was in there with just a mask on.\u201d</p> <p>Within a week, many of those who had tended to Rosa had contracted the coronavirus, including the care home\u2019s main doctor. \u201cShe was so weak she couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d Cristina D\u00edaz, a pharmacist from a nearby village, who took meals to the doctor\u2019s house, told me. Like many care home workers, the doctor was on a short-term contract and low pay. (Take-home pay for Spanish care home doctors is around \u20ac1,600 per month, and just \u20ac1,400 for nurses.) When the doctor finally got better, her contract had already ended, so she took a job elsewhere. Soon almost half of the care home staff were ill as well.</p> <p>On 14 March, when S\u00e1nchez imposed a nationwide lockdown, he held up the country\u2019s elderly as a reason for acting, reminding Spaniards that it was the pension money of parents and grandparents that had prevented many families falling into destitution during the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cIn this crisis, they are the ones who need to be helped,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Santo Domingo, people were only slowly registering the speed at which the disease was spreading. On 17 March, a group of elderly Hospital del Santo residents sat around a table, dipping brushes into brightly coloured paints to make a rainbow poster with a reassuring message. \u201cWe are all fine,\u201d it read. They hung the poster from a balcony and sent a photograph to <a href=\"https://www.larioja.com/la-rioja/coronavirus/fundacion-hospital-santo-20200406152737-nt.html?ref=https:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\" title=\"\">La Rioja newspaper</a>.</p> <p>A week later, with care home deaths rising across Spain, a team from the military emergency unit \u2013 wearing white, hood-to-toe protection suits \u2013 were sent to inspect the Hospital del Santo. They helped to reorganise the centre into different zones, and returned daily to teach staff safety protocols, disinfect corridors and clean out the rooms of the dead. \u201cTheir work was tremendously important to us,\u201d Loza told me. Tests eventually showed 37 of the 65 residents \u2013 including five elderly nuns, living in their own wing \u2013 had Covid-19. Remarkably, most survived. Loza says there were five confirmed Covid-19 deaths, and suspects the disease was responsible for four more. \u201cWe can\u2019t say when it started,\u201d she said. Elsewhere in the country, military units <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52014023\" title=\"\">were discovering</a> care home residents \u201ccompletely abandoned, sometimes even dead in their beds\u201d, the defence minister Margarita Robles told reporters. In Madrid, almost one in seven care home residents has died \u2013 nearly 6,000 people, according to state broadcaster RTVE.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f077afc29c8817fb6cdaa1e5e2b4975ba30925a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f077afc29c8817fb6cdaa1e5e2b4975ba30925a/0_0_3648_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (centre) and colleagues observing a minute\u2019s silence at the start of Spain\u2019s 10 days of national mourning, 27 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (centre) and colleagues observing a minute\u2019s silence at the start of Spain\u2019s 10 days of national mourning, 27 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Calvo/LA MONCLOA/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spain\u2019s health services are run by its 17 regional governments, which have each handled the pandemic in their own way \u2013 some choosing to release detailed data, others withholding it. La Rioja is a semi-autonomous region, with a population of just 315,000 and one of the highest living standards in Spain. Between March and late May, it recorded 4,052 cases and 361 deaths, making it Spain\u2019s third-worst region in per-capita terms, but the regional government has refused to produce a town-by-town breakdown of deaths \u2013 a stance that has encouraged people such as Due\u00f1as to see a conspiracy of silence. At daily press briefings in Logro\u00f1o on 21 and 22 March, questions from La Rioja newspaper about Santo Domingo were batted away, even as evidence was mounting that the town was suffering a particularly severe outbreak of Covid-19. \u201cThe government\u2019s spokeswoman, Chus del R\u00edo, basically answered that there was no point in talking about individual local outbreaks because the whole of La Rioja was affected,\u201d the newspaper reported.</p> <p>On the town\u2019s main Facebook group, which began life as a place to post fond childhood memories of schoolteachers, shopkeepers, nuns and priests, there was outrage. Why weren\u2019t they being told? How many had really died? \u201cDo they think we are stupid? We live here, we can all see what is happening,\u201d complained one group member. A spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s regional government told me that the decision not to give details from specific towns was to prevent them being stigmatised. But withholding information also prevented more searching questions about exactly why Santo Domingo was suffering so badly \u2013 and whether more could be done to save its residents.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lockdown has meant different things in different places. Spain\u2019s has been among the strictest, and was no less strictly observed in the countryside than in cities. Outdoor exercise was banned and children under the age of 13 were not allowed to leave home for 45 days. Some Spaniards embraced the restrictions with <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-lockdown-snitches-thrive-in-europe-reports-watchmen-spying-neighbors/\" title=\"\">inquisitorial fervour</a>. The media began using the phrase \u201cbalcony police\u201d to describe people who hurled insults at passersby who seemed to be breaking lockdown rules. In Madrid, even medical staff on their way to work were sometimes pelted with eggs. This was not just a city thing. In Santo Domingo, too, people complained about the zeal of these \u201cwindow cops\u201d. In some rural towns, including both Santo Domingo and Candeleda where I\u2019m living, the lockdown was enforced not only by residents and police, but also army patrol units.</p> <p>Rural lockdown has certain advantages. In Candeleda, in mid-March, I had a conversation \u2013 shouted from one field to another \u2013 with a neighbour who was counting his cattle. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be alright here,\u201d he roared. \u201cIf necessary, we can just kill a pig or barter our vegetables.\u201d Rural subsistence was suddenly an advantage, and people knew it. As weeks went by, I watched wild flowers paint the valley with streaks of red, yellow and purple. I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/boar-wars-how-wild-hogs-are-trashing-european-cities\" title=\"\">wild boar</a> and otters scurry through fields occupied by sheep, cattle and horses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b7cfb23c0260864ba83e5794661073dd83fc267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7cfb23c0260864ba83e5794661073dd83fc267/0_0_4340_2878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago, which runs through Santo Domingo de la Calzada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago, which runs through Santo Domingo de la Calzada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this was no idyll. The internet kept me, and the rest of the town, hooked on the minute-by-minute narrative of death. There were still loved ones to fret about. The countryside was strangely still and hushed. There were no clanking tractors, petrol-powered bush-cutters, jangling goat bells, braying mules or cussing herdsmen. Most of the local farmers live in town, and could only leave to feed livestock. I even missed things that normally bothered me. Distant traffic and overhead flights \u2013 tiny pinpricks of moving light in the night sky \u2013 disappeared. I was too far away from town to share the evening applause for health workers that boosted morale and upheld the sense of community.</p> <p>Just like in cities, loneliness hit people hard. My closest neighbour, Santi, is a self-sufficient countryman in his mid-70s. He moved in near to me a decade ago, doing up his small barn. Santi is a man who needs to talk. Before lockdown, most days he would have coffee at the petrol station cafe and, later, take a walk up the river with friends. Now these were forbidden. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak, you start forgetting how,\u201d he said after finding another reason to appear at my gate. Sometimes he sat on a nearby rock for an hour, waiting for some company.</p> <p>Santi has a fine sense of humour and I was grateful for his easy laugh, even as I fretted about how far a virus might travel on the wind. Whenever we spoke of someone dying, he shrugged. \u201cPeople have always died,\u201d he said. But his health isn\u2019t good and he was also scared. On his visits into town, the grocer and baker made him stay in his car while they put his food in the boot. There was no chatting. Isolation is isolation, wherever you are.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In Santo Domingo de La Calzada, the dead included Gregorio S\u00e1ez, a well-known figure in a town where the Catholic church plays a central role. The 83-year-old was prior of the lay Brotherhood of Saint Isidore the Farmer, which parades an image of their saint around town during its May fiestas. Santo Domingo\u2019s five brotherhoods, or cofrad\u00edas, are an essential part of local life. Some date back almost to the town\u2019s founding by the 11th century shepherd-hermit, Saint Dominic of the Causeway, after whom the town is named.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot understand Santo Domingo without its saint,\u201d Francisco Su\u00e1rez, the cathedral\u2019s abbot, told me. In his lifetime, the saint helped to build bridges, roads and shelter for pilgrims travelling to the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, about 300 miles west. (Santo Domingo is patron saint of Spain\u2019s civil engineers.) Work on Santo Domingo\u2019s cathedral began in the 12th century, and the town has been a stopping point for pilgrims ever since. Today, much of the local economy revolves around the dozen hostels and hotels that offer hundreds of rooms to pilgrims.</p> <p>Such towns are not used to tragedy. In normal times, the most dramatic events that local reporter Javier Albo, a one-man newsroom, covers are minor car crashes. Skimming through La Rioja\u2019s local pages from March and April 2019, the most noteworthy stories concerned a modest swarm of bees and a few complaints about a \u201cplague\u201d of pigeons invading the town.</p> <p>During the strictest phase of lockdown, residents of Santo Domingo tried to keep up their spirits. The police began driving around town in the evening and stopping every few blocks to blast music from their loudhailers and exchange applause with people on balconies. This ritual was briefly suspended after complaints that it was unsuitable at a time of tragedy, but soon it started up again. People loved the shows, which filled the emptiness with noise and coloured lights. Eventually, it turned into a caravan of municipal police cars, ambulances, civil protection and street-cleaning vehicles, which set out at 8pm and drove around for two hours with sirens blaring and loud music mangled by tinny speakers. Like any party, the music depended on who took control of the sound system: some days it was corny Spanish pop or children\u2019s tunes, other days it was AC/DC.</p> <p>\u201cPeople started asking if we could do something for their kids\u2019 birthdays, so we did that too \u2013 playing Happy Birthday,\u201d Francisco Reina, one of the town\u2019s dozen municipal cops told me. \u201cThen a local baker offered to make them cakes, so we delivered those. We even got out and danced La Macarena.\u201d Reina kept going even after his wife joined the sick and took to her bed. \u201cWe surprised one couple on their golden anniversary, playing the wedding march,\u201d he said. \u201cThat man wept.\u201d Now the police station is full of brightly painted children\u2019s pictures, sent in thanks.</p> <p>The only visible signs of the pandemic scything its way through the town were the muted to-and-fro of ambulances and hearses making daytime trips down empty streets to collect the infected and the dead. Reina and his colleagues rescued the very sick from apartments, helped ambulance crews, and took food to those who couldn\u2019t shop. There was also anger. Posters appeared in windows and on balconies. \u201cWe want tests,\u201d they read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bad010d36cbab28e06a548a9e5619f75412c4c5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bad010d36cbab28e06a548a9e5619f75412c4c5e/0_88_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in Logro\u00f1o, the regional capital of La Rioja, protesting against the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus pandemic, May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Logro\u00f1o, the regional capital of La Rioja, protesting against the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus pandemic, May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raquel Manzanares/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most disturbing thing was that Santo Domingo could not mourn its dead. In a small town like this, packed with relatives, friends and acquaintances, hundreds may be expected at the velatorio \u2013 the 24-hour wake with the body on display \u2013 or the later funeral mass. A local group called I Like Santo Domingo lobbied for the cathedral bells, which are housed in their own baroque tower, to be rung in honour of the dead. On the evening of 22 March they chimed solemnly for two minutes as people stood silently at windows or on balconies \u2013 a tradition repeated every Monday over the following weeks. It was, at least, a communal mourning. \u201cThat was really important to the families,\u201d said the journalist Albo, who doubles as the group\u2019s president. \u201cAt least they felt that people were supporting them in their grief.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, the pandemic was measured in absences. It wasn\u2019t just that the streets were empty and the pilgrims gone, or that the dead were being carried off. Easter went by without its processions of religious statues. The Virgin Mary and the Risen Christ remained on their pedestals in the cathedral. The weeping notes of a trumpet saeta, an Easter tradition that once inspired a Miles Davis recording, had to be performed from the soloist\u2019s apartment balcony.</p> <p>On 10 May, the town began five days of fiestas to honour its saint. The following day, as those parts of Spain where infection rates had dropped were allowed to slowly ease restrictions, people were finally released from their houses. The only group event permitted in this still-limited first phase, however, was mass. The cathedral\u2019s wooden benches were replaced with plastic chairs, dotted at safe distances. After a trial run on 11 May, with just 17 people, seven masses were held the following day. Between each service, the cathedral was disinfected.</p> <p>The highlight of the fiestas is the spectacular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/may/14/the-20-photographs-of-the-week#img-13\" title=\"\">procession of the Doncellas</a>, when three dozen young women in long white dresses and veils carry baskets of bread covered with white linen on their heads. Like everything else, this was cancelled. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do it later in the year,\u201d the abbot told me. Not since 1943, when the town suffered a typhus outbreak, had anything similar happened.</p> <p>But, with neighbouring towns suffering much less, some people had a burning question: where had the virus come from?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Given religion\u2019s central role in Santo Domingo de la Calzada, it is not surprising that some blamed the church. On 17 February, a group of 46 parishioners had set out by coach to visit Rome and Florence. They took a bottle of rioja wine for Pope Francis and, after meeting the Vatican official Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, came back with the promise of plenary indulgence for visitors to Saint Dominic\u2019s tomb over the next seven years. The measure, which remits the need to purge sins and thereby avoid tortures in purgatory, was a way of prolonging the 2019 celebrations for the saint\u2019s 1,000th birthday.</p> <p>Did the parishioners also bring back the virus? Italy, after all, is where Covid-19 began its rampage across Europe, and the group returned via northern Italy on 22 February, just as the first cases were being reported there. Many people in Santo Domingo, including one of the local doctors I spoke to, assume the virus came with them. Due\u00f1as has been the most vocal accuser. \u201cOf course they brought it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the church is too powerful to criticise.\u201d</p> <p>Abbot Su\u00e1rez, who led the trip, is incensed by the accusation that his group is responsible for bringing the disease to Santo Domingo. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete lie. The most stupid thing anybody could say,\u201d he told me. He noted that only one of the group \u2013 the prior of the Saint Isidore brotherhood, Gregorio Saez \u2013 had died of Covid-19, \u201cand the family think he caught it in hospital\u201d.</p> <p>Blame and stigma were part of La Rioja\u2019s experience of the pandemic from the very start. The region\u2019s first recorded cases, in the wine town of Haro, 12 miles north of Santo Domingo, appeared among members of its Roma community, who have been made into scapegoats many times in Spanish history. On 24 February, community members attended a funeral in the Basque city of Vitoria, which became one of Spain\u2019s first known contagion points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41a9c98a8de9c5e7463d633d923be6042012aaf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a9c98a8de9c5e7463d633d923be6042012aaf0/0_0_4225_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty streets in Haro, another small town near Santo Domingo, in early March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empty streets in Haro, another small town near Santo Domingo, in early March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ander Gillenea/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The civil guard\u2019s toughest unit \u2013 the Logro\u00f1o-based rapid action group \u2013 was sent to Haro to hand out quarantine notices to those who had been there. Conservative media published false tales of virus-carrying Roma from Haro sneaking out of hospitals. Local websites and newspapers even published names and medical records of those allegedly infected. \u201cA lot of lies were told, and people were bombarded with threatening messages,\u201d Silvia Ag\u00fcero, a Roma activist and writer in La Rioja, told me.</p> <p>La Rioja\u2019s rationale for not sharing death figures for towns (or health districts) was precisely to avoid this kind of stigma. \u201cWe\u2019ve never talked about ethnicity, or given information about individuals with Covid,\u201d Alvaro Ruidez, a spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s health service, told me. But the examples of Haro and Santo Domingo show that, if anything, the lack of information provided fertile ground for malicious rumours. \u201cIn fact, knowing this would have made people take it still more seriously,\u201d one of the town\u2019s sharpest observers, who asked not to be named, told me. When I spoke to mayor Milesi of San Pellegrino Terme in Bergamo, he said transparency was crucial to the town\u2019s wellbeing and to its future recovery. Spain, meanwhile, still lacks official municipal data, not just for Santo Domingo but for other hard-hit rural provinces such as Cuenca, Segovia and Soria.</p> <p>Jorge S\u00e1nchez believes the virus entered town from several directions at once. Ricardo Velasco, head of La Rioja\u2019s local health districts, points to the Camino de Santiago itself, often described as the oldest tourist trail in Europe, as a possible source. Its popularity has increased tenfold over two decades, attracting 352,000 pilgrims last year. Half of them follow the so-called \u201cFrench route\u201d, which goes through Santo Domingo. Visitor numbers fall dramatically in February and March, \u201cbut even in these months there are thousands,\u201d Velasco told me. The visitors are from all over the world. \u201cThey come in groups, so suddenly you may have a lot of Italians, and another day it\u2019s a group of Koreans,\u201d says Rafael Crespo, a doctor who serves half a dozen small villages close to Santo Domingo.</p> <p>The camino brings in money and shapes local identity. During the 11 centuries that the route has existed, only wars and natural disasters have closed it. Shutting it down, in other words, means the world has changed utterly. As Covid-19 has spread, people everywhere have, at some stage, been slow to accept that. In early March, local doctors had lobbied for part of the route to be closed, but this didn\u2019t happen until the nationwide lockdown was imposed.</p> <p>Other towns on the pilgrimage route do not seem to have suffered as badly as Santo Domingo. The mayor of neighbouring Belorado, \u00c1lvaro Egu\u00edluz, told me he did not want to blame its own moderately large Covid-19 outbreak on either pilgrims or people from Santo Domingo. \u201cIf we start doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will never end.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u2018No government in the world or in any autonomous region can claim to have got everything right,\u201d prime minister S\u00e1nchez said at the end of April, admitting that he himself could have done better. It was a refreshingly honest comment. People such as Due\u00f1as are right to complain about the lack of transparency, but there is no sign of other major mistakes in Santo Domingo that are not widely shared elsewhere.</p> <p>In three months, we have learned a lot. It is notable that the rural black spots in Spain and Italy are places that combine the intimacy of small Mediterranean communities with proximity to the highways of global travel and business. (San Pellegrino Terme, for example, gives its name to a brand of fizzy water sold around the world, but also welcomes tourists to its thermal baths.) Normally, for those places, that is a happy mix. When a virus strikes, it can prove deadly. The connection between Covid-19 and travel is especially grave for Spain, a country where tourism generates 12% of GDP. Only the boldest pilgrims, for example, will pass through Santo Domingo this summer, which will be devastating to locals who depend on their custom.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/italy-home-schooling-coronavirus-lockdown-what-weve-learned\">Italian lessons: what we've learned from two months of home schooling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Spain, the lockdown is being eased slowly, in a careful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/lockdown-easing-have-other-leaders-fared-better-than-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">four-stage</a> process that will take up to two months to complete. When I spoke to abbot Su\u00e1rez, it was 11 May \u2013 the day that Santo Domingo entered the first stage of easing. I felt envious. Candeleda was still stuck in so-called \u201cphase zero\u201d. We have since progressed, but we remain several weeks behind Santo Domingo in shaking off the effects of the virus on daily life.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez had just held the cathedral\u2019s first mass for a small group of people \u2013 an experiment \u201cto see how it worked\u201d. He was already thinking about numerous funeral masses to come. Elsewhere in Santo Domingo, groups of 10 people were now allowed to socialise, while bars and restaurants could serve clients at widely spaced outside tables. I imagined a town that had suddenly burst back into life. I was wrong. \u201cPeople are still scared,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t know if life will ever be quite the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">weekly email here</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2020 to clarify that the information regarding Spain having the world\u2019s highest rate of deaths came from one particular study of excess deaths.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama has told young people of colour \u201cyour lives matter\u201d in public remarks that supporters welcomed as an antidote to Donald Trump\u2019s racially charged and divisive threats to crack down on civil dissent.</p> \n<p>America\u2019s first black president on Wednesday expressed faith in young people in the US and said he remained \u201coptimistic\u201d about the future despite the police killing of George Floyd and mounting crises that Trump\u2019s critics say leave the country crying out for leadership.</p> \n<p>Obama spoke at an event by the My&nbsp;Brother\u2019s&nbsp;Keeper&nbsp;alliance, a program of the Obama Foundation, that was called \u201cReimagining Policing in the Wake of Continued Police Violence\u201d. It was the first public appearance by the 44th president since Floyd was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck, sparking nine days of nationwide protests that have been mostly peaceful but marred by some incidents of violence.</p> \n<p>In striking contrast to the White House incumbent, whose expressions of sympathy for Floyd have been overshadowed by harsh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/donald-trump-george-floyd-protests-military-threat\">warnings that the US military</a> could be deployed to impose law and order, Obama at one point spoke directly to young men and women of color.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want you to know that you matter, I want you to know that your lives matter, that your dreams matter, and when I go home and I look at the faces of my daughters, Sasha and Malia, and I look at my nephews and nieces, I see limitless potential that deserves to flourish and thrive,\u201d Obama said in <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?472749-1/town-hall-president-obama-racial-justice-police-reform\">a virtual town hall</a> for My Brother\u2019s Keeper.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd you should be able to learn and make mistakes and live a life of joy without having to worry about what\u2019s going to happen when you walk to the store, or go for a jog, or are driving down the street, or looking at some bird in a park.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cSo I hope that you also feel hopeful even as you may feel angry because you have the potential to make things better and you have helped to make the entire country feel as if this is something that\u2019s gotta change.
