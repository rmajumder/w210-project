Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.</strong>There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said.

The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June.

The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases.

It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are several side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec443a08f0886ce4f5d6a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T20:49:28.592Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the US, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has claimed that scientists carried out a study of the effects of hydroxychloroquine, the results of which suggested he is wrong to tout it, because they oppose him politically.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\">The study</a> of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate.

Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population. </li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections </strong>as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing. </li> \n   <li><strong>Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19</strong> in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me, <strong>Damien Gayle</strong>, until tomorrow. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec41d808f0864e579f13f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-collyns\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T18:00:42.966Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Covid-19 continues to sweep across the <strong>Peruvian Amazon</strong> with deadly ferocity. Pucallpa, on the country\u2019s eastern border with Brazil, follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/07/peru-jungle-iquitos-coronavirus-covid-19\">Iquitos</a> as the second Peruvian Amazon city to be ravaged by the deadly virus, writes <strong>Dan Collyns</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Social media images showed sick people lying in motorised rickshaws outside one hospital which had shut its doors and refused to take more patients. Other images showed doctors and nurses protesting about the lack of PPE, medicines and oxygen. </p> \n  <p>At least 45 members of the 30,000-strong Shipibo Konibo indigenous people have died from the coronavirus in Ucayali, the Amazon region of which Pucallpa is the capital, according to the local indigenous federation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/feconau1/status/1262055749380902914\">Feconau</a>. Many more are sick as Covid-19 has penetrated villages that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/south-america-indigenous-groups-coronavirus-brazil-colombia\">self-isolated</a> when the pandemic reached South America.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn Pucallpa there is a total collapse of the three public hospitals, the private clinics are shut, and people are dying here every day,\u201d said Miguel Hilario-Manenima, a local university professor with a PhD from Stanford university. </p> \n  <p>As desperate patients gasp for air, an oxygen plant lies inoperative in the city, part of newly built hospital that was never completed, an investigation by <a href=\"https://elcomercio.pe/peru/ucayali/hospital-de-pucallpa-tiene-una-planta-de-oxigeno-inoperativa-por-obra-inconclusa-noticia/\">El Comercio newspaper</a> revealed.</p> \n  <p>As in Iquitos, oxygen has become a precious and overpriced resource in the hands of private companies who have quintupled the cost of a typical 10m3 canister, all sources consulted by The Guardian concurred. </p> \n  <p>Aoife Bennett, an honorary research associate from Oxford University working in Pucallpa, said indigenous communities were clubbing together to try to buy oxygen which had reached \u201cextortionate\u201d prices. A cylinder which cost about 600 soles (\u00a3144) before the pandemic began now costs between 3,500 soles (\u00a3843) and 5,000 soles (\u00a31,205).</p> \n  <p>\u201cI put money towards buying a ridiculously expensive cylinder of oxygen because I\u2019m trying to save a friend\u2019s life,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely disgusting that this should happen.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Peru\u2019s state social security body EsSalud said last week it expected to build a 100-bed field hospital in Pucallpa for Covid-19 patients which would be ready in three weeks.</p> \n  <p>Official figures for Ucayali report <a href=\"https://covid19.minsa.gob.pe/sala_situacional.asp\">2,032 coronavirus cases and 91 deaths</a> but local accounts report hundreds of deaths. One local cemetery <a href=\"https://rpp.pe/peru/ucayali/ucayali-cementerios-colapsan-en-pucallpa-mas-de-500-fallecidos-en-un-mes-pero-minsa-reporta-63-por-covid-19-noticia-1265720\">reported 421 deaths above the average</a> number of deceased during the last month. </p> \n  <p>Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 94,000 on Monday, with a death toll of 2,789 according to official figures.

<p>Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain.</p> \n  <p>On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion.</p> \n  <p>The move came hours after the US president told reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>The letter is the latest salvo in a war of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president, who is under pressure at home over his response to the pandemic, temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">froze funding to the WHO</a> in April, accusing the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat. At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear.

The letter states that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d The letter states that the Trump administration\u2019s review into the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cconfirmed many of the serious concerns I raised...and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization\u2019s alarming lack of independence from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>US deaths pass 90,000. </strong>The coronavirus death told in the US passed 90,000 Monday, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide. </strong>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a> figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>IMF chief says full economic recovery unlikely in 2021. </strong>The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism.

That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, <strong>if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permane</strong>nt and <strong>reconsider our membership in the organization</strong>.

  "<p>Nearly 9m attempts to access child sexual abuse material online were made in the UK last month during the coronavirus lockdown, according to an internet watchdog.</p> <p>The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a British charity that identifies child sexual abuse content online, said it had blocked and filtered at least 8.8m attempts by UK internet users to access videos and images of children suffering sexual abuse during April alone.</p> <p>The figures come after stark warnings from law enforcement and child protection organisations that paedophiles are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-lockdown-raises-risk-of-online-child-abuse-charity-says\">seeking to take advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic</a> to search for and carry out abuse online.</p> <p>The National Crime Agency last month revealed it believes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/03/nca-predicts-rise-in-online-child-sexual-abuse-during-coronavirus-pandemic\">there are a minimum of 300,000 individuals in the UK posing a sexual threat to children</a>, either through physical \u201ccontact\u201d abuse, or via the internet.</p> <p>The IWF provides a list of child sexual abuse URLs that companies use to block and filter so that criminal content is not available through their services. Three companies that use the list helped to compile the data that revealed the 8.8m UK attempts to access child sexual abuse imagery on URLs in April.</p> <p>Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the IWF, said: \u201cThis is the first time we have had this data made available to us and it just goes to show how important the URL list is. Without it, child sexual abuse material would have been accessed millions of times in this period alone.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we have no like for like data to compare it to, the fact so many of these attempts have been blocked suggests the scale of the issue of public demand is quite staggering, and something we need to remain vigilant against.\u201d</p> <p>A notice is served to the internet user each time an attempt to access a URL on the list is made. This notice makes them aware of why they have been blocked from accessing the content.</p> <p>Hargreaves said that companies need to do more: \u201cWe need to face up to the fact there is a demand in the UK for this material. Given that this data comes from just three UK tech companies, 8.8m attempts is a conservative picture and the scale is much bigger \u2013 possibly millions more.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst the majority of the UK\u2019s internet connections are filtered by this list, there are still companies operating in the UK which offer no such protections. If we\u2019re serious about creating a safer internet, everyone needs to step up.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Terrorism suspects who have not been convicted of any offence face expanded and potentially never-ending measures to control their lives under proposed counter-terrorism laws unveiled by the UK government.</p> <p>Ministers want to weaken the burden of proof for terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) to be imposed on people suspected of terrorist activityand remove the two-year cap on their use.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/19/longer-jail-time-for-terrorists-could-backfire-says-watchdog\">Longer jail time for terrorists could backfire, says watchdog</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tpims are controversial and resource-heavy measures \u2013 usually based on secret intelligence \u2013 for controlling the risk presented by terrorism suspects at large where criminal prosecution is not an option.</p> <p>Civil liberties campaigners said the changes posed \u201ca threat to fundamental pillars of our justice system\u201d.

Control orders were abolished by the coalition government as a stain on our human rights record and that\u2019s where they should remain.</p> <p>\u201cThis bill also threatens our safety. Without an evidence-based approach, the government is failing to address the root causes of these incidents and therefore failing to stop them. The fact this bill is being issued during a pandemic, when parliament is not operating at full capacity or able to deliver normal levels of scrutiny, should be a cause of concern for all who care about the future of our democracy and justice.\u201d</p> <p>The legislation will end early release for terrorism offenders who receive a specific type of jail term, known as an extended determinate sentence, where the maximum penalty was life, and force them to serve their whole term in jail.</p> <p>The bill will also increase the maximum penalty from 10 to 14 years for a number of terror offences, including membership of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation and attending a place used for terrorist training.</p> <p>Rachel Logan, Amnesty International UK\u2019s legal expert, said: \u201cIt was never right to drastically curtail people\u2019s liberty on the basis of secret, untested evidence using control orders or Tpims \u2013 and we seem to be diving headlong into that territory where the standard of proof is extremely flimsy and people\u2019s liberties can be curtailed on an indefinite basis.</p> <p>\u201cRushing this bill out while parliament is still operating under Covid-19 constraints suggests the government could be trying to minimise scrutiny for significant legal changes. We\u2019ll scrutinise the bill in full as soon as possible, and we\u2019ll be urging the government to adhere to the tried and tested principle that people reasonably suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities should \u2013 if the evidence is there \u2013 be prosecuted in a court of law.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The government has unveiled a new counter-terrorism bill. Here are some of the key measures to be introduced in the legislation:</p> <h2>New sentencing regime</h2> <p>Terrorism offenders will be sentenced under the following terms:</p> <ul> <li><p>A life sentence \u2013 where the offender spends a minimum period or \u201ctariff\u201d before being considered for release by the Parole Board. The offender may never be released. If released, offenders will spend the rest of their life on licence and can be recalled to custody.</p></li> <li><p>Serious terrorist sentence \u2013 a new term for the most dangerous offenders, where there is a likelihood of multiple deaths, which carries a minimum 14-year sentence with an extended licence period of seven to 25 years.</p></li> <li><p>An extended determinate sentence (EDS) \u2013 if this is handed out when the offence carries the maximum penalty of life, the offender will be required to spend their entire sentence behind bars with no prospect of early release. For other offences, someone given an EDS faces an extended licence period after release of up to 10 years.</p></li> <li><p>A sentence for offenders of particular concern (SOPC) \u2013 for adult or youth offenders, under which they would spend two-thirds of their sentence in custody before being able to apply to the Parole Board for release. Following release they will have a mandatory licence period of 12 months.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Longer sentences</h2> <p>The bill increases the maximum penalty from 10 to 14 years for a number of terrorism offences, including membership of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation and attending a place used for terrorist training.</p> <h2>Longer licence periods</h2> <p>Offenders will spend longer under supervision in the community, with a minimum period of 12 months on licence for all terrorism offenders, and adult offenders on parole will be required to take polygraphs, or lie detector tests.</p> <h2>Tougher tools for monitoring suspects</h2> <p>The bill expands and toughens the power of terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) by lowering the standard of proof for imposing the measure, removing the maximum length they can last and adding extra measures.</p>",

She said that she and her two younger sisters, aged eight and nine, had been \u201cscared and shaken\u201d by a visit to their home by Home Office staff, who questioned her mother.</p> <p>She said that worries about her family\u2019s immigration difficulties sometimes reduced her to tears and often made it hard for her to sleep, adding that she fears being forcibly sent to live in Fiji, a country she has never visited.</p> <p>\u201cMy father has been serving the Queen for 10 years,\u201d she said by telephone. \u201cIt would be devastating to have to leave here. Britain is our home.\u201d</p> <p> Lilieta wants to join the army when she leaves school after hearing her father\u2019s descriptions of his time serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Falkland Islands, but she knows she will face difficulties because her visa status is unresolved.</p> <p>Ratucaucau\u2019s two older daughters were born in Germany, while he was based there with the army. His youngest daughter was born in the UK and has no visa problems. Immigration uncertainties have made everyone in the family very unhappy. \u201cI\u2019m angry and embarrassed,\u201d Lilieta said.</p> <p>Ratucaucau is one of a group of Commonwealth-born military veterans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">who launched legal action against the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence</a> earlier this year over an alleged systemic failure to advise them of the need to apply for settlement in the UK on discharge and for failing to assist them with complex, expensive immigration rules, which has left them categorised as illegal immigrants, struggling to access free NHS treatment, facing unemployment and fearing forced removal.</p> <p>They are unable to regularise their status due to rising visa costs and the complexity of the immigration system.</p> <p>Foreign national soldiers have the right to remain in the UK after leaving the army if they have served for at least four years, but claimants say they were discharged without being given clear guidance about how to regularise their immigration status. Most assumed the process was automatic. Ratucaucau would need to pay \u00a32,389 for each applicant, a total of \u00a39,556 for the family. Since being discharged from the army he has not been able to afford the sum.</p> <p>Visa fees have risen dramatically over the past decade as part of a government policy to cut immigration. Hospitals have been under an increased obligation since 2017 to check the immigration status of patients and to charge anyone who cannot prove eligibility in line with a series of measures designed to create a hostile environment for illegal migration.</p> <p>Ratucaucau said he had had no contact from the government officials and had no reason to think that the Ministry of Defence had changed its position. \u201cI am just hoping that they look at my situation and try to sort this,\u201d he said</p> <p> Charles Byrne, director general of the Royal British Legion, said: \u201cAs a nation we rely on the bravery and courage of our Commonwealth personnel yet, despite their years of service to this country, they currently have to pay thousands of pounds in fees if they and their families wish to remain in the UK after service.

  "<p>According to the American psychologist Gary Klein, desperation is a driver of creativity, a means to unlock insight or solutions that might otherwise have been untried or not even considered.</p> \n<p>Right now, English football is in a precarious place, particularly lower down the leagues, where sobering financial realities have bitten and, to some powerful people, Klein\u2019s theory has resonated. How can everyone adapt to survive in the coronavirus-scarred landscape, they have asked? Could radical opportunity arise?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/19/premier-league-reveals-six-positive-coronavirus-tests-across-three-clubs\">Premier League reveals six positive coronavirus tests across three clubs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some in executive positions at Premier League clubs have seen one. It is a reprise of an idea that Greg Dyke, in his then-role as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/08/premier-league-division-b-teams-fan-commission-greg-dyke-league-three-non-eu-players\" title=\"\">Football Association chairman, advanced in 2014</a>. Could top-flight clubs develop mutually beneficial partnerships with those in the lower divisions? Or could they set up B teams in, say, League Two for their under-23s?</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands the notions were raised during a recent conference call of an influential football working group comprising representatives of a handful of clubs plus the FA, Premier League and English Football League.</p> \n<p>It is important to say that there have been numerous calls and webinars during the pandemic and many ideas floated. The varying degrees of traction have been difficult to discern but, like the ripples from a stone in the water, this one has reached people who were not a part of the original conversation. And they are receptive to it.</p> \n<p>Dyke\u2019s goal had been to improve the prospects of young English players and he set out three options: strategic loan partnerships between Premier League clubs and those further down; partnerships that were more all-encompassing; and B teams, broadly along the lines of the Spanish model.</p> \n<p>Top-flight clubs have long fretted about the playing opportunities for their academy graduates when they are aged between 18 and 21 and, even though Dyke\u2019s plan failed to garner the requisite support, it did not wither on the vine. At the very least, clubs have continued to see whether they can build relationships with one another, some involving the exchange of expertise.</p> \n<p>Some Premier League executives now want to try again. They can see that clubs in League One and, particularly, League Two are facing oblivion but, in a life-or-death situation, they reason that the choice would surely be life \u2013 even with conditions attached. The opportunism is jarring, unpalatable. Welcome to capitalism.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a2d9b96059f7f2747ced3d356904393bb2911d1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a2d9b96059f7f2747ced3d356904393bb2911d1/340_411_2005_1203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Dyke, seen here in 2013 shaking Nemanja Vidic\u2019s hand after the FA Community Shield, had set out to improve the prospects of young English players\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Dyke, seen here after the 2013 FA Community Shield, had set out to improve the prospects of young English players.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It feels like one of those discussions that could merely rumble on in the background because the obstacles to any agreement would be considerable, particularly over B teams.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EFL has previously stated that there is no appetite whatsoever to introduce Premier League B teams into the domestic football pyramid and that position is unchanged,\u201d an EFL spokesman said.</p> \n<p>When the EFL allowed Premier League under-21 teams to enter the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/10/premier-league-academy-teams-english-football-league-trophy-efl\" title=\"\">Checkatrade Trophy in 2016-17</a>, it was a move to help the young players at those clubs to gain experience.

This was not a Trojan horse for the Premier League to infiltrate the EFL.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"50d35353-b412-46bd-9413-d528a3bdadc7\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The reason why B teams have long felt like a non-starter comes down to the integrity of the competition. Ownership of multiple clubs is not allowed because of what would happen if, say, Manchester United\u2019s B team were drawn to face United\u2019s actual team in the FA Cup. Also, there would surely be arguments if some but not all Premier League clubs had a B team. What would happen if a top-flight club with one were relegated? Conversely, would a B team be allowed promotion into the top division?</p> \n<p>There are wider issues, those that talk to the cherished place that a lower-league club occupies in their community, the feelings of belonging and identity. Once they partner or even align on any level with a Premier League club, the disconnects could set in. The clubs would no longer be the same.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/19/hull-city-break-ranks-and-call-for-championship-season-to-be-voided\">Hull City break ranks and call for Championship season to be voided</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The more extreme end of any partnerships would appear hard to achieve \u2013 in other words, a Premier League club effectively taking over an ailing one in League Two and rebranding it as theirs. But there could be a middle ground, particularly in terms of player loans.</p> \n<p>The rules permit EFL clubs to loan a maximum of four players from any one club, two of whom can be over 23. Clubs can name five loanees in a matchday squad. But the EFL would be open to discussing an increase together with the reintroduction of short-term loans.</p> \n<p>What would a wider club partnership look like? Those in favour say the Premier League club could send coaches in addition to players to the other; they could share resources on marketing, programme printing and catering, among other things. The lower-league partner could be granted the use of the Premier League club\u2019s training facilities and even their stadium.</p> \n<p>The weeks and months ahead promise to be turbulent.

</figure> \n  <p>In a briefing on Wednesday, Harman said she had sent the digital contact tracing (data protection) bill to the health secretary, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Matt Hancock</strong>, and to <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, leader of the Commons.</p> \n  <p>Specific legislation, she urged, is required rather than the existing \u201cmishmash\u201d of standards involving the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), case law, the European convention on human rights and the Data Protection Act because the contact-tracing app is more ambitious than anything previously envisaged.</p> \n  <p>The JCHR bill would prevent data being used for other purposes, stop anybody not authorised gaining access to it, delete the data after the pandemic and establish a contact-tracing human rights commissioner.</p> \n  <p>Harman said she would personally download the app, which is already being piloted on the Isle of Wight, but her committee\u2019s view was that it should not go ahead without new privacy protections.</p> \n  <p>Those protections should apply whether or not the government continued with its existing centralised model or whether it eventually opted for the type of \u201cdecentralised\u201d app being used more widely on the continent.</p> \n  <p>Only Australia, she had acknowledged, has so far passed data protection legislation specifically applying to a contact-tracing app. \u201cI have asked Jacob Rees-Mogg to make time in parliament to bring [the bill] forward,\u201c Harman said. \u201cIf not they should allow parliament to say whether [should have a vote on it.]\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked whether safeguards should be relaxed during an emergency, Harman said it was a matter of balancing the right to life with privacy protections.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T15:06:06.395Z\">at 4.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec3f34b8f0886ce4f5d66d5\"

If we look at the UK as a whole, that is just under 55,000 excess deaths.</p> \n   <p>So the gap between Covid-related and excess is about 25% of excess deaths are not explained by Covid being on the death certificate. And that is now a key area of research for us to get underneath that, to understand that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stripe said that within the next couple of weeks the ONS planned to publish more research looking at why the excess deaths figure was so high. But he said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19englandandwales/deathsoccurringinapril2020\">a report published by the ONS on Friday</a>, on deaths in April, did shed some light on what was happening. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That showed that deaths from dementia and Alzheimer disease had gone up very, very significantly during April, as had deaths from something known as \u201cill-defined conditions\u201d. That is often where the certifying doctor puts things like frailty or old age on the death certificate. Usually in the very old, where there might not be a specific morbidity, but the patient has been unwell, you\u2019ll often get these ill-defined conditions. And they were up significantly as well in April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stripe said there could be two reasons for this increase. First \u201cnormal care pathways\u201d could be disrupted; ie, fewer patients were going to hospital, because the hospitals were concentrating on coronavirus. Second, coronavirus might be a factor in these deaths, without doctors being able to confirm that. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There may be some cases where Covid is present but it is not obvious to the certifying doctor that that is the case.</p> \n   <p>And it may be the case that this big jump in the number of dementia and Alzheimer deaths could explain part of that reason there. It could well be that in the very old, if the patient is not able to describe their symptoms very well, there may be many other co-morbidities, that perhaps the doctor has not felt able, in the absence of a positive test, to put Covid on the death certificate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T09:24:35.231Z\">at 10.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec39a3c8f0864e579f1391f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:44:36.983Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Excess deaths in England and Wales running at 3,081 in first week of May, ONS says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> has just published <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending8may2020\">the latest weekly death figures for England and Wales.</a> They cover the week up to Friday 8 May (or week 19, as the ONS calls it).</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Overall deaths in England and Wales in the week up to 8 May were down for the third week in a row, at 12,657. </strong>But they were still 3,081 above the five-year average for that week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Some 31.1% of the deaths in the week up to 8 May involved coronavirus being mentioned on the death certificate, down from 33.6% the previous week.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Overall deaths in care homes in the week up to 8 May were down, from 6,409 to 4,248.</strong> But the proportion involving coronavirus was up from 37.8% the previous week to 39.2%.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec399148f08a1782fa7d569\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:34:12.466Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s farmers and carmakers will be protected under a new post-Brexit trade regime that will result in 60% of goods coming into the country tariff-free from the start of next year, the government has announced.

Health and care jobs generally require a high level of training, which means that workers who have been furloughed or made unemployed will struggle to fill these jobs. For those who remain employed, the collapse in job vacancies will severely limit their ability to move between jobs, which is an important channel for wage progression especially among younger workers.</p> \n   <p>The fact that there has been no recovery in vacancies in the most deprived local authorities is also worrying, especially because it will be risky to travel far for work on public transport.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec393018f0864e579f138e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:11:42.842Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">There are 'substantial number' of job vacancies, says work and pensions secretary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The work and pensions secretary, <strong>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey</strong>, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning.

More than one in three 18 to 24-year-olds, and three in 10 workers in their early 60s, are receiving less pay than they did at the start of the year.

(Important to note that lockdown didn\u2019t start until 24 March.) Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 former Tory leader and former work and pension secretary \u2013 said \u201cthere was always going to be a big hit to the economy by locking down the economy\u201d.

  "<p>As the body count continues to rise and the government\u2019s failures become more and more obvious \u2013 just imagine how many more people might have died if Matt Hancock hadn\u2019t thrown his protective ring around care homes from the very start \u2013 you can sense ministers and scientists increasingly socially distancing themselves from any sense of responsibility.</p> <p>Head meet sand. What contact tracing app that was supposed to be the key to ending lockdown? Oh that one! We never meant to imply it was that important. Or that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/phone-app-delay-raises-concerns-about-easing-lockdown-on-1-june\">necessarily be ready when we said it would</a>. Rather it was just an adjunct to some other measures that we haven\u2019t yet thought of. So we are in a game of musical chairs for the morally bankrupt. Which means that Michael Gove is in with a definite chance of winning.</p> <p>Gove is the ultimate shapeshifter. The politician who, more than any other, bends reality to suit his needs. Tonight, Matthew, he will be whoever he wants to be. All failures and shortcomings rewritten as outstanding successes. His two attempts to become party leader? Massive triumphs.</p> <p>Listening to the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster \u2013 there is no Brexit secretary any more \u2013 answer an urgent question on the third round of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/19/brexit-talks-eu-wants-us-to-obey-the-rules-of-their-club-says-gove\">Brexit talks</a> that had ended in deadlock you would have had no idea the UK was in the middle of the biggest public health crisis for a century. Or that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/what-will-coronavirus-mean-for-the-british-economy\">economy was contracting by the day </a>and that there were now 10 million people on the furlough scheme, many of whom could be out of a job within months.</p> <p>Rather it was as if the clock had been rewound six months to the Brexit culture wars of late 2019. There wasn\u2019t even a nod to the fact that it might be prudent to even consider the idea of extending transition by a short period, just to see what kind of state both the UK and the EU might be in come December. And whether we might cooperate with one another. Rather, we were fighting an ideological war in which everything Brussels did or said was bad and independence day couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p> <p>How dare the EU insist on making the demands it had always said it would make and had been largely agreed in the political declaration of the withdrawal agreement? And how dare Brussels demand we keep a level playing field on standards, hygiene and workers\u2019 rights when ours were already far higher than the EU\u2019s? Apart from the ones we were were going to lower to get a free trade agreement with the US.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves did try to talk Mikey down. Though appealing to his reason is never the best tactic, as the Govester isn\u2019t strong on rationality. She rightly observed that seven months wasn\u2019t long to try to iron out all the remaining details \u2013 the cabinet can\u2019t even agree among itself whether customs and border checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 and that adding to the uncertainty in such uncertain times was potentially catastrophic.</p> <p>Gove had no answer other than to accuse Labour of having no clear plan and that he was sticking to his own regardless. Get Brexit Done. Which had been rather Reeves\u2019s point all along. That not having a clear Brexit plan and hedging your bets over the length of transition was the only sensible option under the circumstances.</p> <p>In the end the Speaker had to interrupt Mikey mid-rant but Gove continued in much the same vein for the rest of the half-hour session. Why were people so obsessed with the coronavirus? It was just an EU plot to thwart Brexit. The people had voted for Brexit and that was what they were going to get. Regardless of how many people had to die or lose their jobs in the process.</p> <p>As if to reinforce the idea that the government was fed up with everyone going on about the coronavirus \u2013 what was the big deal about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/almost-55000-excess-uk-deaths-during-covid-19-outbreak-says-ons\">50,000 deaths</a> and the disappearance from public view of Boris Johnson? \u2013 the environment minister, George Eustice, was sent out to take the Downing Street press conference. Because no one is more likely to make people reach for the off button than the most forgettable of cabinet ministers. More so even than Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, who at least has some unintended comedy value. Earlier in the day she had unwittingly told the BBC that there were plenty of unfilled jobs. I guess she had the Cabinet in mind.</p> <p>Eustice did the prime minister proud by giving a masterclass in banality. He had come with nothing to say and was determined to make sure he said it. So he raced through the same slides that have been shown at every other press conference, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/19/environment-secretary-george-eustice-calls-on-furloughed-brits-to-pick-fruit-video\">lamenting there were no foreigners to pick soft fruit</a> these days \u2013 who would have guessed? \u2013 and begging Brits on furlough to support the national effort. It still hasn\u2019t dawned on the government that EU workers were quite handy for doing the low-paid work Brits couldn\u2019t be bothered to do.</p> <p>Within minutes the minister had put almost his entire audience to sleep. That meant few heard him saying it had been a brilliant idea to stop testing and tracing in March because it made the current levels of testing look all the more impressive. And it had been absolutely right to fill care homes with residents who hadn\u2019t been tested because <em>zzzzzzzzz</em> take back control <em>zzzzzzz</em> making our own laws <em>zzzzzzzz</em> and they would have died sooner or later anyway <em>zzzzzzzz</em>. Come the end, I couldn\u2019t even be sure if Eustice was still awake. Another day had passed in which no one had taken responsibility for anything.</p>",

  "<p>Earlier this month Leo Varadkar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>\u2019s taoiseach, and Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s prime minister, each faced a fraught dilemma. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak+tone/explainers\">Coronavirus</a> infection rates were falling and the economic devastation from lockdowns was rising, tilting the calculus towards easing restrictions.</p> <p>But some experts said it was too soon, that infection rates were still too high, that testing and contact-tracing systems were not ready and that the pandemic would roar back.</p> <p>Varadkar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/ireland-extends-covid-19-lockdown-to-18-may-before-phased-exit\">extended Ireland\u2019s lockdown</a> to 18 May. Johnson rolled the dice and began to unlock \u2013 at least for England, while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/stay-alert-or-stay-home-how-covid-19-lockdown-rules-differ-across-uk\">stuck with the \u201cstay home\u201d</a> recommendation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/19/distanced-drop-offs-and-protective-bubbles-englands-new-school-rules\">Distanced drop-offs and protective bubbles: England's new school rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The verdict on each man\u2019s decision may take months but the extent of divergence is already apparent.</p> <p>On Monday, when Ireland started phase one of its gradual easing, new daily cases had tumbled to about 11% of the country\u2019s late April peak.</p> <p>When England started its first phase five days earlier on 13 May, new daily cases had fallen but were still about 75% of its late-April to early-May peak.</p> <p>There was another stark difference. Ireland started lifting lockdown only after testing and contact-tracing systems were fully scaled up. England took the plunge before its systems were ready.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say it was recklessly premature,\u201d said Se\u00e1n L\u2019Estrange, a social scientist at University College Dublin, who has <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/sociology/t4media/Testing%20Matters.pdf\">written </a>about testing and studied tracing. \u201cI honestly fear [the level of cases in the UK] will go up fast in the coming weeks.\u201d</p> <p>That was especially concerning because the UK appeared to lack sufficient testing and contact-tracing capacity for such a surge, said L\u2019Estrange. \u201cPerhaps they can get it up and running quickly. But they\u2019re behind the curve and playing catch-up. You have to have sufficient testing and contact-tracing capacity ready to go before you ease restrictions. They\u2019ve put the cart before the horse. They released the virus without having the apparatus in place to control it, and they\u2019ve released it at a high level.\u201d</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s lockdown easing started after England\u2019s and is scheduled to go more cautiously and slowly, with the last phase starting on 10 August, and schools opening in September. England\u2019s plan envisages schools starting to open on 1 June and the final phase of lifting starting on 4 July.</p> <p>John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the House of Lords science committee on Tuesday that the decision about schools was political. \u201cIt is not a scientific decision. Scientists can offer some advice.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street has defended its lockdown exit strategy as science-based and an expression of confidence in the public\u2019s ability to \u201cstay alert\u201d while returning to work and interacting with others.</p> <p>This week Matt Hancock, the health minister, announced that everyone over the age of five in the UK with symptoms could now be tested for coronavirus. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said the government had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/17/uk-contact-tracing-applicants-wrongly-told-hiring-paused-in-latest-misstep\">recruited 17,000 contact tracers</a> \u2013 on course to reach its 18,000 target \u2013 and that the first tracers started work on Monday.</p> <p>However, L\u2019Estrange fears the system will struggle because as the public becomes more mobile, the number of infections and number of contacts for each infected person rises. \u201cOnce you\u2019re allowed out and about again the chance of you getting infected increases and so does your number of contacts. That\u2019s why you need lots of surplus at the time of release.\u201d</p> <p>The UK is betting heavily on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/nhs-preparing-to-roll-out-covid-19-contract-tracing-app-by-end-of-may\">contact-tracing app</a> that has been trialled on the Isle of Wight and is due for national rollout at the end of May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Ireland has been working on a similar app that relies on Bluetooth technology but officials are now playing down its importance amid privacy concerns and other obstacles. Both governments may end up dropping the technology, said L\u2019Estrange. \u201cI suspect the app is a white elephant.\u201d</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">editorial</a> in the British Medical Journal this week excoriated the UK\u2019s record on testing and tracing. \u201cMeaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, divert focus and could lead to more deaths. These headline grabbing schemes should be replaced by locality-led strategies rooted in communicable disease control,\u201d it said.</p>",

  "<p><strong> </strong>Sadly, there will be no \u201cnew normal\u201d. At present we are seeing hundreds of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SydneyPolicyLab/status/1242710337826074626\">creative ideas</a> spring forth about how Australia \u2013 and the world \u2013 can be different in the wake of Covid-19. These are important and valuable; long may they continue.</p> <p>But the likelihood remains that Australia will return to a well-worn \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d as the pandemic recedes.

Our political leaders should be commended, not least for their willingness to heed advice of experts. But once the peak has passed, the incentives politicians face will not have changed. This is because of the way power works in Australia.</p> <p>Our prime ministers and premiers wield far less power than most people believe. They are not the only, or even the most, powerful actors in Australian policymaking. They\u2019re simply the final link in a chain, albeit the point at which influence is most intensely targeted.</p> <p>Instead, power is distributed across multiple actors \u2013 business leaders, media, unions, peak bodies and political factions <em>in addition </em>to the individual political leaders. Most leaders today operate a never-ending mental calculus of how they accommodate the competing demands of these groups in a way that will extend their period of office. Simple as that.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Australians, that competition among those demands has not served us well in recent times. The group of actors who have been able to influence political leaders has narrowed dramatically. Those who currently hold most sway over leaders\u2019 behaviour are big business, the media, unions and internal political rivals, with Coalition governments weighting business interests and Labor favouring union ones. Of course, all governments follow opinion polls closely, but these are filtered through the prism of constant media interpretation and factional machination.</p> <p>This is not to say individual politicians aren\u2019t decent people motivated to serve the citizens they represent \u2013 most I\u2019ve met are \u2013 but the demands of this power logic are inescapable.</p> <p>To see these power dynamics up close, consider a few recent events.</p> <p>Qantas CEO Alan Joyce actively lobbied the Morrison government not to support his stricken rival Virgin, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/rod-sims-accc-virgin-australia-stoush-qantas-coronavirus\">experts</a> warning that maintaining two functional airlines is clearly in the national interest. Days later Virgin collapses, giving Qantas an effective monopoly.</p> <p>Andrew Forrest, the mining billionaire, brought a top Chinese diplomat to gatecrash a ministerial press conference to express his dismay at the government\u2019s behaviour towards China. His fellow billionaire Kerry Stokes <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/western-australia/kerry-stokes-calls-for-china-backdown-urges-canberra-to-respect-wet-markets-20200430-p54ohj.html\">chimed in</a> with his approval.</p> <p>Politicians are expected to heed these interventions. Donations and media support depend on it. Former PMs Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull have <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2020/04/18/malcolm-turnbull-wouldnt-bow-to-rupert-murdoch-so-i-had-to-be-destroyed/\">both recounted</a> how Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media works to undermine leaders who do not align with Murdoch positions.</p> <p>With these incentives in place, a return to business as usual is Australia\u2019s most likely outcome. But how can we change this? How can we engage our casualised workers and long-term unemployed with productive, secure work? How can we lift the living standards of the nurses, teachers and carers who\u2019ve shepherded us through the crisis? How can we rebuild our manufacturing sector and Tafe system? How on earth do we get our emissions falling?</p> <p>There are two ways how might we might change direction. The populist media won\u2019t change its business model, but it can be circumvented.</p> <p>One way is for Scott Morrison to reject the calculus that enabled his ascent and burn his political capital on a gamble in the national interest. Whitlam did this in recognising China (and much more), Hawke and Keating did it with the float and cutting tariffs, and Howard did it with the gun buyback.</p> <p>Granted, all had just won office, but Morrison\u2019s management during the pandemic offers him a fresh start with the Australian people. More importantly, all had to take on powerful vested interests, within their party and beyond.</p> <p>Imagine a legacy that involved a permanent rise in Newstart, free childcare, creative use of debt to rebuild industries, and a rapid reduction in Australia\u2019s emissions. He\u2019d have to stare down his own backbench, threatening an election if they didn\u2019t play ball, and it might mean a final term in office, but it\u2019s a far superior legacy than just another chapter of revolving-door prime ministership.</p> <p>The second path to a brighter future is through the interest groups. Most are member organisations and in these memberships resides latent power.</p> <p>Sally McManus at the ACTU has deployed this effectively, but as the last election showed, the unions can\u2019t do it alone. In addition, the companies that comprise the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry<em><strong> </strong></em> must also demand change. So must the institutional investors that sit behind them, including industry super funds. And all need to do so in concert.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/australia-has-found-common-ground-to-respond-to-covid-19-we-can-do-the-same-for-climate-change\">Australia has found common ground to respond to Covid-19.

  "<p> The novels I\u2019ve been meaning to read are still on the shelf, and the puzzle of Northern Italy I started is back in its box. The puzzle was supposed to be mediative, and a little bit poetic because they\u2019re having such a hard time over there, but I didn\u2019t even connect all the edges.</p> <p>And I\u2019m OK with that, because this morning my Dungeons &amp; Dragons gang saved a Bullywug campsite from the pinchers of a giant crab-monster. We blasted the crab with fire-magic and now the whole forest smells like an expensive restaurant. It\u2019s the most excitement I\u2019ve had all week.</p> <p>D&amp;D was invented in the early 1970s by Gary Gygax and Dave Arnsen \u2013 two nerds who figured out how to blend the strategising fun they found in military war games with the immersive storytelling of fantasy role-play. For the next few decades it was known as a game for social outcasts who wanted to live out their unfulfilled barbarian dreams.</p> <p>But all that\u2019s changed since Game of Thrones and Stranger Things put fantasy role-playing back in the zeitgeist. Now D&amp;D is more popular than it\u2019s ever been. I recently found out Vin Diesel\u2019s a huge fan. Apparently he <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/11/vin-diesel-reveals-his-rpg-roots/\">taught Judi Dench how to play while they were filming on The Chronicles of Riddick</a>. There\u2019s a rumour Judi now serves as Dungeon Master for her grandchildren.</p> <p>More and more people are getting into the game because it only moves as fast as you can tell a story, and roll some dice. The slower pace means it\u2019s mainly about hanging out with friends and travelling down dead-end roads. There aren\u2019t any winners or losers, just mysteries to solve and experience points to gain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/17/25-best-online-video-games-coronavirus-self-isolating\">25 best video games to help you socialise while self-isolating</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My first games of D&amp;D were played in my friend Hannah\u2019s garage about two years ago.

These days it feels like the most adventurous thing I can do is try a different brand of toothpaste or meet a new cat on an afternoon stroll. The rules I live by are stricter, my holiday plans are cancelled and my universe feels like it\u2019s contracting. I tried house parties on zoom and gave online karaoke a go. But I gave up because it felt like I was spending my weekends inside a dull photocopy of my former life.</p> <p>D&amp;D isn\u2019t like that. I was worried it might lose its magic because we can\u2019t meet in Hannah\u2019s garage any more, but the fun still translates. If anything, the fact we\u2019re not reacting to each other in the same room has given us even more space to try to think up wild stories while we play. The Dungeon Master still sets the scene and narrates the consciousness of peripheral characters. We still choose which way we want the story to go. Then we roll dice to determine the consequences.</p> <p>Things tend to get more interesting when we align our choices along a double axis of \u201claw\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d plus \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d. But really, we can define those categories however we want. So when the Dungeon Master asks \u201cwhat do you want to do?\u201d, we can do literally anything.</p> <p>Last week, that meant we made enemies with a Bullywug lizard-child after saving him from certain death. We think the Bullywugs are probably a force for good rather than evil, but that kid was a petulant jerk so he can go to hell. Later on I thought I could wow my companions with a lute performance and get us some free lodgings in a candlelit tavern. But I rolled a bad score on the 20-sided die, so the DM informed us that I broke every string with one ugly strum.</p> <p>I could practically hear the twang and snap when people laughed, probably because I\u2019ve been furnishing my imagination with fantasy tropes ever since I was read The Hobbit as a bedtime story.</p> <p>Playing online has also meant we can play the campaign with a friend who\u2019s living in New York. He drinks beer while we sip coffee and we can hang out for hours without any need to talk about rising death tolls or looming elections.</p> <p>Then when I return to the real world and see that the health crisis is feeding political divisions, or that people are now so suspicious of mainstream reality that they believe shape-shifting lizards are holding the planet hostage inside a holographic prison, I can take a deep breath and remember a very grounding idea: I happen to be a Level 4 Cleric with real magical powers. And a camp full of Bullywug lizard people are trusting me a whole lot more ever since I helped defeat that crab-monster.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://dnd.wizards.com/remote/freematerial\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is offering free material, adventures and resources</a> to play the game remotely during the health crisis</em></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Britain\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, has accused Brussels of treating the UK as an \u201cunworthy\u201d partner by offering a low-quality trade agreement that he says would force the country to \u201cbend to EU norms\u201d.</p> \n<p>In an extraordinary letter to the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the prime minister\u2019s envoy says Brussels\u2019 proposal that EU state aid rules be part of British law is \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201csimply not a provision any democratic country could sign\u201d.</p> \n<p>He further accuses Barnier of demanding unprecedented oversight over British laws and institutions through \u201cnovel and unbalanced proposals\u201d, in an intervention that will heighten fears that the talks are now destined to fail.</p> \n<p>The letter, sent shortly after the publication of the UK\u2019s draft trade and security treaty, highlights the tension at the heart of the negotiation over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU after a series of poor rounds of videoconference talks.</p> \n<p>The British negotiator seeks to reassure Barnier that he is not trying to negotiate with the member states through publication of the legal text but to \u201cclear up any misunderstandings about the purpose and effect of what we have put to you\u201d.</p> \n<p>Frost says the EU demands would tie the UK to Brussels\u2019 labour, environmental and social standards while offering a trade deal that fails to match those signed with others in reducing barriers to trade in animal products, motor vehicles, medicinal products, organics and chemicals.</p> \n<p>He writes that the UK government\u2019s proposed free trade deal is very close to that signed with Canada. The draft fisheries proposal is akin to that between the EU and Norway, he claims, and on aviation he says the UK is not seeking more than that given to other non-EU countries.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven this reality, we find it perplexing that the EU, instead of seeking to settle rapidly a high-quality set of agreements with a close economic partner, is instead insisting on additional, unbalanced and unprecedented provisions in a range of areas, as a precondition for agreement between us. Overall, we find it hard to see what makes the UK, uniquely among your trading partners, so unworthy of being offered the kind of well-precedented arrangements commonplace in modern [free trade agreements].\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to the EU argument that proximity and levels of trade require the UK to remain close to Brussels rules, Frost says Britain is less integrated than Switzerland, Norway or Ukraine and the argument on geography \u201camounts to saying that a country in Europe cannot expect to determine its own rules \u2026 and that it must bend to EU norms\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, Michael Gove had said that success in the fourth round of the talks starting on 1 June depended upon \u201cthe EU recognising that the UK is sovereign\u201d, after a notable lack of progress in last week\u2019s talks.</p> \n<p>Barnier, in turn, welcomed Downing Street\u2019s \u201ctransparency\u201d after being blocked by the British government during the recent negotiations from sharing the text with the member states, adding that the bloc had already made its text public \u201cover two months ago\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pedro Silva Pereira, who is part of a cross-party group of MEPs overseeing the talks on behalf of the European parliament, said the negotiations needed a \u201cpolitical wake up call\u201d. \u201cAnd it is Boris Johnson who needs to wake up\u201d, the Portuguese MEP said.</p> \n<p>The last chance to agree an extension to the transition period will come in June but Frost writes that the government does not believe it would be in British interests to stay in the customs union and single market after the end of the year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/who-and-what-uk-and-eu-resume-interupted-brexit-talks-future-relationaship\">Brexit talks: who is involved and what is being covered?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Without a replacement deal, both sides will fall back on the World Trade Organization\u2019s most favoured nation tariffs, which means duties on everyday food items from cheese to beef of more than 40%.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s 291-page draft comprehensive free trade agreement was among the multiple Brexit papers made public by the government covering everything from aviation and fisheries to social security coordination and law enforcement.</p> \n<p>On level-playing-field provisions, so central to the EU\u2019s proposal, the UK text contains a cut-and-paste from the EU\u2019s trade deal with Canada stating merely that it would be \u201cinappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the levels of protection\u201d in current labour laws and standards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"532df0a3-11ca-4d4e-8f76-d04fd6d181ce\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1961)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brefusal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1973)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brentry</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With Sir Edward Heath having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/the-highs-and-lows-of-britains-47-years-in-the-eec-and-eu\">signed the accession treaty</a> the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1975)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Referendum</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\".

  "<p>All adults in England will be considered organ donors when they die, after a change to the law this week that will presume consent unless the family intervenes or the individual opts out.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/26/organ-donation-law-change-save-lives-max-johnson\">At present 80% of adults in England</a> say they would consider becoming a donor, but fewer than 40% have signed up to the current register.

Of the survivors taken to hospital in the aftermath, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/white-island-eruption-what-we-know-so-far\">27 had burns to more than 30% of the body</a>.</p> <p>Medical authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/new-zealand-surgeons-working-non-stop-to-help-volcano-victims\">said 1.2 million sq</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/new-zealand-surgeons-working-non-stop-to-help-volcano-victims\"> cm</a> of skin had been ordered from the US to treat the wounded. The tissue was to be used for temporary dressings until the victims\u2019 skin recovered and could be grafted.</p> <p>The Liverpool site, which holds human tissues from bone to tendons and corneas, offered skin to New Zealand from its stocks \u2013 the bank currently holds 500,000 sq cm of the tissue, with each packet lasting five years.</p> <p>But Gillan said that during the London Olympics, the bank built up a far larger stock in case of a terror incident. \u201cWe ended up going for a million sq cm of skin because we decided that there [are] only so many beds available, and surgeons.\u201d </p> <p>Trained teams have just 24 hours after death in which to retrieve tissues, often from hospital mortuaries. Gillan says about twice a week, donations are transported to the Liverpool site, either to train staff or because the required tissue is unusual with retrieval carried out in the dedicated donation facility.</p> <p>But donation does not only occur after death. Bone can come from living donors \u2013 often those who are having procedures such as hip replacements \u2013 while the service also provides \u201cartificial tears\u201d produced from blood serum for patients who have dry eyes, and amniotic membrane from women who have given birth by elective caesarean section.</p> <p>\u201cIt is full of nutrients and growth factors, so it helps regenerating the surface of the eye when a burn happens,\u201d said Sajjad Ahmad, a consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Moorfields eye hospital.</p> <p>But many organ and tissue recipients are upbeat about the changes. Andy Coghlan, 34, was born with a heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot and received a new heart valve aged 15. He thinks the new rules will make a difference to tissue donation.</p> <p>\u201c[Signing the register] is the sort of thing you think \u2018oh yeah I should really do that\u2019 and then you don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. While Coghlan welcomed the continued requirement for family consent, he is optimistic about the new system. \u201cPersonally I think it is fantastic because it will save more lives, that is the bottom line for me.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Barely a week after racing resumed in France, the sport there suffered a major blow on Tuesday when a new government decree said it could not continue in areas particularly affected by Covid-19, described as red zones. That means most of the major tracks will have to be shuttered once more, including Longchamp, Chantilly and Auteuil, which was due to stage the French version of jump racing\u2019s Gold Cup a week on Sunday.<br><br>The news will cause many a furrowed brow among British racing officials, desperate to convince ministers that it will be safe for the sport here to resume from 1 June. A successful resumption over the Channel seemed a significant point in their favour but in view of such a rapid backtrack they may now feel inclined to pretend France does not exist.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/relief-as-pinatubo-stays-unbeaten-dewhurst-win-2000-guineas\">Relief and elation as Pinatubo stays unbeaten with Dewhurst win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The French sport can continue in green zones, which include a lot of lower-profile tracks as well as Deauville, which will surely now stage the French 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas early next month. One possible question, yet to be addressed by officials, is whether the large number of trainers based at Chantilly will still be allowed to send their horses to racecourses in green zones.<br><br>France-Galop, the ruling body, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/francegalop/status/1262775904578699264\">broke the news</a> by announcing it had heard on Tuesday of a new governmental decree to be published in the coming days which would prevent racing taking place in red zones. Its statement pointed out that the specified sanitary measures had been strictly observed since racing resumed at Longchamp at the beginning of last week and no problems are known to have arisen.<br><br>Officials are hastily redrafting the fixture list from Thursday, when the new law is expected to take effect. In the meantime they may have to consider whether someone powerful is lobbying against them, as there was a previous attempt to change the government\u2019s mind about resumption a fortnight ago.<br><br>Meanwhile, Charlie Appleby has broken his silence to enthuse over Pinatubo, hot favourite for the 2,000 Guineas, scheduled for 6 June. \u201cHe has grown and strengthened over winter,\u201d the Newmarket trainer said of a horse who was the highest-rated juvenile in Europe for 25 years and is no bigger than 6-5 in the betting for the year\u2019s first Classic.<br><br>\u201cWe are not going to have conclusive proof until the Guineas but my gut feeling is that Pinatubo has trained on. His demeanour is the same from two to three. He remains totally relaxed. Provided there are no hiccups, I think he will give a very good account of himself.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Wednesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>At a tight track like Happy Valley, horses that were unlucky in running last time can easily be unlucky again. But if <strong>Seize The Spirit (12.45) </strong>gets a better run through this afternoon, he should be a big player in the third race on today\u2019s card in Hong Kong, to be shown live on Sky Sports Racing.</p> \n<p>Wearing colours that might stir up some bad dreams for those who used to back Latalomne at Cheltenham, Seize The Spirit broke alertly last time but his claiming rider sought to settle him by taking him back in the field in a race where it paid to be handy. They lost several more places down the back as others barged past them before forging forwards in the straight.</p> \n<p>With the horse\u2019s stamina for a mile seemingly assured, Vincent Ho gets a chance to make a better fist of it today and the pair look overpriced at 6-1. Seize The Spirit looks up to winning in this grade and perhaps third time back from a break will be the charm, as it was when he scored at Sha Tin in February.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a76d998e-d4b0-4d00-8afb-773eddb4064c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Tips by Chris Cook</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Happy Valley&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>11.45</b> Happy Good Guys <b>12.15</b> Salto Olimpico <b>12.45</b> Seize The Spirit <b>1.15</b> Allied Agility <b>1.45 </b>Hero Time <b>2.15</b> Simply Fluke <b>2.45</b> Brave King <b>3.15</b> Golden Dash <b>3.50</b> This Is Class</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Allied Agility (1.15)</strong> has been backed overnight but there\u2019s still some 9-2 around for the sprinter, whose defeat of Larson last time is strong form.

  "<p>The effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.</p> <p>For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and<br> is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest \u2013 its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.</p> <p>Qwest\u2019s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.</p> <p>\u201cWe pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,\u201d says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn\u2019t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. \u201cWe get a real sense of achievement. We\u2019ve got nine engineers and some days we\u2019re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone\u2019s working from home at the moment \u2013 only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise \u2013 so they\u2019re champing at the bit to help the community. We\u2019ve developed a \u2018wheel of fortune\u2019, so if we get a phone call saying: \u2018I need two engineers to help out volunteering\u2019, I spin and pick an engineer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"416ff012d0ef44b7addd0704ad04900cbbac685a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/416ff012d0ef44b7addd0704ad04900cbbac685a/514_288_4516_3484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leon Cooke and his team have swapped many of their usual maintenance roles to deliver welfare packages .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"771\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leon Cooke and his team have swapped many of their usual maintenance roles to deliver welfare packages .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shot remotely by P\u00e5l Hansen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Delivering parcels isn\u2019t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council\u2019s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.</p> <p>Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. \u201cHe was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,\u201d says Cooke.</p> <p>Cummins adds: \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they\u2019d go in and help.\u201d</p> <p>Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.</p> <p>On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn\u2019t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man \u2013 and his dog. \u201cOur staff know the right thing to do,\u201d says Cummins. \u201cThey\u2019re highly competent and caring individuals. They don\u2019t do the job just for the money \u2013 they do it because they care.\u201d</p> <p>Delivering food parcels isn\u2019t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council\u2019s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b10e2833122abcee86dcccbe35c0f3e6c74e02ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b10e2833122abcee86dcccbe35c0f3e6c74e02ef/776_232_4368_3490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Qwest managing director, Ben Cummins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"799\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qwest managing director, Ben Cummins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shot remotely by P\u00e5l Hansen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn\u2019t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. \u201cOne of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else\u2019s. It\u2019s about doing the right thing and recognising that we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of pride. We have a really close team \u2013 we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there\u2019s no chance of him going anywhere, but he\u2019s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We\u2019re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/19/by-friday-we-had-a-prototype-the-race-to-create-ventilators-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">'By Friday, we had a prototype': the race to create ventilators during the coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cummins says: \u201cThe question we\u2019ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don\u2019t do it, who will? There\u2019s risk in everything you do, but it\u2019s about balancing that risk, otherwise we\u2019d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It\u2019s proportional, it\u2019s managed risk.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing I\u2019d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don\u2019t notice it\u2019s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.\u201d</p> <p>This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: \u201cThe way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it.

It was proposed by the deputy prime minister on 31 March, <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/international-transgender-day-of-visibility\">International Transgender Day of Visibility</a>, and amendments submitted by opposition parties were discarded one by one on Tuesday.</p> <p>The law has been roundly condemned both at home and abroad. Bernadett Sz\u00e9l, an opposition MP who spoke out strongly against the bill in parliament, described it as evil.</p> <p>Trans people and advocates say the bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/hungary-prepares-to-end-legal-recognition-of-trans-people\">will lead to increased discrimination against the community</a>, especially as Hungarian daily life requires people to show their identity cards frequently. It also means that trans people will not be able to choose a name that fits with their identified gender, as Hungarian law requires first names to be chosen from a list kept by the country\u2019s Academy of Sciences, which is sorted according to gender.</p> <p>\u201cIt basically means coming out as trans to complete strangers, all the time,\u201d Ivett \u00d6rd\u00f6g, a 39-year-old trans woman living in Budapest, told the Guardian last month.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.hatter.hu/\">H\u00e1tt\u00e9r </a><a href=\"http://en.hatter.hu/\">Society</a>, a Hungarian trans rights group, said on Tuesday that the law violated international human rights norms and went against the case law of the European court of human rights, as well as previous rulings of the Hungarian constitutional court.</p> <p>Since 2017, legal gender changes in the country have effectively been frozen, and now the backlog of people waiting for the legal procedure will all be rejected, along with any new applicants. Because the new category will list \u201csex at birth\u201d, there are also fears it could be used to target trans people who have already legally changed their gender.</p> <p>Krisztina Tam\u00e1s-S\u00e1r\u00f3y of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/\">Amnesty International</a> said: \u201cThis decision pushes Hungary back towards the dark ages and tramples the rights of transgender and intersex people.

  "<p>If anyone were to fall gravely ill and be admitted to hospital, we would all hope that our family and friends would be in the ward alongside us to help nurse us back to health. But for those with Covid-19, the contagious nature of the virus means this simply just isn\u2019t possible.</p> <p>\u201cI read the stories about Italian patients dying in intensive care units (ICU) and the families not being with them,\u201d says Louise Rose, professor of critical care nursing at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt\u2019s totally distressing. It\u2019s just a very basic human need, wanting to be together by someone\u2019s bedside at that time. That those suffering with Covid-19 would have no connection with their loved ones really moved me.\u201d</p> <p>We are arguably more connected than ever: there are 3.8 billion social media users around the world, Skype has 40 million daily active users and more than 65bn WhatsApp messages are sent each day. But as Rose watched the death toll rise \u2013 and with the pandemic set to spread across Europe and the US \u2013 surely, she reasoned, there must be some way of using technological advances to bring families with members in hospital together?</p> <p>Rose was introduced to Dr Joel Meyer, a critical care consultant at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospital and together they developed Life Lines, a communication app that allows virtual visits to loved ones\u2019 bedsides through video calling, a vital scheme for palliative care during the pandemic.</p> <p>Rose and Meyer\u2019s collaboration started out when they asked friends and contacts for iPads and other tablets to use in contacting patients\u2019 next of kin. Meyer says: \u201cIt was probably six weeks from me and Louise talking over the initial idea to us testing the app with staff acting as patients at St Thomas\u2019, then two days later trialling it on the ICU.\u201d</p> <p>The speed of the rollout was a necessity for all of those at the frontline, who were dealing with harrowing scenes. Meyer says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear the idea a family might miss the chance to see their loved one before they died, so the fact we have enabled that, and made those final goodbyes happen means such a lot to me.\u201d</p> <p>The pair quickly mapped out the etiquette of using the secure app, Meyer explains, because there\u2019s no avoiding that the circumstances of having to use the device can be uncomfortable at first. \u201cTo begin, we have to use the selfie camera to introduce ourselves and prepare the family for the fact their loved one is on a ventilator and that could be distressing,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we take the tablet to the patient\u2019s bedside. When the relatives are ready, we flip the camera from selfie, so they can see the patient, and narrate the call. We help the patient and their family navigate it.\u201d</p> <p>As well as facilitating the video call between the patient and caller, doctors and nurses are able to update the family on the patient\u2019s progress \u2013 delicate situations that would only have been carried out face-to-face prior to Covid-19. \u201cThe worst conversations are when we have to explain their loved one might not make it,\u201d says Meyer. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but those talks are never perfect. And if we\u2019re giving a family bad news, we will follow up with check-in calls and make sure they are OK \u2013 that they know we are there to talk.</p> <p>\u201cBut that empathy can still be there over a video connection, emotional cues can be seen and body language detected and we can respond to that. In some ways it flattens out any hierarchy, so they are less nervous to ask doctors questions, as we\u2019re all on the same level, the same interface: the doctor, nurse and family.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the UK\u2019s high death rate, there are some stories of hope in the pandemic \u2013 and Life Lines has helped to facilitate some of these moments. Meyer says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a marriage proposal \u2013 a man who was just about able to speak, having just come off a ventilator, wanted to propose to his girlfriend, so we helped arrange that. And she said yes! Scenes like that, they really brighten all our days.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also quite common for patients to want to chat to their pets,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/19/by-friday-we-had-a-prototype-the-race-to-create-ventilators-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">'By Friday, we had a prototype': the race to create ventilators during the coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the other end of line to the patients are their families. Diane, whose husband was hospitalised and spent 15 days on a ventilator due to Covid-19 earlier this year, says: \u201cSeeing him on screen, even when he couldn\u2019t respond, gave me hope. I just told him how much I loved him, how proud of him I was and how much our kids and grandkids were missing him. The first time he was able to talk was when he\u2019d been off the ventilator for three days and his first words to me were: \u2018I love you.\u2019 I cried and cried.\u201d</p> <p>Life Lines \u2013 which has been developed through the secure online platform aTouchAway, created by Michel Paquet \u2013 has currently provided 1,046 tablets to ICUs countrywide, and 15,000 video calls have been made to those in need. The project has been supported by a number of academics, charities and companies, including BT, Google, King\u2019s College, Aetonix and King\u2019s Health Partners, but the young scheme is still fundraising to provide more tablets, software and 4G capabilities to equip more ICUs across the country.</p> <p>It\u2019s been \u201ca rollercoaster journey\u201d say Rose and Meyer. But the ultimate end goal for the project is to see critically ill patients through their hospitalisation, until they are discharged and able to return home to their families. Diane adds: \u201cI asked my husband whether he\u2019d heard my voice when he was so ill on the ventilator, fighting for his life, and he said he remembered hearing me and that it had given him strength.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Donations to Life Lines can be made here: <a href=\"https://justgiving.com/campaign/life-lines\" rel=\"nofollow\">justgiving.com/campaign/life-lines</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Adding more up-to-date death tolls reported to regulators and deaths of care home residents in hospitals to 1 May, it means 14,835 care residents have died from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>UK care homes are demanding a significant increase in testing of staff and residents, up to three times a week, amid fears a lifting of the lockdown could spark new outbreaks.</p> \n<p>So far, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has promised only that all care home residents and staff will be tested by 6 June, but no commitment has been made for repeat testing.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are often finding their tests aren\u2019t arriving on time or being taken away on time,\u201d said Green. \u201cWe are looking at delays of eight to 10 days until people get results.\u201d</p> \n<p>The call for routine testing was echoed by Sir David Behan, the chief executive of HC-One, the largest private provider, and Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, the largest charitable provider.</p> \n<p>Vic Rayner, the executive director at the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care operators, said the promise of 30,000 tests a day was enough only for one test each for care residents and staff.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat that means is you haven\u2019t got the right tools and resources to manage outbreaks within homes and identify when and where infections might have come in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging for providers to operate in that climate. It is absolutely critical that we get that repeat testing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The committee also heard warnings about the continued risk posed by temporary care workers spreading the virus if they work in more than one home.

On that date, Taiwan sent a letter to the WHO noting the reported spate of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, and that the patients were in isolation, and asking for further details.</p> \n<p>China described Trump\u2019s letter as slanderous and health experts said Trump\u2019s criticisms of the WHO could only be effectively addressed by giving the WHO new powers over the health policies of nation states, something Trump would resist if they were applied to the US.</p> \n<p>The WHO leadership itself made no initial response to the Trump letter, but the resolution that passed on Tuesday affirms the WHO\u2019s central role leading on global health. A subsidiary US attempt to change the resolution\u2019s wording on universal access to vaccines has met resistance from African nations. The US wished to include language on incentivising innovation that would give companies guarantees about profits from vaccines.</p> \n<p>The medical journal the Lancet, which was incorrectly mentioned in Trump\u2019s letter as having published a report on the virus in late 2019, issued a statement setting the record straight on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis statement is factually incorrect,\u201d the Lancet said. \u201cThe Lancet published no report in December 2019, referring to a virus or outbreak in Wuhan or anywhere else in China \u2026 The allegations levelled against the WHO in President Trump\u2019s letter are serious and damaging to efforts to strengthen international cooperation to control this pandemic. It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU diplomats, aware that the WHO has become a stage prop in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, have been focusing on trying to minimise the US-China clash at the assembly, and still hope the compromise resolution can minimise the damage, and possibly pave the way for Trump to delay a final break from the WHO.</p> \n<p>In Brussels, the EU threw its weight behind the WHO, urging all countries to support it in the wake of Trump\u2019s continued attacks. \u201cThis is the time for solidarity,\u201d said the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson. \u201cIt is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation.</p> \n<p>Welcoming what had been a victory for EU diplomacy, the bloc\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, pointedly distanced himself from Trump\u2019s criticisms, saying: \u201cThe resolution underlines the importance of responding to this crisis through solidarity and multilateral cooperation under the umbrella of the United Nations. We commend the WHO for its leading role in guiding the response to this crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>He reiterated the EU\u2019s call for vaccine research to be shared and said the WHO would hold a lessons learned inquiry.</p> \n<p>The WHO regularly conducts reviews into its handling of major epidemics, so the real battle if the US stays in the UN body would be over issues such as the precise terms of reference and the identity of the inquiry chair.</p> \n<p>The loss of US funding to the WHO would be a severe blow since the US contributed more than $400m to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget. WHO funding is in need of reform since the overstretched body is heavily dependent on one-off voluntary contributions from nations and philanthropists such as the Gates Foundation. Many European states share the desire to reform the WHO, but find Trump\u2019s threats counterproductive since they only entrench Chinese influence with Africa, and make the reform cause harder.</p> \n<p>Overall, China seemed content with the WHA\u2019s direction, sensing that the US tactics had left Trump increasingly isolated. </p> \n<p>China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump\u2019s letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao said. </p> \n<p>The US decided not to resist the resolution, but put out a statement disassociating itself from a section in the resolution that favoured equal access to the intellectual property of any coronavirus medicines, such as a vaccine. </p> \n<p>At the White House Trump refused to back down, insisting the WHO will \u201chave to clean up their act, they have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the United States or we\u2019re not going to be involved with them and we\u2019ll do it in a separate way.\u201d</p>",

Donald Trump seems to think that if he yells \u201cObamagate\u201d often enough and loud enough, it will magic a scandal into existence and send his arch-nemeses, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, to jail.</p> <p>On Monday, the US attorney general, William Barr, burst his boss\u2019s bubble and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/obamagate-investigations-barr-dashes-trump-hopes-obama-biden\">dismissed the possibility</a> of a criminal investigation into Obama or Biden. Because, you know, they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Trump responded to Barr\u2019s statement in his usual fashion: sulking like a petulant child and saying: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1262475642836258818?s=20\">Well, if it was me they would [investigate]</a>\u201d before continuing to babble incoherently.</p> <p>It may be wishful thinking, but I have a feeling that one reason Trump is so keen to accuse Obama and Biden of criminality is because he is starting to get nervous about going to jail himself. Last week, Biden pledged that, if elected president, he wouldn\u2019t use his executive powers to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/15/joe-biden-pledges-not-to-pardon-trump-2\">pardon Trump of potential crimes</a>. This wasn\u2019t the first time the presumptive Democratic nominee has said he wouldn\u2019t go easy on Trump. In October, Biden told an <a href=\"https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/10/13/biden-says-if-hes-elected-in-2020-he-will-not-pardon-trump/\">Iowa radio station</a> that it had been a mistake for Gerald Ford to pardon his predecessor, Richard Nixon, after Watergate in 1974. Pardoning Trump, Biden said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t unite [the US]\u201d and would send the message that some people are above the law.</p> <p>Of course, as it stands, the US president is above the law. In 1973, amid the Watergate scandal, the Department of Justice adopted the position that a sitting president is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer/can-a-sitting-us-president-face-criminal-charges-idUSKCN1QF1D3\">constitutionally immune</a>\u201d from criminal prosecution, a position it reaffirmed in 2000. As long as he is president, Trump is safe.</p> <p>When he leaves office, however, it is another matter: there are a host of charges he might face. These include <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-prison-after-office-mueller-863027/\">obstruction of justice</a> charges in relation to the Russia investigation; illegally withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate his political rivals; and soliciting campaign donations from foreign nationals \u2013 all of which Trump denies. According to the investigative site the Intercept, the laws Trump has potentially broken in his interaction with Ukraine and China as president could land him <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/trump-crimes-law/\">10 years in prison</a>.</p> <p>And it is not just Trump\u2019s conduct as president that has opened him to potential legal trouble. There is also the matter of his financial and tax dealings, which are the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/supreme-court-donald-trump-tax-returns\">numerous lawsuits</a>.</p> <p>Importantly, how long Trump stays in power has a bearing on any potential legal liability. The statute of limitations on obstruction of justice charges, for example, is only <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-and-obstruction-of-justice-what-is-the-statute-of-limitations-against-donald-trump-2019-07-25/\">five years</a>. So if Trump gets another term, he will run down the clock on that. Honestly, if you want to do the crime without doing the time, it really pays to be president.</p> <p>If Trump ever goes to jail, it will be one of the happiest days of my life. Not everyone is so enthusiastic about \u201clocking him up\u201d, however. Earlier this year, the then Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said that, if he were president, he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/02/pardon-trump-andrew-yang-2020-110331\">wouldn\u2019t investigate Trump</a>: \u201cIf you look at history around the world, it\u2019s a very, very nasty pattern that developing countries have fallen into, where a new president ends up throwing the president before them in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Look, I understand that the US, where people die because they <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/diabetes-josh-wilkerson-death-age-counter-insulin-cost-lost-private-health-insurance-american-doctor-a9039656.html\">can\u2019t afford diabetes medication</a>, doesn\u2019t want to be like a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d. Nevertheless, there is a very nasty pattern into which authoritarian regimes have fallen, where the leader does whatever they like with no repercussions. I am not sure the US wants to be like that, either.</p> <p>I have no idea what the chances of Trump ending up in prison are, but I am pretty sure he is not happy that there is even a small possibility he might swap the White House for the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/big_house\">big house</a>\u201d. But his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/498367-poll-trump-approval-on-economy-jobs-drops-amid-economic-fallout\">approval ratings are dropping</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/17/politics/state-polls-2020-analysis/index.html\">chances of a President Biden are rising</a>. That means Trump is going to do everything he can to win re-election in November; he is not just fighting for another term, he is also fighting for his freedom. He is fighting to avoid the possibility of a Trumpgate.</p> <p>\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

If you are not contacted, that means your information has not been accessed, easyJet said.</p> <p>The airline added there was no evidence that any of the personal information had been misused. However, it is still early days in terms of this incident.</p> <h2><strong>Who was behind this?</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s no confirmation on that yet \u2013 the airline said only that the attack came from \u201ca highly sophisticated source\u201d, and that it has now \u201cclosed off this unauthorised access\u201d. It added that as soon as it became aware of the incident, it took immediate steps to respond and engaged forensic experts to investigate.</p> <h2><strong>I\u2019m one of those affected \u2013 or I\u2019m worried I might be. What should I do?</strong></h2> <p>The ICO recommended easyJet advise its customers about protective steps they can take to minimise any risk of potential phishing. In its most typical form, phishing is where people receive emails purporting to be from a company or organisation that attempt to make contact and/or seek money.</p> <p>Those who might be affected should be very wary of anyone who calls up or emails claiming to be from easyJet, or anyone else. The airline said: \u201cWe are advising customers to continue to be alert as they would normally be, especially should they receive any unsolicited communications. We also advise customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from easyJet or easyJet Holidays.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What else can I do?</strong></h2> <p>Keep a close eye on credit card bills for anything untoward. You should change any passwords on affected accounts \u2013 and also any others if you used the same password elsewhere.</p> <p>If you get a call from your bank or card company saying it has noticed fraudulent transactions, be on your guard. End the call and then phone the bank or card company back to check it was legitimate. Also, don\u2019t hand over any passcodes or passwords to anyone, whoever they claim to be.</p> <p>Further down the line, and if necessary, a credit reference check will show up if anyone has applied for credit in your name.</p> <p>Customers can also find further advice at <a href=\"http://www.actionfraud.police.co.uk/\">www.actionfraud.police.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The European commission will launch a sweeping effort to tackle the global biodiversity crisis on Wednesday, including a call for 3bn trees to be planted in the EU by 2030 and a plan to better protect the continent\u2019s last primeval forests.</p> \n<p>The draft policy document, <a href=\"https://www.arc2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Biodiversity-Strategy_draft_200423_ARC2020.pdf\">published online</a> by an environmental NGO, admits that to date in the EU, \u201cprotection has been incomplete, restoration has been small-scale, and the implementation and enforcement of legislation has been insufficient\u201d.</p> \n<p>Scientists and environmental groups, commenting on the leaked draft of the strategy, say that while the new goals are welcome and impressive, there is a still distinct lack of tools with which to implement them.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good and ambitious document, but what is also obvious is the lack of strategy of how to implement it, and a lack of discussion of why previous documents of this type failed,\u201d said Przemys\u0142aw Chylarecki of the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p> \n<p>The new strategy calls for nearly one-third of EU land and sea to become protected zones. Currently, 26% of land and 11% of seas are classed as protected areas, but the European commission acknowledges this has not been enough to tackle the degradation of the natural world and threat of extinction to some birds and animals. Environmentalists say even these previous targets for protection have not been met in practice.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe proposed strategy lacks game-changing ideas and instruments for reaching the targets. We already know today that existing frameworks are not delivering, so why should we wait,\u201d said Robert Cyglicki, programme director of Greenpeace in central and eastern Europe. </p> \n<p>He welcomed the new strategy but said it would be 2024 before it became clear if new binding measures would be adopted, and called for immediate discussions over funding and enforcement mechanisms.</p> \n<p>Some elements of the programme, such as protecting migratory bird populations, are hard to implement without a global approach, and the paper calls on the EU to intensify efforts to make biodiversity a central part of its diplomacy. </p> \n<p>It concludes that global efforts to tackle the biodiversity crisis under the auspices of the UN have been \u201cinsufficient to halt the loss of the world\u2019s biodiversity\u201d.</p> \n<p>It will also turn the spotlight on the EU\u2019s \u20ac60bn-a-year common agricultural policy, which has been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/europe-must-act-on-intensive-farming-to-save-wildlife-scientists-say\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/europe-must-act-on-intensive-farming-to-save-wildlife-scientists-say\">criticised for fuelling a steep decline in nature</a>, with a call for a quarter of the EU\u2019s agricultural land to be organically farmed by 2030.</p> \n<p>Environmentalists warned the plan\u2019s headline target to plant at least 3bn trees by 2030, \u201cin full respect of ecological principles\u201d, should only be a small part of the solution.</p> \n<p>\u201cPlanting 3bn trees is a really spectacular and visual goal, but it <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/580\">has been shown</a> that planting new trees is not a panacea and doesn\u2019t always help,\u201d said Chylarecki.</p> \n<p>More important will be the goal to map, monitor and \u201cstrictly protect\u201d the EU\u2019s last remaining primeval forests, which have survived in almost every member state, but remain threatened by human activity, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/violence-escalates-as-romania-cracks-down-on-illegal-timber-trade\">illegal logging.</a></p> \n<p>These older forests provide a natural shield against climate change, but in many countries have been preyed on by logging companies, with national governments either ignoring the situation or lacking the resources to properly police logging.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4eb2f7a2-6a6a-48dc-bdba-225172592cd7\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are about <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14967\">three trillion trees on the planet</a> and they play a major role in producing the oxygen we all breathe. But twice as many existed before the start of human civilisation.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Today, 10 billion more trees are cut down than are planted every year. This destruction is a significant contributor to the carbon emissions that are driving the climate crisis. However, trees draw carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere as they grow, and planting trees will need to play an important part in ending the climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Forests are also a vital and rich habitat for wildlife. Earth is at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">start of a sixth mass extinction</a> of species and the razing of forests and other ecosystems is the biggest contributor to the losses. Tropical rainforests are especially important, hosting 50% of known terrestrial species on only 6% of the world\u2019s land. Trees are also important in controlling regional rainfall, as they evaporate water from their leaves.</p>\n    <p>In urban areas, the shade from trees has been shown to both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/21/urban-heat-islands-cooling-things-down-with-trees-green-roads-and-fewer-cars\">cool city streets</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37813709\">reduce levels of air pollution</a>.

He said the strategy \u201cseems more ambitious than the previous one but there are still areas for improvement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Luena said EU member states needed to comply with existing laws, noting that in the last week alone, the European commission launched legal action against 19 governments over failures on EU environmental law \u2013 a tally of charges far from unusual in the commission\u2019s monthly round up of infringement proceedings.</p> \n<p>Sweden and Latvia have been accused of not implementing parts of the EU\u2019s birds and habitats directives, Malta is faulted for not conserving endangered bluefin tuna, while France, Cyprus and Lithuania are said to have neglected to write EU air pollution standards into national law.</p> \n<p>The EU should also offer funding benefits for those governments serious about hitting targets, said campaigners.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the EU level we need some sort of financial stimulus that would make it attractive for countries to focus on biodiversity,\u201d said Marta Grundland, a campaigner with Greenpeace Poland. </p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a EU priority or a national priority. After climate this is the second biggest threat we are facing, and it\u2019s all connected. If we want to help with the climate crisis we should also tackle the biodiversity crisis.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the lockdown restrictions begin to be eased across the UK, more workers are being asked to return to the workplace.</p> <p>The government has said that employees should only be asked to go back if they cannot do their job from home, so if you can, your employer should not be asking you to travel in to work.</p> <p>If you do need to go to your workplace, your employer is obliged to make sure you will be safe there. Employment lawyer <a href=\"https://www.mattgingell.com/\">Matt Gingell</a> says: \u201cEmployers have a general duty to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of all of their employees.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s a guide to your rights if your employer wants you back in the workplace.</p> <h2>How much notice should I be given that I have to return?</h2> <p>\u201cIf employees are unable to work from home, employers can ask employees to return to work and, technically, no notice is required,\u201d says Gingell.</p> <p>Solicitor and consumer law expert <a href=\"https://www.jajsolicitors.co.uk/people/\">Gary Rycroft</a> says there is no notice period written into law \u201cbut giving at least 48 hours\u2019 notice should allow either side to have discussions and air any concerns or even official \u2018grievances\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The advisory group Acas says employers need to check if there are any arrangements in place with unions or similar about notice. It advises: \u201cEmployees and workers should be ready to return to work at short notice, but employers should be flexible where possible.\u201d</p> <p>So while your employer could ask you to return straight away, a good employer would understand if there were things you needed to put in place first, and give you chance to do so.</p> <h2>What if I was furloughed?</h2> <p>When you were furloughed your employer should have outlined what would happen when it wanted you to go back to work, and this may have a clause saying that you have to return as soon as you are asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe termination of the furlough agreement and when an employee will be expected to return to work will depend on the provisions of the agreement,\u201d says Gingell. Again, though, even if there is no notice period, a good employer should realise that you may need some time to prepare.</p> <p>If you have been furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme, your employer can\u2019t ask you to go in and do ad hoc days, or work part-time. They would need to take you off furlough and renegotiate your contract with you.</p> <h2>Can they ask me to go back in part-time?</h2> <p>Not, currently, if you have been furloughed and they are using the government scheme to pay you. It only allows companies to furlough people for all of their normal hours, and bans them from asking you to do any work while you are off.</p> <p>But if your company has not claimed government money to cover your wages, it can ask you to resume work part-time. Make sure you understand the terms of the request \u2013 your employer cannot adjust your contract without your permission, so if it is asking you to change your hours you should get advice.</p> <h2>Can they ask me to take a pay cut?</h2> <p>\u201cThe law here is the same as it would be if an employer made the same request in the normal course of an employee\u2019s employment. Reducing hours and/or pay are deemed to be such fundamental changes to an employee\u2019s terms and conditions that the employee concerned should be consulted and then agree in writing,\u201d says Rycroft.</p> <p>He points out that for some employers \u201cthis may be the only economically viable option\u201d, and the alternative, if people refuse, could be redundancies. To make more than 20 people redundant there will need to be collective consultation.</p> <h2>What if I am in a vulnerable group or live with someone who is?</h2> <p>No special rules have been put in place to protect people in these groups who are asked to go into work but some already exist \u2013 if you are disabled or pregnant, for example, your employer has extra obligations.</p> <p>Rycroft says some employees may be able to argue that it will be discriminatory to force them to attend work outside the home. \u201cIt is all a question of degrees, in terms of how the employer can show that they have listened to legitimate concerns and made reasonable adjustments,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If you are pregnant your employer is obliged to make sure you can do your job safely. This can mean allowing you to do your job from home, or giving you a new role which can be done remotely. If your employer refuses either of these options, and you do not feel safe going into work you should take advice. <a href=\"https://www.employmentsolicitor.com/pregnancy-work-covid19/\">Employmentsolicitor.com says that you could be able to argue for a medical suspension</a> on full pay, which will allow you to stay at home.</p> <p>Living with someone who is vulnerable or especially at risk is not necessarily a reason an employee can refuse to return to work, says Rycroft. \u201cHowever, you can, as an employee raise a grievance and ask to be listened to and hopefully a compromise may be agreed, such as unpaid leave or using up annual holiday. But if an employer can show that a workplace is safe, the employer may insist on an employee attending.\u201d</p> <h2>What if I have childcare to worry about?</h2> <p>Legally, you can take time off to look after any dependants \u2013 these could be children, or older relatives. This time is typically unpaid. If you are currently furloughed and your employer does not have enough work for everyone to go back full-time, they may agree to leave you on furlough so you can continue to earn 80% of your normal pay.</p> <h2>What information should they give me in advance?</h2> <p>Rycroft says there is no law saying that employers should provide information before you return, but the government guidance to employers recommends that they do. He says this information \u2013 written or verbal \u2013 should cover how they are making your workplace safe in light of the pandemic. So you should be told what is happening to ensure social distancing and hygiene. \u201cThis will allow employees to understand how their health and safety at work is being addressed.</p> <h2>Can I refuse to go back?</h2> <p>Yes, if you believe there is a real danger to going to work. \u201cIf an employee refuses to return to the workplace due to the employee reasonably believing imminent and serious danger and is then dismissed for that reason the employee could, depending on the circumstances, have a claim for unfair dismissal,\u201d Gingell says.</p> <p>\u201cThe requirement that the employee has to believe that there is imminent and serious danger, does limit the right.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, you cannot refuse. \u201cIf someone refuses to attend work without a valid reason, it could result in disciplinary action,\u201d says Acas. But you may be able to make other arrangements with your employer \u2013 perhaps you can use holiday or take unpaid leave, or if you have concerns about something like travelling at peak time, they may be willing to accommodate different shifts. Your employer does not have to agree to this, but it is worth asking.</p> <p>Acas has more details on your rights around <a href=\"https://www.acas.org.uk/absence-from-work\">absence from work</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What if I am worried when I see my workplace?</h2> <p>Rycroft says that under section 100 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 employees may leave a place of work where there is an imminent health and safety danger. So if, for example, you return to find social distancing is impossible, you could argue that this is a reason to leave your workplace.</p> <p>But in the first instance you should try to resolve the issue with your boss. Gingell says: \u201cEmployers ought to to listen to the concerns of individuals and be sympathetic and understanding.\u201d</p> <p>If you do not get anywhere with this, you should take advice. If you are in a union, it should have a helpline you can call if there is no rep to speak to on site. <a href=\"https://www.acas.org.uk/\">Acas</a> is another port of call, as is <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\">Citizens Advice</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf the employer has breached the implied obligation to provide a safe working environment and/or trust and confidence an employee could, again, depending on the circumstances, resign swiftly as a result and claim constructive unfair dismissal,\u201d says Gingell. But he says you should get advice before taking this action.</p> <p>\u201cAnother option for employees to consider is contactIng the Health and Safety Executive, which enforces health and safety legislation,\u201d he says.</p>",
  "<p>Ailing fashion retailer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/french-connection\">French Connection</a> has warned it will run out of cash within the next few months unless it secures a cash injection or sees an improvement in sales.</p> <p>The retailer, which was forced to close all 68 of its stores and concessions in the UK as well as many overseas outlets in March as part of measures to control the spread of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>, said it had seen a significant reduction in sales.</p> <p>While online trade has jumped 44% and the brand continues to receive wholesale orders from some customers as some of its stores in Europe have begun to reopen, French Connection said this activity could not support the business. Some wholesale clients in the US have also delayed payments for stock supplied.</p> <p>\u201cIn the light of the company\u2019s current cash position and the continued expected weak trading environment, we have been in active discussions with a number of potential funding partners,\u201d French Connection said in a statement to the stock market.</p> <p>The company, which was founded in 1972 and also owns the Great Plains brand, said it was confident of raising sufficient funds to support the business until trading improved and these talks were \u201cproceeding well\u201d. But the statement made clear: \u201cWithout securing additional funding and should the current Covid impacted trading levels continue, the company\u2019s cash resources will eventually be eroded in the coming months.\u201d</p> <p>French Connection is preparing to reopen UK stores on 1 June, the current deadline for non-essential retailers to restart high street trading under the government\u2019s coronavirus plan. It said: \u201cWe look forward to returning to more normal levels of trade as the situation evolves, although we do not expect this for some time to come.\u201d</p> <p>In an effort to conserve cash, French Connection said that it was talking to landlords about rent holidays or deferments, asking suppliers for discounts or extended payment terms and rescheduling tax payments in the UK. About 90% of its 780 staff are also on furlough under the government\u2019s job protection scheme.</p> <p>The company said it had tried to access further funds from government support schemes but had been unable to do so because of \u201ctight qualification constraints\u201d.</p> <p>French Connection has spent years in the doldrums most recently reporting a \u00a37.3m annual pretax loss after sales fell nearly 12% to \u00a3120m. At the group\u2019s year end in January, the company said cash reserves had halved to \u00a38m.</p> <p>The retailer, more than 40% of which is owned by founder and chairman Stephen Marks, with Mike Ashley\u2019s Fraser Group holding 26% of the company, spent over a year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/08/french-connection-for-sale-stephen-marks-mike-ashley\">looking at \u201cstrategic options\u201d</a>, including a sale of the business.

But the pandemic \u2013 and the city\u2019s homeless policies during the pandemic \u2013 helped create a perfect storm within the neighborhood\u2019s 35 blocks. In order to be able to enforce social distancing guidelines, San Francisco\u2019s overcrowded homeless shelters drastically reduced their capacity. The city made hotel rooms available to homeless people, but only those who had tested positive for the virus or ranked among the most vulnerable.<strong> </strong>Many unhoused people suddenly had no other choice but to take to the streets, some fortunate enough with tents and others making do with what they could find. Amid a lack of testing, it\u2019s unclear how widespread the virus is in the neighborhood, among the housed and unhoused.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Roger Moussa, 51, who has been sleeping on the streets since his shelter bed reservation ran out a month ago. \u201cI feel completely helpless. I have nowhere to go, and every other night I get robbed.\u201d</p> <p>Tents have sprung up throughout San Francisco\u2019s 49 sq miles since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, but in the Tenderloin, the number of tents had exploded by 285% \u2013 268 tents total. Neighborhood residents believe this to be an undercount, with some tallying 432 tents as of last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3/0_0_3996_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This is not a way for people to live, especially now,\u201d said Kathy Looper, owner of the Cadillac Hotel in the Tenderloin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is not a way for people to live, especially now,\u201d said Kathy Looper, owner of the Cadillac Hotel in the Tenderloin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is not a way for people to live, especially now, and the city is not providing any solution,\u201d Looper said. \u201cThey herded everyone into this one neighborhood and said it\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not OK. They created their own Warsaw ghetto.\u201d</p> <p>Several unhoused people said they weren\u2019t trying to make life difficult for the housed Tenderloin residents. Many have community ties, with some living in the supportive housing offered there before becoming homeless again. Given the option, most of them wouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the sidewalk; they didn\u2019t have a choice.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to go into the men\u2019s shelter but they said the corona had came out,\u201d said Abdull Best, 25. \u201cYou can\u2019t get into a new shelter while it\u2019s quarantined. No new residents during the quarantine.\u201d</p> <p>The city has responded with a Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan that includes more public restrooms and hand-washing stations. It <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/14/855588754/san-francisco-shifts-from-trashing-homeless-camps-to-sanctioning-them-amid-covid\">launched</a> several \u201csafe-sleeping sites,\u201d city-sanctioned encampments with access to some amenities and services and identified 13 of the hardest hit blocks for cleaning and clearing. \u201cI want to really recognize that this is going to be a targeted plan, a challenging one, and we are set to be as aggressive as we can in implementing it so that the people in the community can see a difference,\u201d said Mayor London Breed.</p> <p>For many in the neighborhood, it\u2019s yet another empty gesture in a long history of empty gestures. Residents have grown accustomed to being overlooked by the powers that be. Located just three blocks from the towering beaux-arts majesty of city hall, the neighborhood has long been written off as an open-air drug market and homeless hub. Tourists are warned to avoid it. Fox News and conservative media relish in attacking it, splashing live shots of feces and syringes on the pavement as proof of the city\u2019s failings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bacb72688175383a37a2c6c4326329509b07122d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bacb72688175383a37a2c6c4326329509b07122d/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco\u2019s first sanctioned tent encampment is in a fenced-off space near city hall with spaces marked for social distancing and some amenities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco\u2019s first sanctioned tent encampment is in a fenced-off space near city hall with spaces marked for social distancing and some amenities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s also one of the <a href=\"https://default.sfplanning.org/publications_reports/SF_NGBD_SocioEconomic_Profiles/2012-2016_ACS_Profile_Neighborhoods_Final.pdf\">most diverse</a> and densely populated communities in the city: 31% of the neighborhood is Asian, 23% is Latino and 10% is black. In San Francisco, a city with the most <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/9/18537122/billionaire-study-wealthx-san-francisco\">billionaires per capita</a> in the world, the median household income is $104,552. In the Tenderloin, where 30% of the neighborhood is in poverty, the median household income is $23,513.</p> <p>A term frequently used with the Tenderloin is \u201ccontainment zone\u201d. For years, residents have viewed this as the city\u2019s tactic in dealing with the neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s inherent pressure in urban life, with homelessness and drug dealing and mental illness \u2013 just urban realities,\u201d explained David Faigman, dean and chancellor of the UC Hastings Law School, which is located in the neighborhood. \u201cAnd if we can keep it in the Tenderloin, we\u2019re not going to see it in the Marina. We\u2019re not going to see it in Pacific Heights.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, UC Hastings filed a federal lawsuit against the city, joined by the merchants and property association and some other residents. The lawsuit seeks to compel the city to clear the sidewalks and clean the streets by providing healthy and safe options for the unhoused population in the encampments.</p> <p>\u201cWe could have brought a lawsuit 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago and we probably could have had standing,\u201d Faigman said. \u201cWe would have had neighbors who were fed up with what they were dealing with. But what they\u2019re dealing with now is at such a much more profound level. We have a virus that could possibly be deadly, and we don\u2019t know how prevalent the pandemic is out on the streets. You have people in wheelchairs, children and the elderly who need to maneuver around a population that may have a very high rate of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThere has always been an underlying health crisis,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut now it\u2019s a true exigent emergency.\u201d</p> <p>To many in the neighborhood, the city\u2019s homelessness policies amid the pandemic have continued to institutionalize homelessness within the neighborhood borders, rather than try to solve the issue with housing. \u201cThe time they spent writing the plan they could have spent moving people into hotels or sanctioned encampments,\u201d said Randy Shaw, executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic.</p> <p>And many recognize that nothing will change until those without shelter can safely get off the streets. \u201cThere is a literal plague sweeping the country and our city and we are only as safe and as protected as our most vulnerable residents,\u201d said local lawmaker Matt Haney, who represents the Tenderloin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d55662f67cc24f9a87aee9ceafb1e617cc0e0d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d55662f67cc24f9a87aee9ceafb1e617cc0e0d21/0_0_5045_3027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist protests from her vehicle outside Moscone Center in San Francisco, asking Mayor London Breed to house homeless people using vacant hotels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist protests from her vehicle outside Moscone Center in San Francisco, asking Mayor London Breed to house homeless people using vacant hotels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The crisis unfolding in the Tenderloin has created light tension in the world of homeless outreach. Residents\u2019 demands for clearing tents and sweeping encampments can come across as anti-homeless, but many of those advocating for the measures work in homeless outreach. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re against homeless people \u2013 it\u2019s that \u201cno one should be in those tents\u201d, Shaw said. \u201cEveryone should agree they should either be in hotels or in supervised encampments. They shouldn\u2019t be on sidewalks in the Tenderloin.\u201d</p> <p>There needs to be concern for the housed residents of the Tenderloin as well, Shaw said, many of whom do not have the luxury to work from home and have to make their way through the crowded streets every day.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a level of despair in the Tenderloin that I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWhat does it say to these families that the city government will allow these conditions to proliferate right on the sidewalks? It sends a message that they\u2019re not valued at all.\u201d</p> <p>One week after the city announced its Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan, tents and makeshift structures still crammed the sidewalks, their occupants never too far away. The few public restrooms available had lines down the street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2dc75a6d154d6b20bf711f0a5d6a744b0696bd61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dc75a6d154d6b20bf711f0a5d6a744b0696bd61/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians walk by homeless encampments in the Tenderloin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedestrians walk by homeless encampments in the Tenderloin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city has recommended establishing a testing site as part of its Tenderloin assessment report and has begun setting up the sanctioned encampments. Homeless outreach advocates worry that it won\u2019t be enough. The camps must still adhere to social distancing, so they will only accept a limited number of people. Priority is going to the medically vulnerable and those who are already in the city system.</p> <p>Haney, the local lawmaker who represents the Tenderloin, believes that what happens in this neighborhood will determine how long the city\u2019s stay-at-home order will last. \u201cCan San Francisco meet the metrics the governor has put forth if we have so many people who cannot shelter in place?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Because what Haney and homeless outreach advocates have been saying since the mayor declared a state of emergency is that viruses don\u2019t stay within income brackets or sociological boundaries. The impact on the Tenderloin already demonstrates the direct effect that the unhoused population in a pandemic can have on a housed population.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t even about doing the right thing for disenfranchised people, or charity,\u201d Haney said. \u201cWhen they get sick, you and your families will get sick as well.\u201d</p>",

What makes women fervently fantasize about downing bottomless mimosas with a woman who has a doctorate of education and exceptionally white teeth?</p> <p>In Rodham, we meet a \u201cwho me?\u201d Hillary in law school, a woman insecure about her looks, uncertain about her ambitions, dazzled and overwhelmed by the clarity of Bill\u2019s desire to become president. She is willing to sideline her own dreams (vaguely defined) to move with him back to Arkansas to help facilitate his political future. But once he starts to cross ethical lines \u2013 a little bribery here, a little rape there \u2013 she realizes she needs to live her own life. She runs for office herself, pursuing a Senate seat because, as her character explains, \u201cour government makes a lot of important decisions, and I\u2019d like to be involved in them,\u201d which is more the language of a 12-year-old girl than a 43-year-old professor of law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14bc361e091a0a5ea9ca926ecf8839149b35a9a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14bc361e091a0a5ea9ca926ecf8839149b35a9a7/0_318_2616_1570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"hillary clinton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In Rodham, we meet a \u201cwho me?\u201d Hillary in law school, a woman insecure about her looks, uncertain about her ambitions, dazzled and overwhelmed by the clarity of Bill\u2019s desire to become president.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaPunch/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our reluctant politician is a lot like Mrs America\u2019s reluctant activist Steinem, who repeatedly insists she is not a politician and she hates politics but keeps somehow finding herself at conventions and in meetings with senators, advocating for women\u2019s rights (vaguely defined). Rodham and Steinem share similar obstacles to their ascension, which are mostly just micro-aggressions rather than anything structural. Romantic partners are not supportive, male colleagues underestimate them, they have to meet unfair standards of beauty and decorum. But each woman is, deep down, a good girl. They only get angry about injustice, they are only ambitious for change (vaguely defined). The mistakes they make along the way \u2013 in both cases this involves sidelining a woman of color, Shirley Chisholm for Steinem and Carol Moseley Braun for Rodham \u2013 are not about any character flaw, they\u2019re about the greater good and a little naivete. These women are powerful, yet harmless.</p> <p>These are self-empowerment fantasies, which have always been a popular form of women\u2019s entertainment. But instead of dreaming of being a sex columnist with great shoes and an impossible apartment in a New York City before it was just a collection of CVSes and bank branches, now I guess we\u2019re dreaming of being a woman who wants to be president but doesn\u2019t want to be seen wanting to be president, like the girl who dreams of being homecoming queen, but would never try to be homecoming queen by actually campaigning, she just really hopes that everyone in her school wants her to be homecoming queen and will spontaneously vote for her because she deserves it and she can wear her crown with grateful surprise and a pure heart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Depicting women who have who have compromised basic human decency as just doing their best is not only objectionable, it\u2019s boring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But politics is not about self-actualization. Becoming president is not the top of the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs; it\u2019s not the reward for being a really good person or making all of the right romantic choices, such as leaving your marriage after the first rape allegation against your husband and not like the eighth or whatever. Politics is about the distribution of resources, and those resources, whether it\u2019s money or food or bombs, decides who in our society lives and who dies, who has abundance and who barely scrapes by.</p> <p>Depicting women who have real ambition, who long for power, who have compromised any basic human decency to defend the activities of the CIA in the 1950s and 60s or destabilize governments in order to maintain that power, as just doing their best is not only objectionable, it\u2019s boring. Plus, I read in Rodham a fictionalized Bill Clinton referring to the fictionalized Hillary\u2019s fictionalized vagina as a \u201choneypot\u201d and I think I lost consciousness for a minute or two.</p> <p>In Rodham, a mentor gives Hillary a little pep talk. \u201cIf you\u2019re not the beneficiary of the women\u2019s movement, who is? More than any other young woman I know, you have the freedom to choose your own path.\u201d Like our dancing Gloria, whose abortionist really just wants what is best for her, this Hillary and her creator seem to understand feminism, instead of being an ideology of true equality and dignity, as being about letting women do whatever they want. It turns out that in our world, what Hillary really wanted was to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/welfare-reform-and-the-forging-of-hillary-clintons-political-realism/486449/\">destroy social welfare programs</a> that allowed single mothers to have food for their children and to give money that could have been used to keep families in their houses <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-cited-ny-banks-biggest-winners-wall/story?id=37629893\">to big banks instead</a>.

These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The requirement to keep 2 metres distance between people means only 50 MPs can attend the chamber in person, while up to 120 can join proceedings remotely via Zoom.

  "<p>It is the most significant step forward for the beautiful game since the introduction of red cards 50 years ago, and arguably the most controversial amendment to the laws of association football in living history. The use of the Video Assistant Referee (or VAR) in this season\u2019s Premier League has divided fans, players and pundits like no other issue \u2013 and even with the current campaign in suspension, continues to be hotly debated.</p> <p>But is VAR really the demon some have made it out to be? Are its faults being exaggerated, and is what we have seen so far simply the teething problems of a technology that will ultimately make matches fairer, players better, and football itself a more enjoyable fan experience?</p> <p>Neil Swarbrick, the Premier League referees\u2019 lead on VAR, believes the negativity has been overstated. When asked by BBC Sport how he\u2019d rate this season\u2019s VAR performance, he gave it \u201caround about a sevenish\u201d out of 10, adding: \u201cWe have more decisions correct with VAR than without it. If the mark now is seven \u2013 early days \u2013 in two years\u2019 time I\u2019m hoping for maybe an eight-and-a-half or nine.\u201d</p> <p>Others have been less kind. TV presenter and football pundit Danny Baker describes the technology as \u201ctrying to perfect football like CDs tried to perfect music in the 80s. But we like vinyl. We like a few pops and crackles in our art.\u201d</p> <p>For most football lovers, VAR would seem to be a brand-new addition to the game \u2013 but the truth is the technology has been developing for longer than many think. It was first mock-trialled in the Erdivisie, the Netherlands\u2019 top-flight league, back in 2012, before going \u201clive\u201d there in 2016. By the following season it was also a regular part of Major League Soccer in America, as well as the Bundesliga in Germany and Serie A in Italy.</p> <p>In 2018 VAR was used in every game of that summer\u2019s World Cup; and perhaps it is no coincidence that it holds the record as being the cleanest World Cup since 1986 \u2013 as well as recording the highest tally of goals scored by penalty of any World Cup ever.</p> <p>So what changed with the Premier League this season? Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has suggested that the time taken to check for VAR decisions has put many off, even adding that there should be a one-minute deadline for decisions.</p> <p>Will Leighton at The One Glove, which makes gloves for many top-flight goalkeepers including Martin Dubravka of Newcastle United and Republic of Ireland keeper Rob Elliot, says that the initial frustration with delays was not limited to fans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"73b00270a1195357daae4b85e308911685ae3ce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73b00270a1195357daae4b85e308911685ae3ce4/201_0_1414_1414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of referee showing red card during football match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Critics of VAR dislike the delay in reaching a decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: simonkr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think at the start it was a little frustrating for teams to be waiting longer periods of time to see a decision made,\u201d he says. \u201cPlayers want the right result, but with it being such an emotional game, frustrations will play a part if something doesn\u2019t go your way \u2013 if you believe you have scored and celebrated with teammates and fans for two minutes and then it\u2019s chalked off after, it\u2019s not a nice feeling. Players don\u2019t want to be waiting around, they want to play.\u201d</p> <p>Official statistics, however, seem to contradict the impression that decisions are taking an age to come through. There have been an average of around six VAR checks per game in the Premier League this season \u2013 with the average delay for a check around 30 seconds. Additionally, there has been only one overturned decision every four or so games \u2013 with the delay in those cases being around one minute 15 seconds on average.</p> <p>The other sticking point with VAR has been the apparent reluctance of referees to use the pitchside screen, with former Manchester City player Micah Richards saying: \u201cThey\u2019ve got major decisions wrong and they are hiding behind VAR. This all can be eradicated if the referee just goes and looks at the screen. If the referee looks at the screen and it\u2019s his final decision, then you have to hold your hands up.\u201d</p> <p>Leighton agrees that the pitchside screen is currently being underused. \u201cIt\u2019s still a personal decision even after all the checks,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the ref should use the monitors on the field more \u2013 and we could certainly benefit from some better explanations to fans over the big screen.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, those working in the game agree, for the most part, that VAR is here to stay: and that the improvements that technology made to other sports such as cricket, tennis and rugby will, ultimately be seen in the beautiful game too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/plug-into-hybrid/2020/may/19/computer-chess-how-the-ancient-game-revolutionised-ai\">Computer chess: how the ancient game revolutionised AI</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMany other sports have embraced tech and it\u2019s now just part of every fixture \u2013 there\u2019s no reason issues with VAR can\u2019t be ironed out and for it to become a key part of football,\u201d says Leighton.</p> <p>\u201cOther sports use solutions including Hot Spot, a bit of cricket tech that uses infrared cameras to see whether the ball has hit the batsman, his pads or the bat itself.

  "<p>When legendary chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov found himself beaten by IBM\u2019s Deep Blue supercomputer, it was seen as a seminal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence.</p> <p>It was New York, 1997 and for the first time ever a computer had beaten a world champion under tournament conditions. This was the culmination of a journey in which the first stirrings of what we now call artificial intelligence and machine learning were born. A road trodden by war heroes and student researchers alike, whose singular desire to create a program that could beat the very best in the world would shape an entire science.</p> <p><strong>Early origins<br></strong>Chess lends itself well to computer programming. Where other games can depend more on gut instinct or physical skill, chess is a game of strict binary rules \u2013 a move is either correct or it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>It\u2019s a game where multiple permutations, strategies and responses to moves and gambits could all be pre-programmed. Teaching a computer how to select the best option from those available to counter a problem, though, was the tricky part, and that\u2019s where machine learning came in.</p> <p>Given the close relationship between chess, logic and programming it\u2019s no surprise that the driving forces of early computerised incarnations of chess were academics whose love of the game dovetailed with their desire to push the boundaries of the burgeoning field of computer science.</p> <p>One of those academics was Alan Turing. He may have made his name breaking Nazi ciphers at Bletchley Park, but he also helped lay the early groundwork for computerised chess too. In 1947, while working at the University of Manchester, Turing developed the first simple algorithm that was capable of analysing an opponent\u2019s move one step ahead. Four years later, his academic colleague DG Prinz wrote a program that could solve particular moves, but not play a game.</p> <p><strong>Competitive games<br></strong>The 1960s saw computer chess start to come into its own. In 1967, MacHack VI, a program written by MIT student Richard Greenblatt, was able to draw a game in a US Chess Federation tournament, losing four. But this was just the start and its results began to improve.</p> <p>New York City hosted the first US computer championship in 1970; it was won by Chess 3.0, a program put together by a team from Northwestern University.</p> <p>And in 1988, HiTech, a computer developed at Carnegie Mellon University, defeated grandmaster Arnold Denker, in a match. In the same year, another Carnegie Mellon program, Deep Thought, defeated top-notch grandmaster Bent Larsen in a tournament game.</p> <p><strong>Humans strike back<br></strong>Deep Thought\u2019s defeat of Larsen was a huge moment for early AI. But this success was short-lived \u2013 the program was easily bested later that year by Garry Kasparov.</p> <p>This setback prompted the team behind Deep Thought to push further and further to refine their model. In their view, Kasparov\u2019s success was simply check \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t check mate. The team\u2019s success caught the eye of US computer giant IBM, which brought them aboard as part of a dedicated chess programming group tasked with devising a way to beat Kasparov and they developed a successor to Deep Thought called Deep Blue. It incorporated a sophisticated new multiprocessing system that enabled it to consider as many as 50bn positions in three minutes, about a thousand times faster than Deep Thought\u2019s system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6591be6cd865bbe48980ce2f8da2ece573c5eff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6591be6cd865bbe48980ce2f8da2ece573c5eff1/0_26_2320_1392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CHESS PLAYER GARRY KASPAROV WINNING AGAINST IBM DEEP BLUE COMPUTER, NEW YORK, AMERICA - 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garry Kasparov takes on Deep Blue in 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kasparov vs Deep Blue<br></strong>Deep Blue made its professional chess-playing debut in a six-game match with Kasparov in Philadelphia in February 1996.

Its algorithm was also improved with input from human grandmasters.</p> <p>Kasparov played smart though, he was conservative with his moves which threw Deep Blue off balance \u2013 it hadn\u2019t expected it. But after resigning the second game even though it was drawable, the Russian said he never recovered mentally. With the match tied at one win, one loss, and three draws, Deep Blue won the decisive final game in 19 moves.</p> <p><strong>Influence on AI<br></strong>The lessons learned from the desire to create a program that could beat a human chess champion enhanced AI.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/plug-into-hybrid/2020/may/19/a-tipping-point-is-likely-in-2021-why-electric-vehicles-will-soon-dominate-uk-roads\">\u2018A tipping point is likely in 2021\u2019: why electric vehicles will soon dominate UK roads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Murray Campbell, one of IBM\u2019s top AI experts, originally worked on the Deep Thought and Deep Blue projects.

One of the criticisms of Deep Blue and subsequent machines is that they relied on the \u201cbrute force\u201d application of their superior memory skills \u2013 they could remember more permutations than a human. They could out-calculate, rather than out-think.</p> <p>AI company DeepMind\u2019s algorithm AlphaZero set out to change that. It could teach itself how to play chess and learn from its own mistakes. Not only that, it was able to play with intuition and finesse, destroying the reigning artificial chess champion Stockfish during a match in 2017.

  "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/failed-state\">failed state</a> is one that can no longer claim legitimacy or perform a government\u2019s core function of protecting the people\u2019s basic security. Lately, the Wisconsin supreme court seems to be doing its level best to make its state qualify for \u201cfailed\u201d status. Multiple decisions have both undermined the government\u2019s legitimacy and endangered the people.</p> <p>First, there was the primary. Because voting in person is clearly risky during a pandemic, several states delayed their primaries to make sure everyone was able to mail in a ballot instead of having to go to a polling place. Not so Wisconsin. The state\u2019s Democratic governor signed an executive order for an all mail-in election but was thwarted by the Republican legislature. Then the governor issued an order postponing the election. Republicans challenged it, and the Wisconsin supreme court sided with them. The primary went forward, but was a disaster: there were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/long-lines-form-in-milwaukee-as-wisconsin-proceeds-with-elections-under-court-order/2020/04/07/93727b34-78c7-11ea-b6ff-597f170df8f8_story.html\">long lines</a> in Milwaukee, where only five polling places in the whole city were open\u201d and more than 50 people appear to have <a href=\"https://time.com/5829264/wisconsin-primary-coronavirus/\">contracted coronavirus</a> as a result. Ensuring that people can vote without risking their lives is a basic duty of government, one at which Wisconsin failed.</p> <p>But the Wisconsin supreme court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/wisconsin-lockdown-ruling-supreme-court-republicans\">latest decision</a> is even worse. The conservative majority overturned the state\u2019s \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order, immediately leading bars to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/wisconsin-bars-coronavirus-stay-at-home-order\">flooded with patrons</a>. Even as public health officials stress the danger in suddenly lifting restrictions, justices presented it as a freedom issue, with one <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/us/coronavirus-wisconsin-supreme-court.html\">writing</a> that the \u201ccomprehensive claim to control virtually every aspect of a person\u2019s life is something we normally associate with a prison, not a free society governed by the rule of law\u201d. Public opinion is <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0511/Poll-Most-Americans-disapprove-of-anti-lockdown-protests\">generally against</a> the anti-lockdown protests, but if a conservative minority has power, the \u201cletting a deadly virus spread unchecked = freedom\u201d perspective will triumph.</p> <p>Courts are the least democratic branch of government to begin with; judges are like robed \u201cphilosopher kings\u201d with the power to overturn measures overwhelmingly favored by the people. (Sometimes that\u2019s a good thing, but decisions as to what to let stand and what to overturn are <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/how-the-supreme-court-pretends-to-be-reasonable\">almost always political</a>.) Once a single party dominates at court, it simply has veto power over the entire democratic process.</p> <p>The court\u2019s conservative majority has shown no hesitation in imposing its ideology on the state. As Akela Lacy <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/04/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election/\">reported</a> in the Intercept, they have been denying the rights of unionized workers, ruling consistently against criminal defendants, and even overturning a rule banning people from carrying weapons on public buses.</p> <p>Wisconsin\u2019s Republicans have succeeded in capturing power in the state even without having to capture popular approval. As Michael Li of the Brennan Center <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-meets-coronavirus-wisconsin\">documents</a>, the state has been heavily gerrymandered, meaning Republicans can exercise power without having to win majority support:</p> <p><em>\u201c[G]errymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority. Wisconsin\u2019s maps were crafted with such micro-precision that even if Democrats managed to win a historically high 54% of the two-party vote \u2013 a level they\u2019ve reached only once in the last 20 years \u2014 Republicans would still end up with a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Whitford-Opinion112116.pdf\">solid nine-seat majority</a> in the state assembly. In fact, Wisconsin\u2019s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats even with a minority of the vote. <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Whitford-Opinion112116.pdf\">Analyses</a> of the maps in the lawsuit challenging the maps showed that Republicans are a lock to win 60</em><em>% of statehouse seats even if they win just 48% of the vote.\u201d</em></p> <p>In a supposedly democratic country, this should be an outrage. How can a government claim legitimacy if it does not require the people\u2019s support? But this is true far beyond Wisconsin. Republican rule is minority rule; as we know, thanks to our archaic electoral college system Donald Trump, like George W Bush, was able to win the election without winning the most votes, and the undemocratic Senate is Republican-dominated. The Republican agenda is <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/09/republican-memo-admits-voters-oppose-republican-policies.html\">unpopular</a>, meaning that in order to impose it, institutions have to be crafted that will prevent the population from exercising its will. The easier it is for the masses to participate, the more difficult it is for Republicans to protect the 1%, who really should be winning exactly 1% of the vote. (Donald Trump admitted that if voting were easy enough Republicans would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">never win another election</a>.)</p> <p>What respect do people owe a government that cannot protect them and cannot claim democratic legitimacy? Very little. The more that Wisconsin Republicans act to impose their will unilaterally without regard to the safety or will of the people, the less we should treat Wisconsin as a functional government.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs and a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Donald Trump has reignited a controversy over the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">telling reporters </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\"> he was taking the latter</a> to protect himself against coronavirus. What do we know about these drugs?</p> \n<h2><strong>What is </strong>hydroxychloroquine<strong>?</strong></h2> \n<p>Hydroxychloroquine, which Trump says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he has been taking</a> for about two weeks, was developed as an antimalarial but it is also used to treat conditions like lupus, an anti-immune disease, and arthritis, where it can help combat inflammation. It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n<h2>What is the link to Covid-19?</h2> \n<p>Researchers have been interested in chloroquines as an anti-viral agent for some time. A study in <a href=\"https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-2-69\">Virology Journal in 2005</a> found that chloroquine inhibited the closely related Sars virus in primate cells in lab conditions.</p> \n<p>However, evidence for the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in recent human trials during the coronavirus pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">has been at best inconclusive</a>, with some suggestions that it could worsen the outcome of severe cases.</p> \n<p>The WHO is looking at whether hydroxychloroquine could be an effective Covid-19 treatment, while the US National Institutes for Health is also running a clinical trial to establish whether the drug, administered together with the antibiotic azithromycin, can prevent hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>In recent days, enthusiasm about hydroxychloroquine has been boosted by a study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, that looked at the combination of hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/azithromycin/\">azithromycin</a> and zinc supplements.</p> \n<p>It showed that patients who received the three-drug combination vs the two-drug combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were 44% less likely to die than the second group. Joseph Rahimian, a co-author of the study, pointed out that the study\u2019s findings were limited to the possible promise of zinc, not of hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/16/hydroxychloroquine-how-did-an-unproven-drug-become-trumps-miracle-cure\">The story behind Trump's 'miracle' drug hydroxychloroquine \u2013 podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong></h2> \n<p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n<p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n<h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n<p>There are a number of side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n<p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n<h2>So why is Trump taking it?</h2> \n<p>Despite there being no conclusive body of evidence that it can be effective when used to prevent contracting coronavirus, the president apparently decided in conversation with the White House physician Sean P Conley that it was worth the risks.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,\u201d Conley wrote.</p> \n<p>It is probably worth pointing out that Conley, a naval doctor, trained initially as an osteopath and then in emergency medicine, serving as research director at Portsmouth Navy Department of Emergency Medicine prior to his assignment to the White House medical unit.</p> \n<p>For his part, Trump, despite the FDA and other warnings, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s good. I\u2019ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it\u2019s not good, I\u2019ll tell you right. I\u2019m not going to get hurt by it. It\u2019s been around for 40 years.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Have we been here before?</h2> \n<p>Yes. Trump has a history of personally advocating for the use hydroxychloroquine, which he has described as a potential \u201cgame-changer\u201d. Although it has been reported that Trump has a small stake in a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine via an investment fund, this seems to be about Trump\u2019s own hunches and his desire to be both proved right and protected against the disease.</p> \n<p>On Monday, he also claimed lots of doctors were using the drug prophylactically and cited letters he had received from members of the public. As Paul Waldman, a columnist in the Washington Post, has suggested, this is more about Trump\u2019s psychology than anything else.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump compensates for his own insecurity by working to convince himself and everyone else that the experts don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, and he knows more than them about everything,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/07/real-reason-trump-is-obsessed-with-hydroxychloroquine/\">Waldman has written</a>.</p>",

But, \u201cwhat we know with certainty is that <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-poultry-producers-coronavirus-20200424-hufdfzs24zhqpeptx4w6yngztm-story.html\">2 million meat chickens</a> [and] <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/egg-demand-shifted-and-61-000-minnesota-chickens-were-euthanized/569817312/?refresh=true\">61,000 laying hens</a>\u201d, have been killed on farms.</p> <p>Compared with poultry, said Garc\u00e9s, stopping or slowing the production cycle of pigs is harder, mainly because pig growing periods are about six months compared to six weeks for hens. \u201cPregnancies had already been set in motion when the slaughterhouse closures occurred,\u201d she said, and pigs were already in the system.</p> <p>The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) has <a href=\"https://nppc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/euthanasia-fact-sheet-FINAL-5-8-20.pdf?ftag=MSF0951a18\">estimated</a> that: \u201cup to 10,069,000 market hogs will need to be euthanised between the weeks ending on 25 April and 19 September 2020, resulting in a severe emotional and financial toll on hog farmers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"609941f267b588228f22d90270a01a00570d2f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/609941f267b588228f22d90270a01a00570d2f2e/0_0_5564_3709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"chicken on supermarket shelf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The peak of the chicken cull has passed, experts said, but pigs may now need to be \u2018depopulated\u2019 in large numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For pig culls, AVMA \u201cpreferred methods\u201d include injectable anaesthetic overdose, gassing, shooting with guns or bolts, electrocution and manual blunt force trauma. AVMA methods \u201cpermitted in constrained circumstances\u201d include ventilator shutdown (VSD), potentially combined with carbon dioxide gassing, and sodium nitrite which would be ingested by pigs.</p> <p>Speaking more graphically, Garc\u00e9s said manual blunt force trauma can mean slamming piglets against the ground while VSD would \u201cessentially cook the pigs alive\u201d.</p> <p>Asked to estimate numbers of pigs that have already been culled, Speck said producers are very reluctant to depopulate. \u201cAbout two million might have been culled so far due to the Covid-19 pandemic, over the last six or so weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Speck added that with slaughterhouses likely to return to 85% capacity by the end of May, the NPPC\u2019s depopulation estimate of 10 million pigs could be significantly reduced.</p> <p>Speck said breeders are thinning herds and slowing growth to reduce pig supply. \u201cThey are sending breeding sows to slaughter, aborting pregnant sows on a small scale and [keeping market-bound pigs] on maintenance style rations with less protein. Coming into the summer months the pigs will also gain weight more slowly as the weather heats up.\u201d</p> <h2>Methods are \u2018inhumane\u2019</h2> <p>Asked about growth slowdown, Garc\u00e9s said it posed other welfare risks. \u201cOne method to slow down growth is to turn the heat up inside of the warehouses beyond the pigs \u2018comfort zone\u2019 because pigs eat less when they are too hot,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The combination of feed restrictions and higher barn temperatures, she said, mean pigs are \u201chungry and hot, increasing their overall discomfort, which is already high in a factory farm setting\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad0d7dea0d6e74838a7337efccb3d1db910e4b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad0d7dea0d6e74838a7337efccb3d1db910e4b06/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hogs at a farm in Illinois, US\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many farmers now face having to cull market-ready pigs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In what appears to be an attempt by the industry to reduce any negative depopulation impact, a <a href=\"https://www.porkcares.org/about-we-care/we-care-organizations/\">blog managed</a> by the National Pork Board called Real Pig Farming offers social media sharing tips for farmers.

Filling sheds with carbon dioxide gas is one method, said Kim Sturla, director of welfare organisation <a href=\"http://animalplace.org/\">Animal Place</a>. Another cull method, she said, is to smother hens with water-based foam, similar to firefighting foam. Water-based foaming is <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/resources/AVMA-Guidelines-for-the-Depopulation-of-Animals.pdf\">categorised</a> as the \u201cpreferred\u201d method by the AVMA.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/29/millions-of-farm-animals-culled-as-us-food-supply-chain-chokes-up-coronavirus\">Millions of farm animals culled as US food supply chain chokes up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously asked about water-based foaming and other cull methods such VSD, an AVMA spokesperson said depopulation decisions were difficult and \u201cand contingent upon several factors, such as the species and number of animals involved, available means of animal restraint, safety of personnel, and other considerations such as availability of equipment, agents and personnel\u201d.</p> <p>European campaigners said firefighting foam causes prolonged suffering.

  "<p>As the UK begins to ease lockdown restrictions, attention has turned to the prospect of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/gps-press-ministers-for-clear-testing-strategy-to-avoid-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">second wave</a> of coronavirus cases. In Germany, where shops and restaurants have tentatively reopened, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-germany-cases-spread-lockdown-lifted-r-number-a9507571.html\">the reproduction number </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-germany-cases-spread-lockdown-lifted-r-number-a9507571.html\">R</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-germany-cases-spread-lockdown-lifted-r-number-a9507571.html\"> has risen to 1.1</a>. In Seoul, a recent outbreak of at least 170 infections has been linked to five bars and nightclubs. Even in South Korea, one of the most successful countries at controlling the virus, there\u2019s no room for complacency.</p> <p>As a veterinary epidemiologist, I study how viruses spread between animals and animal populations. The principles of viral transmission are much the same in humans (indeed, many scientists work on both). The concept of a second wave in public health is often linked to factors outside of human control. This might include the birth of infants who are susceptible to a particular disease causing the wavelike patterns we see in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/414716a\">childhood illnesses</a>, or environmental factors that influence the <a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/86/8/4279\">seasonality of influenza</a>. But for Covid-19, the anticipation of a second wave has more to do with actions within our control.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s as important as the R number is the total number of cases across a population that an R increase would cause</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shifts in social behaviour create more opportunities for human contact. In China, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china/russian-border-becomes-chinas-frontline-in-fight-against-second-virus-wave-idUKKCN21V06R\">the entry of people with coronavirus</a> across the Russian border is one example where easing restrictions resulted in new cases of the virus. Meanwhile in Germany, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-breaks-out-in-third-german-slaughterhouse/a-53389860\">outbreaks of coronavirus linked to abattoirs</a> where employees live in poor housing conditions is a reminder that the R number can also increase when vulnerable individuals are exposed to the virus for the first time.</p> <p>The potential rise in R after lockdown measures are relaxed is something that epidemiologists are well aware of. If the government delivers an effective testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/epidemiologists-contact-tracing-coronavirus\">contact-tracing strategy</a> that can bring the virus under control by the time lockdown measures are lifted for everyone, new cases of Covid-19 would theoretically be little cause for concern \u2013 as health authorities would have measures in place to identify and curb incipient outbreaks.</p> <p>What\u2019s of greater concern to epidemiologists are indications that the R number is rising uncontrollably, or in a way that increases the exposure of the most vulnerable or puts health systems under great strain. In other words, what\u2019s as important as the R number is the total number of cases across a population that an increase in R would cause. While the increase in Germany\u2019s R number is concerning, this would be far more alarming were it to occur in the UK, where there are currently many more cases of coronavirus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/regional-differences-in-covid-19-transmission-rate-emerge-in-england\">Regional differences</a> in the value of R are also important. Easing the lockdown in areas with greater health resources, fewer Covid-19 cases and where more people have already had the virus, may be practical compared with another part of the country where outcomes of an increasing R would be more severe. Differences in the R number among particular risk groups, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">care home residents</a>, are also likely to be more meaningful than the value of R for the country as a whole. Again, we\u2019ll need a widespread programme of testing and tracing to determine these risks, and enable health authorities to rapidly contain incipient outbreaks.</p> <p>Intuitively, we know that if contact between people with Covid-19 and those susceptible to infection increases, the R number is likely to rise. But this doesn\u2019t happen in a straightforward way. A 10% increase in contact doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a 10% increase in R, or a 10% increase in overall risk of catching the virus. Understanding how contact between people affects transmission, whether it be transmission of hate messages via a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06930-7\">malicious bot on the internet</a> or transmission of a virus from an infected person, is a pivotal concept in the field of \u201cnetwork science\u201d.</p> <p>For Covid-19, a single contact can endanger an otherwise isolated community. Once an infection is introduced, the results can be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-52676174\">disastrous</a>. In network science, this pattern is described as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/30918\">small-world</a>\u201d effect. The concept originated from the idea that individuals with apparently little in common often have connections they are unaware of. What this means for public health is that even if only a handful of people have the potential to expose other communities to disease risk, in communities that are geographically distant or isolated, the impact of those few people on the spread of a virus can be significant. In the case of coronavirus, many areas in the UK have only experienced small outbreaks so far, creating fewer opportunities for the effects of \u201cherd immunity\u201d to curb the risk of a future outbreak.</p> <p>To understand why mass gatherings are so important for infection, we can use a second concept borrowed from network science, that of \u201cscale-free networks\u201d. This is when some individuals in a network have a disproportionate number of contacts compared with the average. Gatherings are one context in which a single individual who is infected with Covid-19 could have many more contacts with other people than average. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15842.1\">Emerging scientific research suggests</a> that some individuals may be responsible for infecting many more people than others. One crucial question, which scientists haven\u2019t yet answered, is whether these patterns are driven by more contact or differences in infectiousness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">The Sage advice must be published now to find where Britain got coronavirus wrong | Anthony Costello</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mass gatherings become more significant if such events occur frequently, with at least some of the same individuals returning repeatedly to the same place. This is often the case for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/angelo-ogbonna-accuses-premier-league-ignoring-coronavirus-risk\">scheduled football matches</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/churches-consider-ticketing-when-they-reopen-after-lockdown-coronavirus\">religious services</a>, both of which occur weekly \u2013 an interval conveniently similar to the time it takes a person infected with coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.17.2000257\">to become infectious to others</a>. Gatherings both increase the opportunities to become infected and increase the chances of infecting other people. If a few people who are infected with coronavirus come into contact with many others, the<a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.066112\"> risk of a rapid spread can become uncontrollable</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">some events</a> present both kinds of risk: drawing in many people from great distances, and holding them together in close contact for an extended period.</p> <p>Lowering our chance of a second wave will require minimising the impact of both of these factors. This means restricting large gatherings, especially where individuals might repeat these over the course of a single infection, and restricting movements over long distances, or those with a higher probability of putting vulnerable groups at risk. Crucially, it also means having in place a testing and tracing strategy that allows health authorities to identify new cases of Covid-19. These concepts are intuitive, but what network science tells us is that the risk associated with even a small change in patterns of human contact can be substantial.</p> <p>\u2022 Rowland Kao is the Sir Timothy O\u2019Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, and is working with Public Health Scotland on coronavirus modelling. </p>",

  "<p>Had the teenaged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush\">Kate Bush</a> listened to the wishes of her record label, Wuthering Heights would not have been her debut single. EMI preferred the pop-stomp of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PTZWoyp_000\">James and the Cold Gun</a> to the eerie, circular song that introduced her to the world. But by her late teens, Bush clearly knew herself and wisely pushed for Wuthering Heights instead. When it saw the light of day, in early 1978, it was a hit. By March that year, it had become a No 1 hit, the first single written and recorded by a female artist to top the British charts. It replaced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/all-abbas-uk-singles-ranked\">Take A Chance </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/all-abbas-uk-singles-ranked\">on Me</a>, and remained at the top for a month.</p> <p>It is sometimes worth remembering the incredible fact that Bush wrote Wuthering Heights when she was 18 years old, though perhaps its keen ear for adolescent angst is part of what makes it so special. She had been inspired by an old television adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/21/emily-bronte-strange-cult-wuthering-heights-romantic-novel\">Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel</a>, which led her to seek out the book. Written from the perspective of the ghost of Catherine Earnshaw, a young woman pleading with the brutal Heathcliff, whom she loves and hates, to let her soul into the house, the song is a gothic melodrama that builds until it is thick with intensity. It is a magnificent achievement, though the writing of it was seemingly painless. \u201cActually, it came quite easily,\u201d Bush recalled later, telling the story of a single moonlit night at the piano. The vocal was said to have been recorded in a single take. Bush found out that she and Bront\u00eb shared a birthday, and the fates were aligned.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1pMMIe4hb4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-1pMMIe4hb4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Kate Bush: Wuthering Heights \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The casual story of its creation belies the odd unwieldiness of the song itself. The piano gently heralds the arrival of this haunted tale of lost love and longing, then that tight, high melody reels you in. It loops and lilts, ascending, descending, as Bush\u2019s vocal urges the story on, like Catherine striding across the moors. In the BBC\u2019s 2014 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/23/kate-bush-running-up-that-hill-review\">The Kate Bush Story</a>, artist after artist recalls hearing it on the radio for the first time, thinking some variation of: what on earth was that? \u201cYou can hear one note of a Kate Bush song or one note of her voice and know what it is,\u201d said Annie Clark, AKA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/st-vincent\">St Vincent</a>, and it has been that way from the start.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/23/kate-bush-every-uk-single-ranked\">Kate Bush \u2013 every UK single ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spectacle of Bush as a performer inspired similarly wowed and unsettled reactions. She made two videos for the song, and appeared on Top of the Pops with it five times in 1978, cementing her public image as an ethereal spirit, embodying the essence of Cathy through a combination of wide eyes, floaty fabrics and wild choreography, still fondly mimicked and parodied today. Wuthering Heights turned Bush into a pop star, the rules of which she continues to bend to her own will: her individuality was set in stone from the very beginning.</p>",
  "<p>Black people and white people in the US, segregated in cities after policies in the 1930s mandated that social housing projects should be built separately for them, were further divided in the 1950s when white residents took up generous government subsidies to flee these projects for the suburbs. Decades later, the cheapness of properties in some of these neglected black neighbourhoods fuelled a reversal of white flight and gentrification. The family at the heart of <em>The Residue Years</em> is among those African Americans who succumbed to offers to sell up, and Mitchell S Jackson\u2019s enthralling, autobiographical, award-winning debut novel (originally published in the US in 2013) is, in essence, the quest for a return to their home, to a physically impoverished yet emotionally rich Eden.</p> <p>Set in the 1990s, mostly in a poor black district of Portland, Oregon, the chapters alternate between the perspective of a mother, Grace, and her eldest teenage son, Champ. Grace is a penitent drug addict whose approach, even in rehab, seems borrowed from Oscar Wilde\u2019s dictum: \u201cThe only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\u201d Champ is a student smart enough to give a sardonic class presentation on disproportionate sentencing (soft cocaine versus crack cocaine) between white and black defendants; nonetheless, he supplements his own income through dealing. \u201cTough to count the days my [pungent] backpack\u2019s freighted with more than books, with what\u2019s a sure trigger for a federal charge.\u201d</p> <p>The mother-and-son relationship is fraught but tender. Grace is haunted by a Greek chorus of detractors she can\u2019t shut out from her head, reminding her how she has wronged her children, as she herself was wronged. The notion of predeterminism stalks <em>The Residue Years</em>. In a courtroom, Champ witnesses a black defendant who crumples a perfunctory plea-bargaining note of contrition prepared by his lawyer, and tells the judge: \u201cFuck this. You think this gone stop? It won\u2019t... cause we out here neck deep. If one go down, one come up... is the only law that counts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMister\u201d, the big-time dope dealer, tells Champ, who wants to upgrade to two bricks (of cannabis), \u201cDon\u2019t let this slip your mind. Most of us, if we\u2019re lucky, we see a few seconds of the high life. And the rest are the residue years.\u201d Champ equates the high life with regaining occupancy of the old family house, sold to a middle-class white couple; he yearns to buy it back with his drug earnings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The stories of mother and son interlock incrementally over the course of the book like bolts on a series of prison gates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This, then, is a novel of mourning and loss, steeped in the author\u2019s experiences \u2013Jackson was raised by a single mother and imprisoned as a youth after he was found guilty of drug offences \u2013 and populated by figures who evanesce. \u201cI see a ghost, alive, but three-quarters dead or more,\u201d says Champ, on the streets, bumping into his godmother, Dawn, previously an undisputed beauty now \u201csloped against a pole... a crack life specialist... a pound away from levitating.\u201d With Dawn\u2019s reappearance, Grace recalls her own past, huddled in dope dens, burning through every red cent of benefit cheques.</p> <p>Jackson\u2019s writing crackles and sparks with startling insights and descriptions: Grace gets a job from a sympathetic employer who\u2019s \u201cbeen through the fire and got a soft spot for folks that seen the flame\u201d; Champ is on amber alert for the \u201cmean-mugging misanthropes\u201d whom he mostly evades. Of course, his luck will run out. When eventually robbed by rivals, Mister hands him a gun, adding: \u201cThey take from you. They take from me. And we can\u2019t have that problem.\u201d We know, as does Champ, that it\u2019s the final piece of the tragic jigsaw puzzle of his young life. When he\u2019s pulled over by a police patrol, your heart pounds as fast and hard as his.</p> <p>The stories of mother-and-son interlock incrementally over the course of the novel like bolts on a series of prison gates, before reaching a devastating conclusion. Still, <em>The Residue Years</em> holds out for a fault in the logic, that Grace\u2019s vision of her future (\u201cLet the world see me now, a conqueror, high above my sorrows, a flagpole pushed through the pile\u201d) will not prove delusional. But Champ knows he must relinquish the dream of returning home to a place of safety. Such a place is only to be found in the recess of his mind \u201cwhere the lie of us won\u2019t live\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Residue Years</em> by Mitchell S Jackson is published by Little, Brown (\u00a314.99).

That seems like an astronomical task, especially in a time when spray paint and artist materials are not necessarily easy to obtain for everyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have sponsors willing to do murals by the dozens,\u201d says Meyer. The Beautify website is a marketplace where business owners can upload photos of their empty walls for artists to see, create their proposals, contact the business owners and complete their collaborative contract, and payment, online.</p> <p>They have mounted murals already in Pasadena, West Hollywood, Seattle and Oakland, with artworks by artists such as Guerin Swing, Gino Loffredo, Sel Dog, and Corie Mattie, who is so far one of the few female artists of the group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14b82aea68d80882d1c4b696d94b290c65373bb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14b82aea68d80882d1c4b696d94b290c65373bb9/0_0_5168_3448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corie Mattie with one of her projects for Beautify\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corie Mattie with one of her projects for Beautify.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mattie has created a series of coronavirus-themed murals in yellow, black and white, as a way to uplift passersby, using a cartoon of a person wearing a face mask opening a long coat to reveal hope and prayers.

  "<p>This should have been one of the grand weekends of the rugby year. The Champions Cup final was due to be staged in Marseille on Saturday and a quick check of the weather forecast is a reminder of just how grievously it will be missed. Unless, that is, you don\u2019t much care for clear blue skies, temperatures of 25C and a glass of something chilled overlooking the Vieux Port.</p> <p>With party-loving fans from right across Europe all gathering beside the Mediterranean it had the potential to make the Monaco Grand Prix feel like a garden fete. As in Newcastle 12 months ago, it would also have offered a tantalising glimpse of what rugby might become if it were ever consistently smart and united enough. Instead we will just have to make do with sitting at home, staring at the now-familiar kitchen wall and speaking French to the cat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/17/rugbys-factions-must-pull-together-or-coronavirus-crisis-could-tear-sport-apart\">Rugby's factions must pull together or coronavirus crisis could tear sport apart | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a double shame because this year\u2019s knockout stages promised so much. It may yet be, of course, that the matches are finally played this autumn and Marseille hosts the finals, after all, in mid October. But hang on. What if no spectators can enter the stadiums, there is no riotous colour or atmosphere and no late-night revelry in tightly packed bars? Does that qualify as proper rugby at all?</p> <p>We know the stock answer: any rugby is better than none. Which it probably is, up to a point. Fulfilling routine league fixtures will at least make sure the television money gets paid and satisfy the competitive itch to some degree. But pause for a moment and think about the biggest showpiece games: how will it feel to watch a team lifting Europe\u2019s most sought-after club trophy in an echoing, empty ground, unable to spray champagne because of health and safety concerns, no family or friends to hug afterwards? Surreal does not even begin to cover it.</p> <p>Not much discussed in rugby yet, either, is the competitive difference that playing behind closed doors could make. Look at the four Champions Cup quarter-finals: Leinster v Saracens, Clermont Auvergne v Racing 92, Exeter v Northampton and Toulouse v Ulster. Instead of being lobbed into their respective bearpits and assailed from all sides by waves of partisan noise, the four visiting sides will be able to hear a pin drop. It will quietly alter the equation, if nothing else.</p> <p>As Saracens have shown over the years, it is not an absolute requirement to have tens of thousands of fans in attendance to win trophies. Their ability to block out everything and thrive on neutral grounds \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\">Lyon in 2016</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/13/clermont-auvergne-saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Murrayfield in 2017</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/11/leinster-saracens-champions-cup-final-match-report\">Newcastle last year</a> all spring to mind \u2013 was remarkable. The mind\u2019s eye also drifts back to 2014 when they took apart Clermont 46-6 at a two-thirds unoccupied Twickenham; the rows of empty seats barely seemed to register.</p> <p>Conversely, however, what about their rescheduled snowy game against Clermont at Allianz Park in 2017-18 in front of two men and a dog? They lost 46-14 and were pretty fortunate to come second. It suggests the exact location or limited crowd numbers count for slightly less than a team\u2019s state of mind. If a side aren\u2019t mentally right before they run out, it will matter not how many are watching.</p> <p>Still, it is fun to look back and wonder if a lack of a crowd might have changed the outcome of any big European games in the past. Take the first final of the millennium, which also happened to be the first played on English soil. Northampton were facing an entire Red Army of mad-keen Munster supporters who had flown over to London en masse from Shannon and Cork, desperate for their team to be crowned European champions.<br> The semi-final win over Toulouse on a roasting hot afternoon in Bordeaux had been one of the great occasions and, from that Twickenham day to this, I have never seen quite so many visiting fans milling around outside the stadium so far before kick-off. Maybe that sense of delicious expectancy infiltrated the Munster dressing room; as Ronan O\u2019Gara said years later in his autobiography, the occasion got to him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0c881e7fe1fa4304ec1c3eb45fe8bd5a254fb64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0c881e7fe1fa4304ec1c3eb45fe8bd5a254fb64/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Northampton\u2019s captain Pat Lam and Tim Rodber celebrate winning the Champions Cup in 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Northampton\u2019s captain Pat Lam (right) and Tim Rodber (centre) celebrate winning the Champions Cup in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Hayhow/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The young Irish fly-half missed four penalty attempts out of four, including a late one that allowed the Saints to edge home 9-8. \u201cAt the final whistle I stood in the middle of the pitch, surrounded by 70,000 people, completely alone,\u201d wrote O\u2019Gara. \u201cThat experience probably made a man out of me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/from-aaron-cruden-to-maa-nonu-are-big-money-rugby-signings-worth-it\">The Breakdown | From Aaron Cruden to Ma'a Nonu: are big-money rugby signings worth it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what if no one had been in the ground? O\u2019Gara would still have had to deal with the pressure of the moment \u2013 like poor old Doug Sanders on the final hole of the Open at St Andrews 50 summers ago \u2013 but not the gasps and frustrated sighs that increasingly swirled around Twickenham as the ball consistently refused to bisect the distant uprights. With the Munster of that era there was an unusually close relationship between the team and their supporters; mostly it helped to win games they might otherwise have lost but here was an exception that proved the rule. Everyone present wanted it so badly that, ultimately, the intensity of that desire became counter-productive.</p> <p>It is too late to rewind now but we do know this: empty grounds are set to become an all-too-familiar part of the rugby landscape. Maybe, ironically, it will help Irish goal-kickers, for whom a theatrical hush is a more natural state of affairs, more than their French counterparts. Might Ulster, if and when they play in Toulouse, also find the lack of Gallic whistling and roaring to their advantage?</p> <p>Here\u2019s hoping, either way, that the sound of silence does not blank out everything that makes big-time rugby so special.</p>",

  "<p>As we struggle to stop Covid-19, we\u2019re being hit with a fresh pandemic of unemployment. In April, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits increased by the most since records began to reach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/uk-jobless-april-coronavirus-crisis-unemployment-benefits\">almost 2.1 million</a>, probably taking us to well over 10% unemployment. It\u2019s now obvious that the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">job </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">retention </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">scheme</a> (CJRS), which subsidises 80% of people\u2019s wages but did not put the necessary duties on employers to prevent them from firing employees, is failing in the one thing it\u2019s meant to do: retain jobs.</p> <p>Job numbers haven\u2019t collapsed in other countries such as Denmark or Germany because they have security and democracy at work, not just wage subsidies. Unemployment in Denmark has <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20180116-focus-denmark-low-unemployment-rate-strict-controls-job-seekers-benefits\">risen to just 4.2%</a>. Unemployment in Germany has risen to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b6ba29e-c90a-4b68-a149-4847415d75ac\">5.8%</a>. It might get worse, but it\u2019s a fraction of the UK\u2019s problem.</p> <p>Unemployment isn\u2019t natural. It\u2019s a legal and social choice. In Germany, workers in companies with more than 20 staff can elect a work council that may veto or delay dismissals and get compensation to internalise the social costs. In companies with more than 2,000 workers, staff can elect half of the supervisory board of directors. The system was restored post-second world war, after Hitler abolished all labour rights. It restarted with a law that the <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Control_Council_Law_No_22_(10_April_1946)_Works_Councils#Articles_IV\">UK and US helped to draft</a>, but we\u2019ve failed to follow it ourselves. In Denmark, workers in companies with more than 35 staff have the right to organise <a href=\"http://www.worker-participation.eu/www.worker-participation.eu/index.php/National-Industrial-Relations/Countries/Denmark/Workplace-Representation\">cooperation committees</a> and workers elect up to one third of the board of directors.</p> <p>Democracy and security at work make enterprise more rational. Directors elected by staff ensure managers think in the long term. In this crisis, short-term thinking isn\u2019t even creating so-called shareholder value, just a sinking spiral of dole queues and shuttered shops.</p> <p>The unemployment pandemic is by far the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-coronavirus-us-unemployment-could-hit-25-warns-fed-chairman-as-japan-enters-recession\">worst in the US</a>, because it has the worst labour rights in the free world. Despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">$2.2</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">tn bailout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-us-data-coronavirus\">36 million people</a> have been fired. This probably means more than 25% unemployment, a crisis worse than the Great Depression. Americans have no self-standing job security rights, except to get 60 days\u2019 warning before mass layoffs. An arbitrary, incompetent or venal boss can say \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. This is the Donald Trump system of job security. It\u2019s creating a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d depression.</p> <p>But the UK can\u2019t be content with its laws. Yes, employers must give reasonable notice before dismissal. At no time can an employer dismiss an employee in a way that breaches the \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wnx7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=\">duty of mutual respect</a>\u201d, or the contract. After two years of work, employees can only be dismissed for a fair reason, as assessed by an employment tribunal, and have a right to a redundancy payment if the dismissal is for economic reasons.</p> <p>That\u2019s fine, but British workers have no votes at work (outside universities such as Cambridge or Edinburgh), and no voice or veto over dismissals. Many employers evade employment rights by drafting sham contracts, pretending their staff are self-employed. The CJRS, with a <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">\u00a330-40</a><a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">bn expected cost</a>, pays 80% of wages to any employee who is furloughed, and it also covers the self-employed. But the scheme came without job security and workplace democracy conditions, <a href=\"https://www.ier.org.uk/comments/ten-things-the-government-can-do-right-now-to-prevent-a-corona-depression/\">as labour law experts called for</a>. So, employers fire staff despite subsidies.</p> <p>A dwindling minority of economic theorists argue we need \u201clabour market flexibility\u201d, saying that rights kill jobs. But there\u2019s no credible evidence for this claim. For instance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \u2013 whose research has influenced the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 thinks employment protection legislation hampers job creation, productivity and investment. But the <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/fmdu9/\">OECD\u2019s analysis</a> is based on breathtaking misunderstandings of employment law. By contrast, the latest credible research shows that job security and workplace democracy decrease unemployment, while <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ilr.12128\">improving productivity</a> and innovation.</p> <p>How can we stop the unemployment pandemic? First, we must change what got us here, and boost workplace security and democracy. In the UK, the secretary of state could amend the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) code that employers must follow before making dismissals. Such amendments could give all staff a voice on dismissals through elected work councils, if unions collectively bargain for them, or if five or more staff request it.</p> <p>We must strengthen our pension laws so that staff representatives, not short-term asset managers, control shareholder votes in companies. Then, to stop irrational layoff decisions being made to begin with, workers need the right to vote for representatives on their board of directors, like they do at Oxford University, BMW or H&amp;M. We already have a <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">democratic </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">society </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">act</a> drafted for the UK, and any US state can pass the workplace democracy and security laws they need without the federal government. States can adapt models such as those that have been proposed by senators Elizabeth Warren, <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/\">Bernie Sanders</a> or Tammy Baldwin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/normal-life-failed-coronavirus-rethink-economy-labour-party\">'Normal' life failed us. The coronavirus crisis gives us the chance to rethink a new economy | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, because so many have already lost their jobs, we need an immediate freeze on dismissals, as France, Italy and Spain have done, and to cancel the dismissals that have taken place since March. The crisis of confidence afflicting business, forcing them to plan for a future of mass unemployment, comes from their fear of collapsing demand. Fear will dissolve with a credible recovery plan.</p> <p>Third, and ultimately, the government has to provide everyone with a job guarantee and a fair income by filling the gaps of our social security system. This is what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/28/un-adopts-universal-declaration-human-rights-paris-1948\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> requires: universal social security and the right to work for fair pay.

  "<p> Like many LGBT teachers, Bradley Saunders learned to live a double life. To his close friends and family he was a young gay man in a steady relationship, while at the primary school where he worked his home life was a secret. He avoided questions about weekends, pretended to go on holiday with his family, and did not take his partner to school social events.</p> <p>So when after four years he moved to a job as director of learning for the Hearts academy trust, and was approached by one of the trust\u2019s teachers, Jane Robinson, about leadership training for LGBT teachers, his first thought was to turn her down.</p> <p>\u201cI had my school life and my home life and I was very happy with that.

  "<p>Love is the great accident. We can fall for the wrong person, or we can have the great good fortune to attach ourselves to the right person, and the strange thing is, we may never know which is which.</p> <p>In Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s 2008 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, a woman\u2019s tough love pulls her husband back from alcoholism and then he becomes president of the United States. That woman is a fictional version of Laura Bush and she sometimes wonders at the amazing, almost casual particularity of her role in history. People seem to blame her: \u201cHis election is my fault, his presidency is my fault, his war is my fault. Why couldn\u2019t I just have let him be an alcoholic? Plenty of wives put up with it every day!\u201d</p> <p>The intersection of the ordinary and the historic made <em>American Wife</em> feel almost Shakespearean; the relationship was destined and domestic and surprisingly sexy. Sittenfeld\u2019s new book, <em>Rodham,</em> undoes destiny, and it tilts toward the political rather than the intimate. This is, in part, because its heroine, Hillary Clinton, is a greater political force than Laura Bush ever was. But also, in <em>Rodham,</em> there is no central marriage. That is the whole point.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem is that this fictional Hillary is not as interesting as the proud and private human being we wonder about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the old days, people used to think Hillary was hitching a ride on Bill\u2019s career \u2013 now it is possible to think that he held a good woman back. <em>Rodham</em> is an account of what might have happened if she had taken one hard look at Bill\u2019s promiscuous nature and run the hell out of the relationship. It is a very exciting conceit; the only pity is that Hillary\u2019s life feels more dull as a result.</p> <p>The first third of the novel is one we know from the history books. The couple meet at Yale, move to San Francisco and then to Fayetteville, where Bill plans to run for office, in Arkansas. In this version, however, Hillary quickly discovers the nature of the man who is the love of her life, and she decides to leave him. \u201cIt was unfathomable that we were hugging a final time, that I was climbing into the car, starting the engine,\u201d she says: and then she does just that.</p> <p>We find the new fictional Hillary in 1991, working as a law professor in Chicago, single and happy enough. Bill has become governor of Arkansas, as he planned to do. At his side is a sweet, soft-spoken, younger wife who wears <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> dresses and cries when challenged on television about his infidelity. This is a version of the famous <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UqKNgrwK8E\">60 Minutes</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UqKNgrwK8E\"> interview</a>, in which the real Hillary saved Bill\u2019s presidential campaign. When alternate Hillary watches it from her life in Chicago, she thinks her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wife is weak. \u201cBill needed an equal who acted like, even if he\u2019d had affairs, so what?\u201d</p> <p>The game of the speculative part of the book is to consider what might have happened differently and what would have happened anyway, and this is a lot of fun. What is the result of happenstance and what of choice? Some incidents look familiar: the suicide of a colleague, the rise of Obama, the fact of Trump. Sittenfeld teases apart the strands of fate and weaves them together in a slightly altered pattern, but she does not change the personality of the actors, nor can she change society itself. Misogyny is a constant in this fictional Hillary\u2019s life, too, though the men who incite it are crucially different. All through her journey, the book holds a certain dream intact \u2013 that, without Bill, our heroine might have become her proper self.</p> <p>The problem is that this \u201cmore true\u201d Hillary, as voiced in the book, is not as interesting as the challenged, proud and private human being we wonder about when we see her on our television screens. In the novel, we find fictional Hillary single at 40 and relieved that the question of children is now moot. She has latent political ambitions but they remain hidden, even from herself. She thinks like a law professor, and this feels appropriate, though it dampens everything down, somehow. The law is a discourse where passion gets turned into procedure, where things are regularised and made known. This tendency is there from the very beginning. When she and Bill go on their first date, as students at Yale, their reported conversation sounds like a job interview for future greatness.</p> <p>The real Hillary is, of course, a controlled kind of person. She is shown, in the early sections, happily nesting in her student bedsit, alone and in her pyjamas, surrounded by her calendar, to-do list and legal briefs. When the young Bill disturbs this moral, conscientious life, they have a great amount of sex, as students in love are prone to do, but there is none of the joyous specificity that made <em>American Wife</em> such a surprising book. Clinton attracted women with great ease and frequency, but though the word \u201ccharisma\u201d is much used, it is hard to tell what exactly his secret was. And although, in later life, his response to getting found out is one of self-pity and resentment, the discovery of his infidelity as a young man produces an odd, confessional penitence. He wakes Hillary in the middle of the night to say she should leave him. \u201cThe thing that is wrong with me is incurable,\u201d he says. This early, more religious self feels a little unlikely \u2013 a young man who says he needs sex all the time is more usually boasting than crying for help. And this is the problem with real life, because in real life people don\u2019t know what they are doing until it is too late.</p> <p>In real life, it is possible to look at that <em>60 Minutes</em> interview and see a man who is not just interested in sex but in punishing his smart-as-paint wife. Yes, there were telephone calls with Gennifer Flowers. \u201cI think once that I called her when we were together,\u201d he says and his wife manages to hold her expression, before glancing quickly down. Bill would later ring senators from the Oval Office while an intern was servicing him under the desk. Perhaps he was addicted, not to orgasm, but to the pleasures of deceit \u2013 and these pleasures sometimes require being found out. So it is possible to see why Clinton needed a woman like Hillary to cheat on, over and again, and less easy to see what she got out of being punished in this way, apart perhaps from the moral high ground and, with it, a sense of her own superiority. The battle for power was in their marriage long before it was in the world. The real Hillary stayed because that is exactly what she would have done. This fictional Hillary leaves when his philandering spills over into something worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/rodham-curtis-sittenfeld-hillary-without-bill-clinton-novelist\">Hillary without Bill: Curtis Sittenfeld rewrites Clinton's personal history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone can have a theory about what happened within the marriage, including people who think it was just a political pact, but one way or the other it was the place where Hillary Rodham Clinton was trapped.

You can ascribe to her one or other flaw (pride is always a good contender); you can ask did she, or the US, deserve her outrageous and misogynistic fate.

The US desperately needs a fantasy. <em>Rodham</em> is a wonderful, sad dream of what might have been \u2013 it contains so much yearning and so many regrets.

  "<p>A photograph of a migrant labourer, his face contorted with anguish as he sits on the roadside in Delhi speaking to his wife about their sick baby boy, has come to symbolise the ordeal of India\u2019s daily wage workers; penniless, and unable to get home to their families because of the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Rampukar Pandit, a construction worker in the Indian capital, had heard that his 11-month-old son was seriously unwell.

His wife, Bimal Devi, had just called to say their son had died.

  "<p>Unless the plan is to keep all children off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/michael-gove-tells-councils-to-look-to-their-responsibilities-and-open-schools\">school</a> until there\u2019s a coronavirus vaccine, we ought to be able to have a conversation about their phased return. That debate should of course include the immediate practical concerns of which year groups stand to be take the greatest hit to their educational progress; which age range is least likely to stick to social distancing (reception or teenagers? It\u2019s genuinely hard to say); and how fast or slow they should be eased back in.</p> <p>But we should also be able to extend our imaginations far enough to consider the risk factors of the virus, as well as where that risk sits in the scope of a child\u2019s life. It would seem civilised to discuss their social isolation as well as the education gaps opening up; the life of the mind as well as the risk to the body.</p> <p>We have a tendency to discuss children, where they come up against policy, quite mechanistically, as a series of inputs and outcomes: this many teaching hours multiplied by this much deprivation gives you this much equality of opportunity. Kids are also people: they need to socialise; wild abnormality makes them anxious; their creativity doesn\u2019t seem to ignite very readily over Microsoft Teams. These considerations are harder to measure than raw infection numbers, but that shouldn\u2019t put them off-limits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than engendering hope, the contrast of other countries with our own government is enough to make us despair</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet an absolutism has crept into these discussions that barely leaves room for scientific fact, let alone the more subtle human trade-offs. Some of it is explicable by sheer ignorance, with which I have a lot of sympathy. I could give you chapter and verse on why a Year 6 child has to go back to primary school, before they start at secondary in September: this transition is one of the most seismic events in a school career. The final term is dictated by carefully planned preparation and reassurance as much as it is by Sats. Children also have to say goodbye to a lot of the people they\u2019ve seen most days for most of their lives. I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone who didn\u2019t have a Year 6 child at home to know all this.</p> <p>But a far more important block to decent decision-making has been the insertion of political identities into what are essentially apolitical matters: for example, a teacher on social media worrying about whether or not kids were vectors of infection was berated as a Marxist, then told she was lazy, a glorified babysitter and could be replaced by an app. Meanwhile, anyone who agrees with children returning to school faces similarly overheated arguments: private schools aren\u2019t planning to go back in June, ergo, you\u2019re being duped into using your kids as cannon fodder.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">unions</a> made a perfectly valid intervention: before we reopen schools, let\u2019s at least equip ourselves to measure the effect on infection rates, and ensure that teachers are protected, as any employee has a right to be. It was interpreted as yet another rebellion of the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8327149/Politicians-warn-union-opposition-opening-schools-risks-destroying-decade-progress.html\">left</a> against authority.</p> <p>It is intensely dispiriting to watch all this break down into a set of completely meaningless caricatures and oppositions: parents who care versus those who don\u2019t; unions against patriots; cowardly teachers set against valiant nurses. It bears no relation to the facts as we know them, and makes no reference to the huge uncertainties we face. Yet, while senseless, it feels discursively familiar: \u201cmy identity is more pro-social than yours\u201d; \u201cmine more authentic\u201d.</p> <p>As wearying as this is, I think it\u2019s driven more by the need for security than by any genuine malice for one another. It is hard to discuss facts on the ground without confronting the terrifying deficiencies of our government. We can look at the evidence in New South Wales that <a href=\"http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2020-04/NCIRS%20NSW%20Schools%20COVID_Summary_FINAL%20public_26%20April%202020.pdf\">infection rates</a> were very low between pupils, and from pupils to staff, but that poses the irresistible question: why have we no similar data sets of our own for those children who have been going to UK schools throughout this crisis? Why didn\u2019t we do any contact tracing, why is there not a single region in the country that could even tell you how many schoolchildren have been infected?</p> <p>We can consider countries such as <a href=\"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education_uncertainty-reigns-as-schools-re-open-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/45747340\">Switzerland</a> that have already reopened many schools, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52421723\">Belgium</a>, with its roadmap helpfully given out so citizens know the plan. Rather than engendering hope, the contrast with our own government is enough to make us despair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/when-will-schools-reopen-uk-children-safe-coronavirus\">When will UK schools reopen \u2013 and how will they keep children safe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other nations appear to be slowly bringing the crisis under control. Yet, as our ministers cannot account for the difference in relative trajectories, refuse to even engage in comparisons, have overseen sluggish testing and non-existent tracing, and fundamentally resist scrutiny, it becomes almost painful to confront our impotence.</p> <p>Why bother comparing evidence and assumptions across Europe and beyond when all it really highlights is that, generally speaking, our situation is worse, and nobody in power is prepared to explain why? At least in a battle between political identities, we can feel as though we have some control over the argument. Without that, we\u2019re simply buffeted from one closed door to another, disempowered and infantilised by a political class that itself has no grip or maturity.</p> <p>Plainly, though, this is self-defeating. As soon as we sort ourselves by ideological type, we\u2019re deaf to any expertise that doesn\u2019t suit our case, strangers to nuance. If the culture war is a comfort blanket, it is a pretty flimsy one for a situation like this. Ultimately, viruses don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a Marxist or a free-market fundamentalist.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Greece may be one of the most written-about countries, so while choosing this list has been a pleasure, there has been agony involved as well. I first went there more than 30 years ago, and it was books that inspired me \u2013 not always novels, and I have cheated a couple of times in my choices here. There is a great deal of excellent non-fiction about Greece \u2013 I would pick out Patrick Leigh Fermor and Henry Miller, though I also wish I could have made more choices by Greek authors, particularly as the past few years have inspired some brilliant writing (check out <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Austerity-Measures-New-Greek-Poetry/dp/0241250625/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DTFLXYRN7SR8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=austerity+measures+the+new+greek+poetry&amp;qid=1589248729&amp;sprefix=austerity+m%2Caps%2C386&amp;sr=8-1\">Austerity Measures</a> if you like poetry, and there are several novels). However, this is a selection for the English reader \u2013 \u201ca transport to Greece\u201d in troubled times. Hopefully, these books will take you there and lead you on to other things.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/30/journeys-in-literature-the-odyssey-by-homer-the-first-step\">The Odyssey by Homer</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"721bc228a9c7837f3814ac67e29318da369004f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/721bc228a9c7837f3814ac67e29318da369004f2/0_223_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An ancient Roman mosaic of Odysseus on his ship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ancient Roman mosaic of Odysseus on his ship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Kaehler/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First cheat \u2013 some would say this isn\u2019t a novel; I would say it\u2019s one of the first. I have never stood on the deck of a Greek ferry, watching the islands slip by, without thinking of the magnificent, mercurial character of Odysseus. And the descriptions of Greece! \u201cRosy-fingered dawn\u201d is undeniable. Some people have problems with the \u201cwine-dark sea\u201d, but really, take a good look at the right time. The only problem is picking the best translation. I\u2019m a fan of Lattimore, Fagles and Fitzgerald. I am also very excited to read a new one by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/08/the-odyssey-translated-emily-wilson-review\">Emily Wilson</a>. In fact, I\u2019ve read the same book in several different versions, which must count for something, including a bad attempt at the original Greek. It\u2019s a foundation for all reading.</p> <h2><strong>The King Must Die by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/mary-renault\">Mary Renault</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f6bb9673944c886196fc9823668eb40ea5d89da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6bb9673944c886196fc9823668eb40ea5d89da/0_0_430_675/319.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Mary Renault\u2019s The King Must Die\" width=\"319\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mary Renault was one of the writers who sent me to Greece in the first place. I read her in my early teens and her \u201chistorical\u201d takes on myth are still a firm favourite. This, and its sequel The Bull from the Sea, are a retelling of the life of Theseus, and the first book has action in the Peloponnese, Crete and Athens \u2013 all places that have played an important part in my life. Renault does not shy away from the difficult aspects residing in these tales. There is dark stuff here, and no real heroes, either. If you enjoyed Game of Thrones, Renault might be where to go next.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/louisdebernieres\">Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin by Louis de Berni\u00e8res</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30c74d4ce180baf97b2a6a404f8c0ad07c8b7568\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30c74d4ce180baf97b2a6a404f8c0ad07c8b7568/0_0_2075_1245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Pelagia in the 2001 film of Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Pelagia in the 2001 film of Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buena Vista</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I asked people what novel conjures up the landscapes and scents of Greece, this was among the most popular replies. I\u2019m not 100% behind it, but agree in general. It\u2019s similar to the movie, which looks gorgeous but has off-putting aspects (the lead actor, for example); in the case of the book, it is some of the politically based caricatures of the communist resistance during the second world war. It caused a lot of controversy when it came out and some of my Greek friends won\u2019t go near it. But its evocation of a lost Kefalonia, the still-beautiful island it\u2019s set on, is perfect. Above all, Pelagia is a character that many who know Greece will recognise \u2013 feisty and passionate.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/little-infamies-9780099433521.html\">Little Infamies by Panos Karnezis</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a95c6df3d85fd814fb0e41cf5be6ea8c5de1bce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a95c6df3d85fd814fb0e41cf5be6ea8c5de1bce4/0_0_416_640/325.jpg\" alt=\"cover of Little Infamies, by Panos Karnezis\" width=\"325\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The location of the unnamed village in Little Infamies is not given, and Karnezis has said it is not necessarily even Greek, although all the names and details point in that direction. I like to imagine it in the Peloponnese, but perhaps only because that\u2019s the region whose villages I know best. A series of interconnecting short stories lays bare the local life, and anyone familiar with this environment will find it <em>deeply</em> familiar. Even the mythological touches make sense \u2013 you\u2019re always half-expecting a centaur to pop up in Greece and engage you in conversation. There are dark secrets beneath the surface of the village, but Karnezis always treats his characters with deep affection.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/10/meg-rossoff-my-family-other-animals-gerald-durrells\">My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecaa6c6a85df1991678f3f5f7f36029757a40893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecaa6c6a85df1991678f3f5f7f36029757a40893/0_313_5809_3486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milo Parker as \u2018Gerry\u2019 Durrell, with Keeley Hawes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milo Parker as \u2018Gerry\u2019 Durrell, with Keeley Hawes in the ITV production of The Durrells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joss Barratt/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My second cheat, I\u2019m afraid, as this is clearly more of an autobiography, but it does read like a comic novel and much of it contains an element of fiction \u2013 for instance, Larry, or Lawrence (see below), didn\u2019t live in the same house as the others. He also called the book \u201cvery wicked [but] very funny\u201d. As a description of an eccentric, dysfunctional family the book is a blast, making you half grateful and half sorry that your family is not similar; but it\u2019s on this list for its descriptions of Corfu, and specifically the landscape and nature. A friend of mine, who has not read it since childhood, recently summed it up perfectly, \u201cI can still hear the cicadas and see the lizards scuttling over sun-drenched rocks.\u201d</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/03/scienceandnature.nicholaslezard\">Uncle Petros and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture by Apostolos Doxiadis</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7b0cc4820a4c748e9b4cc38f74583d3ab2a27bfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b0cc4820a4c748e9b4cc38f74583d3ab2a27bfb/0_0_345_538/321.jpg\" alt=\"cover of Uncle Petros and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture\" width=\"321\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With all this myth and nature roiling around it is good to remind ourselves that the Greeks are also famous for science, maths and logic. Not that this book is without emotion. Uncle Petros is a mathematician laid low by an unsolvable problem, and generally considered a failure. Only his unnamed nephew still thinks he may be redeemable. Don\u2019t be scared off by the maths: this is essentially a study of a human relationship. In between all this we get a superb rendering of a certain facet of Athens, with its old houses and apartments, courtyard gardens and elegant decay.</p> <h2><strong>Freedom and Death by Nikos Kazantzakis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2235d636287fa227e0771792663a10cf5ded7506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2235d636287fa227e0771792663a10cf5ded7506/0_0_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hills and olive groves in south-west Crete.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hills and olive groves in south-west Crete.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry Williams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crete, particularly its mountains and southern coast, was one of my first loves in Greece, so I have to include a couple of books about the island. I must also include some Kazantzakis. Zorba is too obvious, although I do recommend it, and it (secretly) took its inspiration from the Peloponnese, despite being set in Crete. This brooding tale of Captain Michalis (the original title of the book) takes place during the Turkish occupation, and the fact that the local Turkish bey is his blood brother shows the complications of the time. It all boils up into a properly Shakespearean tragedy while showing the characters\u2019, and the author\u2019s, deep love of their island.</p> <h2><strong>The Dark Labyrinth by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lawrence-durrell\">Lawrence Durrell</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"129f6558779efb342c1ef25ef505a7a50ae8da06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/129f6558779efb342c1ef25ef505a7a50ae8da06/8_15_585_954/307.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Lawrence Durrell\u2019s The Dark Labyrinth\" width=\"307\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Caves are important in Greece, providing a connection between our world and the hidden one. Herakles and Orpheus both descended to Hades through one, and Theseus\u2019s labyrinth is surely another. I once climbed down a steel ladder into a deep cave in the Cretan mountains. At the bottom was a rather macabre shrine to a local saint, lit only by my feeble torch. I had an absolute panic attack, and blame much of it on this book, an intriguing mix of adventure story, mythology and horror. It\u2019s not a masterpiece \u2013 Durrell\u2019s non-fiction on Greece is better \u2013 but it nails that chthonic feeling that rests just below the blue skies and waters of Greece.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/12/booker-don-delillo-the-names\">The Names by Don DeLillo</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f51be55cb264c73eb4481910b5b845fe19f51673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f51be55cb264c73eb4481910b5b845fe19f51673/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fishing boats on clear water at Gerolimenas, on the Mani peninsula.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fishing boats at Gerolimenas, on the Mani peninsula.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benny Marty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Talking of dark undercurrents, this little-known book by a famous author gets beneath the skin of Greece magnificently. It is partly set in the Mani, a rocky and often barren part of the southern mainland where my family lived for several years. It is a starkly beautiful area, dotted with tower house fortifications and small Byzantine chapels, but there is always something lurking in the landscape. Imagine a breeze through olive trees for a moment, and then see what DeLillo does with it: \u201cWind blew across the olive groves, causing a wild tremor, a kind of panic, treetops going silver.\u201d Anyone who has visited this part of the world outside of the somnambulant summer will instantly know this.</p> <h2><strong>Atticus the Storyteller\u2019s 100 Greek Myths by Lucy Coats and Anthony Lewis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"244e6ea0e59c538b9663df971124675f2beb3472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244e6ea0e59c538b9663df971124675f2beb3472/0_0_305_400/305.jpg\" alt=\"cover of atticus the storyteller\u2019s 100 Greek myths\" width=\"305\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is possibly my favourite book on this list, mainly because I have spent many an evening reading it to my kids. The Greek myths can be deeply weird and confusing \u2013 check out the Robert Graves version if you don\u2019t believe me \u2013 but children seem to cope with them much more intuitively than adults. The premise behind this collection is genius. Atticus, a tale teller, sets off from his home in Crete to a festival of stories near Troy, travelling through much of Greece. On the way, in exchange for food, lodging and transportation, he relates the myths that are appropriate to the area, starting with the birth of Zeus and ending with the Trojan war. It\u2019s ostensibly a kids\u2019 book, but I would happily read this to myself, and much of my knowledge of Greek mythology rests on it.</p>",

Passengers were moved to the detention centre of Tariq al-Sikka \u2013 infamous for torture and abuse \u2013 where they remain.</p> <p>\u201cMaltese authorities\u2019 refusal to rescue these persons amount to a serious breach of international human rights and maritime law,\u2019\u2019 said Giulia Tranchina, human rights lawyer at Wilson Solicitors in London. \u201cThe survivors taken back to Libya have been placed again in arbitrary detention in inhuman conditions in the main EU-funded \u2018official detention centre\u2019 of Tariq Al Sikka, managed by the Libyan [Directorate for Illegal Migration] police, where male refugees are often tortured in underground cells for months.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Following April\u2019s media coverage, prosecutors in Malta launched an investigation into the allegations. Neville Gaf\u00e0, a former Maltese official, told magistrates on 30 April <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/neville-gafa-says-he-coordinated-libya-pushback-on-opm-orders.788951\">he was enlisted by the government to coordinate the pushback of migrants to Libya,</a> following instructions from the prime minister\u2019s office.</p> <p>The Maltese government did not respond to Guardian requests for comment. However, in a statement released on 15 April, authorities in La Valletta confirmed that it \u201ccoordinated the rescue of an immigrant boat assisted by a commercial vessel\u201d and on 1 May, answering reporters\u2019 questions about the boats, Malta\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, said: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/01/world/europe/ap-eu-malta-migrants.html\">Nothing stops a state from using private assets.</a>\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Alarm Phone said: \u201cTwelve people have died while Malta and Europe were watching. We should never forget that these deaths are the direct result of Malta\u2019s and Europe\u2019s non-assistance policies, and their clear intention to let people die at sea. These deaths could and should have been prevented.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>The survivors are all still in detention cells, including the toddler and baby, at Tripoli\u2019s Tariq al-Sikka, where, according to lawyers and charities, they have no access to medical treatment, or sufficient food and water.</p> <p>\u2018\u2019We wanted to come to Europe because we have the right to live\u2019\u2019 says the woman. \u2018\u2019I have decided to talk because it is my right to talk, because our brothers died in the sea.

According to a <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/809\">2015 Science magazine study</a>, the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99% of the world\u2019s oceans. This, in addition to proactive conservation efforts implemented over the years, has accounted for the flourishing of the lobster population; lobster are thriving in the slightly warmer waters. But lobstermen know better than to celebrate. All they need to do is look at what happened in the early 2000s in places like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Long Island Sound, where once-robust lobster fisheries have become commercially extinct due to the continually warming waters.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have a long time before that happens in Maine,\u201d says Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at Maine\u2019s Island Institute, who works with fishermen to diversify their businesses by including aquaculture, like kelp farming. \u201cBut the changes that are occurring are undeniable.\u201d</p> <p>Those changes aren\u2019t good, but kelp farming has the potential for environmental good. \u201cThe ocean is a sponge for carbon dioxide,\u201d says Nichole Price, senior research scientist and director of the Center for Seafood Solutions at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine. Carbon dioxide is the cause of ocean acidification, one of the myriad stressors responsible for destroying coral reefs and preventing mollusks from building their shells. Price has found evidence that sugar kelp has an especially high capacity for absorbing CO2 and thus lowering the acidity of the surrounding water. Investing in kelp farming now could potentially benefit marine life in the future.</p> <p>\u201cThe Maine coast is almost all lobster now, and it didn\u2019t used to be that way,\u201d says Baines, who has a close-cropped white beard, chiseled cheekbones and hazel eyes so deep-set that it often looks like he\u2019s squinting. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, in summertimes I worked in a lobster boat that went long-lining for ground fish \u2013 cod, haddock, hake \u2013 that were dominant in the Gulf of Maine.\u201d The way Baines says \u201ccod\u201d sounds more like \u201ccaught\u201d, as one might expect of a New Jersey native who spent his childhood summers in Maine and has lived his adult life here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F11e4b618d05331595ee6c5ed874dbe48fcf3c932%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff577b8f212acaac031b433c970e949793253cf55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Bob Baines details\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F11e4b618d05331595ee6c5ed874dbe48fcf3c932%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff577b8f212acaac031b433c970e949793253cf55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Bob Baines details</a> <figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> Bob Baines at the helm of the FV Thrasher. <strong>Right:</strong> Heading back to harbor after checking progress of his kelp farm off Spruce Head, Maine.

If it\u2019s a bad year for lobster, it\u2019s a very bad year for lobstermen.

He is one of the 24 \u201cpartner farmers\u201d working with Atlantic Sea Farms, which was founded in 2009 under the name Ocean Approved as the first commercial seaweed farm and nursery in North America. (Baines\u2019s daughter, Jesse, works for the company.) Atlantic cultivates seeds and gives them to partner farmers, assists with the design and layout of the kelp farms, and coaches farmers throughout the season \u2013 from setting up the farm in the winter to the harvest in spring, complementary to lobster\u2019s summer to fall season. Because Atlantic Sea Farms seeks experienced lobstermen who already have equipment and know-how, start-up costs tend to be lower than those who are beginning from scratch.</p> <p>The farmers grow two types of kelp \u2013 ripply sugar kelp and ribbon-like skinny kelp \u2013 which Atlantic then processes into a line of goods they sell online, to grocery stores, fast-casual chains, meal kit companies such as Daily Harvest, and national restaurants. Kelp grows 3-8lbs per foot of line, which means a farm with 13,000ft, the average size of Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 partner farmers\u2019 lines, can potentially generate around $20,000 to $57,000 at harvest time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"951a0524dedf0585eb8cf37b40da87f46bfa3f26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/951a0524dedf0585eb8cf37b40da87f46bfa3f26/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baines is among 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baines is among 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greta Rybus/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Southport, Maine, an hour down the coast from Baines\u2019 kelp farm, husband and wife Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer are coming up on the end of their latest season growing kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. This will be their third harvest \u2013 though last year an errant dock tore through their lines, sweeping their entire farm away. \u201cWe were getting ready to harvest,\u201d says Hutchins, 35, wearing a weathered baseball cap, wisps of sandy brown hair poking out from underneath. \u201cThere were 18,000 feet of line, 3 \u00bd to 4lbs of kelp a foot, about 5 to 8ft long \u2013 we would have had 90,000lbs of kelp. We spent three days cleaning it up.\u201d</p> <p>After last year\u2019s debacle, Hutchins babysits the plots regularly to see that the lines haven\u2019t crossed, which would rub the kelp right off, and otherwise make sure that everything is looking right. If all goes well, he is projecting a 48,000lb harvest.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a quitter,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cWhen Jodi and I met, the price of lobster went down and I was washing windows for $10 an hour.\u201d Hutchins, who comes from a long line of lobstermen, is no stranger to the turbulence of the trade. His family started fishing in Maine in the 1600s; he himself has been lobstering since he was eight, and started in earnest as a 20-year-old, with his father as his sternman. Until a few years ago, Hutchins fished for shrimp during the lobster off-season. He had invested in hundreds of shrimp traps right before the state closed the shrimp fishery in 2014, due to the warming waters. That is when he and Brewer turned to kelp.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to fill the void where we had lost shrimping,\u201d says Brewer, who wears a fleece pullover embroidered with her name, and punctuates her speech with nervous giggles. \u201cThe price of lobster is so volatile anyways,\u201d adds Hutchins. \u201cWhat we have going on right now with the coronavirus and the prices dropping. Normally this is the highest price time of year. I got $10.50 to $11 per lb this time last year. And now we\u2019re at $4, $4.50. So it\u2019s nice for me to have something else to fall back on besides lobstering.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F36c0a461d35debc5cf13104dd34d55cde1ae28c2%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9a5e8ad02222f6b9bd479ece576f6632df5ab745%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Left: Alex Hutchins, left and Jodi Brewer.

It appears straightforward enough, but creating a three-dimensional rope structure in the ocean is as challenging as you\u2019d think.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re seeding the farm, you\u2019re working out of a skiff, not out of a big lobster boat,\u201d says Baines. \u201cIn a 14ft skiff in choppy waters, you\u2019re bouncing all over the place. When I got home that first day of seeding, I hadn\u2019t been that tired in I don\u2019t know how many years of fishing.\u201d</p> <p>But the effort seems to be paying off. Baines lifts a line out of the water, from where kelp the color of a Budweiser bottle dangles like streamers and offers a sample. The flavor is fresh and vegetal, like underripe peas, and, surprisingly, not salty. No wonder it has gastronomic appeal. Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 kelp has been championed by the likes of Alice Waters, renowned chef, and made an appearance last March in a salad created by chef David Chang for the fast-casual chain Sweetgreen. At Chaval, a French and Spanish-influenced restaurant in Portland, kelp has found its way into the glass \u2013 dried and powdered, in a salted cocktail rim that tasted like the beach \u2013 and onto the plate \u2013 in an ethereally crisp churro stuffed with lemon cream, where kelp is integrated into the dough and blended into the sugar mixture that is sprinkled on top.</p> <p>Despite the multifold promise of kelp, not everyone is on board with seaweed aquaculture. \u201cKelp farming is so new that for many fishermen, the initial reaction is \u2018I don\u2019t want that around here, that\u2019s where I go lobstering\u2019,\u201d says Baines.</p> <p>At a community hearing last year to review the lease for Baine\u2019s kelp farm, other lobstermen <a href=\"https://knox.villagesoup.com/p/courier-gazette-letters-to-the-editor-oct-10/1835778\">complained</a> that the aquaculture lease would somehow hamper their ability to catch lobster, even though kelp farming occurs from winter to the spring, during lobster\u2019s off-season. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reasonable argument,\u201d says Baines. \u201cOnce they see that my lease didn\u2019t bother anyone or take anything away from them, it will all settle right down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa6c8c9e8d30a6c900317dd88a25e727599cbe996%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F202b4bc6805818a8aefdff656b50727ec7b8c301%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Lobstering details\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa6c8c9e8d30a6c900317dd88a25e727599cbe996%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F202b4bc6805818a8aefdff656b50727ec7b8c301%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Lobstering details</a> <figcaption><strong>Left: </strong>The lobster fishing industry has been impacted by climate change and Covid-19, prompting fishers to consider diversifying their practices include aquaculture. <strong>Right: </strong>Lobster ropes and buoys on the docks at Spruce Head Harbor.

They have plans to move into a larger facility and there is a waitlist of fishermen who want to farm with them. They want to expand their network of partner farmers, which currently numbers 24. But due to the coronavirus outbreak, the waters have become choppy. In late March, Atlantic Sea Farms lost most of their food service clients, which made up about 50% of their accounts. Simultaneously, they saw increased retail and meal kit demand, and a surge in online sales. In the short term, they hope to shift the ratio of their contracts toward retail, with a Wegmans rollout and an expansion into Whole Foods in New England and other regions scheduled for the summer.</p> <p>Bob Baines, Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer, and the rest of the partner farmers received an email in late March from Briana Warner, the chief executive of Atlantic Sea Farms, assuring them that the company is still committed to buying their kelp. \u201cLobster prices dropped dramatically and we are heading into the lobster season very soon, so this kelp income matters more than before,\u201d says Warner. \u201cIt could be a very hard season.\u201d To meet the CDC standards for social distancing, Atlantic Sea Farms will not be bringing in their usual seasonal workers who commute from Massachusetts each day during harvest to process the kelp. Instead, it will be done with a local skeleton crew made up mostly of the company\u2019s management team. \u201cIt hurts but we\u2019ll get through it,\u201d says Warner.</p> <p>As for the farmers, they are happy to have work they can rely on. \u201cThis is the hardest time of year for commercial fishermen,\u201d says Hutchins of the winter-spring season. \u201cAnd this year, not knowing what will happen with the lobster market as a whole, it\u2019s nice to know I have something coming in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a98ba18be1221c0c09994fbac1d77e979d4d9612\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98ba18be1221c0c09994fbac1d77e979d4d9612/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fish shack with lobster traps in Cozy Harbor, on Southport Island, Maine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fish shack with lobster traps in Cozy Harbor, on Southport Island, Maine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greta Rybus/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Industry groups predict the impost will make the trade impossible until the dispute is resolved.</p> <p>China\u2019s commerce ministry announced late on Monday that it would proceed with tariffs of 73.6% on barley imported from Australia after an 18-month investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/australia-australia-pm-scott-morrison-disappointed-if-china-coronavirus-invesigation-tariff-plan-linked-covid-19-inquiry\">claims the industry was \u201cdumping\u201d the product</a> at a lower price than at home.</p> <p>In addition, a tariff of 6.9% will be applied based on claims the Australian industry gains an unfair advantage from government subsidies.

  "<p>The World Health Organization will establish an independent and impartial inquiry into the source and handling of the coronavirus outbreak, once the pandemic is brought under control, a virtual meeting of its annual governing body was set to agree on Tuesday.</p> <p>The proposed inquiry, mirroring previous WHO-led inquiries such as the one following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa, arguably stops short of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">fully independent inquiry</a> sought by Australia and the US, but represents a compromise brokered by a powerful alliance led by the European Union and India.</p> <p>The WHO-led inquiry set out in a resolution being put to the UN World Health Assembly on Monday, and negotiated over the past week, is probably less independent and less directed at China\u2019s role in informing the WHO than some critics of China wanted.</p> <p>But the likely terms of reference will give scope to examine China\u2019s cooperation with the WHO and the powers the organisation possesses to demand greater cooperation from member states.</p> <p>The compromise came after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the assembly he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/china-facing-pressure-over-covid-19-and-taiwan-at-world-health-assembly\">supported a comprehensive evaluation</a>, including into the sources and transmission routes of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cChina supports a comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the epidemic after the global epidemic is under control, to sum up experiences and remedy deficiencies,\u201d said Xi. \u201cThis work needs a scientific and professional attitude, and needs to be led by the WHO, and the principles of objectivity and fairness need to be upheld.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted that China had been transparent and open throughout, acting quickly to share information about the disease with the WHO, but said the world needed to be able to respond more quickly in future.</p> <p>Xi also pledged $2bn in financial support over the next two years to help deal with Covid-19, especially in developing countries. China will also make any self-developed Covid-19 vaccines a \u201cpublic good\u201d to help with the efforts to curb the pandemic, he said.</p> <p>Calling the pandemic \u201cthe most serious global public health emergency since the end of the second world war\u201d, Xi said: \u201cAll along we have acted with openness and transparency and responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>He repeatedly directed his remarks to Africa, highlighting how much his country was doing to help the continent develop its health systems and break the shackles of debt.</p> <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he would set up the independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment, adding that it would look into the responsibility of all actors in good faith. The greatest failing, he said, would be not to seek to learn lessons. Short-term amnesia plagued the world\u2019s approach to global health, he said.</p> <p>Previous WHO inquiries into past pandemics have been hard-hitting, but have tended to shy away from criticising individual countries\u2019 performances, preferring instead to propose structural reforms. The WHO has for years debated the degree of autonomy nation states are allowed in terms of cooperating with WHO advice or recommendations. There is, however, a clear duty to keep the WHO promptly informed of potential pandemics.</p> <p>Any inquiry is unlikely to report before the US presidential election in November, so giving Donald Trump and China latitude to continue to publicise conspiracy theories about the source of the virus.</p> <p>Tedros had invited both Xi and Trump to take part in a virtual summit, but Trump did not respond.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was to bring the two superpower leaders together in solidarity to fight the pandemic, and to do so at this historic world health assembly, as well as to try to create a sort of rapprochement in the increasing \u2018cold war\u2019 between China and America,\u201d said a source familiar with the invitation.</p> <p>Asked about his lack of response, Trump said at a White House event: \u201cI chose not to make a statement today. I\u2019ll be giving them a statement, sometime in the near future, but ... I think they [the WHO] have done a very sad job in the last period of time.\u201d</p> <p>The US was isolated in its hostility to the WHO, with even its closest ally, Australia, joining the chorus of support for the organisation\u2019s central role in overseeing the global response to the pandemic and calls to end the \u201chit and miss\u201d funding of the UN body. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\">suspended all payments</a> to the WHO pending a review into its alleged \u201cChina-centric leadership\u201d and ineffectiveness. His aides have been discussing continuing to make a minimal payment so in part to retain influence over any inquiry. Trump said on Monday he would make a decision about WHO funding soon.</p> <p>The US health secretary, Alex Azar, told the assembly that the virus had spun out of control due to the WHO failings.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>Without naming China, Azar added: \u201cIn an apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak, at least one member state made a mockery of their transparency obligations, with tremendous costs for the entire world.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that WHO failed at its core mission of information sharing and transparency when member states do not act in good faith. This cannot ever happen again.\u201d</p> <p>In a hard-hitting speech, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said recent weeks had seen many expressions of international solidarity, but very little practical action. \u201cWe are all paying the price for implementing contradictory strategies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He warned the disease had spread across the world, and was now heading for developing countries where he predicted it would be even more devastating.</p> <p>He said the WHO was irreplaceable and needed enhanced support, arguing: \u201cWe are as strong as the weakest health system.\u201d</p> <p>An inquiry to look back fully into how everyone reacted, he said, should wait until we have turned the page. \u201cNow is not the time,\u201d he insisted, arguing: \u201cNow is the time for unity. We stand together, or we fail.\u201d</p> <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the only priority worth talking about was ending the disease. The time demanded \u201cfreedom from complacency and unfounded accusations\u201d, a remark that could be directed at Washington\u2019s repeated claim that China may have deliberately spread the virus in the west.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, threw her support behind the WHO, saying everyone needed to look at the sustainability of its financing.</p>",

The cheerleaders are seeking personal triumphs, but they also really, really want to win for Monica.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e950d87e7a21ac51e21aa3703fd2a0d46329b5b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e950d87e7a21ac51e21aa3703fd2a0d46329b5b9/216_0_3375_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Aldama, coach of Navarro College Bulldogs Cheer team.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monica Aldama, coach of Navarro College Bulldogs Cheer team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheerleading remains linked to the yesteryear image of pompoms and short skirts, but this is not that kind of cheerleading.

And cases are on the rise away from the more urban states.</p> \n  <p>The Trump administration spent Sunday continuing its pivot toward opening up the economy, in the face of crippling unemployment in an election year. But on Sunday night one of those independent voices who the president finds so irritating,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell</strong>, told CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, essentially, \u201cNot so fast.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis economy will recover,\u201d Powell said, but \u201cit may take a while. It may take a period of time, it could stretch through the end of next year, we don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Powell also said unemployment could reach 25% and said the economy would not fully recover until Americans \u201cfeel they are safe\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Powell said: \u201c<strong>Assuming that there\u2019s not a second wave of the coronavirus</strong>, I think you\u2019ll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year \u2026 People will have to be fully confident, and that may have to await <strong tabindex=\"-1\">the arrival of a vaccine</strong>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Short points to that end:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Many experts fear a second wave of the coronavirus later in the year \u2013 one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/rick-bright-testimony-coronavirus-trump-ousted-whistleblower\">Trump administration whistleblower</a> said last week the US was facing \u201c<strong>the darkest winter in modern history</strong>\u201d and spoke of the country being \u201cin deep shit\u201d.</li> \n   <li>Trump administration predictions about the development and availability of a vaccine are rated by most experts and even the Republican chair of the Senate health committee as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-senate-republicans\">hugely ambitious at best</a>.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Powell\u2019s interview would always have seemed likely to stoke the president\u2019s ire \u2013 he also urged more stimulus spending by Congress, and though the House passed a $3tn bill on Friday the Republican Senate and White House don\u2019t want it.</p> \n  <p>And indeed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262205045359226880\"><strong>Trump went at CBS on Sunday night.</strong></a> But he was most exercised about the aforementioned whistleblower, Rick Bright, whose interview he said showed CBS and 60 Minutes were \u201cdoing everything in their power to demean our Country, much to the benefit of the Radical Left Democrats\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump attacked Bright, while characteristically claiming not to know him, and said \u201cthis whole Whistleblower racket needs to be looked at very closely, it is causing great injustice &amp; harm\u201d. </p> \n  <p>A whistleblower from the intelligence community, remember, triggered Trump\u2019s impeachment over his approaches to Ukraine for help against his political rivals.</p> \n  <p>Trump tagged Senator Susan Collins, who <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/minority-media/committee-approves-akaka-collins-whistleblower-protection-legislation\">authored</a> <strong>whistleblower protection legislation</strong>, and said he hoped the Maine Republican was \u201clistening\u201d. He also named the head of CBS, Shari Redstone, and said he hoped she would \u201ctake a look at her poorly performing gang\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In other news on Sunday night, the Axios website reported that Trump is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1261640314709774338?s=20&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossneakpeek&amp;stream=top\">poised</a> to <strong>confirm his cut of all funding to the World Health Organization</strong> \u2013 in the middle of a pandemic.
