  "<p>Taylor Swift is calling on Tennessee lawmakers to remove racist monuments, arguing \u201cvillains don\u2019t deserve statues\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things,\u201d tweeted Swift, who owns a home in Nashville. \u201cEdward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such.\u201d</p> <p>Swift\u2019s outrage comes after demonstrators toppled a statue of Carmack that sat outside the Tennessee Capitol on 30 May. Carmack was a prominent attorney and newspaperman in Tennessee and served in the state senate from 1901 to 1908. His statue was first erected in 1927. Swift noted <a href=\"https://tnmuseum.org/Stories/posts/who-was-edward-carmack\">Carmack</a> was known for writing pro-lynching articles and promoted violent attacks against the trailblazing Black journalist Ida B Wells. Tennessee has said it would replace the statue. But Swift argued that would be \u201ca waste of state funds and a waste of an opportunity to do the right thing\u201d.</p> <p>She suggested Carmack\u2019s statue be replaced with a memorial to Wells \u201cfor her pioneering work in journalism and civil rights\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1271534712423698434\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things.

  "<p>MPs have labelled British Airways \u201ca national disgrace\u201d for trying to slash its staff terms and conditions during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>In a scathing report, the Commons transport select committee accused BA of making \u201ca calculated attempt to take advantage of the pandemic\u201d through moves that could lead to up to 12,000 staff being laid off and the remaining 30,000 put on inferior contracts.</p> <p>Although the report said some redundancies at BA and other airlines might be inevitable, it condemned the flagcarrier, which has been granted a \u00a3300m Bank of England loan and received \u00a335m a month to furlough thousands of employees.</p> <p>In conclusion, MPs said: \u201cThe behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace. It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.\u201d</p> <p>BA issued formal notice to unions at the end of April of its plans to lay off staff and reduce terms and conditions. The 45-day minimum period for consultation will pass on Monday, although immediate redundancies are not expected.</p> <p>The transport committee chair, Huw Merriman, said: \u201cThe impact of coronavirus may sadly mean that the loss of some jobs in the aviation sector is justified. The behaviour of British Airways and its parent company, IAG, is not.\u201d</p> <p>He said MPs would continue to bring pressure to alter BA\u2019s plans, including potentially asking if its airport slots \u2013 it occupies almost half of takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow, Britain\u2019s biggest airport \u2013 could be reviewed on competition grounds.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThis wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction \u2013 by government, parliamentarians or paying passengers who may choose differently in future.\u201d</p> <p>BA said the report was \u201cfuelled by impassioned messages\u201d rather than the facts, and said: \u201cThe government has no plans to help the sector restart and recover, as evidenced by the introduction of the 14-day quarantine regulation. We find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry. A crisis not of our making but one which we must address.</p> <p>\u201cWe will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.\u201d</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, easyJet and other airlines are expecting to shed a similar proportion of their workforce, but BA\u2019s proposals to force through inferior contracts on staff follow previous attempts, and ensuing industrial disputes, before the pandemic.</p> <p>The report acknowledged the depth of the crisis facing aviation, and said helping the sector\u2019s recovery from a 97% drop in passenger flights and the loss of \u00a320bn in revenue in the UK should be a priority for government. It criticised ministers for failing to act sooner, saying that at four months into the crisis \u201cthe strategy should be more developed\u201d and urged it to set out plans as soon as possible.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it said the quarantine measures introduced last Monday would damage the recovery, and urged it to abandon the policy on review in favour of \u201ca more flexible and risk-based approach to border control\u201d. BA, easyJet and Ryanair have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/12/ba-easyjet-and-ryanair-begin-court-action-over-uk-quarantine-rules\">launched a high court action</a> to overturn rules forcing passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days.</p> <p>MPs also called for a temporary suspension of air passenger duty and business rates payments to help the sector recover.</p> <p>The Unite union, which represents thousands of aviation workers, said the report was \u201can immediate wake-up call to the government\u201d.</p> <p>The union\u2019s assistant general secretary, Diana Holland, said: \u201cThe chancellor first promised support for aviation in March and three months later that still has not materialised. The aviation industry must also respect the report\u2019s findings and stop prematurely making workers redundant.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the report, a government spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise that this will be a very distressing time for all employees in the aviation industry and their families. We encourage businesses to respect the spirit of measures such as the job retention scheme.However, we stand ready to support those who may still lose their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to work at speed to help protect the long-term future of the sector. However, we will always put public health first, and we must not risk an extremely damaging second wave of the virus.\u201d</p>",

With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.\u201d</p> \n<p>The remarks followed action by a number of US cities and states towards banning police chokeholds.

  "<p>This year the summer reading stack developed a dystopian counterpart: the lockdown reading stack. Just like the summer stacks, lists proliferated all over social media.

That\u2019s it. I did not even make it to a battle scene.</p> <p>I <em>finished</em> a book at the very start of lockdown \u2013 James Bradley\u2019s excellent Ghost Species \u2013 but in hindsight it was the last-ditch effort of someone staggering to the finish line at the end of a hard race.

Instead I ended up watching a bunch of Jane Austen film adaptations and the BBC mini-series of Wolf Hall.</p> <p>My actual reading list ended up being, well, short. Sally Rooney\u2019s Conversations With Friends did nothing but make me yearn for the vapid pleasures of our before-pandemic social lives (remember gossip!?) and after about 150 pages of what I found to be overly florid and weirdly ethereal prose in Ocean Vuong\u2019s On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous I felt like I was going to have a panic attack. <strong>- </strong><em><strong>Michael McGowan, reporter</strong></em></p> <h2>Still can\u2019t do gossip</h2> <p>Over the course of isolation, I thought what I needed was escapist gossip.

It turns out what I actually needed was a dystopian YA deep-dive into how privileged young men turn into monsters. Is it a Hunger Games? Yes. Is it for teenagers? Kind of. Is it escapist? Not really.

The prime minister acknowledged that tracking back to normal would likely spark new Covid-19 infections but he said, more than once, this wasn\u2019t something that should slow the trajectory. \u201cOutbreaks are not a reason to slow things down,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cOutbreaks are going to happen, all premiers and chief ministers understand that.\u201d</p> <p>Should the states hold their nerve if the resumption of normal activity brought new clusters of infections? \u201cYes,\u201d Morrison replied. Just in case we missed it, the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, also echoed the line. \u201cThe important thing is not the size of the outbreak, the important thing is the response.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/12/black-lives-matter-australia-protest-will-blm-protests-spark-second-covid-19-coronavirus-wave-health-experts\">Black Lives Matter: health experts assess risks of Covid-19 transmission at Australia protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But at a point in time this week, Morrison\u2019s story changed. Apparently the risk of new clusters could be a factor in how fast things moved if the clusters emerged from a Black Lives Matter protest.</p> <p>Asked by the Melbourne radio host Neil Mitchell whether governments would be easing things a bit more quickly if the rallies hadn\u2019t happened this past weekend, Morrison was equally declarative. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cNo doubt\u201d. About an hour earlier on 2GB in Sydney, Morrison described the rallies as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/scott-morrison-if-black-lives-matter-protesters-defy-advice-and-march-they-should-be-charged\">the \u201conly legitimate block\u201d to easing</a> restrictions because a cluster of new infections might emerge.</p> <p>Now why is the opposite also true? Perhaps the best explanation is the simplest one. Perhaps Morrison indulged in a bit of rhetorical overreach on May 8. His bullish suggestion that governments would, or should, push on with easing of restrictions in the face of evidence this really wasn\u2019t a great idea always seemed more like political flourish than reality, and academic in any case, given in our federation the premiers control the timing.</p> <p>But when you begin to catalogue contradictions, you\u2019ll find they keep coming.</p> <p>Take the borders. Morrison said this week he\u2019s worried about a new cluster of infections as a consequence of the Black Lives Matter protests (remembering that 8 May Scott Morrison wasn\u2019t worried about clusters in other contexts because that\u2019s the price of life returning to normal). But the prime minister also wants the states to press ahead and reopen their borders, pronto. So are we worried about the consequences of the recent mass gatherings, or not? Try and divine the logic here. Go on. I\u2019ll wait.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c68c46d6eafdf71b34870d87bcfc52372bfd8d52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c68c46d6eafdf71b34870d87bcfc52372bfd8d52/0_120_5300_3180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-lockdown protest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Those anti-lockdown protests happened when the health restrictions were tougher. Yet the prime minister was sanguine.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is compounded because Morrison has also exhibited a flexible attitude to protests. People will have heard the prime minister\u2019s strong criticism of the mass gatherings last weekend, but that activism wasn\u2019t the first outbreak of civic expression during the pandemic. There were protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/12/vaccines-5g-bill-gates-why-are-australians-gathering-to-spread-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories\">against the public health lockdowns on 12 May</a>.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s true the earlier assemblies were much smaller than the gatherings to protest Indigenous incarceration, and that fact obviously influences the public health risk assessment, but those anti-lockdown protests happened when the health restrictions were tougher. Yet the prime minister was sanguine. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country. People will make their protests and their voices heard,\u201d Morrison said at the time \u2013 noting it was up to authorities to ensure things remained within the bounds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/scott-morrison-if-black-lives-matter-protesters-defy-advice-and-march-they-should-be-charged\">Scott Morrison: Black Lives Matter protesters should be charged if they defy advice and march</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So we\u2019ve washed up in a mildly surreal universe where clusters both are and aren\u2019t a problem; where we are worried about clusters if they come from (some) protests but not if they come from repopulated workplaces or shopping centres thronging with people; and if you organise or participate in a protest about coronavirus being a \u201cscam\u201d or linked to vaccines or 5G technology, that\u2019s kosher because it\u2019s free expression, but if you organise or participate in a protest against Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody, that\u2019s engaging in unwelcome and highly risky and dangerous activity.</p> <p>And this from a prime minister who says consistency is important.</p> <p>The next logical question to ask is why the dissonance? I think the simplest way to think about this is Morrison drifts back and forth between a prime minister who wants to unite people and a prime minister who wants to divide people and pit them against one another for partisan advantage.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s 30th prime minister is like a reverse cycle heating and cooling unit. He possesses both instincts, and deploys both situationally.</p> <p>Morrison also tunes his messages up and down with different audiences. The negative commentary about the Black Lives Matter protests, and the Trump-lite lines on the protests being \u201ctaken over by other much more politically driven leftwing agendas\u201d were delivered on 2GB \u2013 a bit of red meat for the base.</p> <p>When Mathias Cormann was wheeled out to deliver very similar messages several days earlier, presumably as a test run \u2013 to opine about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/the-government-does-not-need-to-import-divisive-leadership-strategies-from-overseas\">reckless self-indulgence of people</a> rallying to pursue better outcomes for First Nations people \u2013 he was deployed to Sky News, the narrowcaster\u2019s network of choice.</p> <p>Perhaps the government\u2019s judgment is some coddling is in order. Morrison has stretched the tolerance of the base during the pandemic by working cooperatively with premiers who prioritised public health sufficiently to shut down non-essential services, which has imperilled businesses and cost jobs.</p> <p>You can feel the incipient backlash bubbling up through the Coalition backbench, which is getting mouthier with the leadership about winding back fiscal support, and about returning conditions to normal. That activity is a reliable barometer of community sentiment in Coalition safe-seat land.</p> <p>Looking beyond an inclination to engage in confirmation bias exercises with the base, the other thing to understand is the most substantial economic downturn since the Great Depression will make people very focussed on their material circumstances.</p> <p>Morrison will be very aware that when people are worried about their livelihoods, people will be more inclined to be impatient with protests, viewing the behaviour as an abstraction or an indulgence. That fault line is something you can mine; it is angst that can be weaponised against your progressive opponents.</p> <p>I suppose we\u2019ve arrived at the point where I bring you the unwelcome news that politics-as-usual returned to the national stage this week. Morrison is back to minute calculations and tactics. But he also doesn\u2019t want to shake off the prime minister he became during the coronavirus crisis: the unifier.</p> <p>This was particularly obvious on Friday, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/12/scott-morrison-sorry-for-no-slavery-in-australia-claim-and-acknowledges-hideous-practices\">walked back a tone deaf and factually incorrect observation</a> he\u2019d made during Thursday\u2019s 2GB rampage about slavery never existed in Australia. Morrison wanted people to know that he was a prime minister who cared about Indigenous disadvantage. He put his back into expressions of regret. He gave every impression of being sorry.</p> <p>But Morrison was unable to say, in clear and frank terms, that slavery happened in this country. \u201cHideous practices\u201d happened. You had to guess what these hideous practices might have been.</p> <p>He had to talk around the issue to arrive at a generalised position of regret, because to do otherwise was to engage in \u201cthe history wars\u201d. Just to be clear, no one had asked Morrison to engage in the history wars, the invitation was to tell the truth. Slavery happened. The end. Not that hard you would think.</p> <p>In any case, the mark of the unifying prime minister is not what you say, or how you might like to see or project yourself, but what you do.</p> <p>First Nations people can see a prime minister who declines to criticise a protest promulgating unproven conspiracy theories in the middle of a pandemic but choses to criticise a protest highlighting the ongoing subjugation of Indigenous people in their own country.</p> <p>First Nations people have heard many fine words throughout the white history of this continent. Words are cheap. What they need is action, and the person who can lead the action, with all the authority of the prime ministerial office, is Morrison.</p>",

In 2019, he went a step further and shut down the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">U</a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">N\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">human rights office </a>in the country after 23 years, claiming he had made sufficient progress in human rights.</p> <p>Yet when Nkurunziza first came to power following the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war, which pitted Hutu rebels against the Tutsi-led army, he had seemed genuinely committed to the ideals of peace and democracy. As the leader of the CNDD\u2013FDD (National Council for the Defence of Democracy \u2013 Forces for the Defence of Democracy) Hutu rebel group, he had begun negotiating a peace deal in 2001. Two years later he signed the <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/node/1207\">Arusha agreement</a>, which ended the civil war, in which 300,000 people died. He transformed his rebel group into a political party and joined the transition government as a minister for good governance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853/946_0_4526_3273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berthier Mugiraneza/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005 Nkurunziza became president after his party won the elections by a landslide. A year later he lifted a curfew that had been in place since 1972. In 2007 Burundian soldiers joined an African Union (AU) peacekeeping force in troubled Somalia. The <a href=\"https://umoya.org/2009/03/13/burundi-paris-club-creditors-cancel-burundis-debt/\">Paris Club group</a> of creditors cancelled Burundi\u2019s debt in 2009.&nbsp;</p> <p>But after being re-elected with 92% of the vote in the 2010 poll, which was boycotted by many opposition candidates, Nkurunziza became increasingly authoritarian, power-hungry and intolerant. In 2014 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27818254\">he even banned jogging</a> out of \u201cfears it could be used by his opponents as a cover for subversion\u201d.</p> <p>Burundi was inching so close to another Hutu-Tutsi conflict that in 2016 the AU approved a pre-emptive deployment of a 5,000-strong <a href=\"https://theglobalobservatory.org/2016/02/burundi-nkurunziza-african-union-maprobu/\">African Prevention and Protection Mission </a>in Burundi, which has yet to be deployed because Nkurunziza objected to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colonisation has produced many crises that continue to haunt post-independence Africa but few have been as destructive as the Hutu-Tutsi divide. In neighbouring <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26875506\">Rwanda in 1994 it fuelled a genocide in which 800,000 </a>mostly Tutsis were killed by the Hutus. Twenty years earlier, in Burundi, it led to a wave of mass killing of mostly Hutus by the Tutsi-led army following a failed Hutu coup in 1972. Experts estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed.</p> <p>Like Rwanda, the 1972 killings affected Burundi so deeply that it has become a defining political factor. Almost all recent Hutu leaders, including the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchior_Ndadaye#:~:text=Melchior%20Ndadaye%20(March%2028%2C%201953,a%20Burundian%20intellectual%20and%20politician.&amp;text=His%20assassination%20sparked%20an%20array,decade%2Dlong%20Burundi%20Civil%20War.\">Melchior Ndadaye</a>, whose assassination triggered the 1993 civil war, was a 1972 refugee. Nkurunziza\u2019s father, Eustache Ngabisha, a former member of parliament and governor of Ngozi and Kayansi provinces, was a victim of the 1972 ethnic killings. Nkurunziza was eight years old at the time of his death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Born in Ngozi, Nkurunziza was the son of Ngabisha and of Domitille (nee Minani), a Tutsi assistant nurse. After his father\u2019s death, his family moved to Gitega, where Nkurunziza attended Athen\u00e9e de Gitega secondary school.</p> <p>A fitness enthusiast and keen footballer who in later life owned his own team, Hallelujah FC, Nkurunziza studied physical education at the University of Burundi. After graduation in 1990, he worked as a high school PE teacher at Muramvya high school. He married Denise Bucumi, who later became a pastor, in 1994.</p> <p>The following year, while working as a lecturer at the University of Burundi, in Bujumbura, Nkurunziza was shot at during a Tutsi attack on the campus, which killed hundreds of students. He joined one of several rebel Hutu groups, CNDD\u2013FDD, as a soldier.&nbsp;Two of his six siblings were killed after civil war erupted in 1993 and three others died while fighting with CNDD-FDD. By 1998 Nkurunziza was promoted to deputy secretary-general of the group, and in 2001 became its leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10/0_11_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-government protestors in Bujumbura, 2015.

Nkurunziza was elevated to the status of \u201cParamount Leader and Champion of Patriotism\u201d, a title that came with a $535,000 retirement package and villa.&nbsp;</p> <p>His cause of death was officially given as a heart attack, yet many suspect it was Covid-19.&nbsp;Ten days before his death, his wife was airlifted to Kenya for treatment for coronavirus symptoms, <a href=\"https://www.nation.co.ke/dailynation/news/burundi-first-lady-denise-nkurunziza-airlifted-to-nairobi-for-treatment-310894\">according to the Daily Nation</a>.

One Greenpeace campaigner described the flight as \u201cmind-blowing\u201d, while a deputy for the Green party in the Flemish parliament, Imade Annouri, said it was nonsensical, polluting and outdated. \u201cIn several neighbouring countries, short flights are being phased out and investments are being put into rail links,\u201d the Flemish deputy said. \u201cI would prefer to see the minister for mobility in the avant-garde rather than supporting an airline company.\u201d</p> <p>Peeters said she had taken the flight to show support for regional airports, but conceded her presence at a press conference would have been enough. In a statement, Peeters said she fully supported initiatives to make the aviation industry more sustainable. \u201cMobility and sustainability will have to go hand in hand. I therefore fully understood the criticism of last Tuesday\u2019s press flight.\u201d</p> <p>The minister had been attending an event to explain the Flemish government\u2019s actions to help regional airports, such as Antwerp and Ostend, hit by the economic impact of coronavirus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/slow-streets-can-coronavirus-cure-brussels-of-addiction-driving\">Can coronavirus cure Brussels of its addiction to driving?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The criticism recalls the outcry when the federal environment minister, Marie-Christine Marghem, took a private jet to a UN climate summit in 2018, but declined to sign Belgium up to a group of countries pledging to make deeper cuts in emissions.</p> <p>Belgium\u2019s regions control many policies necessary to tackle the climate emergency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/belgium-climate-crisis-school-strikers-activists\">such as transport, housing and agriculture</a>, which has contributed to slow progress.

You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don\u2019t engage and share your original posts then you\u2019re missing a huge potential source of customers.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created <a href=\"https://clapforourcarers.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">clapforourcarers.co.uk</a> with <a href=\"https://uk.godaddy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoDaddy</a>.</p> <p>Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,\u201d says Plas.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/go-make-it/2020/jun/12/freeze-dried-fruit-and-brownies-how-having-a-website-kept-these-businesses-thriving-when-lockdown-hit\">Freeze-dried fruit and brownies: how having a website kept these businesses thriving when lockdown hit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.</p> <p>Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.\u201d</p> <p>Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Becoming an influencer</h2> <p>\u201cSome influencers get a bad reputation,\u201d says Masha Zvereva, founder of <a href=\"https://codingblonde.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coding Blonde</a>. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.</p> <p>Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cInfluencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don\u2019t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you\u2019re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAnyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I\u2019d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people\u2019s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?\u201d</p> <h2>Building a brand</h2> <p>Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can\u2019t be overstated.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is something Zaffrin and Brian O\u2019Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company <a href=\"https://www.fivedotbotanics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Five Dot Botanics</a> set out to do well before their company launched.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c019d31e0a05e500bfad4d6c968d89b093c80f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c019d31e0a05e500bfad4d6c968d89b093c80f5b/0_0_573_764/375.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand'\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSocial media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,\u201d says Zaffrin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Before setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.&nbsp;</p> <p>The stories the O\u2019Sullivans shared weren\u2019t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.</p> <p>Once the social channels were up and running, the O\u2019Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy\u2019s services \u2013 and they were in business.</p> <p>Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you\u2019re willing to put money behind it \u2013 paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is \u201cone to watch\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOur audience are our fans,\u201d she says. \u201cThey root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they\u2019re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at <a href=\"https://www.openwestand.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenWeStand.org</a> to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

  "<p>Picture the scene. You\u2019re keen to find out more about a product so you google it, and the search results bring up various mentions \u2026 but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any online links to the company that produces it. After a few more tries, you give up with a shrug.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fact is that without a website, a business doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 or, as Descartes might have it: \u201cI link therefore I am.\u201d It\u2019s a concept that Stuart Prescott, the co-founder of a freeze-dried fruit brand, <a href=\"https://www.5thseasonfruit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">5th Season</a>, understands implicitly: \u201cIt\u2019s expected that a business should have a website; if they didn\u2019t, you might not trust them,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>With a background in product development and marketing for the likes of Pepsi and Kettle Chips, Prescott knows what it takes to make a successful brand. \u201cIf you look at the small businesses that have got big \u2013 Graze, Huel, Grenade \u2013 they were online-only for a number of years,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that meant is that they had a really great relationship with their consumers, so as soon as they went into Tesco, for example, or another retailer, they were a huge success.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebcd80964da0c198b59953182bd05cf0aa0b6a10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebcd80964da0c198b59953182bd05cf0aa0b6a10/0_0_573_764/375.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'I don't want to be writing code \u2026 I wanted to bake brownies'\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Launching your business online also allows you to test and learn more affordably than if you were to open a bricks-and-mortar store. \u201cThe plan was always to set up online initially,\u201d says Andy Walker, who launched <a href=\"https://gingerbreadbakery.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gingerbread Bakery</a> in February, just as pandemic preparations were ramping up. Featuring personalised notes and packaging, Walker\u2019s brownies and other baked goods make handy long-distance gifts, so the timing has actually panned out OK. (Not that you can please everybody: \u201cSomeone did complain to me yesterday about being called Gingerbread Bakery even though we don\u2019t sell any gingerbread yet,\u201d he says.) Customers enter their message directly on to the website and Walker fires up the oven to order.</p> <p>An IT software developer by trade, Walker resisted the temptation to personally engineer every facet of his site. \u201cI know how much work generally goes into e-commerce so I knew it could be a long-winded process, and that\u2019s why I started to look at off-the-shelf solutions. I don\u2019t want to be writing code. I could \u2013 I could spend eight or nine hours a day developing my own website \u2013 but that\u2019s not what I wanted to do, I wanted to bake brownies.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Unlike 5th Season, which brought in an external company to create its website, Walker researched the self-build options and decided to go for GoDaddy.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt just seemed the most logical to me. It could do everything that I needed without it being too technical. This was \u2018click and do\u2019,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>By using <a href=\"https://uk.godaddy.com/websites-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoDaddy\u2019s Websites + Marketing</a>, which has been made free during the Covid-19 pandemic, Walker benefits from a whole suite of tools, including search engine optimisation (SEO), email marketing, blog analytics and social media stats. This keeps him incredibly close to his business performance, whether he\u2019s seeking to identify best-sellers or regular customers.</p> <p>So far, so successful \u2013 but what if you\u2019re selling a service, not a product? And what if that service is all about bringing people together, at a time when no one could leave their house? As the country closed in on itself in March, Lizzy Eaton, the founder of an events agency, <a href=\"https://oddityevents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oddity Events</a>, began sharing virtual hints and tips via her business blog. This grew into a series of weekly webinars and, to her surprise, created new business leads too.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be selling any of my services during this time, but because of my blog and my website I have been able to,\u201d says Eaton. Off the back of her online marketing \u2013 which, like Walker, she runs through GoDaddy Websites + Marketing \u2013 she was approached by a brand consultancy firm who wanted to run a virtual event.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/go-make-it/2020/jun/12/being-online-has-helped-us-survive-how-e-commerce-can-kickstart-your-small-business-in-lockdown-and-beyond\">\u2018Being online has helped us survive\u2019: how e-commerce can kickstart your small business in lockdown \u2013 and beyond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Eaton, digital will remain a core part of her business even as restrictions are lifted. \u201cYou can integrate online to make your events more sustainable by, for example, not flying in speakers from across the world, or you can have all of your assets on a website rather than printing out reams of paper,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cEven in normal times, I speak a lot to clients about how we can make our events more inclusive,\u201d she says. \u201cI talk about it in terms of physical inclusion for people with disabilities, and cultural inclusion.

  "<p>Public statues are never historic, they are always contemporary. Councils maintain them. Planning law sustains their visibility. Criminal law punishes interference. Social power preserves them because it likes what they say. When people feel that the story monuments tell is disadvantageous, they destroy them: think Akhenaten, Lenin, Saddam Hussein, a rooftop swastika.</p> <p>Removal is an act of historic authorship. Sustaining one, meanwhile, is narrative curation. If we do nothing, statues fall down of their own accord. We therefore face an ongoing choice: commit resources to removing a monument or to maintaining it. What we choose depends on the narratives we invest in it, what impact we seek and what inconveniences we gloss over.</p> <p>In contrast to postwar Germany\u2019s soul-searching, Britain has kept up appearances over imperialism \u2013 through the monarchy, the Commonwealth and the myths of exploration, benign rule and abolitionism. These mask perpetrations of violence and injustice \u2013 slavery included. Because Britain will not face its past, schools do not teach imperialism as Germany does nazism. Instead, we have the pomp and the statues.</p> <p>As time diminishes personal culpability, individuals are looking beyond the fantasy to contemplate the harm that people sailing from these islands did.

  "<p>When Kate Moore, a 21-year-old student, saw the bitterness of the division in her home of Ashbourne over the disappearance of a bust of a black man\u2019s head, she decided to come up with a compromise.</p> <p>Over the last week, the mystery over the whereabouts of the head, which Moore viewed as indisputably racist, has lifted this small Derbyshire town to national prominence. Before that it was best known as the home of Royal Shrovetide, an eccentric, beloved and very English game of \u201cmedieval football\u201d played through the streets each year.</p> <p>Everyone could get behind that, Moore thought.

But I am.\u201d</p> <p>Three weeks after the death of George Floyd, and five days after a controversial Bristol statue of the slavetrader Edward Colston was toppled, the intensity of the mood that has gripped Ashbourne is far from unique. And with grown men in shorts and woggles defending a statue of Robert Baden-Powell, and the prime minister himself intervening, it has taken on the unmistakable flavour of a culture war. </p> <p>The Derbyshire Dales\u2019 incarnation of this national crisis began seven days ago, when another student from Ashbourne published a petition: \u201cRemove the racist caricature of a black man\u2019s head from the Green Man sign.\u201d The crude wooden caricature, which sits on an archway resembling a gallows in the centre of town, is a recognisable version of a classically demeaning image of a black man. The petition\u2019s author \u2013 who has since stayed out of view after a torrent of abuse and threats \u2013 wanted her town to be part of the international movement. \u201cWe in Ashbourne can do our bit to fight back against this kind of vile racism,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>After the momentous events in Bristol on Sunday, and with the number of signatories calling for the head\u2019s removal reaching 30,000, the district council \u2013 which turned out to be the owner \u2013 decided it had to act. Plans were made to take it down on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>They never came to pass. As local Facebook groups lit up and a counter-petition gained thousands of signatures of its own, a protest was swiftly organised and more than 100 people showed up on Monday night. A man in a hood climbed a ladder and hung a sign over the head that said \u201cSAVE ME\u201d. A local councillor, Stuart Lees, spoke to outline a plan to protect the head. \u201cSomebody is going to come along and it\u2019ll disappear,\u201d he said. \u201dIf we take it down now as a town, we know where it is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ab4f380fc487b367e5bc5b3e6fe2e2a383d3745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ab4f380fc487b367e5bc5b3e6fe2e2a383d3745/152_897_2475_3092/800.jpg\" alt=\"Duncan Renshaw and \u2018Raffa\u2019 hold up the black head after taking it down from its perch last week.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duncan Renshaw and \u2018Raffa\u2019 hold up the black head after taking it down from its perch last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rod Kirkpatrick/F Stop Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone clapped. Two men, a Polish resident identified only as Raffa and another local, Duncan Renshaw, climbed up and \u2013 after some complications \u2013 brought it down to whoops and applause. \u201cYou\u2019re not hanging him, are you?\u201d one woman asked, to laughter. \u201cWe should have worn white hoods for this,\u201d someone replied. After some celebratory photographs, the object was put in the back of a white van, and driven away.</p> <p>Where did it go? Nobody was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s in a secret location,\u201d said Thomas Donnelly, a Conservative councillor. \u201cIt\u2019s in a prominent Ashburnian person\u2019s garage,\u201d said Renshaw, one of the two men who removed it. The council itself refused all requests for comment, but issued a statement asserting that it would regain possession of the object on Tuesday.</p> <p>There were rumours, though. Most people seemed to think a councillor had it. On Tuesday, Lees answered the phone to the Guardian but declined to comment. Asked if he had the head, he said \u201cHello? Hello?\u201d then made a crackling noise to suggest poor reception, laughed, and hung up.</p> <p>When Moore and her friends \u2013 fellow students Eva Gorman and Lucy Hill \u2013 heard that the head had come down, they first thought it was a victory. They are part of a 30-strong group backing the original petition that has been discussing the issue online. \u201cThen we figured out what was actually happening,\u201d Moore said. </p> <p>The three young women are a little stunned that their call for change has caused such consternation. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a longer way off than I thought it was before this,\u201d said Gorman. The close-knit nature of the town makes the disagreement especially hard, she said, remembering the cold stares she recieved the previous day when walking down the street.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not enjoying being in a confrontational situation with people we\u2019ve known all our lives,\u201d said Hill. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Annie Smail, another student who wants the head removed, says the consequences have been profound. \u201cNeighbours have fallen out, people are having arguments of the kind where you can\u2019t be friends any more,\u201d she said. </p> <p>When Smail and others have tried to defend their position on Facebook, she said, they have been silenced. One resident who objected to the comment that \u201cif the blacks don\u2019t like it they can leave our country\u201d in one popular group was immediately removed by the administrator. Meanwhile, Facebook received multiple complaints about a post saying the bust should be replaced with \u201ca replica of George Floyd\u2019s head\u201d, but concluded it was not in violation of its guidelines.</p> <p>In the 2011 census, 98.5% of Ashbourne\u2019s population of 8,377 was white, and there were only 12 black people. While a trickle of newcomers has since slightly changed the town\u2019s ethnic profile, the few minority residents are conspicuously absent from the discussion.</p> <p>One person from a minority background, who asked not to be named, remembered the liberal use of racial slurs at school, and the daily humiliation when the teacher struggled with their name at registration. \u201cEven now, when they say my name at the GP\u2019s, people look at me,\u201d they said. \u201cI left school a while ago, and it\u2019s still embedded in me. All the white people of Ashbourne telling us this sign isn\u2019t offensive \u2026 it\u2019s just horrific. How can someone who\u2019s never experienced it say what you feel?\u201d</p> <p>To those on the other side of the debate, such sentiments do not detract from the cultural significance of the object itself. Outside his house, 70-year-old Martin Spencer, a town councillor and retired electrical engineer, said he had been told not to make any comment to the press, but added: \u201c45,000 people signing a petition \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere near that many live here. So I think it\u2019s irrelevant. Wouldn\u2019t matter to me if it was 100,000.\u201d</p> <p>Minorities do have a harder time, he conceded, considering the question of privilege. \u201cI worked in Derby for years, there were some foreign guys, and one said they used to share driving licences. They\u2019re giving themselves a bad name, some of them. Foreign people, they do tend to break the law - and I think of Lee Rigby.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9320dcf274fbc6703a8386e9cc745afa71eda974\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9320dcf274fbc6703a8386e9cc745afa71eda974/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Millward, then aged 100, holds the ball aloft during the 2016 Royal Shrovetide football match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Millward, then aged 100, holds the ball aloft during the 2016 Royal Shrovetide football match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew James Harrison/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the bust\u2019s detractors \u201cshould understand the full reasoning behind it. It\u2019s a grade 2 listed item. I know some of the people who took it down, some of them very closely. They care a great deal about the heritage of Ashbourne.\u201d Is one of them Lees, the councillor? \u201cI\u2019m a very good friend of his and he won\u2019t tell you,\u201d Spencer laughed.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon, the council shifted its position from saying that \u201cwe expect to have possession of the head\u201d to \u201cwe are aware of the location of the head\u201d. Requests for additional comment were refused.</p> <p>By Thursday, there had been no update. At Lees\u2019 house at around 4pm, a woman who answered the door said the councillor was out. The head was not visible.</p> <p>Later on, Renshaw - the man who took the head down in the first place - answered the phone and shed more light on the circumstances. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to get ripped down by a bunch of idiots. So, basically, we asked that the council put it in a safe place, and it\u2019s gone in a controlled environment room which has to be signed in or out of.\u201d</p> <p>Lees, it emerged, really had been out \u2013 at a carefully choreographed meeting to arrange the head\u2019s handover. \u201cStuart [Lees] wanted a witness, so we both took it, Stuart\u2019s signed on our behalf, and there are three signatures,\u201d said Renshaw. \u201cIt was locked in a garage. If you\u2019d gone in for hours you wouldn\u2019t have found it.\u201d Lees declined to comment.</p> <p>On Thursday evening, the council said at a meeting that the head had been recovered, and that no decision on its future would be made until a public consultation could take place. It also announced an inquiry.</p> <p>Clare Gamble, a Labour councillor, said the week\u2019s events had \u201cturned the Derbyshire Dales into a national disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>Those who want the head returned continue to view that as absurd, and believe the row is likely to blow over. But their opponents insist that such an outcome will never happen. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop fighting for this small piece of justice,\u201d said Gorman.</p>",
  "<p>Gay rights and homophobia are likely to be major issues in Poland\u2019s delayed presidential election after the frontrunner pledged to \u201cdefend children from LGBT ideology\u201d.</p> <p>Andrzej Duda, the incumbent president, who is allied with the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, made the pledge while launching a so-called \u201cfamily charter\u201d. The move appeared designed to energise the party\u2019s conservative base as polls showed his lead narrowing.</p> <p>After the vote was moved from 10 May to 28 June owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, entered the race, and polls suggest that in a run-off against Duda the vote could be split almost evenly.</p> <p>Trzaskowski, of the centre-right Civic Platform, has been a supporter of LGBT rights as Warsaw mayor. He attended Warsaw\u2019s pride event, the first time a mayor of the capital has done so.</p> <p>PiS has been accused of <a href=\"Incumbent%20president\">democratic backsliding and erosion of the rule of law</a> since winning a parliamentary majority in 2015. It has often hit out at gay rights and what it calls \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d, in rhetoric that is popular with parts of its base and the Catholic church.</p> <p>Among other things, Duda\u2019s new charter pledges no support for gay marriage or adoption by gay couples, with Duda describing the latter as part of \u201ca foreign ideology\u201d. It also seeks to \u201cban the propagation of LGBT ideology\u201d in schools and public institutions \u2013 language reminiscent of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/vladimir-putin-gay-winter-olympics-children\">notorious Russian law</a> targeting so-called \u201cgay propaganda\u201d.</p> <p>There has been a concerted effort to portray the centrist Trzaskowski as an anti-Polish radical. Last week the pro-government weekly Sieci <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notesfrompoland/status/1269633753611149312\">featured Trzaskowski on its cover</a> wearing a rainbow armband and black hoodie, with the caption \u201cthe extremist candidate\u201d.</p> <p>Jacek Karnowski, the editor-in-chief of Sieci, said the magazine had chosen the cover because the politician was presenting himself as moderate when in fact, during his time as mayor of Warsaw, \u201che was trying to introduce LGBT ideology into schools and public life\u201d. Karnowski said PiS was focusing on the LGBT issue because it \u201cresonates on an emotional level\u201d with a large part of the Polish population.</p> <p>Government and church leaders have on various occasions compared \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d to communism, Nazism and the plague. Marek J\u0119draszewski, the archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, used an address to mark the religious holiday of Corpus Christi on Thursday to denounce foreign ideologies that he said \u201cundermine the institution of marriage and the family\u201d.</p> <p>The messaging does have an effect. In a survey last year, when asked to name the biggest threat to Poland, the most popular answer among men under 40 was \u201cthe LGBT movement and gender ideology\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c25d1de1bfec97c17176d11cb4418dcb3eb0c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c25d1de1bfec97c17176d11cb4418dcb3eb0c42/0_127_4045_2429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People with rainbow flags take part in a flashmob in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People with rainbow flags taking part in a flashmob in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Czarek Soko\u0142owski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a statement addressed to Duda this week, Poland\u2019s Campaign Against Homophobia said: \u201cMr President, let us say it out loudly and clearly once again: there is no such thing as \u2018LGBT ideology\u2019, it\u2019s just a homophobic construct. LGBTs are lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender persons who personally experience the consequences of homophobic and transphobic hate which you also fuel.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday evening dozens of LGBT people and supporters gathered outside the presidential palace in Warsaw for a \u201csilent disco\u201d in protest at Duda\u2019s charter. A number of opposition politicians called on people not to attend the protest, saying images of it would be used as propaganda and could help PiS win the election.</p> <p>Those present were angry at Duda\u2019s messaging and also at the lack of support from other candidates. \u201cWe need solidarity, but almost all the candidates in the presidential election are scared to be associated with the LGBT community, and that\u2019s scary,\u201d said Jvlia \u015awi\u0119ch, one of those involved in creating the event.</p> <p>The election was originally scheduled for May as the PiS leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, was keen to take advantage of polling that suggested Duda would win easily in the first round. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/poland-holds-ghost-election-with-0-turnout\">called off with days to go</a> and rescheduled. Poland has since relaxed many lockdown rules, although it is recording more new infections a day than in May.</p> <p>Recent polls suggest the race will be much closer, with Duda projected to win around 40% of the votes in the first round, requiring a second-round run-off that would be held two weeks later.</p>",

As any seasoned writer will tell you, writing a novel is a challenge - but it can be done, with the right blend of stamina, skill and inspiration.</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking to develop your idea for a novel, or you\u2019ve already started writing one, this six-week online programme with award-winning novelist <strong>Ross Raisin</strong> - featuring an innovative mix of live workshops, a supportive discussion forum and one-to-one tuition - will furnish you with the structure, confidence and technique you need to get writing. And be fearless about what you can achieve long after the course ends.</p> <p>Over six consecutive, high-impact weeks, you and other aspiring writers will learn how to craft your story page by page, covering everything from creating vivid characters, and writing sharp dialogue, to drafting and editing.</p> <p>Each Tuesday evening, Ross will explore a key aspect of writing through nuanced analysis and practical activities in live workshops, giving you feedback and advice throughout, as well as an exercise to keep you going through the week. On top of that, the course includes a personalised tuition session with Ross, during which he will discuss up to 3,000 words of your writing on a bespoke, one-to-one basis.</p> <p>Taught sessions are complimented by constructive discussion and peer feedback in a forum of your fellow writers, so that you will not only equip yourself with a deeper understanding of the art of fiction, but also leave the course with a unique and supportive writing community to guide you in your next steps.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve got an idea for a novel, or have already started working on one, this inspiring programme will empower you with a new creative direction, as well as a toolkit of skills to unlock your true potential - and pursue the novel you know you\u2019re capable of writing.</p> <h2><strong>Week 1: Creating characters</strong></h2> <p>Characters are at the heart of all good fiction. Ross has created some memorable and distinctive characters, among them Sam Marsdyke, the solitary young farmer in God\u2019s Own Country (shortlisted for nine literary awards), and Mick Little, the former shipbuilder in Ross\u2019s critically acclaimed second novel, Waterline.</p> <p>This first session is a fantastic chance to learn from Ross\u2019s experience as a writer, and will see you receive expert advice on developing vivid and memorable characters for your own novel. What makes them tick? What are their motivations and fears? How can you ensure they are realistic and relatable in some way?</p> <p>In the second part of the session, you will turn to your synopsis, for the start of a group project that you will continue in the second week.</p> <h2><strong>Week 2: Developing your idea</strong></h2> <p>Developing and managing your plot is the key to establishing the flow of your novel. During this second session, you will learn how to build your idea into something that has narrative momentum.</p> <p>Then, following on from the previous week, you will fine-tune your story outline, and have the opportunity to share your burgeoning idea and receive constructive feedback.</p> <h2><strong>Week 3: The writing process: drafting, re-drafting and editing</strong></h2> <p>Writing is rewriting - and every writer must find their own way to revise their work. Many writers struggle with this stage, but in this third session, you will learn not only how to complete your first draft, but how to re-draft and edit your writing to bring out its strengths. The techniques learned in this session will last you a lifetime, enabling you to become a more confident and skilful writer.</p> <h2><strong>Week 4: The secrets of writing great dialogue</strong></h2> <p>What do we mean by \u2018great dialogue\u2019? The ways in which your characters speak demonstrates how convincing they are, as well as the credibility of your novel; it can be all too easy to write in dialogue that\u2019s wooden, expositive, or excessive.</p> <p>During this session, you will learn a range of techniques that will help you to strike a balance that works for you and your book, while also engaging your readers and advancing your story.</p> <h2><strong>Week 5: Style</strong></h2> <p>Take a look at any handful of novels and you will see that language can be used to create different effects. In this session, you will examine the crucial relationship between style and content, and how to find your own unique style. You will also look at three very different extracts of fiction, in which different styles match perfectly to content.</p> <h2><strong>Week 6: Wrap-up, plus advice on getting published</strong></h2> <p>This final session is an opportunity to look at everything you\u2019ve covered during the six weeks, and refresh your mind about key learnings - as well as to celebrate how far you have come since beginning.</p> <p>You and your peers will receive invaluable advice from Ross about the business of writing, including tips on the publishing process and how to approach literary agents with your novel. You will be encouraged to share your writing with the group through informal readings, and set goals to continue working on after the course.</p> <p>You will complete the programme with the technical abilities and inspiration to write your book chapter by chapter, as well a new support group of other writers in different corners of the world. And then, onwards to publication!</p> <p><em><strong>You will be sent a link to the webinar 1hr before the start time of 7pm (BST).</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Tutor profile</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ross Raisin</strong> was named one of Granta\u2019s best of young British novelists in 2013.

  "<h2><strong>COMING SOON</strong></h2> \n<p>Maybe absence does make the heart grow fonder. But what makes it grow even fonder is an obscene comparison. Naturally, then, after several months of daily news briefings from gaffers who have led a whole nation to relegation and heartbreak, The Fiver is actually looking forward to next week\u2019s resumption of honest-to-goodness post-match press conferences with Premier League managers. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard blaming VAR for a narrow defeat doesn\u2019t seem so objectionable after hearing how that shower in real power have accounted for tens of thousands of losses that matter.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-project-restart-the-key-questions-answered\">Premier League Project Restart: the key questions answered</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, tricky questions remain about the imminent return of the Premier League, such as: with footballers getting back to their day jobs, who will feed the nation\u2019s children? Will Marcus Rashford have to carry on providing assists on that front too? And after Jordan Henderson helped buy essential hospital gear for nurses in recent months, should we expect some shambling suit from the Ministry of Health to send in a few useful corner kicks as Liverpool resume their quest for the title? And does hoping a misgoverned population forget about the pain in their lives because Norwich are fighting for survival amount to a form of sportswashing?</p> \n<p>If you need The Fiver to answer those questions, we\u2019re all jiggered. So let\u2019s just grant ourselves momentary relief and consider this: there\u2019s a decent match on the box on Friday! Juventus host the once-admirable Milan in the second leg of their Italian Cup semi-final. It will presumably be preceded by a Star Wars-style recap: \u201cA long, long time ago in a reality far, far away, Milan and Juve played the first leg and drew 1-1 \u2026\u201d Mind you, not everyone is placated by football\u2019s return. In Bergamo, where thousands of lives were lost to Covid-19, a group of ultras hung a banner outside Atalanta\u2019s stadium reading: \u201cDisgusted by an absurd decision. You chase the millions, not the ball.\u201d</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spent years protesting against the fact that La Liga wants to make us the props for their broadcasts, but with this move they have gone one step further.

I never knew you had it in you. In yesterday\u2019s edition I was pleasantly surprised to find that, after a routine fact-check, Andalucia does indeed spread west as far as the Portuguese border. Huh! In the very same sentence I then learned of the rather splendid word \u2018stramash\u2019. Thinking I should probably quit while I\u2019m ahead, I was invited in the next paragraph to recall the simple potty-mouth pleasure of Rude Kid from Viz only for you to provide a no-less-than-perfect dismount with an on-point Manic Miner reference. You\u2019re targeting a fairly narrow demographic there but hey, for once I\u2019m applauding you. I\u2019m not sure it was worth waiting 10 years but why let that spoil the moment\u201d \u2013 Glenn Leete.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith this Vizrt lot in charge of virtually repopulating stadia across the land, filling them with images of fans in home-team colours (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful for readers of a certain age to see the heaving throng of Sid and Doris Bonkers berating hapless, tight-lipped, ashen-faced Ron Knee, aged 59. Just a thought\u201d \u2013 Jim Hepple.</p> \n<p>\u201cRe: music at football matches (Fiver letters passim). I am not sure how much of a Mahlerphile The Fiver is, but his second symphony is almost 90 minutes long.

  "<p>Amid a continuing pandemic and a painful national introspection on race, a volatile American economy is also forcing Donald Trump and Joe Biden to recalibrate how they campaign in 2020\u2019s presidential election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/us-economy-unemployment-us-states\">Stock markets tumble as another 1.5m Americans file for unemployment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Trump, any positive news about the economy needs to be trumpeted. That\u2019s what the president did when the most recent unemployment figures came in surprisingly lower than expected, at 13.3%.</p> <p>For Biden, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, the approach is to remind voters that the soaring unemployment numbers are unacceptably high. Virtually every time he can, Biden looks to link the virus-cratered economy to Trump.</p> <p>But as with many other things in 2020, there is nothing normal or easy to predict about the US economy as the election unfolds.</p> <p>Unlike normal recessions, the devastation unleashed on the American jobs market has come about because of deliberate shutdown policies aimed at curbing the pandemic\u2019s spread. That makes blaming Trump for the 40 million plus new jobless Americans a little more difficult.</p> <p>By the same token, coaxing the economy back into life is not just a matter of trying to stimulate demand or tinkering with interest rates. It is instead deeply entwined with public health policy, where reopening the artificially shut-down economy could cost tens of thousands of US lives.</p> <p>That situation poses problems for both contenders as they seek to make the economy central to their campaigns.</p> <p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as the 2008 John McCain campaign\u2019s director of domestic and economic policy, said the challenge for Biden and Trump is different as they seek to persuade voters they have the answers to solve the problems posed by an economic freefall driven by a virus.</p> <p>\u201cFor the Biden campaign, the challenge is to ask themselves every day: \u2018OK, what looks presidential in this moment?\u2019\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cBoth have to appear presidential, but Trump in particular has to be a source of trustworthy information.</p> <p>\u201cPeople derive great comfort from someone who can tell them what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>For Trump, he either needs to communicate a convincing argument to be optimistic that he can lead the economic recovery, or show that Biden is a worse alternative.</p> <p>A swath of recent polling has shown Biden beating Trump in a general election matchup. But on the economy, Trump is still competitive. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that a plurality of voters still think Trump is preferable on dealing with the economy and cutting the unemployment rate.</p> <p>Trump has habitually pointed to certain metrics \u2013 such as the stock market \u2013 to argue that he\u2019s the stronger candidate on the economy. He also likes to say Democrats are the party that wants to raise taxes.</p> <p>Holtz-Eakin expects Trump to focus more on bashing Biden as the election nears, regardless of how the economy is doing on any particular day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cf984203adfab9aa199a329835721683c8e1da6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cf984203adfab9aa199a329835721683c8e1da6/12_0_5296_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden at an economic roundtable discussion in.

Philadelphia on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s going to concentrate on the messenger,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.</p> <p>In recent days, Biden has tried to multitask in attacking Trump. He and his campaign, publicly and privately, have put a heavy focus on race relations, and the unrest around the police killing of George Floyd. Talking points sent to some Biden surrogates on Monday and obtained by the Guardian did not mention the economy, and instead focused on Floyd.</p> <p>But Biden\u2019s fundraising schedule this week includes multiple economy-related events, according to invitations obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>One fundraiser on Wednesday was labeled a \u201cVirtual Conversation on Rebuilding a Most Resilient Health Economy after Covid-19\u201d. Another fundraiser featured Peter Orszag, the former director for the Office of Management and Budget during the Obama administration.</p> <p>In public remarks, Biden has also eagerly pivoted to addressing the economy and laying out his policy platform.</p> <p>\u201cTrump&nbsp;has loved to crow about the great&nbsp;economy&nbsp;he built. But when the crisis hit, it became clear who that&nbsp;economy&nbsp;has been built to serve. Not workers. Not the middle class. Not families,\u201d Biden said in recent public remarks.</p> <p>In addressing the economy, Biden often ties it to race relations or the coronavirus. On Thursday, Biden\u2019s campaign released a new factsheet titled \u201cThe Biden Plan for an Effective Re-Opening that Jumpstarts the Economy\u201d. The campaign has also set up a secretive group of advisers who have Biden\u2019s ear on economic policy.</p> <p>The state of the economy isn\u2019t everything in presidential politics ad campaigns. Obama won re-election in the wake of the outbreak of the Great Recession against a candidate with a strong business background.</p> <p>But amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, it casts a long shadow in 2020 and both Democratic and Republican strategists have to deal with it. </p> <p>Scott Kozar, a veteran Democratic strategist, said that the unemployment rate is something that will continue to matter in the coming months, and is likely to be a problem for Trump because of the sheer scale of the collapse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/us-economy-federal-reserve-jobs-coronavirus\">US economy will shrink 6.5% this year, Fed forecasts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really arguing that 16% unemployment\u2019s good? It\u2019s a bit like arguing only 100,000 people died,\u201d Kozar said. \u201cThere is a clear vacuum of leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Other strategists, though, argue that the state of the economy will be too complicated for just one side to take advantage of.</p> <p>\u201cI think the campaign that does a better job spinning the economic data, and the campaign that does a better job convincing people that the economy is either roaring back or is stalling out \u2026 whichever campaign wins that messaging battle is likely to be in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Republican strategist Todd Harris, who served as a top adviser for the Florida senator Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be enough conclusive economic data one way or the other to have it be a slam dunk win for one side or the other.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Democrats are optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to know when the light at the end of the tunnel\u2019s going to come about between now and the election,\u201d the Democratic strategist Aaron Pickrell said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still going to be some ebbs and flows, and potentially a good jobs report and things aren\u2019t as bad as they\u2019re going to be one month. But at the end of the day, I have a hard time imagining that voters think the economy is going great and everything is safe by the time we\u2019re voting in November.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Just as trailers for the BBC\u2019s Windrush drama <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08g29ff/sitting-in-limbo\">Sitting in Limbo</a> were released at the start of this month, Anthony Bryan, who was wrongly imprisoned for five weeks after mistakenly being classified as an illegal immigrant, and whose story is dramatised in the film, received an interim offer of compensation from the Home Office. It was two and a half years after officials first realised they had made an error, and more than two years since the then prime minister, Theresa May first apologised for the Home Office\u2019s mistakes. The compensation letter came exactly a week before the film was due to go out on television, and the timing of its arrival made him very thoughtful.</p> <p>A few days before Sitting in Limbo was broadcast, emails and calls started coming from the private office of the home secretary, Priti Patel, asking if Bryan would join a video call with her just an hour before the film went out. The home secretary is \u201cactively thinking\u201d about \u201cgiving a voice\u201d to the Windrush generation, one email read, \u201cand feels it vitally important to hear directly from affected members of the community, such as Mr Bryan\u201d.</p> <p>Bryan felt sceptical about the timing of this invitation, and declined. Meanwhile Home Office staff were pestering the film\u2019s makers to let them have an early preview \u2013 without success.</p> <p>These are standard Home Office damage-limitation manoeuvres,<strong> </strong>without any effective action to address the underlying problem. (And none of the other 30 Windrush claimants being supported by the North Kensington Law Centre, which has been helping Bryan, received compensation offers this month or had invitations to have phone calls with the home secretary, staff there told me.)</p> <p>Clearly the unfolding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> and the focus on Britain\u2019s own difficulties with racism are making ministers particularly anxious to be seen to be doing the right thing on Windrush. They will be uneasily aware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/18/revealed-depth-of-home-office-failures-on-windrush\">not enough has been done to put things right</a>. This is not a centuries-old problem that can be shrugged off as history, but the direct consequence of hostile environment measures that remain a central part of government policy.</p> <p>Of course, giving people a voice and listening is great, but much careful listening has already been done, and those affected by the scandal have for months been saying that now is the time to move on to action. A forensic 275-page analysis of what went wrong, based on detailed interviews with hundreds of those affected, was <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874022/6.5577_HO_Windrush_Lessons_Learned_Review_WEB_v2.pdf\">submitted to the Home Office in March</a>. One of the key recommendations made by its author, Wendy Williams, was a call for a full review of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d measures.</p> <p>But none of the policies that caused the Windrush scandal have been repealed, and Patel has made no commitment to reverse them. She tweeted new apologies as the programme was broadcast, lamenting the \u201cunimaginable suffering endured by the Windrush generation\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/windrush-lessons-learned-review\">seems to have shown little interest in looking again at the structure of immigration legislation</a>, which continues to cause so much suffering to thousands of people living entirely legally in the UK.<strong> </strong>In this regard, her stance echoes that of Nick Timothy, May\u2019s former special adviser, and one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/theresa-may-was-not-opposed-to-go-home-vans-official-accounts-suggest\">key architects of the hostile environment</a>, who last week breezily asserted that it was a \u201csensible\u201d policy. He added that he was \u201ccertainly never warned\u201d that there was a cohort of people who might get trapped in its embrace because they were unable to prove that they were living in the UK legally.</p> <p>Both of these points are highly questionable. After all the life-shattering problems the policies have caused, \u201csensible\u201d seems a peculiar word to have chosen. They<strong> </strong>deliberately made life impossible for tens of thousands of people without documentation, introducing workplace immigration checks, and eligibility checks for healthcare, bank accounts, pensions, driving licences, rental contracts and benefits. It was the hostile environment that caused Bryan to get the sack from his job as a decorator, and saw him formally categorised as an illegal resident (despite having lived in London since arriving as an eight-year-old in 1965), arrested, detained and booked on a flight back to Jamaica, a country he hadn\u2019t visited in more than 50 years.</p> <p>The hostile environment policies introduced new levels of spite into society; the government set up the National Allegations Database, designed to make it easier for people to make tip-offs about immigration offenders to the Home Office.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not even clear that these \u201csensible\u201d measures have succeeded in their stated goal of addressing illegal immigration, as a handful of reports from the <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/handling-of-the-windrush-situation/\">National Audit Office</a>, the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567652/ICIBI-hostile-environment-driving-licences-and-bank-accounts-January-to-July-2016.pdf\">Borders and Immigration Inspectorate</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">Home Affairs </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">select </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">committee</a> concluded. What is clear is that large numbers of people who came to the UK legally, but who struggle to prove their status, are still being denied healthcare, formal employment and stable housing; the policies institutionalise cruelty and drive people underground.</p> <p>Timothy\u2019s assertion that he was never warned is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation\">contradicted by so much evidence</a> that it feels disingenuous. His own department\u2019s impact assessments warned that these policies could hurt people who had been in the UK for decades, but who had no documentation. Every migration and race organisation<strong> </strong>united to warn that racially discriminatory consequences would follow. A Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants lawyer remembers a junior immigration minister rolling his eyes at her warnings when she gave evidence in parliament. They were warned; they just didn\u2019t want to listen, she says. </p> <p>Timothy\u2019s comments matter because the government continues to cling on to these cruel policies in spite of their damaging impact on so many, including thousands of the key workers who have been supporting Britain throughout the pandemic. The hostile environment also gave us the NHS surcharge in 2015, which, until a sudden U-turn last month, required doctors and care workers to pay for the right to access the care they were providing, and which they were already paying for through taxation. It has also increased visa charges so exponentially that families are pushed into destitution as they try to pay recurring immigration costs. Many are forced into illegality because they cannot afford the exorbitant cost of regularising their status.</p> <p>The Home Office has spent two years in a legal battle over whether the rent to right policy \u2013 which requires landlords to check on tenants\u2019 immigration status \u2013 is racially discriminatory. The high court said it was; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">court of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">appeal agreed it could be,</a> but ruled that the scheme was nevertheless \u201cjustified\u201d; a new appeal is under way. </p> <p>In her review into what caused Windrush, Williams makes it clear that officials should be actively educating themselves. The department\u2019s failings on Windrush demonstrate an \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation\u201d that is \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d, she concluded. The scandal was able to happen, she added \u201cbecause of the public\u2019s and officials\u2019 poor understanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history \u2026 and the history of black Britons\u201d.</p> <p>Two years ago, the then home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/sajid-javid-plans-fairer-more-compassionate-immigration-system\">Sajid Javid, promised to review the immigration system</a> to ensure it was working in a compassionate, fair and humane way; we are still waiting for that review. Only 60 people have received Windrush compensation payments \u2013 which is why last-minute invitations to video chats with the home secretary do not feel welcome.</p> <p>\u2022 Amelia Gentleman is a Guardian reporter.

Further delays of full controls could be put in place if there is a second wave of coronavirus, sources have indicated.</p> <p>The Freight Transport Association, which had lobbied for the delays, said it was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d the government had listened to its concerns. The Road Haulage Association, a vocal critic of the government\u2019s hardline approach to Brexit in the past, also welcomed the announcement.</p> <p>The government plan involves a phased implementation of controls in January, April and July next year.</p> <p>In the first stage, full customs checks and tariffs will be imposed on \u201ccontrolled\u201d goods such as alcohol and tobacco. But importers of \u201cstandard\u201d goods ranging from clothes to electronics will have up to six months to complete customs declarations and to pay tariffs, if any apply.

  "<p>For the past five days, Bijendra Singh has been haunted by the voice of his dead wife, Neelam. \u201cWhy could you not get me the treatment that I needed?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhy could you not save me, save our baby?\u201d</p> <p>It was around 6am on 5 June when Neelam, more than eight months pregnant, began complaining of lower back pain and breathlessness. Presuming it was early contractions, Singh and his wife set off in his brother\u2019s auto-rickshaw to a government hospital in the Uttar Pradesh city of Noida. Before leaving, they kissed their five year-old son goodbye and promised they would be returning with the birthday present he had requested: a baby sister.</p> <p>However, because of her suspected Covid-19 symptoms, they were refused entry at eight hospitals. It was to be a 15-hour ordeal that would expose how the coronavirus pandemic has pushed India\u2019s healthcare system to the brink of collapse, and would result in the needless death of 30-year-old Neelam.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning of this pandemic, the government completely underestimated the virus,\u201d said Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti, who works on the Covid-19 ward of Delhi\u2019s Manipal hospital. \u201cWe had over two months of lockdown, but all that time was wasted. We have not seen any investment in healthcare, which will be the only way to get this under control.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cEvery day I see the number of patients are rising, while hospital admission is becoming impossible and many are dying outside hospitals. Healthcare workers are all getting infected in droves and our healthcare system in Delhi is already exhausted. If strong steps are not taken now, I expect the healthcare system to collapse in a few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, India began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/global-report-india-reports-surge-in-covid-19-cases-as-lockdown-eased\">easing its coronavirus lockdown</a>, one of the largest and strictest in the world, with shopping malls and places of worship opening their doors for the first time in more than two months. It joined countries such as neighbouring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/global-report-who-urges-pakistan-to-return-to-lockdown-as-hospitals-struggle\">Pakistan</a> as well as Mexico, Russia and Iran, who, despite escalating infection rates, have decided to ease restrictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54fbf89dd9567c577a4eedc52a4fee426587524b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54fbf89dd9567c577a4eedc52a4fee426587524b/0_344_6937_4163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cleaning staff throw medical waste into a bin at Guru Nanak Dev hospital, Amritsar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cleaning staff throw medical waste into a bin at Guru Nanak Dev hospital, Amritsar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cases in India, currently at 298,000, are increasing by 10,000 a day and the country has overtaken the UK to become the fourth worst hit in the world. India\u2019s biggest cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are running out of not only beds but also doctors and nurses to treat the unprecedented numbers of patients, and university medical professors have been seconded to work on Covid wards. Private hospitals have been charging upwards of 80,000 rupees (\u00a3840) per night for those who are admitted with Covid symptoms \u2013 unaffordable prices for even middle-class let alone poorer Indians.</p> <p>Singh, a factory worker from Khora Colony in Ghaziabad, took his wife first to a government hospitalin the neighbouring city of Noida. But the doctor insisted they could not admit her. It was to become a familiar refrain. At another hospital nearby, an ambulance driver refused to go near Neelam because he suspected she had Covid-19, and she was refused admission. They then went to the private Shivalik hospital. \u201cBut again the doctor said there, sorry, this looks like a Covid case, we don\u2019t have ventilators or beds,\u201d said Singh.</p> <p>They tried eight hospitals, each time being denied entry because medics suspected from Neelam\u2019s breathing troubles that she had Covid-19, although she was never tested.</p> <p>\u201cAt the fourth hospital, I broke down, pleading with them, telling them I had been going around hospitals all morning. They told me \u2018we cannot treat her, she will die here\u2019,\u201d said Singh. \u201cMy wife was shouting out: \u2018I need oxygen, I need painkillers, please help me,\u2019 but no one listened to her.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the couple reached their next hope, Sharda hospital, they were so desperate that they paid for Neelam to be transferred to an ambulance so she could have access to an oxygen tank.</p> <p>At the seventh hospital, Gims hospital in Noida, when it too refused to admit her, Singh called the police. \u201cI could not bring myself to go back into the ambulance and face her. She kept telling me: \u2018I won\u2019t survive much longer, please get me help, you are not doing anything for me.\u2019 At this point I lost all my strength.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f93f774203d82fdfba3ea0738429e89c067e363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f93f774203d82fdfba3ea0738429e89c067e363/0_0_5544_3326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A colleague helps a nurse put on PPE in Max hospital, New Delhi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A colleague helps a nurse put on PPE in Max hospital, New Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atish Patel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even the two officers could not get her a bed. Singh and Neelam drove 30 miles to the Max hospital in Ghaziabad, where again doctors walked him into the ward to show him it was full, so they drove back to Gims. \u201cBut when we got there, I pulled the oxygen mask off my wife\u2019s face and she was dead,\u201d said Singh.</p> <p>\u201cPlease know I did everything to save her and my baby. It is not my fault, the system is broken.\u201d</p> <p>The consequences of a pandemic in India, a poverty-stricken and densely populated country that spends just 1% of GDP on healthcare, are becoming more apparent by the day.</p> <p>Hospital morgues are overflowing with bodies: Delhi\u2019s LNJP hospital morgue, which has capacity for 45 bodies, last week had 108 piled up. Nigambodh Ghat, New Delhi\u2019s biggest and oldest crematorium, has begun building traditional funeral pyres because their furnaces cannot keep up with the number of bodies, around 30 a day more than usual. They have performed more than 500 coronavirus-related funerals in the past two months.</p> <p>Delhi\u2019s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, has said the capital will have more than 500,000 Covid-19 cases by July and will need to increase the number of beds from 9,000 to 80,000 to meet demand. \u201cFor Delhi, this is a big problem if cases continue to rise,\u201d Sisodia said.</p> <p>Balram Bhargava, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, insisted India was still \u201cdefinitely not\u201d in a community transmission stage of the outbreak, even though officials in Delhi admitted they knew the source of only around 50% of infections. But this was rejected by Bhatti, the Covid-19 doctor. \u201cThe claims of no community transmission is rubbish, it is only to save the government from criticism and so they can avoid spending more money on hospitals and manpower,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Only 5m tests have been done in a country of 1.3 billion people. And while India\u2019s official death toll of 8,102 is comparatively low, some analysts believe this may be due to rampant under-reporting and also the fact that 65% of India\u2019s population is below the age of 35, compared with nations with more vulnerable, ageing populations.</p> <p>Even the home minister, Amit Shah, admitted in a speech on Monday that the government, which last month announced a stimulus package billed as being worth $266bn, \u201cmay have made a mistake, we may have fallen short\u201d in the fight against the virus.</p> <p>The situation has become so bad that not even money and influence can pull the usual strings. Resident associations for affluent neighbourhoods have begun buying their own oxygen supplies. In Delhi\u2019s Greater Kailash I (GK1), an upmarket area in south Delhi, the residents\u2019 association has purchased two oxygen concentrator machines, while in the housing complex of Eldeco Utopia in Noida, residents have bought 20 oximeters and sequestered five rooms, equipping them with oxygen cylinders, a stretcher, a wheelchair and PPE kit.</p> <p>\u201cThe bubble we lived in has burst,\u201d said Rajiv Kakria, an adviser to the GK1 residents\u2019 association. \u201cYou can have money. You can have connections and know influential people, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. You can still die waiting for a bed or oxygen.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The callous killing of George Floyd resonated powerfully across all of Britain\u2019s black communities, given our long-running issues with the police. But his death at the hands of four Minnesota police officers probably had more meaning in one part of the country than any other.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham, north London, five black people have died at the hands of the police. There is my friend\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985\">Cynthia Jarrett</a>, who died of a heart attack during a police raid on her home in 1985. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/celldeaths/article/0,2763,195387,00.html\">Joy Gardner&nbsp;</a>(1993) died after the police gagged her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (1999) died after being restrained.

It is ironic, then, that chief constables from across the country should have chosen to publish a <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death-403767\">statement of support</a> for last week\u2019s Black Lives Matter demonstrations:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life.

But in truth this crass PR statement, published on the Metropolitan Police\u2019s website, is an insult to all the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of British police, whether they be black or white.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community. In fact, in every instance, we had the exact opposite response. The Met appeared to follow the same line of using the media to tarnish the characters of the victims, sometimes before relatives had even been informed of their deaths. It was this callous treatment of Duggan\u2019s family that led to the demonstration at Tottenham police station two days after his killing, which in turn sparked the riots.</p> <p>However, this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Guardian report</a> into his death \u2013 using a groundbreaking 3D reconstruction from a human-rights research agency, Forensic Architecture \u2013 is a sign of how things might change. Finally, families can have hope that loved ones killed by the police may receive justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initial media reports on Duggan\u2019s death claimed there had been a shootout after he had fired at the police. It later transpired that they had been given this <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25776826\">misinformation</a> in a briefing from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). But the most contentious issue surrounding the case has always been that the gun \u2013 which Duggan had been seen to collect in a shoebox earlier that day \u2013 was eventually \u201cdiscovered\u201d almost eight minutes after he was shot, some seven metres away from where he had been shot.</p> <p>Somehow the inquest jury was able to return a verdict of \u201clawful killing\u201d even though not one witness, including the 11 police officers who took part in the stop, testified during the entire three-month hearing that they had seen Duggan throw a gun. The IPCC eventually published its report claiming that the \u201cmost plausible explanation\u201d was that Duggan had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32041119\">thrown the weapon</a> after he had received the first shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Describing the verdict as \u201cperverse\u201d \u2013 on the basis that there was no witness who saw a gun thrown, and that the shooting of an unarmed person by agents of the state should never be deemed to be \u201clawful\u201d \u2013 the family began legal proceedings. Although the Met had previously stated its intention to fight the civil action, they ultimately agreed last year to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/10/mark-duggan-shooting-family-settle-high-court-claim-against-met\">out-of-court settlement</a> with Duggan\u2019s family. The Met has made no admission of liability for the death.</p> <p>Many believe the settlement came because Duggan\u2019s legal team commissioned Forensic Architecture to examine the killing. The research group used the testimony provided by police officers during the inquest, along with Home Office pathologist reports, to create an interactive 3D digital model. This, for the first time, provided an independent visual reconstruction of the last moments of Duggan\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Mark Duggan shooting: can forensic tech cast doubt on official report?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forensic Architecture\u2019s model challenges the version of events given by the police at the inquest, and brings into question the IPCC\u2019s findings. It comes to the conclusion that the IPCC was incorrect to conclude that the gun could not have been planted in its position. The family is now calling for the IPCC\u2019s successor body, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), to reopen its investigations. The IOPC has said it is reviewing Forensic Architecture\u2019s report and will reopen the investigation \u201cif there are compelling reasons to do so\u201d.</p> <p>The sophisticated reconstruction is a striking challenge to the state\u2019s monopoly over the investigations of deaths at the hands of the police. Duggan\u2019s family now has some measure of&nbsp;justice; but in future it might also help to make not only the police but also the bodies that are meant to scrutinise their work, far more accountable for their actions.</p> <p>The police may object to this new level of scrutiny, but ultimately, for all of us, surely we\u2019d far rather have justice than unrest on our streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement.

  "<p>Why on Earth would you want cider to be like wine? That was my immediate reaction to a new campaign called <a href=\"https://www.cideriswine.co.uk/\">Cider is Wine</a>. OK, maybe that\u2019s a touch disingenuous. For years we\u2019ve not taken cider seriously. We\u2019ve got smashed on it as students, and downed it on sunny afternoons in the park, but we\u2019ve never been willing to pay more than a bare minimum for it.&nbsp;Mind you, we also haven\u2019t minded that cider is often a chemical soup made from fruit concentrate that often doesn\u2019t even come from this country, or that it\u2019s sweetened and artificially flavoured, too.</p> <p>What the new campaign is saying is that we should respect cider producers who use 100% of their own freshly pressed fruit just as we respect wine producers for using their own grapes. In other words, it deserves a decent bottle and a place at the table.&nbsp;</p> <p>And, in some cases, cider <em>is</em> like wine; well, natural wine at least, which has become the darling of fashionable wine bars and is ironically often accused of tasting like cider.&nbsp;Some cider producers, such as Find &amp; Foster and Little Pomona (see panel below), have taken this to the next stage and are now describing their ciders as \u201cpet nats\u201d, the term for a wine that is bottled while it is still fermenting, leaving it with a touch of sweetness and a gentle fizz. Find &amp; Foster\u2019s delightfully hazy, unfiltered <strong>Snicket Petillant Naturel 2019</strong> (\u00a315 a bottle for a case of three <a href=\"https://thefinecider.company/products/snicket-2019\">Fine Cider Company</a>, 6%), for example, could easily be a natural wine and would probably cost at least a fiver more if it was.</p> <p>That said, it seems a shame that artisan producers feel the need to invoke wine as a reference point to be taken seriously. Cider \u2013 and perry \u2013 should be celebrated in its own right as a fine British drink that was enjoyed long before English wine was ever A Thing. Calling the campaign Cider is Wine, and referencing \u201cfine cider\u201d&nbsp;(whatever next? \u201cFine ale\u201d?)&nbsp;seems to me a case of protesting too much, though if it makes it possible for an exciting and innovative new generation of cider makers to thrive, then it\u2019s all to the good.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the other end of the price spectrum, cider producers are taking a leaf out of the craft brewers\u2019 book and packaging their cider in cans \u2013 a welcome development, particularly when it showcases new styles such as <strong>Adnams Wild Wave English cider</strong> (see panel) and Thatchers refreshing new <strong>Cloudy Lemon Cider</strong> (\u00a35.50 for four 440ml cans, widely available, 4%).</p> <p>Who knows, in years to come, we might even be telling friends about a great new cider we\u2019ve discovered, rather than boasting how little we\u2019ve paid for it.</p> <h2>Four ciders worth taking seriously</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"fifhaeiof\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b8d38e9645a9ccf2abc62cec6cae65df2ca28958\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8d38e9645a9ccf2abc62cec6cae65df2ca28958/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Little Pomona Hard Rain Quince\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.littlepomona.com/\">Little Pomona Hard Rain Quince</a></strong></p> <p>\u00a37&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thefinecider.company/\">Fine Cider Company</a>, 3.8%.</p> <p>A low-alcohol cider, or \u201cciderkin\u201d, co-fermented with quince pomace, which weirdly gives it a delicious taste of white nectarine and mango without being remotely sickly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"gdb\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f99aab8eab50911456fae27b6561397add3dd9e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f99aab8eab50911456fae27b6561397add3dd9e5/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Once Upon a Tree Rose\u0301 cider Dabinett and Pinot Noir co-ferment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Once Upon a Tree ros\u00e9 cider</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://shop.haygrove-evolution.com/collections/once-upon-a-tree-cider\">\u00a312.50 Once Upon A Tree</a>, 8.5%.</p> <p>I <em>know</em> it\u2019s pink and I <em>know</em> it\u2019s not \u201cproper\u201d cider, but it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;absolutely delicious, with a lovely, natural, raspberry flavour.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"shfjd\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4e06c5a3dbfc2974d2478ac2d8d7a16486d3ec5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e06c5a3dbfc2974d2478ac2d8d7a16486d3ec5f/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cidentro still cider\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.cidentro.co.uk/product/still-cider/#\">Cidentro</a> still cider</strong></p> <p>\u00a345 a case of six full-sized bottles (ie, \u00a37.50 a bottle) <a href=\"https://www.cidentro.co.uk/product/still-cider/#\">cidentro.co.uk</a>, 7%.</p> <p>Mild, mellow and sweetly appley, this is more recognisably cider (in a medium-dry style), but with a rather cool label and Spanish-sounding name.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"djglk\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"979ee723db6d9bcec39077b199ae9bbdea97df9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979ee723db6d9bcec39077b199ae9bbdea97df9d/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adnams Wild Wave English Cider\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.adnams.co.uk/beer/shop-by-taste_1/sparkling-cider/adnams-wild-wave-english-cider-cans.htm#\">Adnams Wild Wave English Cider</a></strong></p> <p>\u00a318.99 for 12 x 330ml cans, 5%.</p> <p>Dry, appley, almost salty, seaside cider for drinking with fish and chips.

Or was it ever broken to begin with? After last night\u2019s low scoring error strewn affair it was an end-to-end goalfest at Kardinia Park. </p> <p>At half-time the game was in the balance with Hawthorn probably heading to the sheds in the ascendancy, but whatever Chris Scott said at the main break worked with the Cats flying out of the blocks in the third quarter and putting the Hawks to the sword in the fourth. It was a sweet night for Patrick Dangerfield in his 250th appearance but he was overshadowed by fellow superstar Joel Selwood, who dominated when it mattered most. Brandon Parfitt, Rhys Stanley, Gary Ablett, and plenty other in hoops also caught the eye.</p> <p>Hawthorn will hope it was just a bit of ring rust for those last couple of quarters but their drop-off in intensity, particularly around stoppages, was alarming. They will welcome the return of Jaeger O\u2019Meara to the engine room as soon as possible.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for your company.

Both clubs have descended somewhat from those lofty heights, but neither have plummeted far, and Chris Scott and Alastair Clarkson will consider their premiership windows open in this most unpredictable of seasons.</p> <p>This is ordinarily a rivalry that draws a bumper crowd to the MCG, but with fans still locked out Geelong have lobbied successfully for the Hawks to make the journey to GHMBA Stadium for the first time since 2006. Not only that, but there is an expectation that other heavyweights will make rare visits to Victoria\u2019s Surf Coast later in the season, in a major boost to the Cats\u2019 flag hopes. Few teams in history have enjoyed home ground advantage like Geelong in the past decade or so (42-8 win-loss record in previous 50 matches), and their familiarity with the dimensions (the Kardinia Park oval is the third-longest but also the narrowest in the league) should give them a notable advantage.</p> <p>Let me know what you think of that, as well as some other tasty morsels, like Patrick Dangerfield\u2019s place in the game on the night of his 250th appearance, Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett pandering to #SokkahTwitter by advocating for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/superfooty/status/1271354892532121600\">relegation</a> from the AFL, or how tonight could be the last time modern greats Shaun Burgoyne (37), Gary Ablett (36) and Harry Taylor (34 today!) all compete for the same Sherrin.</p> <p>Get in touch by Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jphowcroft?lang=en\">@JPHowcroft</a> or send emails to <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. </a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeelongCats/status/1271343909210226688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wish you were here. \ud83d\ude22<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Danger250?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Danger250</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLCatsHawks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLCatsHawks</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ww95pTiKTp\">pic.twitter.com/Ww95pTiKTp</a></p>&mdash; Geelong Cats (@GeelongCats) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeelongCats/status/1271343909210226688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T08:59:56.810Z\">at 9.59am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p><br>An invisible killer that is passed through touch, homes and businesses in lockdown, desperate efforts to test, track and trace, community resilience in the face of tragedy.</p> <p>It sounds very much like life in the time of Covid-19, but this is also the world depicted in a high-profile BBC One drama focusing on the aftermath of the nerve agent attack on the former Russian spy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/sergei-skripal\">Sergei Skripal</a> in Wiltshire.</p> <p>Filming for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08dqns1\">The Salisbury Poisonings</a> ended just days before the Covid-19 lockdown began in the UK and, as coronavirus swept the world, there were concerns among its makers that there would be no appetite for the show for months or years.</p> <p>But, speaking to the Guardian, the series director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/saul-dibb\">Saul Dibb</a>, and the producer, Karen Lewis, said they believed the Covid-19 crisis had made the drama, which will be broadcast over three nights from Sunday, all the more relevant.</p> <p>Dibb said the parallels between novichok, the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack, and Covid-19 were unavoidable. \u201cIt\u2019s deadly and passed through touch \u2013 an invisible threat. You don\u2019t know if you are passing it on,\u201d said Dibb.</p> <p>The drama examines how \u201ceveryday\u201d people were affected, at times in the most horrific of ways, and how local police and officials were caught in the eye of a storm. \u201cIt\u2019s not a story about central government, it\u2019s a story about people working it out at a local level,\u201d said Dibb. \u201cAll that has so much to say to us now.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis said: \u201cThe stuff that is being done now on a much bigger scale was done there. It resonates with what is happening now in many ways \u2013 it\u2019s about community coming together and economic impact, the closing down of shops and restaurants, no footfall, no tourists.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of the drama was never to tell the spy story and the global politics. Dibb said that rather than point the camera at the bench where the Skripals collapsed in March 2018, they turned it in the other direction. \u201cIt was about the collateral damage, how people were impacted,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, barely feature.

Sturgess, 44, died.</p> <p>Dibb said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a Spielberg story of these extraordinary things happening in a small town \u2013 the hazmat suits, the army, the tanks, a spy and Russia and poison.</p> <p>\u201cI felt it was a weird Jaws story.

I think they knew if they talked to us and opened up with us and told us what it was really like, we would be able to tell the story more fully, more respectfully, more honestly.\u201d</p> <p>On the Sturgesses, Lewis said: \u201cIt was amazing how open they were. It was barely a year since Dawn had died. They were still grieving and still are. They are a very dignified family.\u201d</p> <p>Dibb added: \u201cThere\u2019s a bit I like in the film. Stan opens the door and Dawn\u2019s sons come in and her sisters and their families. Suddenly you see there\u2019s this big family of people who all love her. That brought it home to me shooting that scene how big the repercussions are.</p> <p>\u201cWith Covid there are thousands and thousands of deaths. We\u2019re talking here about one death. I think it shows through looking at one individual\u2019s death how significant all of those individual stories are. They often get glossed over. For us it\u2019s the chance to say this is one person, this is what all of those 40,000 people have experienced now.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis said Bailey felt guilty that he may have poisoned his family, having unknowingly carried novichok into his home: \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that none of his family were poisoned.\u201d</p> <p>Dibb said: \u201cWhen he comes home once he\u2019s been at the crime scene, he makes a cup of tea, makes breakfast, brings it up to his wife, kisses his wife, hugs his kids. All the while contaminating his house and passing this thing on in a way that could have been fatal for all of them. Those things have a greater resonance now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce2b77ae51467ecaa3cafb3a4b26db433849afb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce2b77ae51467ecaa3cafb3a4b26db433849afb0/0_141_4241_2546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafe Spall as Nick Bailey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafe Spall as Nick Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Pardon/BBC/Dancing Ledge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The drama may able to highlight some elements of the story that news stories could not \u2013 for example, what it felt like being poisoned.

  "<p>It\u2019s actually an ancient Chinese curse: \u201cMay you live in times when you have to look up what a statutory instrument is, and how it relates to law passed in parliament.\u201d If you don\u2019t want to listen to my botched synopsis of Priti Patel\u2019s new quarantine rules, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na9QfL9JTys&amp;feature=youtu.be\">there are online video explainers</a>. Obviously you do, though, so here it is: English people, you may go on holiday (it is droll how fast the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish quietly stepped away from English rule, when its full rubbishness unfurled. After all these centuries \u2026). But when you come back, you have to self-isolate in the fullest possible sense, which is to say, no going out at all, not for supplies, not for exercise, except in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>Yawn, I thought, when I read this. Nobody will do that. They will think of Dominic Cummings and Barnard Castle. Or the Isle of Wight MP, Bob Seely, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/tory-mp-bob-seely-attended-lockdown-barbecue-with-journalists\">his barbecue attendance</a>. They will remember the lame excuses, in which the eye-test was actually surpassed, for absurdity and unrelatability, by Seely\u2019s claim that he only had half a sausage. Seriously, who does that? Who do they think is going to eat the other half?</p> <p>I can make up a lame excuse as well as the next man, so no biggie. Except it is quite a biggie, because if you get this wrong, you will end up with a criminal record. The forces of law now have a huge amount of discretion, in so far as they can basically adjudicate between one lame excuse and another. I personally would take a punt on the government\u2019s competence, that it will outsource quarantine enforcement to Serco, hopefully even put electronic tags on us, and after that nobody will ever be able to say for certain where we are again.</p> <p>And anyway, it is actually my civic duty to defy this stuff, I decided, as I was scrolling through the weather forecasts for everywhere I have ever been, thinking: \u201cWow, who knew Amsterdam was so hot?\u201d Perhaps quarantining returning travellers from specific countries would have made sense in January and February. What could its rationale possibly be now, except: \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get a disease from another country than you are in England\u201d? And since, demonstrably, the opposite is true, what could the foundational logic be, besides \u201cforeigners are mucky\u201d? When I am browsing Eurostar timetables, I am not looking for a holiday; I am resisting xenophobia. With browsing. Call it online activism, if you will.</p> <p>There is a kind of lockdown-signalling, where you demonstrate your commitment to the nation\u2019s wellbeing by constantly voicing your desire never to go anywhere, ever again. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will go back to the office.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not getting on a tube until 2025, soonest.\u201d \u201cWho needs to go abroad?\u201d \u201cWhy should we impose our filthy urban germs on those rural folk who, by dint of living further apart from one another, are relatively less infected and, apparently, morally better?\u201d \u201cYea, gladly will I eschew the call of the wild, in favour of the HBO theme music.\u201d Sometimes it has a top note of schmaltz, and you have to pretend that you love your family so much that you don\u2019t care where you are, so long as you are together.</p> <p>This is what passes for solidarity at the moment: because some people cannot go on holiday, being especially vulnerable, or totally skint, everyone pretends holidays are so last century and right-thinking people never needed them. I do not think it helps. It\u2019s a Facebook version of solidarity, where you take an image that was two-dimensional in the first place and crop everything unsightly from it. All self-indulgence, all hedonism, anything needless, anything self-interested, it all has to be scrubbed off your character.</p> <p>To channel Phoebe from Friends, I need to live in a world where people can spill. I need to at least be able to fantasise about going somewhere different, and not having to work at a nuclear plant, or a space agency, in order to be allowed to come home. (These are two of the exceptions to the quarantine rule, along with post office workers, and people who commute between countries for their job, and anyone involved in a clinical trial. The list would be quite amusing, but for the terrible klaxon it sets off: \u201cChrist, there are children in charge, and they\u2019re writing actual law!\u201d To which you can self-soothe with: \u201cIt\u2019s not a law, it\u2019s a statutory instrument.\u201d)</p> <p>Mr Z has chronic cabin fever and wakes up every morning with a different, urgent yen. He needs to smell heather. He wants to hike in the Caucasian mountains. He has to visit a distillery. He must drive to New Zealand. He wants to hear a cicada, outside of a zoo. Or any other insect, or animal: he wants to hear anything that isn\u2019t our own dog, or a fox having sex. I want completely different things. I want a drink with an umbrella in it, not ironically. I want to hear a really loud, preferably five-way conversation in a language I don\u2019t understand. I want to be far, far too hot, and then sunburnt. I want to watch a couple I don\u2019t know having an argument. I would kill to see a buffet. I will not go softly into perpetual lockdown.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist<br></p>",

We had figured out the practicalities: the \u2018bubbles\u2019 the children would go in, the teachers who would work in each classroom and the outdoor space we would spread out in, to keep to social distancing rules. We even bought a marquee where staff could eat at lunchtime.</p> <p>But then I got the information from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/28/reopening-english-schools-on-monday-could-lead-to-new-surge\">independent Sage group</a>, which said waiting until 15 June would halve the risk to children. I had sleepless nights that weekend. I didn\u2019t feel I could ignore that advice. I became really uneasy \u2013 I didn\u2019t feel convinced or sufficiently well-informed to make that huge decision \u2013 and I asked for a governing body meeting to discuss it. My governors were very supportive of a delayed wider reopening so I contacted parents again and explained that I had changed my mind. Now we are keeping the decision under review.</p> <p>Other primary schools in my area reopened more widely to pupils on 1 June and I totally respect the decisions those heads made. But the idea didn\u2019t sit well with me. I\u2019m concerned not just about staff passing the virus on to children and vice versa, but it leaking out into the wider community and affecting vulnerable adults and grandparents.</p> <p>I\u2019m anxious to get the children back into school. I\u2019m concerned about their education but I\u2019m actually more concerned about their mental health and wellbeing \u2013 I feel they do need to come back. But the health of the whole community weighed more heavily. I thought: if a delay of two weeks halves the risk, then that is worth doing.</p> <p>Since I made that decision, parents have been extremely supportive. They\u2019re pleased. They know that we just want to keep their children safe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aaf512eeeed497034f7be72f753b14ca73b30353\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaf512eeeed497034f7be72f753b14ca73b30353/486_881_1440_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Howell, head of the biggest pupil referral unit in Birmingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018We need PPE\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Steve Howell, headteacher, </strong><strong>City of Birmingham </strong><strong>schoo</strong><strong>l, a pupil referral unit</strong></p> <p>\u201cMy governors and I found the advice from the independent Sage group really worrying and also the concerns being raised by the teaching unions.</p> <p>I have a massive feeling of responsibility for all my staff and I wanted to do this right, not fast. The worst-case scenario for me would be if someone gets ill, or worse, because I didn\u2019t take the right precautions. I feel confident I\u2019ve got the back-up of my local authority, Birmingham city council, which has <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birmingham-city-council-issues-statement-18276430\">publicly supported</a> school leaders making their own decisions about when it is safe to reopen.</p> <p>So I have spent the past couple of weeks risk-assessing all of my staff. Out of 145 staff members, 23 are shielding and another 25 are clinically vulnerable, for example they have asthma, diabetes or are from a BAME background. I\u2019m also concerned about our pupils \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of children who live in three-generation households. I wanted to have time to find out from parents what their risk level is, individually.</p> <p>But the biggest obstacle is that I need to make sure that my staff have enough PPE. We work with some of the most vulnerable and challenging young people in Birmingham, who have been excluded from mainstream schools. We\u2019ve got some very difficult primary school-aged children who might regularly need holding, either to comfort them or keep them safe. Sometimes these children do very risky things like climbing or trying to hurt other people, and a small number are known spitters.</p> <p>That\u2019s the reality of the situation, it\u2019s a reaction you sometimes see from very young children when they get upset. When you\u2019re going to be in very close physical contact with a child like that, you\u2019re going to need PPE: apron, gloves, a mask and goggles or a visor.</p> <p>We know our kids are better off in school. But I have to ensure we have a consistent supply of PPE before I can decide when we will reopen \u2013 and it has been a real challenge to source. I\u2019m still working on it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We don\u2019t have staffing or space\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Anonymous headteacher, primary school in the Midlands</strong></p> <p>\u201cOther schools in my local area did reopen more widely on 1 June, but those schools have more staff and space. It\u2019s more complicated for smaller schools like ours because you don\u2019t have the staff or the space to spread out.</p> <p>Our parents have really understood that, as a school, we want to do what\u2019s right by their children and make decisions based on our own circumstances, not on what other schools are doing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/16/england-plans-to-send-the-wrong-children-back-to-school-at-the-wrong-time\">England plans to send the wrong children back to school at the wrong time  | Laura McInerney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I wanted to make sure we were following all the safety guidance from the trade unions. That way, when we do reopen there is no question that we are doing it in the safest way possible.</p> <p>I decided to speak to all the stakeholders over seven days and fully involve our staff, who have been brilliant, in the planning. We are currently in talks with the teaching unions, who have been great. The unions have asked me to carry out our staff meetings remotely, which I think is fair.</p> <p>We are also going to make sure that there is PPE for staff if they need to do anything like first aid. That\u2019s not been cheap to source, but it was the right thing to do. We are making sure that we have the right cleaning materials in school and can maintain a 2-metre distance where possible.</p> <p>Discussions are ongoing between the unions and the local authority, which is one reason why I didn\u2019t feel it would be fair to identify my school: I don\u2019t want to put those discussions in jeopardy.

Lots of people have keys so we can\u2019t confirm it would be kept sterile. We do not have the toilet facilities you might need to keep groups of children separate, there\u2019s only one male and one female toilet.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have a cleaning service. Cleaning is normally done by an elderly caretaker, and we can\u2019t ask him to deep clean in the way we would need. We would need to find a company to do that for us daily, and it would be difficult, as a charity, to cover that cost.</p> <p>We considered whether the children would be better off at home with their parents and their own stuff around them, or at a setting where there\u2019s nervousness around infection control and hand sanitising. Our staff felt it wasn\u2019t in the best interests of our children to reopen. The preschool would be so weird and unlike anything that the children had encountered previously, that we felt it would be more likely to make them anxious or upset than if they stayed at home.</p> <p>We couldn\u2019t allow parents to come in and settle them, because we have only one entrance. We wouldn\u2019t be able to allow the children to play with all the toys. Normally, we do lots of singing - but we would feel nervous about that, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/did-singing-together-spread-coronavirus-to-four-choirs\">singing may be an activity with a very high risk transmission</a>.</p> <p>We also looked at the overall infection and transmission rates. We did not feel confident that the contact tracing and the testing was up and running properly. It felt very rushed.</p> <p>There are only a few weeks until the end of term. I think the government should have just said: everybody go back in September. That would have given people plenty of time to plan.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating a birthday with friends in a London park the night they were stabbed to death. The sisters had stayed behind after everyone else had left just after midnight. Now, five days after their bodies were found, detectives have said they believe they were murdered by a stranger. </p> <p>As the hunt for the killer intensified, the Metropolitan police said whoever murdered Smallman, 27, and Henry, 46, may have been injured during the attack, which may have caused significant bleeding.</p> <p>An extensive search is ongoing at the crime scene in Fryent Country Park in north-west London, and officers are trawling through hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish from a local refuse depot in search of items they believe were mistakenly cleared from the scene.</p> <p>A 36-year-old man arrested in south London on suspicion of murder this week was subsequently released with no further action in connection with the killings.</p> <p>The bodies of the sisters were discovered on Sunday in the park, a well-known spot for looking out over the capital, where two days earlier they had met friends and family to celebrate Henry\u2019s birthday.</p> <p>People gradually left throughout the evening and by about 12.30am on Saturday only Smallman and Henry remained. Officers believe they were murdered within the next couple of hours. Both women were reported as missing to police late on Saturday when they had not returned home.</p> <p>DCI Simon Harding said: \u201cThis is an unthinkably harrowing and tragic incident and my first thoughts remain with Nicole and Bibaa\u2019s close family and friends who are going through the most unimaginable pain and suffering.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been a number of factors involved in both the incident and the aftermath which have required extra time and care in enabling us to create a clear picture of what has taken place. But what we can now say with some certainty is that Nicole and Bibaa were murdered by someone who was unknown to them.\u201d</p> <p>Killing by a stranger is rare. The most recent figures on homicide from the Office for National Statistics showed that six out of 208 adult women killed in the year to March 2019 were killed by a stranger \u2013 less than 3%.</p> <p>The two women were the daughters of the Church of England\u2019s first female archdeacon from a black or minority ethnic background, Wilhelmina Smallman, known as Mina. She was the archdeacon of Southend in the diocese of Chelmsford until her retirement in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39a3ecc516fe0af7399d69256e1a3bc53d5821ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39a3ecc516fe0af7399d69256e1a3bc53d5821ec/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police cordon at an entrance to Fryent Country Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police cordon at an entrance to Fryent Country Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Henry, who lived in Brent, was a senior social worker at Buckinghamshire council and a mother of one.

We ask that their privacy is respected and for everyone\u2019s prayers at this most difficult of times.\u201d</p> <p>Smallman had recently started working for a marketing firm called BALL Events and Promotion based in Watford. A statement from the company said: \u201cIn the short time that Nicole worked with us she made a massive impact on everyone that was lucky enough to be around her. She quickly became a major part of our team \u2026 and had become a real friend to those who worked closely with her.</p> <p>\u201cNicole was \u2026 a genuinely kind and caring person with always ready to help anyone. We are all in complete shock over what happened. Nicole will be truly missed by us all.\u201d</p> <p>The community near Fryent Country Park have been left shocked by the disturbing events. Shama Tatler, a councillor for Fryent ward, said: \u201cEverywhere has its issues but the park has always been a place for families. It\u2019s unusual it happened in the area, it\u2019s recognised as a family area and we\u2019re just shocked that anything would happen let alone something like this.\u201d</p> <p>Harding appealed for members of the public to come forward if they know someone who had been wounded in the last week and had not been able to account for their injuries. He said officers believed the suspect left the park via the Valley Drive entrance</p> <p>\u201cAt this stage we don\u2019t know why this awful attack took place and any information we can gather will help us further put the pieces of the jigsaw together,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Back when feminism was mainstreaming, and it seemed like the conversation was finally going to turn toward \u201chow do we start to think about women as human beings, rather than as mothers/sexual objects/children/domesticity machines?\u201d, women drew up a lot of lists. <em>Please read these books of feminist theory. Please watch these women-directed movies. Please follow these women on Twitter. </em>We thought we could educate people \u2013 of any of the genders \u2013 out of their misogyny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/corona-rage-covid-19-masks-jessa-crispin\">Corona rage is boiling over.

Suddenly Instagram, typically the most unabashedly shallow social media platform, has converted overnight into the world\u2019s largest anti-racism bookstore. I\u2019m impressed with the good faith of the people sharing these lists or asking others for recommendations, and for the presence of these books on bestseller lists.</p> <p>But I\u2019m also skeptical. Because feminism tried this, and it mostly failed to connect the <em>intellectual</em> understanding of misogyny with the way the world functions for women. We taught it. We talked about it. We wrote about it, we marched about it, we podcasted about it, we yelled about it, we made YouTube videos about it, we wore T-shirts about it, we went to court about it.</p> <p>And over and over again, we said, <em>Please, read our books</em>. Because <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/\">reading builds empathy</a>. Because <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/why-reading-books-makes-you-a-better-person-according-to-science.html\">reading makes you a better person</a>. (Stalin was a big reader, but sure.) We demanded and got women superheroes. We got more of our stories and experiences told in film and television. We got documentaries made about our deaths, our history and our struggles to live in a world hostile to us. And part of it was our fault, for mostly elevating white voices, voices with minor requests, voices pitched to avoid making men too uncomfortable. But as soon as a stressor hit \u2013 a small thing like a combination pandemic-uprising-global lockdown \u2013 domestic violence rates rose, women lost their jobs at a disproportionate rate, and the difficulty in raising equal attention for black women killed by police, like Breonna Taylor and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/transgender-woman-police-killing-stlouis_n_599df3f7e4b05710aa599d34\">Kiwi Herring</a>, became obvious.</p> <p>Education has so often been used as a method of indoctrination and control \u2013 typically the first step of any colonial project is to take over the schools.

Intellectual curiosity should always be encouraged, and diversity of thought and perspective is important for a multitude of reasons. But often we leave an issue with \u201ceducate yourself\u201d and figure that person will \u201cdo the work\u201d and either find enlightenment or remain an irredeemable misogynist or racist troll forever.</p> <p>Part of it is our naive and longstanding belief that we can <em>buy</em> our way to liberation. Maybe if we all just consume the right products, the world will become a better place. But buying grass-fed beef didn\u2019t slow global warming, it just made a couple of very rich men much richer. Buying a couple of books from the Women\u2019s History Month display table at Barnes &amp; Noble didn\u2019t solve misogyny.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to recognize that paying attention is not the same as understanding, and in an age of information overload, more information \u2013 the <em>right</em> information this time, of course \u2013 isn\u2019t the full solution. We perceive each other through intermediaries, and this seems to be what we prefer. For that which is foreign to us, we prefer a theory or an explanation. We watch a documentary about beekeepers in Macedonia and think we now understand beekeepers in Macedonia. But all we are doing is interpreting reality through someone else\u2019s interpretation of reality.</p> <p>How do we make a bad person less of a bad person? Trying to answer this question has led us to all sorts of timewasters and ethical dead ends. We tried through yelling, we tried through medical experimentation, we tried through re-education, we tried through philosophy. But as anyone who has been raped by a philosopher knows \u2026</p> <p>When we are dealing with someone who is indoctrinated or besotted with bad or regressive thinking, the intuitive approach is to educate or instruct. But there truly is no replacement for actual, physical, social encounter between humans to create a shared perspective. And right now, in this uprising, that is where the counterintuitive, but constructive, answer is forming. We are encountering each other in our shared (and forced) encounters with the police. The building can start from there. There is no shortcut. We must find one another on the streets.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is a Guardian US columnist.

It was a very orderly, socially distanced affair \u2013 so much so that standing near the back I couldn\u2019t hear any of the speeches as there was no PA system. All I could do was take my lead from what others were doing. So I clapped when other people clapped and got down on one knee when everyone else did. This was something of a problem as I have a metal knee and I was in a lot of discomfort throughout \u2013 kneeling down is still painful even years after the operation \u2013 and my wife had to help me to get upright again.

The statement on the protests in the Commons was a classic piece of parliamentary hypocrisy. Because while MPs on all sides were keen to condemn the civil disorder, everyone seemed secretly relieved that the statue had been removed. Certainly no one called for it to be reinstated.

Now it turns out that parliament has plans to curtail its own holidays and come back a week earlier than planned which would be the same week we were in Norfolk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-says-removing-statues-is-to-lie-about-our-history-george-floyd\">Boris Johnson says removing statues is 'to lie about our history'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The official reason for the government\u2019s change of heart is that it has a lot of business it needs to get through. After the events of the past week, please excuse my hollow laughter, as parliament has gone out of its way to waste its own time, not to mention money, and that of the entire country. First we had Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s absurd change to procedures which resulted in MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\">queueing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\">for 90 minutes</a> to vote on preventing some other MPs who were either carers, shielding, socially isolating or who had to travel long distances from taking part in debates or voting. Since then the government has had to make so many concessions that parliament is basically back to operating how it was before Rees-Mogg took matters into his own hands. We\u2019ve also had to endure the spectacle of the government doing a U-turn on all children going back to school. So, if on the vague off-chance that Airbnb holidays with other couples are allowed and we aren\u2019t in a second major lockdown, then I\u2019m planning on taking my holiday regardless. I can\u2019t plan my entire life around the government\u2019s incompetence.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Speaking on the phone to my daughter, it seems that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/george-floyd-killing-minneapolis-protest-police\">Minneapolis</a> is gradually returning to some kind of normality. The protests have thinned out and the national guard is less visible. Also, having shut down a lot later than us \u2013 I remember conversations we had in early March in which she said that the coronavirus just wasn\u2019t on the US radar \u2013 Minneapolis has now eased almost all of its lockdown regulations. It\u2019s not immediately clear if this has been done on a scientific basis or because the city authorities are keen to ease some of the tensions that sparked the protests, but restaurants and gyms are now open and everyone is now free to meet pretty much anyone they want, subject to physical-distancing guidelines. It\u2019s made me realise just how easily institutionalised I am. When I came out of hospital after a longish stay some years back, I found being at home totally disorientating and quite scary. But that was nothing to how I feel about the possibility of the government lifting lockdown measures here. At least with the hospital, I trusted that the doctors were making the right clinical decision to discharge me. But with this government, I have no faith that Boris Johnson will make the right decisions for the right reasons at the right time. I chose to put myself in isolation a week before it became official government policy and I will maintain a similarly cautious approach for a few weeks after lockdown is eased. Even though my 96-year-old mother has seen off Covid-19, I\u2019m not willing to take any chances myself. I have always been a creature of habits, and right now my habit is staying indoors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c47857915ea139b9890cf9ef2f565f34f0e36110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c47857915ea139b9890cf9ef2f565f34f0e36110/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson with windswept hair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson: \u2018Don\u2019t worry.

Now the only way we can get any parliamentary scrutiny is for Labour to table an urgent question, and even then Gove couldn\u2019t be bothered to turn up in person. Instead he let a junior minister, Penny Mordaunt, take the flak. Also missing in action this week was the accident-prone Robert Jenrick. Having caused controversy by travelling from London to visit his parents in Shropshire during lockdown, the housing minister has got himself into trouble by overruling Tower Hamlets council to allow the Tory donor Richard Desmond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/robert-jenrick-ducks-commons-question-planning-intervention-richard-desmond\">planning permission</a> for the Westferry development the day before he would have been liable for a \u00a340m tax surcharge. To add to the intrigue, Jenrick was not only on the same table as Desmond at a Tory fundraiser in January, at which the development was raised, he also later admitted that his granting of permission was unlawful. A few weeks later, Desmond paid \u00a312,000 to the Tory party. Understandably, the opposition parties suspect that the ministerial code may have been somewhat stretched, and today managed to secure an urgent question so that Jenrick could explain how his actions had been totally above board. Only Jenrick pleaded the fifth amendment and sent along the junior minister Chris Pincher to face the music instead. As Pincher had clearly only been briefed on how not to give direct answers, MPs left the chamber none the wiser than they had been at the beginning. At any other time, this would have been a major scandal. But in the new coronavirus normal, it was just a minor inconvenience to be shrugged off. The crisis is good news for some.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s less than a week until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-project-restart-the-key-questions-answered\">Premier League restarts</a> and I still find myself totally underwhelmed by the prospect. This isn\u2019t at all how I imagined I would feel back in March \u2013 I thought that I\u2019d be ecstatic \u2013 and I\u2019m not entirely sure why. Part of it must be partisan: at the start of the lockdown, Spurs were playing like a bunch of strangers and had nothing to look forward to apart from the outside possibility of qualifying for the Europa League \u2013 a competition many clubs try to avoid \u2013 so the final nine matches always felt as if they were going to be an ordeal to be endured. Then there\u2019s the thought of the rest of the season being played out behind closed doors. I like my football live, preferably with me in the crowd, and the idea of empty stadiums in which three DJs \u2013 one for a remix of home team chants, one for the away fans and a neutral one for background noise of fans talking to each other about how everything is basically a bit pointless \u2013 competing over the PA system to provide atmosphere, feels soulless. I go to football as much to escape from myself for 90 minutes \u2013 to lose myself in something over which I have no control \u2013 as for the game itself. Not that I intend to boycott the games \u2013 I\u2019ll be sat in front of the TV for all Spurs\u2019 remaining fixtures along with a whole lot of matches in which the main attraction is wanting the team I hate more to lose \u2013 but I do wonder how much lockdown has affected me. This time next year, will the coronavirus just feel like a distant, bad memory with life having gone back to normal, or will it have changed my relationship with the world in a more permanent way? Not least with my sense of risk. I know I will go back to live sport, just as I will go back to opera, theatre and concerts, because life without them is a life half-lived. But I think it will be some years before I can do so without having a niggling worry there is someone in the crowd or audience who could unwittingly kill me.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> A 20.4% drop in GDP.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"524ec83ae6965b2804fda706fc58579e66203046\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/524ec83ae6965b2804fda706fc58579e66203046/0_94_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social distancing markers at the penguin enclosure at ZSL London Zoo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture of the week: \u2018Don\u2019t know what you\u2019re moaning about.

Set in small-town Texas, it follows the fortunes of the Turner family, who&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;a haunted house open to paying visitors.

In a clever premise that sets up a seat-of-the pants adventure, the powers that be have established 13 \u201cvirgin zones\u201d around the globe, deported the former inhabitants, and instituted a strict no-go policy enforced by paramilitary units.

Many states require the ballots to arrive by election night, a cutoff that could leave eligible voters disenfranchised. In Wisconsin, Democrats secured a court order requiring the state to count ballots as long as they were postmarked before election day and arrived within six days of the election.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">79,000 ballots</a> that normally would have been thrown out were counted during the extension (Trump won the state in 2016 by just under 23,000 votes).&nbsp;</p> <p>There is also growing concern about plummeting voter registration in recent months and an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/Voting-republicans-trump.html\">unprecedented </a>Republican effort to monitor the polls and challenge the eligibility of voters who appear, something that could result in voter intimidation.

After Wisconsin\u2019s chaotic April primary, the state\u2019s bipartisan election commission released a <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">detailed analysis</a> of what went wrong and unanimously voted to send an absentee ballot application to all voters who <a href=\"https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections-commission-approves-sending-absentee-ballot-applications-to-2-7-million/article_4f2cd7af-4e3a-58ef-8f26-d30333e6528f.html\">hadn\u2019t requested one</a> for November. The commission also moved to give local clerks \u2013 who were overwhelmed by ballot requests during the primary \u2013 more help.

Michigan \u2013 which saw long lines at some election offices during its March primary \u2013 is also sending an absentee ballot application to all voters.&nbsp;</p> <p>But other signs suggest states may move in the opposite direction. In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the state\u2019s top election official, refused to acknowledge systemic problems in the way the election was run this week, instead blaming local election officials. In Iowa, Republicans<a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/05/iowa-senate-republicans-propose-limiting-absentee-ballot-request-forms-paul-pate-covid-19/3155908001/\"> are considering legislation</a> that would prohibit the secretary of state, Paul Pate, from sending absentee ballot applications to all voters, something Pate, a Republican, did ahead of the state\u2019s June primary when there was record turnout. Ohio Republicans are also considering legislation that would<a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/ohio-house-passes-bill-restricting-future-changes-to-elections.html\"> bar the state\u2019s</a> top election official from paying for postage on absentee ballot requests and the ballots themselves.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s very concerning,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, which is <a href=\"https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAHScale_StrategyPlan.pdf\">advising election officials</a> on how to prepare for November. \u201cOn the other, what I would say is that this is a wake-up call.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee in Georgia who put voting rights at the core of her campaign, said some states were better positioned for November \u201cbecause those states have an intention of actually letting every person vote\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not that we don\u2019t know the answer.

  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As more countries ease out of lockdown, scientists shed light on how the virus attacks and raise questions over the wastewater that drains from sinks and bathrooms.</p> \n<h2>Lockdowns work</h2> \n<p>Substantial lockdowns around the world have taken their toll on millions of lives and dented economies globally. So it was a relief to hear that the bluntest tool of all in the outbreak management toolbox did actually work. Lockdowns in Europe saved more than 3 million lives, including an estimated 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France, and 630,000 in Italy, according to researchers at Imperial College London.</p> \n<p>Outbreak modellers found that lockdowns slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81%. In the UK, that amounted to lowering the all-important reproduction number of the virus, R, from 3.8 to 0.63, the researchers <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">reported in Nature</a>. In 11 countries from France and Germany to Spain and Italy, lockdowns pushed the R value below one, meaning the epidemics went into decline.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/global-report-eu-nations-continue-steady-exits-from-lockdown\">Global report: EU nations continue steady exits from lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The modelling showed that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people in those countries had been infected by coronavirus but \u201cattack rates\u201d varied dramatically, from 0.46% of Norwegians infected to 8% of Belgians. In the UK an estimated 5.1% of people were infected. Prof Axel Gandy, a statistician on the team, said the model suggested \u201cwe are very far away from herd immunity\u201d, where at least two-thirds of the population need to have acquired protective immunity to the disease. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8\">More work on lockdowns</a> came from the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists there estimated that lockdowns in the US, France, China, South Korea and Iran had prevented about 530m infections. The research came as New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, declared the country virus-free and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/new-zealand-abandons-covid-19-restrictions-after-nation-declared-no-cases\">scrapped all coronavirus restrictions</a>, except strict border controls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"634b5ed6-bc05-4cf6-9564-3cf587cdcfc3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gTskXsdMwc0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Enter the virus</strong></h2> \n<p>Scientists worked out early on how the virus invades human cells and establishes infections. Spikes on the virus bind to so-called ACE-2 receptors that pepper the surfaces of many human cells, most importantly those in the respiratory tract. Once latched on, the virus gains entry and replicates over and over, until millions burst out to infect more cells.</p> \n<p>But that might not be the only way in. Separate teams led by the Technical University of Munich and Bristol University found that the virus attaches to a second human cell receptor called NRP1. Like ACE-2, it peppers cells in the respiratory tract, but it is also abundant in olfactory tissues, those that are used to smell.</p> \n<p>Both groups found that blocking the receptor prevented the virus from infecting human cells in the lab, adding weight to the idea that it is important. What is most intriguing about the receptor is that it may be a gateway to the brain, and in particular allow the virus to reach olfactory centres and potentially disrupt the sense of smell.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.137802v2\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.134114v1\">papers</a> are tentative for now and have yet to be published in scientific journals. But if the results are sound, they might explain some of the disease\u2019s stranger symptoms and help to steer future vaccine design.</p> \n<h2><strong>Keep your distance</strong></h2> \n<p>Politicians on either sides of the Atlantic became embroiled in debates over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">safe distancing</a>. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, posted \u2013 and then swiftly deleted \u2013 a photo of President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign staff displaying zero physical distancing. Meanwhile in the UK, the Tories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/mps-pressure-boris-johnson-cut-2-metre-distancing-rule-tories-covid-19-england-uk-economy\">piled pressure on Boris Johnson</a> to reduce the 2-metre distancing guideline to 1 metre, amid concerns for the economy, in particular pubs, cafes and restaurants. Johnson made clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/englands-2-metre-distancing-rule-still-under-review\">he wants to ease the rule</a>, but uncertainty around whether the advice will be changed has caused chaos for councils and retailers, who may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/uncertainty-over-2-metre-distancing-rule-in-england-causing-chaos\">wasted millions of pounds</a> on signs and other preparations for reopening the high streets.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">What is the science behind the UK's coronavirus distancing rules?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Prof Susan Michie, who sits on the behavioural science subgroup of the government\u2019s Sage committee of experts, said reducing the distance to 1m would undermine messages of how the virus is transmitted. \u201cIt seems to me that now is not the time to be lifting restrictions unless there\u2019s a very good argument.

Previous research has shown that the virus can survive for anything from four hours on a copper surface to five days on glass, with cardboard, plastic and wood all lying somewhere between. What was less clear was how often domestic objects and surfaces are contaminated with the virus.</p> \n<p>A team of virologists at the University of Bonn hunted for the virus in air samples, wastewater and on surfaces in 21 randomly selected households. All were in quarantine after at least one member had tested positive for the virus. None of the air samples tested positive for the virus, but among the water samples taken from sinks, showers and toilets, 15.5% contained the virus. Strikingly, tests on 119 surfaces, including door knobs, handles, electronic gadgets, furnishings, food and drink items, clothes, plants and pets, yielded only four positives. These came from one TV remote control, two metal doorknobs and one wooden stove overlay. The scientists could not grow infectious virus from any of the samples they collected.</p> \n<p>The researchers are not suggesting that people ease up on hand-washing or cleaning surfaces, particularly when sharing a home with an infected person.

By his own estimate, he has helped punters recover more than \u00a3500,000 from bookmakers over the past seven years and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/01/betfred-pay-punter-40000-dispute-bet\">The Guardian has sometimes reported</a> on the outcomes of his cases but the work has got harder and he has begun to feel ground down.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s far more frustrating than it ever was and a real different ball game,\u201d adds Fairhead, who says the final straw was the failure of his appeal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/25/talking-horses-punter-gutted-as-189000-case-turned-down-by-ibas\">the case of David Smith</a>, a punter who cost himself \u00a3189,000 by writing Bailarico rather than Bialco.

When she left, she said the industry should engage with groups like Justice For Punters and that never really happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fairhead has also noticed, and not enjoyed, a change in the cases he is asked to take on. \u201cIt was bets that hadn\u2019t been settled properly or fairly, or people being deducted a Rule 4 when there shouldn\u2019t have been, or Best Odds Guaranteed being withdrawn after a bet won.\u201d He notices many fewer BOG cases now and hopes that firms have learned from past mistakes.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn recent months, 90% of the emails I get are from people who have had their funds frozen or confiscated and are being asked for \u2018source of wealth\u2019 information.

But it is obviously a breach of any firm\u2019s terms and conditions. His point is that bookmakers should make their background checks before accepting bets from a customer.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes I think they may have suspicions of third-party betting but while you\u2019re losing it\u2019s not an issue. As soon as you back a winner and then you go to withdraw, they have all these questions about where the money came from. The time to ask is when the money\u2019s deposited, before they take a bet. In simple terms, my view is if a firm accepts a bet, the bet should be honoured.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fairhead\u2019s departure makes life harder for punters, though they can still seek support from <a href=\"https://justiceforpunters.org/\">Justice For Punters</a> or the <a href=\"https://ukhbf.org/\">Horserace Bettors Forum</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to help people and at the end of the day, I have other things to do. I feel like I\u2019ve done my bit, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to win these cases and when you get a case like Dave Smith\u2019s, his only route is to go to court.

  "<p>Long before a white police officer killed George Floyd and sparked nationwide outrage, long before Covid-19 began killing Black people at twice the rate of their white counterparts, doctors and health experts were raising alarms that systematic racism is itself a pervasive, deadly pandemic \u2013 one that kills both instantaneously and insidiously, burdens Black and Brown Americans with generational trauma, contributes to higher rates of infant mortality and heart disease, and even speeds up the ageing process.</p> \n<p>Now, amid a national reckoning with entrenched inequality, lawmakers are finally hearing those alarms \u2013 and officially declaring racism a public health emergency. The city councils of Cleveland, Denver and Indianapolis have voted to acknowledge a crisis. Officials in San Bernardino county, California, and Montgomery county, Maryland, have done the same. State representatives in Ohio and Michigan are looking to follow suit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-black-minority-americans-house-subcommittee\">Black and minority Americans more likely to get Covid-19, House panel hears</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>These declarations are \u201clong overdue\u201d, said Dr Allison Agwu, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. As a physician on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, Agwu said she had been amazed at how quickly the medical establishment mobilized to develop diagnostic tests, and produce thousands of research papers seeking a treatment and vaccine. If the government can commit the same sorts of resources and funds to addressing issues of systemic racism, Agwu said, \u201cThat\u2019s a start.\u201d</p> \n<p>The stark health disparities in the cities and counties that have declared emergencies have been clear for decades. In Cleveland, the city where a white officer shot and killed with impunity 12-year-old Tamir Rice, Black infants are nearly three times as likely to die as white infants. Maternal mortality rates for Black women are two to three times greater compared to white women, and neighborhoods where the majority of residents are Black have the highest rates of lead poisoning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e8e721d74b69b71fae48e9cb558f4123d336128\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e8e721d74b69b71fae48e9cb558f4123d336128/0_225_4693_2817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical workers from the DC Nurses Association march in support of Black Lives Matter in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical workers from the DC Nurses Association march in support of Black Lives Matter in Washington.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cEven as an elected official, when I\u2019m driving, when the police drive up behind me \u2013 I feel a sense of nervousness that comes over me, \u201c said Basheer Jones, a Cleveland council member who introduced legislation declaring racism a health crisis. \u201cThe trauma of seeing your children, your sons, your daughters, your wives being killed, in living color \u2013 that kind of stress \u2026 also plays a part in the ailments that affect our bodies.\u201d</p> \n<h2>New urgency for longstanding issues</h2> \n<p>In Cleveland, officials introduced the landmark resolution recognizing racism as a health emergency in early March, before the coronavirus pandemic had hit the city, and months before the demonstrators against police brutality took to the streets nationwide.

Housing segregation and racist housing policies have limited access to education and healthcare, and left minorities disproportionately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/09/the-blackest-city-in-the-is-us-facing-an-environmental-justice-nightmare\">exposed</a> to toxic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/16/louisiana-cancer-alley-residents-march-pollution\">cancer-causing</a> chemicals in the water they drink, the air they breathe.</p> \n<p>Amid the pandemic, a labor market structured by racism means that Black and Latino people working frontline jobs as nurses, grocery staff, cleaners and transit workers are disproportionately exposed to the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of a number of coronavirus patients, and I\u2019ve had frank discussions with my Black patients about their risks,\u201d said Dr Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago Medicine. \u201cAnd as a Black provider, I offer that perspective in a way that doesn\u2019t feel as painful or threatening.\u201d But pervasive discrimination within the medical system also contributes to bad health outcomes, she noted. \u201cBlack people aren\u2019t believed when they\u2019re in pain,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f487ef5fb81e8ef66a801b82e045d2090396730\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f487ef5fb81e8ef66a801b82e045d2090396730/0_0_5775_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurses take a stand for racial justice outside of Bellevue hospital in New York City, in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurses take a stand for racial justice outside of Bellevue hospital in New York City, in June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Sanchez/Pacific Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Discrimination as a chronic illness</h2> \n<p>Mary Bassett, the director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard, who previously served as a New York City health commissioner, said race can also gradually erode physical wellbeing in less obvious ways. A growing body of research has found links between the chronic stress of experiencing discrimination and health disorders; for instance, people who endure years of microaggressions develop <a href=\"https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/race-discrimination-and-cardiovascular-disease/2014-06\">heart disease</a> more rapidly. A <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.128.suppl_22.a9550\">study</a> of Black women found that stress from frequent racist encounters was associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Other research <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/20/570777510/how-racism-may-cause-black-mothers-to-suffer-the-death-of-their-infants\">suggests</a> that pregnant women who report high levels of discrimination tend give birth to babies that have a lower birth weight.</p> \n<p>Some researchers have also linked the constant stress of being marginalized to a phenomenon called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470581/\">weathering</a>\u201d \u2013 which accelerates ageing on a genetic level. \u201cOf course, the answer to all this is not sending everyone on a yoga retreat \u2013 though that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. We still need to address the structural issues,\u201d Bassett said. Doing so will probably involve a range of reforms across many different departments of local governments, she told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>To that end, Somerville, Massachusetts \u2013 along with declaring a public safety and health emergency \u2013 announced it would withdraw from a federal defense department program that provides military weapons to police departments and committed to implementing a 10-point plan to reform law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/02/ayanna-pressley-rachael-rollins-police-reform-violence-racism-press-conference\">developed</a> by US representative Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat of Massachusetts. Cleveland lawmakers are planning to create a community advisory board to help shape legislation to address health disparities.</p> \n<p>In San Bernardino, community activists plan to keep the pressure on officials to go beyond a ceremonial declaration, by addressing not only the criminal justice and policing system that doles out \u201cinstant death\u201d for Black men, Casey said, but also inequities in the education and medical system.</p> \n<p>\u201cRacism is a pandemic just like Covid-19 is a pandemic,\u201d Casey said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been dealing with the coronavirus for, what, four months? We\u2019ve had systematic oppression for 400-plus years.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Here are today\u2019s key events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The national cabinet met and reconfirmed its commitment to the 3-step easing of restrictions, with some changes. Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence.</li> \n   <li> Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW postponed local government elections until 2021.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you for joining us.

But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it. But in the jobs they need. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee30baf8f08cdef7bed3f35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:00:26.604Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Will the prime minister look at extending the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September as suggested by the Reserve Bank governor? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> gets the nod:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you.

Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation. It\u2019s absolutely urgent for those who are impacted by the bushfires. Certainly, definitely, but it is also critically important for those for whom their jobs depend on getting the jobs started. <br></p> \n  <p>There is no greater focus this government had than on job creation in the wake of the Covid circumstances and indeed in the wake of the bushfire crisis. Rebuilding communities, rebuilding homes and jobs and rebuilding our economy.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:16:02.591Z\">at 5.16am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2fdd68f08cdef7bed3ec8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:07:34.670Z\">5.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Question time starts</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>to <strong>Paul Fletcher:</strong></p> \n  <p>Why is the government supporting a decreasing of Australia Post services?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fletcher:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You know that there\u2019s a byelection on when Labor turns to the old scare campaign, and the scare campaign that they\u2019re going on this time is about Australia Post and delivery times.

Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn<strong> Alan Tudge </strong>and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra?</p> \n  <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. <strong>This is not true.</strong> Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. <strong>This is not true.</strong> While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

  "<p>\u2018Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.\u201d So goes the saying popularly (if spuriously) attributed to Confucius \u2013 a proverbial truth that The Last of Us Part II explores, unflinchingly and sometimes gruesomely, for 30 hours. It is difficult to explain how exactly it does this without robbing players of the chance to experience it for themselves, but I will say this: no video game has ever gone to these lengths to humanise the enemy, or to interrogate the violence that it asks the player to perform.</p> <p>We play as Ellie, a 19-year-old born a few years after a fungal illness devastated human civilisation, turning the afflicted into shambling, deformed husks and the world\u2019s cities into overgrown relics. Since the events of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/jun/05/the-last-of-us-ps3-video-game-review\">The Last of Us</a> (2013), she has been living in a stable community of survivors, making friends, learning the guitar, kissing girls at dances. But a traumatic event drives her to leave the relative safety of Jackson on a revenge mission that takes her to the remains of Seattle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXl9GI1p_Os\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TXl9GI1p_Os?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The city has been ravaged first by the military, then by the infected, and finally by nature. Vegetation grows through the cars rooted to the highway and rusting skyscrapers preside over ominously empty streets. Abandoned storefronts and apartment buildings might hide notes from doomed former residents, scrap with which to fix up Ellie\u2019s weapons or craft improvised explosives and health kits \u2013 or dormant infected ready to tear her to bits. Before long, she comes into contact with the remaining human residents of the city: the remnants of a well-equipped militia and the unsettling followers of a brutal cult, whistling creepily to each other as they hunt Ellie down.</p> <p>There is shooting and molotov cocktails, and even a flamethrower at one point, but there is also an awful lot of hiding, running away, and creeping through long grass, desperately hoping not to be found. This isn\u2019t a game that makes you feel powerful. Ellie can take care of herself, but I spent much of this game feeling horribly imperilled. It is usually difficult but possible to sneak past undetected or run away from fights, but good luck finding the best paths through knots of soldiers or navigating a subway station full of zombies on your first try.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The violence is extreme, sometimes uncomfortable, and consequential</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More often, I was forced into desperate, scrabbling combat, trying not to get overwhelmed, wasting bullets in a panic. Very occasionally this felt slightly farcical; once I was stuck hiding on top of a shipping container, having exhausted all my ammo for every weapon, waiting for an opening to dash to the door I needed to get through to end the scene. But more often it feels intense and dramatic; immense relief descended on me every time I made it through a scene unscathed. This game pulls the occasional horror trick on you, sending you falling through a floor into a dark basement full of zombies or confronting you with horrendous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/27/resident-evil-praise-milla-jovovich-games-film\">Resident Evil</a>-inspired new variants on the infected, but the scariest parts for me were when I was probing through seemingly empty buildings, or hiding in a corner praying that guard dogs wouldn\u2019t sniff me out.&nbsp;</p> <p>The violence is extreme, sometimes uncomfortable, and consequential. It\u2019s hard to feel too bad for shooting, bludgeoning or blowing up the grotesque and suffering infected as they run at you, gasping, moaning and making hideous clicking noises, but when Ellie is choking a struggling human enemy, grim-faced, it\u2019s not pleasant to watch. In video games we are accustomed to an action-movie suspension of disbelief in relation to body counts, and to a straightforward moral assumption that the player characters whose perspective we inhabit are the goodies, and that the people on the other side of the aiming reticle are the baddies. The Last of Us Part II challenges both of these assumptions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b99f4bd60b533c00843c0ada5236ef0fbbad3e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b99f4bd60b533c00843c0ada5236ef0fbbad3e9/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Last of Us Part II\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotionally effective ... The Last of Us Part II</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naughty Dog/Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This isn\u2019t a straightforward violence-is-bad story. As in most zombie fiction, violence is baked into this world and our interactions with it. Instead, it\u2019s about the motivations for that violence, the endless cycles of retribution that pull individuals or whole populations down into destructive spirals, and what it takes to break those cycles. There were parts of it that I had to endure rather than enjoy, furious or disgusted by what characters were doing \u2013 and, by extension, by what I was doing. There will be many players who don\u2019t like where this story takes them, but by God, it\u2019s emotionally effective. I was obsessed with it from the first hour, and now that I\u2019ve finished it, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it for days.</p> <p>This effectiveness is the result of some fine acting from The Last of Us Part II\u2019s human stars, and the immense technical skill on show in translating those performances to the screen. Never for a moment did the awareness that I was watching 3D models interact with each other intrude on my experience of this story. You can see every scar, scratch and micro-expression on their faces, read their body language, hear the venom or fear or conflict in their voices \u2013 and these characters are, not incidentally, the most diverse set to feature in a game as big as this. It is rare in games for the moments when you\u2019re not playing to be as memorable as those when you are.</p> <p>The writing is extremely good, not only the dialogue but also the masterful use of flashbacks and other narrative devices to flesh out personalities and motivations, having you revisit scenes and places in new contexts that make you see things differently. Chases, shootouts and horribly tense forays through long-abandoned, zombie-infested buildings are balanced with quiet (or quietly devastating) scenes where all you do is talk and look around. The game\u2019s graphical and technical accomplishments are just as key to its power: everything from the animation to the scene-setting, every building and battered piece of furniture and tiny trinket that makes up this post-apocalyptic Americana, is meticulous and astounding.</p> <p>This is an unlikely comparison, but now that I\u2019ve had some time to absorb The Last of Us Part II, it reminds me thematically of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/feb/06/shadow-of-the-colossus-review-sony-japan-studio-bigpoint-playstation-4\">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, another game about how consuming grief and anger can be. I was similarly poleaxed by that game\u2019s clever manipulation of the player\u2019s power, the way it also used the language of video games to make you think twice about your actions.

Here we speak to people about why they have been demonstrating, what needs to change and whether they will continue protesting.</p> <h2>\u2018It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change\u2019</h2> <p>Seeing so many generations of black people was emotional. It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change \u2013 specifically in education. What are we teaching our kids? We don\u2019t learn about migration and the British empire but if people realised that Asians and Africans helped build this country, and contributed so much to what we call Great Britain today, they might open their hearts more.</p> <p>It makes some people feel uncomfortable, seeing black people protesting in this way. It\u2019s hard for people to admit their ancestors have done wrong and that society has to change. Sometimes we need to accept criticism because that\u2019s the way forward. I\u2019m not impressed with the government. I think Priti Patel\u2019s completely ignorant and doesn\u2019t care about why we\u2019re protesting and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">even telling us not to</a>.

As a black race we\u2019ve continually been subjugated to oppression and systemic racism and we are not taught our own history. We need radical change to policies that keep black people disproportionately in prison, excluded from healthcare and education, and suffering from mental health conditions. We need to be able to have our voices in prominent places but in order for that to happen ideologies have to change.</p> <p>I feel completely obliged to attend upcoming protests. This is a historic moment and I want to be a part of it, show my solidarity and be able to tell my daughter about it. I want her to grow up in a society where we invest in each other, where the best isn\u2019t kept for the elites. A lot of people are getting behind the movement because they can relate to the disenfranchisement that black people have felt for so long. I want there to be a community again, so much has been torn down by this government. <em>Chantelle West, 32 London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef/41_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The government needs to admit that racism is still a big issue\u2019</h2> <p>As a British Asian woman, I know that racism is still a huge issue. BAME people have been silenced by society because people are blind to racism or are afraid of admitting there is a problem. People need to admit, especially in government, that racism is still a big issue in our country and they need to listen to the black community more. The diversity training in businesses is not good enough, we need harder conversations; and the curriculum needs to change, it\u2019s focused on American slavery rather than Britain\u2019s role.</p> <p>If I decide to have kids one day, I don\u2019t want them to suffer because of the colour of their skin, to be harassed like I have been. I was always called a \u201cpaki\u201d. Even now if I walk down the street with my white partner, he has \u201cpaki shagger\u201d shouted at him.

I had never attended a protest before until Saturday and I was quite nervous about the persisting risks of coronavirus but felt like I needed to go. Everyone was really respectful; the feeling and the energy was incredible. It was a very emotional experience.</p> <p>Black history in British culture and especially in education is completely whitewashed. I came out of studying history at university and school knowing absolutely nothing about black history in the UK and it seems to be we will happily ignore the sins of our past and instead learn about those of other countries.

  "<h2>Does it matter what sort of mask you wear?</h2> <p>Yes. Different types of mask offer different levels of protection. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against Covid-19 infection, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. So even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested such masks should be reserved for health workers or those at particularly high risk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/face_mask_sew-zip/giv-39026Lfu2QQ9VIkZ/\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/face_mask_sew-zip/giv-39026Lfu2QQ9VIkZ/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The evidence on the protective value of single-use paper masks or reusable cloth coverings is less clear, but still suggests that face masks can contribute to reducing transmission of Covid-19.

A tighter fitting around the face is probably better, but <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/DIY-cloth-face-covering-instructions.pdf\">the CDC suggests any covering</a>, including a bandana, is better than none.</p> <p><a href=\"https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/News-Releases/2020/04/Testing-Shows-Type-of-Cloth-Used-in-Homemade-Masks-Makes-a-Difference\">One US study</a> investigated which household materials best removed particles of 0.3-1.0 microns in diameter, the typical size of viruses and bacteria, and concluded that good options include vacuum cleaner bags, heavyweight \u201cquilter\u2019s cotton\u201d or multiple layers of material.

Cover the mouth and nose with your mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Avoid touching the mask while using it and, if you do, wash your hands. Replace the mask when it is damp. To remove your mask, take it off using the elastic tags, without touching the front and discard immediately into a closed bin or, if the mask is reusable, directly into the washing machine.</p> <h2>How often do you need to wash masks?</h2> <p>They should be washed after each use.

These portraits start with a photo, snapped in the freshness of youth on his Pentax K1000 camera in the 90s and early-2000s. Occasionally, as with Tempa T, it\u2019s an image from an old style magazine such as Vice, those once unique storehouses of yesterday\u2019s music and fashion subcultures. The emphasis is on the fleeting and everyday, and its transformation through the labour-intensive business of changing the moment captured in a photographic image into the physical object that is a painting, which Silva creates by painting wet-on-wet.</p> <h2><strong>Seize the </strong><strong>moment \u2026</strong></h2> <p>Using soft light, muted colours and quiet moments, the mood throughout all of Silva\u2019s work is both affirmative and gently mournful, for bygone times, places and the people we once were. </p> <p><em>Included in <a href=\"www.theapproach.co.uk\">London Portraits, Interiors and Still Lives</a>, to 2 August </em></p>",

Young said that he hopes to be an influence to other young black men, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">a group whose turnout declined in the 2016 presidential election</a>.</p> <p>Since the Supreme Court partially repealed the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the 2013 decision Shelby County v Holder, voter disenfranchisement has become one of the nation\u2019s most urgent political issues: Michelle Obama launched the voting rights organization When We All Vote in 2018 and Georgia politician Stacey Abrams launched Fair Fight Action after she narrowly lost the gubernatorial election to Brian Kemp, who oversaw the election as the presiding Secretary of State and was widely accused of rigging the election (Abrams sued Kemp through Fair Fight Action and the case is pending). More Than a Vote is expected to join forces with both organizations, though neither When We All Vote nor Fair Fight have confirmed any partnership with James\u2019s group.</p> <p>It\u2019s yet another bold undertaking from James, who has gone beyond the standard calls for change and charity donations. The LeBron James Family Foundation has spent millions underwriting college scholarships for low-income students to attend the University of Akron and his elementary school, I Promise, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/education/lebron-james-school-ohio.html\">posted excellent performances</a> in its first district assessments. James did not explicitly reference US president Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/911610455877021697\">whom James once called a \u201cbum\u201d</a>, but his move into the voting rights debate is direct action against a president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/30/trump-voting-republicans/\">who has linked higher voter turnout</a> to increased likelihood of Republican losses in elections.</p> <p>The debate over voting rights is already one of the nation\u2019s most intense: The Trump administration adamantly opposes any expansion of vote-by-mail despite the public health threat of Covid-19 and Georgia\u2019s debacle during Tuesday\u2019s primaries was just one instance of voters facing long lines and faulty machinery to vote. In April, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/wisconsin-election-voting-rights.html\">the Supreme Court reversed a decision</a> to postpone the forthcoming election in Wisconsin by a week to assure that its residents could safely vote. The ruling forced thousands to go to the polls at the height of the pandemic. A report from the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research indicates that voter registration is down 70% across 11 states compared to 2016, largely due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>Judging by his public comments, James envisions his foundation doing more than mass voter registration. \u201cYes, we want you to go out and vote, but we\u2019re also going to give you the tutorial,\u201d James told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you the background of how to vote and what they\u2019re trying to do, the other side, to stop you from voting.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The advice on protests from Australia\u2019s Health Protection Principal Committee \u2013 the group of experts that advises governments during national emergencies \u2013 has been clear. People should not attend mass gatherings of any kind, because even though rates of community transmission of Covid-19 are low and many states are not reporting any new cases for days in a row, there is still a risk the virus may spread.</p> <p>\u201cAustralians are reminded that in our recent past a single person infected more than 35 others,\u201d the committee\u2019s advice states. \u201cThis virus is very, very infectious. It will be with us in one way or another for many months to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as Australia has made commendable efforts to contain Covid-19, the social and public health consequences of racism have been brought to the fore by the Black Lives Matter movement. Protests are being held throughout the world following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd in the US on 25 May after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd\u2019s protests of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. Australian protesters took to the streets in solidarity on Saturday, campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\">437 known Aboriginal deaths </a>since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">Family of David Dungay, who died in custody, express solidarity with family of George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is clear that protests will go ahead despite the health advice about Covid-19, with more protests planned in New South Wales and Western Australia for Friday night. A Victorian man who attended the weekend protest in Melbourne was later diagnosed with the virus, with health authorities saying he was likely infected before the rally. But with community transmission in Australia so low, and the prime minister saying Australia\u2019s goal is \u201csuppression\u201d and not \u201celimination\u201d of the virus, and that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July, just how risky are the protests?</p> <h2>Is the risk of spread from protests high?</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous.\u201d But he also said the country has \u201ceffectively achieved elimination\u201d. The issue is there may still be pockets where community transmission is occurring, he said. While widespread testing, especially in Victoria, might help to identify those areas, it is unlikely that all cases have been identified.</p> <p>A professor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health at Western Sydney University, Aunty Kerrie Doyle, said she personally would not attend protests as she and her husband are at higher risk of complications if they get the virus.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>But I support people who are going and I appreciate people standing up for our mob,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunity infections are almost non-existent, really. Meanwhile, there\u2019s not a day when Indigenous people aren\u2019t targeted. The police know who we are.\u201d</p> <p>She said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">NSW Aboriginal man David Dungay said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five guards in a Sydney jail</a>. \u201cFinally there is a groundswell of people who have come to understand how serious this issue is,\u201d Doyle said.</p> <p>Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, a member of the World Health Organisation advisory panel for infection prevention and control, said, \u201cYou need to balance perceived risk with real risk and infection control. I think there is always a risk when people gather but the community and myself are confused given it\u2019s OK to go to a crowded airport and sit on a plane for at least 40 minutes without a mask, and you can go to crowded shopping mall or to a supermarket, or be surrounded by people talking at a restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>She said the risk at rallies would depend on crowd behaviour. \u201cAt a rally, people without a mask will increase risks as we know particles can be pushed out at great velocity, especially if you\u2019re shouting. But if the protesters wear a mask and they keep that integrity of the mask during the rally intact, and they stay home if they feel unwell, then the risk is very minimal to negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>What can be done to minimise risk of spread?</h2> <p>The chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, Pat Turner, said it was important for protesters to remember that Covid-19 poses a serious risk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people due to higher levels of chronic conditions in that population, especially in those aged 50 years and older.</p> <p>\u201cThe specific advice of all health authorities is that while Covid-19 remains in Australia that everyone should take precautions including the social distancing and hygiene practices,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThose who attended the rally should take every precaution they can in terms of practical measures to protect themselves and their families. It is important you continue with social distancing, regular hand washing and cough hygiene. If you can, avoid contact with Elders and with people with chronic medical conditions ... If you develop even the mildest of symptoms, stay home and get a Covid-19 test.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s health advice is that people who march in protests don\u2019t need to isolate unless they feel sick, in which case they should get tested.</p> <h2>What are the health impacts of racism?</h2> <p>\u201cRacism makes you sick,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cI think one of the greatest impacts I see is a reluctance among our people to approach others for help. They have internalised that they are a second class and lower class citizen, and that they don\u2019t deserve medical treatment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers\">and if they seek it out, doctors won\u2019t listen</a>. If the rest of Australia thinks you\u2019re rubbish, you will believe that eventually.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers\">'How could this happen?': Indigenous health tragedies spark search for answers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She referred to a report that came out one decade ago from the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health and Flinders University which found \u201ccompared to non-Indigenous patients with the same medical needs, Indigenous patients were about one-third less likely to receive appropriate medical care across all conditions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAfter accounting for the effects of a range of other contributing factors, racism was significantly associated with poor self-assessed health status, psychological distress, diabetes, smoking and substance use \u2026 depression, poor self-assessed health status and poor mental health,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Doyle said that for so long Indigenous people and their supporters had tried various ways to raise these issues with government. Yet the disparity remained.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are protests going on tonight and we at our university are worried about our students and our Indigenous students who go and place themselves in clear and present danger for having their voices heard, but what\u2019s the other alternative?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can you do when people like Pauline Hanson are out there saying people like Floyd deserve their treatment?\u201d</p> <h2>Two public health objectives do not have to compete</h2> <p>The Public Health Association of Australia chief executive, Prof Terry Slevin, said the community often perceived events as \u201crisky or not risky\u201d. The reality was often more complicated, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us not to depict the protests this evening about being one public health imperative against another; Covid-19 versus advancing the health of Indigenous and Torres Strait islander people.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests are not completely risk-free, but neither is going to the supermarket. It\u2019s very important for people with concerns about Black Lives Matter to have an opportunity to express that and do it as safely as they can. That means not taking a confrontational approach towards protesters but a co-operative approach that minimises risks.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Full disclosure: Aliens was my favourite film when I was 12, and Aliens is still my favourite film in 2020. I am now 35 years old and have flecks of grey in my beard.&nbsp;I\u2019ve often worried about this. The film, I mean, not the beard. On the one hand, lots of people still like things they liked when they were 12. You don\u2019t see entire generations reaching their 20s and suddenly switching their favourite colour because they think they\u2019ve found a better one, or one day deciding they no longer care for Ribena or biscuits. Some things are just good, good for ever, and that\u2019s that. Growing older alongside them has no impact whatsoever on their objective merits.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the other hand, some profound intellectual awakening probably should have occurred in the intervening 23 years. Because I was not some wise-beyond-their-years child genius whose artistic tastes were surpassed only by a wit pithier than a Sunday league half-time snack. At 12, I was a preposterous little idiot. I wore, almost exclusively, Adidas \u201cpopper\u201d tracksuit bottoms, a Fila jumper so starchy you could smash paving slabs with it, and a curtains-with-undercut hairdo you might charitably call \u201cwildly misjudged\u201d. This was in addition to double-train-track braces, and the general fug of Lynx Inca that was concomitant with any boy at that time who had started to want girls to like them, and rather optimistically assumed body odour was the only reason they didn\u2019t. Yet one thing I\u2019ve got in common with that little dolt from 1997 is Aliens. He liked it and so do I. I\u2019ve come to accept that the reason for this is simple: Aliens is the single greatest film ever made.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t get to see it in the cinema. It came out in 1986, and I\u2019d only been out for a year at that point. So my introduction to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamescameron\">James Cameron</a>\u2019s opus came around the age of 10, from a version taped from the telly on to a knackered E180 video, from which my dad had failed in a valiant attempt to seamlessly excise the adverts by using the stop and record buttons.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKSQmYUaIyE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XKSQmYUaIyE?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>My mum had developed a loose set of rules about what my sister and I were allowed to see at that age. Sex and swearing were tentatively permitted, subject to her swift judgments on gratuity. Sexual violence was a no-no, as were drugs. Horrors were out (my uncle Tony was my source for these). People shooting other people: bad. People shooting robots and/or aliens: fine. Robots and/or aliens shooting robots and/or aliens: fill your boots. Through a loophole of her own making \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s people v aliens, so it\u2019s fine mum, honest\u201d \u2013 I\u2019d seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/01/alien-review-ridley-scott-lethally-contemporary-masterpiece\">Alien</a>, and found it bleak, claustrophobic and more terrifying than I cared to admit. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Aliens took the first film's essence and Scrapheap Challenged a rip-roaring war movie out of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was in later years I came to truly appreciate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott\">Ridley Scott</a>\u2019s original masterpiece, which is only the second-best film of the franchise on away goals. But I was hooked enough with the atmosphere, titular beast and the character of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sigourney-weaver\">Sigourney Weaver</a>\u2019s Ellen Ripley to want to see where the story went next. Nothing prepared me for the onslaught of brilliance to come.</p> <p>Aliens is often regarded as a blueprint for how to execute an effective sequel. And rightly so. It didn\u2019t try to replicate the first film. Instead, it took its essence and Scrapheap Challenged a rip-roaring war movie out of it. Ripley, the lone survivor of the mining ship, Nostromo \u2013 the sepulchral setting for the first film\u2019s slasher-horror minimalism \u2013 joins a ragtag band of marines to take the fight back to the aliens. And what a bunch they are: Michael Biehn\u2019s stoic Hicks, Bill Paxton\u2019s wild-eyed gobshite Hudson, Jenette Goldstein\u2019s badass gunslinger Vasquez. Frost, Spunkmeyer, Gorman, Apone, Drake \u2013 it\u2019s amazing how many memorable grunts Cameron managed to forge with so little expository dialogue. That they used enormous \u201csmart guns\u201d mounted to their hips and sped around in a Batmobile-esque armoured personnel carrier only served to sprinkle more geek catnip on my impressionable 12-year-old brain.</p> <p>The first film\u2019s tagline was: \u201cIn space no one can hear you scream.\u201d The tagline for Aliens was: \u201cThis time it\u2019s war.\u201d That, as much as anything, summed up how impossibly cool it was. The original film had scared the bejesus out of me, and I felt as if I was right there with Ripley, facing her fear, gaffer-taping a flamethrower to a machine gun because, hey, why not.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"def9ee6ed3df6e903278a7a9c14762a1abb162cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/def9ee6ed3df6e903278a7a9c14762a1abb162cb/0_722_1978_1187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Badass gunslinger \u2026 Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez with Bill Paxton as Hudson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Badass gunslinger \u2026 Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez with Bill Paxton as Hudson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rewatching it over the years I\u2019ve only come to appreciate Aliens more. It remains a masterclass in building tension: we don\u2019t actually see an alien until the hour mark, and when we finally do it\u2019s in a bewildering frenzy of bodycam panic. The scene with Ripley and Newt (the girl Ripley finds living feral on a base long since overrun by aliens) trapped in a laboratory with a scuttling face-hugger is still a bum-clenching ordeal. Paul Reiser\u2019s smarmy, flop-sweat-slick company man, Burke, has become ever more punchable with every passing year. And Ripley overcoming her prejudices to accept the android Bishop as a friend is more touching now than it ever was. Yes, Bishop had to be literally ripped in half in order for her to do this, but the point stands.&nbsp;</p> <p>It could be argued that Cameron hasn\u2019t made a truly great film since Terminator 2 (1991). That was the other adult-centric movie I remember featuring heavily in my childhood. Both Cameron films, both sequels to grimier, more disturbing originals that my mum would rather I didn\u2019t watch, both held together by remarkable performances by their leading women. I\u2019ve come to think that my mum was engaged in a not-so-subtle campaign to imbue me with an appreciation of strong female role models. Was she casting herself as Ripley, or Sarah Connor? Perhaps. This does rather sweetly imply that she cast my dad as Mr Biehn, as opposed to the arguably more apt Mr Bean, but maybe I\u2019m overthinking it.</p> <p>So, spotty pre-teen wazzock he may be, but my 12-year-old self and I remain in agreement. Pot Noodles are still nice. Encore Une Fois by Sash! is still an absolute stone-cold banger. And Ripley gaffer-taping a flamethrower to a machine gun is still the coolest thing ever committed to celluloid. Game over, man!</p>",

  "<p>Matt Hancock is facing legal action from the daughter of a man who died from Covid-19 in a care home in which the health secretary is accused of a \u201clitany of failures\u201d and misleading the public with his claim to have \u201cthrown a protective ring\u201d around care homes.</p> \n<p>Dr Cathy Gardner launched a high court claim on Friday after her father, Michael Gibson, a retired superintendent of births, marriages and deaths, died in an Oxfordshire care home in early April. He became infected after a patient who tested positive for the virus was discharged from hospital into the home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The request for a judicial review alleges failings \u201chave led to large numbers of unnecessary deaths and serious illnesses\u201d and have been \u201caggravated by the making of wholly disingenuous, misleading and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 plainly false statements suggesting that everything necessary has been done to protect care homes during the pandemic\u201d.</p> \n<p>The move comes amid growing anger among families of care home residents at policies they believe may have caused their loved ones to become infected. Several have raised complaints with hospitals and care homes about infection control, including the discharging of Covid-negative residents into homes with outbreaks.</p> \n<p>Thirty-five councils have also blamed virus spread on discharges with hospital patients sent to homes that did not have sufficient protective equipment and/or facilities to isolate infected residents.</p> \n<p>Other cases include a decision to discharge John Heywood, 83, from Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge into a Peterborough care facility with an outbreak. He contracted the virus and survived, but his family have lodged a formal complaint with Addenbrooke\u2019s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"769991784b32ea73b9cced4fd41c6f9106563ce0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/769991784b32ea73b9cced4fd41c6f9106563ce0/0_384_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Heywood, whose family fear he contracted Covid-19 after being discharged into a care home with an outbreak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Heywood, whose family fear he contracted Covid-19 after being discharged into a care home with an outbreak.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI was really upset and angry,\u201d said his daughter, Sarah Heywood. \u201cI called the [hospital] discharge planning team and they said there was no obligation to tell us if there\u2019s Covid in a home.

  "<p>Hollywood\u2019s depiction of infertility over the years has been, well, let\u2019s say sporadic. When it does make it on to the screen, it\u2019s usually played for laughs. Whether it\u2019s adoption in Juno, surrogacy in Baby Mama or infertility in Raising Arizona, when it comes to women\u2019s wombs, film execs have decided they need to throw in a good chuckle to make the subject more palatable. Just in case the grim reality of it all drives viewers away screaming in horror.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/08/my-streaming-gem-why-you-should-watch-creep\">My streaming gem: why you should watch Creep</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Private Life is a comedy about infertility but rather than using it as a plot device, it delves into the nitty gritty of IVF, egg donation and adoption, showing what a long, hard and lonely slog it really is. Its story of a middle-aged couple in New York struggling to conceive \u2013 inspired by writer and director Tamara Jenkins\u2019 own experiences \u2013 feels genuinely authentic. It\u2019s an intimate&nbsp;and unflinching look at the pain and heartache of infertility that is deeply compassionate and, at times, very funny.</p> <p>Released at the end of 2018 on Netflix, it was given a warm pat on the back by critics before being forgotten fairly swiftly in the deluge of other offerings on the streaming platform. Which is a crying shame as it\u2019s up there with the likes of Marriage Story and Roma as one of the platform\u2019s finest originals. A large part of this is down to Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti as Rachel and Richard, a successful artistic couple in their 40s who are not just emotionally spent but also financially bust after countless failed IVF cycles. They\u2019re still determined to cast the fertility net far and wide by making one last-ditch attempt at IVF as they also explore adoption.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1orjA9Z8g4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J1orjA9Z8g4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But their rocky road to parenthood has left its mark. She is anxious, overwrought and on the edge. He is snappy, frustrated and plain exhausted. Their relationship is on the verge of imploding and they\u2019re barely holding it together for their medical appointments. Their disapproving sister-in-law Cynthia (the always brilliant Molly Shannon) snipes that they\u2019re \u201cfertility junkies\u201d. While Richard insists to his wife as they\u2019re forced to spend another $10,000 on surgery: \u201cWe\u2019re not insane, we\u2019re normal.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, it\u2019s always a joy to spend time in Hahn and Giamatti\u2019s company but together they are a formidable duo. Their performances are wonderfully naturalistic; they breathe life into their roles by filling the jagged corners of their characters with poignancy. Hahn is outstanding as she teeters between barely contained rage and raw vulnerability while Giamatti skillfully conveys how dejected Richard has become, beaten down by his own sadness. Both are equally compelling as they demonstrate in their different ways how this primal need to have a child does not listen to reason or to a beloved spouse or to anyone really but their own spluttering biological clock. Even if it threatens to tip into something toxic and unhealthy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f0b30310b501a451d34538508efc17bd48d10e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f0b30310b501a451d34538508efc17bd48d10e9/0_0_3504_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Things take a turn when they decide to ask their stepniece Sadie (Kayli Carter), a 25-year-old college dropout who is trying to figure out what to do with her life, to be their egg donor. She\u2019s game but perhaps still too emotionally immature to grasp the full implications of what she\u2019s signing on for. Jenkins reveals how a deeply private matter like infertility soon becomes public property; your body grabbed by strangers\u2019 hands (in one scene a doctor asks Rachel if she likes prog rock midway through a medical procedure) and your grief casually laid bare for friends and families. She\u2019s also adept in finding the wry humour that lurks within darker moments with plenty of bittersweet laughs along the way.</p> <p>Her script exposes some of the conflicting messages that we\u2019re fed as a society about fertility especially how women are told to go forth and forge a career and then chided for waiting too long to try to have a baby. It also touches on the other ways women\u2019s bodies betray them as they age when the hell of menopause kicks in, as Cynthia, plucking out a chin hair one night, discovers. The film doesn\u2019t gloss over the repetitive nature of the fertility hamster wheel. Not just with the constant injections, the mind-numbing paperwork, the faceless waiting rooms and how tooth-pullingly awkward each step is. But also the seemingly endless cycle of burgeoning hope that is wiped out by crushing disappointment and heartbreak.</p> <p>Private Life shows us that despite the tears, the anguish and the emotional scars that linger on, it\u2019s this hope which refuses to be extinguished. And that is what makes us human.</p> <ul> <li><p>Private Life is available to stream on Netflix in the US and UK</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I am not saying I do not live an exciting and fulfilling life, but I enjoy ordering A4 samples of wallpaper online. I am saying that I truly believe the moment capitalism spiralled out of control was when homeware stores started charging for tester pots of paint.

When I was growing up, it was definitely out of fashion. Now it has had a renaissance. Queen Anne even introduced a wallpaper tax (in 1712, it lasted until 1836). One way people got round it was to buy plain paper and stencil it. Which I like to think is the sort of creative-thinking antecedent to what I do.

  "<p>Two widely reported acts of civil disobedience took place in Britain this past month. One was on the streets of Bristol and led to the toppling of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">slave-trader\u2019s statue</a>. The other was on the Dorset coast at Bournemouth and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/health-officials-make-last-minute-plea-to-stop-lockdown-easing-happy-monday\">Durdle Door</a>, where thousands flagrantly breached the government\u2019s social distancing law and, in the government\u2019s words, \u201crisked lives\u201d. In both cases, the police arrived and did not intervene.&nbsp;</p> <p>Public space is the stage of political last resort. Where consent to rule fails, where constitutional redress collapses, people will treat the law with contempt. You may call it civil disobedience, protest, trespass, a mob or a riot. It is political action with the objective of securing a change supposedly unavailable by other means.&nbsp;</p> <p>A much-favoured fiction of history is that Britain does not do \u201cmobs\u201d. To Tocqueville, its politics defaulted to the club, while America and France defaulted to the mob. This was rubbish. Karl Marx may have thought Britain a hopeless venue for revolution: London\u2019s proletariat was too suburban to congregate in street action. But agitators from John Wilkes and Lord George Gordon to the London dockers and Mosleyite fascists regularly terrified the authorities by their ability to command the streets.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the 19th century, governments watched nervously to see if Britain would be infected by Europe\u2019s revolutionary epidemics. Just such fear caused the 1819 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/04/peterloo-massacre-bloody-clash-that-changed-britain\">Peterloo</a> massacre. It was the stones of the mob crashing against the Duke of Wellington\u2019s windows in 1832 that drove him to concede reform. Likewise in 1867, when Disraeli saw 100,000 protesters pour into Hyde Park to face his 10,000 troops, he lost his nerve. He agreed to the mass franchise he had opposed a year before.&nbsp;</p> <p>I have reported on many protest marches and found being surrounded by a purposeful crowd strangely compelling. The comfort of a shared opinion, the naive emotion of the shouted slogan and the exhilaration of a common enemy are a reversion to raw politics. There is no debate, just Freud\u2019s \u201cunlocking of the subconscious\u201d. The rules and courtesies by which democracy operates are nowhere. The reason so many street marches veer into riots is that unrestrained politics defaults to a fight.</p> <p>British politicians supposedly know by instinct how far to concede to such emotions. Parliament may have capitulated in 1832, but in 1848 it faced the Chartist marchers with 80,000 police and saw them off. There were no concessions to mass demonstrations against nuclear weapons, the Vietnam and Iraq wars, or to the anti-capitalist Occupy movement \u2013 if only because concessions were not deemed realistic.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/31/poll-tax-riots-25-years-ago-political-awakening-carnage-trafalgar-square\">poll tax riots</a> of 1990 undoubtedly played a part in that tax\u2019s demise, while Extinction Rebellion in London\u2019s West End last year secured what was at least an appearance of government support. Successive protests over race in British cities have invariably led to ardent promises of lessons learned and reforms instituted, even if present discontents show promises unfulfilled.&nbsp;</p> <p>I do not agree with the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d. I rather acknowledge Reinhold Niebuhr\u2019s grimmer contrast between the sainted individual and the sinful group, \u201cmoral man and immoral society\u201d, drawing on the experience of interwar Germany. Crowds are licensed unreason. But I still regard the street as a sacred political space, the last resort, liberty rampant.&nbsp;</p> <p>That is why what matters is not so much the protest as how authority responds to it. Street violence has undoubtedly diminished in Britain, I think because the police have become more sophisticated in crowd control. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\">Notting Hill riots</a> in the 1950s flared in large part through police incompetence. So many street protests in cities round the world are caused by inept and heavy-handed law enforcement, when a deft blind eye is all that is needed to defuse trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bristol and Bournemouth might both be offences against public order, but they are hardly serious ones. The first was the result of Bristolians failing to agree on how best to deal with their chequered history. The second was a mass refusal to obey a ludicrously draconian safety rule after weeks of cooped-up self-imprisonment. In both cases, the answer of the authorities was to let it be. Move on.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet those who appease law-breaking must acknowledge the risk. As the American political psychologist Jonathan Haidt has noted, most good people favour democracy, prosperity and fairness, but only as long as their security is assured.

  "<p>British airline passengers should avoid bringing hand luggage on to a plane in order to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, according to new government advice.</p> <p>However, the recommendation was criticised by Europe\u2019s biggest airline, Ryanair, which said it was safer for passengers to carry rather than check in bags. The Department for Transport guidance \u201cstrongly\u201d encourages passengers to check in bags and minimise hand luggage because it will \u201cspeed up boarding and disembarking and minimise the risk of transmission\u201d.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the guidelines were \u201ca positive next step\u201d for the embattled aviation sector to start recovery, after most flights were grounded due to coronavirus and travel restrictions from late March.</p> <p>Shapps added: \u201cThe government\u2019s advice currently remains to avoid all non-essential travel, but today we are taking the necessary steps to ensure a framework is in place for the aviation industry to bounce back&nbsp;when it is safe for restrictions on travel to be lifted.\u201d</p> <p>The guidelines for air travel come as more flights are due to resume next week, when easyJet will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/easyjet-to-resume-domestic-flights-across-england-and-france\">restart domestic services from Gatwick</a>.</p> <p>The advice, which broadly follows the guidance from the UN aviation body the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as well as input from the UK aviation industry, also recommends checking in online and remaining seated as much as possible during the flight.</p> <p>General health advice will continue to apply, such as attempting to maintain social distancing where possible in the airport, and washing hands regularly after touching any surfaces, including check-in kiosks and trolleys.</p> <p>Passengers are urged to bring their own face covering for use throughout their journey including at the airport, with spare coverings for longer journeys and plastic bags to store used masks.</p> <p>Specific rules on temperature checks or self-certification, which some airlines and airports have asked for, have not been issued. But in line with general guidance passengers have been told not to travel if they have been in close contact with anyone with symptoms in the past 14 days.</p> <p>Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at MAG, the owner of Stansted and Manchester airports, said they had collaborated with the government to draw up the guidelines, based on advice from independent medical and scientific experts who looked at necessary safety measures at each stage of travel.</p> <p>But Ryanair said that it recommended hand luggage, which would only be touched by the passenger, rather than checked-in bags which would have contact with multiple baggage handlers and check-in staff.</p> <p>Apart from Ryanair, most airlines and airports welcomed the guidelines, which they said would help pave the way for travel to resume \u2013 but also urged the government to remove the impediment of its controversial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/08/what-are-the-uks-new-quarantine-rules-that-face-a-legal-challenge\">quarantine rules</a>&nbsp;and introduce proposed \u201cair bridges\u201d to enable flights to selected international destinations as soon as possible.</p> <p>Tim Alderslade, chief executive of&nbsp;Airlines&nbsp;UK, said the guidelines were welcome: \u201cThey&nbsp;demonstrate how&nbsp;airlines&nbsp;can&nbsp;apply targeted and multi-layered measures to ensure air travel is safe for customers and crew.\u201d</p> <p>The International Air Transport Association said the measures were sensible but \u201crendered useless if the government continues with the 14-day quarantine rule\u201d.</p> <p>A Ryanair spokesperson said the government should \u201cstop issuing rubbish advice to passengers about baggage and instead focus their efforts on scrapping the UK\u2019s useless visitor quarantine, which the UK Home Office now admit cannot be implemented, supervised or policed effectively\u201d.</p>",

But French competition Blow Your Style adapted with an e-battle, dancers from around the world posting their clips to Instagram to be judged online. The kids\u2019 battles are brilliant, some of them just primary-aged, filmed on DIY garage dancefloors and in front of their mums\u2019 soft furnishings. Both the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CALp8IuIVb8/\">boys</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CALSNtfobjc/\">girls</a> are technically fierce and they leave most older opponents well and truly (home)schooled.</p> <h2>Swans for Relief</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/418674679\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/418674679?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Back in April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/09/the-swan-birmingham-royal-ballet-lockdown\">Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s C\u00e9line Gittens danced The Dying Swan</a> at home, a poignant ray of light at the beginning of lockdown. Well, multiply that one ballerina by 32 and you\u2019ve got <a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/swansforrelief\">Swans for Relief</a>, masterminded by the magnificent Misty Copeland, a fundraiser featuring dancers from North America, Mexico, Cuba, China, South Africa and Europe performing the same Mikhail Fokine solo (including the Royal Ballet\u2019s Francesca Hayward and English National Ballet\u2019s Precious Adams). From Australian hijabi ballerina Stephanie Kurlow to Denise Parungao dancing on a rooftop in the Philippines, it\u2019s a movingly universal portrait of the yearning beauty of ballet.</p> <h2>Boy Blue, #30byThursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAxJEdzHbmg/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We are working with the Home Office to determine what must change so that this shameful period of our history is not repeated.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of Covid-19 and the killing of George Floyd by US police officers has resulted in urgent calls for action to end the systemic and entrenched race inequalities that exist in our country. The law requires that all public bodies must promote inclusivity and opportunity by considering the impact their policies have on ethnic minorities.\u201d</p> <p>An alliance of 16 anti-racism groups called on the EHRC to launch an investigation into the extent of institutional racism within the Home Office in the wake of the publication of the Williams lessons learned review in March.</p> <p>Patrick Vernon, a campaigner on Windrush, welcomed the decision to launch an investigation. He has organised a <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/windrush-never-again\">petition</a>, so far signed by over 100,000 people, calling for the full implementation of all 30 recommendations set out in Williams review.

It is vital that the government immediately accepts Wendy Williams\u2019 recommendation for a full review and evaluation of the hostile environment policy and measures.\u201d</p> <p>Kimberly McIntosh, of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cWith the immigration bill making its way through parliament, it\u2019s time to tackle the longstanding injustices that permeate our immigration system. The government should implement the full set of recommendations made in the lessons learned review and end the hostile environment policies that wrought havoc on the lives of not just the Windrush generation, but countless others.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: </p> <p>\u201cWe are carefully considering the findings of the Windrush Lessons Learned review and will respond shortly to those important recommendations.

What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture.

  "<p>There\u2019s a new divide in the Conservative party: Waitrose or Lidl? But it\u2019s not about which supermarket you shop at. It\u2019s how you view a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/boris-johnson-trade-deal-us-chlorinated-chicken\">potential trade deal</a> with the US.</p> <p>As talks get under way across the pond, the cabinet is split between those who wish to prioritise British farmers and those who want their constituents to benefit from cheaper produce on the supermarket shelf.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a rehash of remain v leave. Instead it\u2019s about which part of the Tory voter coalition gets priority treatment: traditionally Tory rural constituencies or the post-industrial, \u201cred wall\u201d seats that the party won for the first time last December.</p> <p>A trade deal with the US has long been cited by Tory Brexiteers as the jewel in the crown of their plans for post-Brexit Britain. The idea is that such an arrangement with Washington would remove the UK from Brussels\u2019 regulatory orbit and show that the UK can negotiate its own trade deals even with the world\u2019s largest economies.</p> <p>But despite the Conservatives now having a majority of 80, senior Tories are beginning to worry that their free market dream is on life support. As the prime minister grapples with the government response to coronavirus, a battle of ideas is playing out among ministers and MPs \u2013 and to the surprise of the free marketeers, it\u2019s the protectionists who are on the front foot.</p> <p>This month Boris Johnson agreed a proposal for the trade deal that would see a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/poultry/government-plans-dual-tariff-system-for-us-chicken-imports\">dual tariff</a>\u201d system in place that could allow ministers to use high tariffs to make it economically unsustainable for US producers to supply the UK with controversial foodstuffs such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in real danger of a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do a trade agreement with the United States being hijacked by a bunch of Waitrose protectionists,\u201d says a senior Tory.&nbsp;The Waitrose set, as they have been dubbed, are made up of the likes of the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, environment secretary George Eustice, his predecessor Theresa Villiers and green Brexiteers such as Zac Goldsmith and Danny Kruger.</p> <p>Boosted from the sidelines by rural and organic champions such as Henry Dimbleby, this group wants British farmers and UK food standards to remain protected.&nbsp;Their concern is that farmers must not be undercut by cheaper production and lower animal welfare standards.</p> <p>Leading the charge on the free market side is the international trade secretary, Liz Truss \u2013 with a majority of the cabinet sympathetic to her position. They believe they have public support, &nbsp;with internal polling suggesting 62% of Britons back a deal.</p> <p>Those familiar with Truss\u2019s thinking insist she does not favour chlorinated chicken, but does view free trade as a way to increase consumer choice. The growing concern among this group \u2013 the Lidl free marketeers \u2013 is that chlorinated chicken is being used to shut down any debate on wider imports from the US.</p> <p>Several of the usual suspects who would be looked at to make the case have been missing in action of late, their attention focused either on China or the need for the lockdown to be eased. So it\u2019s the new intake of red wall MPs who are agitating that protectionism could deprive their voters of a tangible benefit of Brexit: cheaper food on the supermarket shelf.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a lot of the MPs hijacking the debate represent wealthier constituencies with middle-class neighbourhoods,\u201d says one. \u201cThey might appreciate organic produce but our new voters want decent stuff on the shelf and they also want choice.\u201d</p> <p>This split between the agricultural interests and free trade goes back a long way, of course. In 1846, Robert Peel<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/07/tories-face-a-corn-law-moment-but-catharsis-is-nowhere-in-sight\"> repealed the corn laws</a> to provide cheap food for people in the new manufacturing centres. But that decision led to his resignation and a schism that kept the Tories out of power for the best part of 30 years.</p> <p>Coronavirus and the new importance placed on supply chain security&nbsp;means the argument for free trade \u2013 that many Brexiteers believed they had won in the EU referendum, Tory leadership contest and general election \u2013 is becoming harder to make. As Johnson\u2019s government becomes more interventionist and looks to make Britain more self-sufficient, arguments for free trade will have to be made again.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s final decision on the deal will come down to how he plans to sell Brexit in the post-coronavirus landscape. Is it via a vision of a new, self-sufficient nation where British is best \u2013 or as a champion of free trade where consumers have more choice and cheaper food?</p> <p>Whatever the prime minister decides, one section of his new party will be left disappointed.</p> <p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",

Unlike earlier US and EU sanctions it targets the regime\u2019s backers outside of Syria; in banking, business and politics, expanding a remit to neighbouring capitals, the Gulf states and Europe, which have maintained economic links to Damascus. From 17 June, institutions, businesses or officials that finance the government of Bashar al-Assad could be subject to travel bans, denied access to capital, and face other measures including arrest.</p> <p>Ibrahim Olabi, a British barrister who founded the Syrian Legal Development Programme, an organisation that works on sanctions, said that even among some of the law\u2019s proponents there are growing concerns that a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach could overshadow the intent of the law. He said earlier US and European Union sanctions had a more limited mandate.</p> <p>\u201cThe Caesar sanctions definitely have the potential to be a bigger deal because the US is using them to deter countries from doing business with Syria,\u201d said Olabi. \u201cThe US has recognised that Syria is a proxy arena for all the elements they\u2019re targeting.</p> <p>\u201cUsing the human rights abuses that were committed there as the vehicle helps give the US additional legal leverage for Caesar. Instead of Iranian and Hezbollah actors looking like they are being targeted on political grounds, they now could be targeted on the basis that they are supporting the unprecedented human rights abuses in Syria.\u201d</p> <p>As the Syrian economy has unravelled since March, so too has Lebanon; both countries\u2019 currencies have plunged in parallel, and prices of essential goods are now beyond the reach of many. In Syria, protests against the imploding economy have been held this week in regime strongholds such as Latakia \u2013 a rarity throughout the war. And on Thursday, Assad fired the country\u2019s prime minister, Imad Khamis, as pressure continues to grow from an increasingly desperate and vocal public.</p> <p>The ramifications of Caesar are rippling through Beirut, where traders retain lucrative ties to Syrian officials that are barely keeping Lebanese state revenues ticking over.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a disaster for the [Lebanese] government, said one Lebanese banker. \u201cThey will sanction Lebanese traders and banks. Our currency will plunge as far as theirs. One of the few places we can trade is Damascus. If that\u2019s shut down, we\u2019re doomed.\u201d</p> <p>Lebanon\u2019s currency collapse appears to have factored in the upcoming Caesar bill and Beirut\u2019s economic crisis is likely to have sent Syria\u2019s economy into free fall. The parallel plunges are being used by some US officials to claim that both governments are co-dependent \u2013 and therefore warrant the same approach.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey claimed that the crumbling Syrian currency was partly due to US actions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Syrian pound\u2019s collapse proves that Russia and Iran are no longer able to float the Assad regime while the regime itself is no longer able to manage an effective economic policy, or launder money in Lebanese banks\u201d Jeffrey said. </p> <p>Over the past month, wheat and fuel \u2013 subsidised from the fast dwindling reserves of Lebanon\u2019s central bank \u2013 have kept the Syrian economy on life support, to the chagrin of some Lebanese leaders. Smuggling lines from Iraq, meanwhile, have maintained a supply of food into most parts of regime-held Syria, where soaring prices have led to few buyers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the availability that\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Fouad Shabbana from the town of Palmyra. \u201cIt\u2019s that no one can afford to buy anything. As of yesterday, my whole [monthly] salary can buy one kilo of meat. I now get paid the equivalent of $14.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrices of goods in Syria, including locally produced ones, are rising with the exchange rate,\u201d said Elizabeth Tsurkov, Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cThe inflation is so rapid that prices in the morning would be lower than in the evening. Contacts across the country reported that in the span of one month, in line with the rapid depreciation, prices of most goods rose by over 50%. This puts Syria into a small club of countries that have experienced hyper-inflation.\u201d</p> <p>Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: \u201cAssad is absolutely the prime driver of Syria\u2019s ongoing collapse. [But] the US position now appears to be fundamentally driven by great power politics and the goal of ensuring that Russia and Iran can\u2019t claim a win.</p> <p>\u201cMy fear is that Caesar will achieve the exact opposite of its stated goals, fuelling the worst impulses of the Syrian regime and wider conflict. The US self-declared maximum pressure campaign aims to bring the regime to its knees and force its backers to concede defeat but the regime knows how to brutally hold onto power and it\u2019s clear that its key backers aren\u2019t for moving.</p> <p>\u201cThe Syrian people have been brutalised for a decade now and the country is devastated by conflict but we appear to be staring into the precipice of a dangerous new stage of the conflict \u2026 which risks a devastating new unravelling.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>I\u2019m proud to admit, even if colonisers find it rude or tasteless, that last month my partner and I spat at the feet of the British warlord George Grey. It\u2019s our duty as Waikato-Tainui descendants to disrespect the governor who sent the British empire into our land, pinching and plundering from our ancestors as they went, and it\u2019s our responsibility to resist clean commemorations. The statues commemorating Grey \u2013 like the stone rendering in Albert Park \u2013 the street names honouring his memory, and the towns that take his name (\u2018Greytown\u201d) aren\u2019t \u201chistory\u201d. They\u2019re a tribute to one people\u2019s violent victory over another. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/fears-of-violence-stop-london-racism-protest-as-statue-attacks-continue\">Tensions rise over race and heritage as more statues are attacked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/city-of-hamilton-in-new-zealand-to-remove-statue-of-british-naval-captain\">Hamilton council\u2019s decision to remove the statue </a>commemorating Captain Hamilton, the naval commander who led a regiment at Gate P\u0101, a colonial invasion in the Bay of Plenty, is a turning point: it\u2019s a reminder that Grey is next on the block, and after him Marmaduke Nixon, the military commander notorious for leading an attack against women and children at an unfortified village in the Waikato, and after him every other statue celebrating the men who made the empire. It\u2019s 2020, after all, and postcolonialism is giving way to decolonisation.</p> <p>But for the tragics and the nostalgics this is vandalism, denying history and its makers, however unpleasant. But what the statues\u2019 defenders miss is that history is always in the making, and its destruction is as relevant as its commission. The savviest defenders might concede that argument, acknowledging movements like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/protesters-rally-in-oxford-for-removal-of-cecil-rhodes-statue\">Rhodes Must Fall</a> are making new histories, but the ground shifts in the defence: \u201cwhy can\u2019t we move the statues to museums, presenting history in all its context\u201d? That seems like a reasonable request, but it leaves the obvious counterargument unspoken. History is already playing out in all its context. Grey\u2019s actions bleed into the present, shaping who owns land in the Waikato and who doesn\u2019t and determining which institutions (the crown\u2019s government) exercise power and which don\u2019t (iwi and hapuu). </p> <p>Do M\u0101ori need a museum to explain this \u201ccontext\u201d? Of course not.</p> <p>But history isn\u2019t neutral. It can critique power (like Rhodes Must Fall or the Hamilton statue\u2019s critics) or justify it (like the Hamilton statue\u2019s defenders). Michael King, the late New Zealand historian, exposes the different layers well, describing Anzac Day and its government-led history as a \u201cthe necessary myth\u201d. Necessary in the sense that Australia and New Zealand were in need of a story, and one of sufficient gravity, to locate their identity. The irony is that that story takes place half a world away, in lives lost in an imperial war, when the same story takes place here \u2013 in lives lost in a colonial war. The difference? One history \u2013 Anzac \u2013 is distant, its consequences are abstract \u2013 \u201cnationhood\u201d \u2013 and the other (the New Zealand wars) is present, its consequences everywhere to see from the inequality between M\u0101ori and Pakeha to the statues commemorating the men who made those conditions possible.</p> <p>War, in every fight and in every portrayal, is a drama of opposites. But who was fighting for what in the New Zealand wars? Grey, Hamilton and Nixon were fighting for control, taking it from one people for the benefit of another. Are these men who are worth commemorating? Never. They\u2019re not worth commemorating in public \u2013 whether in Albert Park or Hamilton \u2013 and they\u2019re not worth commemorating in private spaces either, whether in museums or elsewhere. The only way to acknowledge the history they made \u2013 invading the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and Taranaki \u2013 and the society they\u2019re responsible for \u2013 where M\u0101ori are on the wrong side of every statistic, from incarceration to joblessness \u2013 is to tear it all down. </p>",
  "<p>In attempt to chastise the tens of thousands of people who marched in cities and towns around Australia in support of Black Lives Matter, the conservative talkback host Neil Mitchell told Scott Morrison that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody were a \u201cfurphy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sadly high level of Indigenous incarceration, I think it\u2019s about 30% compared to 3% of the population,\u201d Mitchell said, while interviewing the prime minister on Thursday. \u201cBut black deaths in custody, I mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a furphy, isn\u2019t it?

Her medical records had not arrived with her and, apart from issuing Panadol, authorities did not believe she was in need of pain relief. Six weeks after the transfer, she took her own life. The coroner said the pain was \u201ca contributing factor in her despair\u201d during her final weeks.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>An Aboriginal man in the grip of cardiac arrest was made to walk to a guard station to use a portable oxygen unit before an ambulance was called.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Another Aboriginal man died of heart disease lying on a concrete bench in a Darwin police watch-house cell.

Coroners have criticised unnecessary delays in notifying next of kin. In one case, a father found out his son had died when another prisoner called him several hours after the death, long before police notified him officially.

I\u2019m not sure. This is another top-down initiative, not a deliberative response to local expressions of need,\u201d said Amy Hanser, associate professor in the department of sociology at the University of British Columbia, who focuses on inequality and urban China.</p> <p>In the days since Li\u2019s speech, authorities have started to limit public excitement. A directive from propaganda authorities told news outlets to delete content related to the <em>ditan</em> economy to avoid \u201chyping\u201d the topic. On the social-media platform Weibo, some hashtags related to the subject appeared to be blocked. Authorities in Beijing have already said that the capital is \u201cnot suitable\u201d for street vendors.</p> <p>That skittishness may be because a loosening of policies towards the vendors would be a rare example of social control being relaxed. For most of the last decade, cities such as Beijing have come under stricter regulation, from barring \u201cuncivilised behaviour\u201d \u2013 such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/06/chinese-citys-ban-on-beijing-bikinis-leaves-men-hot-under-collar\">\u201cBeijing bikini\u201d</a>, when men roll up their shirts in the summer \u2013 to efforts to rid the city of the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/china-ruthless-campaign-evict-beijings-migrant-workers-condemned\">low-end population</a>\u201d of migrant workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe see Chinese society under more and more control. Everything becomes stricter, and suddenly we see some space,\u201d said Xu Jianhua, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Macau, who has researched street vending in Guangzhou. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really about so many people excited about vending. It\u2019s an opportunity to see the relaxing of control.\u201d</p> <p>Xu sees the current support for street vendors as a temporary measure in response to Covid, not a real reversal of the government\u2019s apprehension about the informal economy and set ideas about cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/blindsided-how-coronavirus-felled-the-global-economy-in-100-days\">Blindsided: how coronavirus felled the global economy in 100 days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe overarching idea about what is modern, what is a good city, I don\u2019t think has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cModern means clean, orderly skyscrapers by big companies, and smarter cities.\u201d</p> <p>For Meng, the street stall business is also temporary. Beijing has not relaxed its policies towards vendors. As his partner quickly stir-fries rice noodles with egg, sauce and vegetables, he takes orders and serves up the food in small polystyrene bowls and a pair of disposable chopsticks.</p> <p>\u201cOur customers are very happy to see us. Some said they couldn\u2019t find any food even after a long walk. So it\u2019s very convenient,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Meng does not plan on doing this forever. <em>Chengguan,</em> or municipal police, have a reputation for abusing, and sometimes beating, street vendors. The fines are also steep. \u201cRunning a stall, there is no stability. Even if you are not caught today, you might get caught tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em><br></p>",
