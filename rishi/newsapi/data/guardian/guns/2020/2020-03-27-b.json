  "<h2><strong>How to keep your hair in check \u2013 Sali Hughes</strong></h2> <p>Social media is awash with professional colourists pleading with absent clients not to reach for the box dye while they\u2019re closed for business. This is partly because, like every service profession, hairdressing will take a financial beating during this crisis.</p> <p>But professionals are also genuinely worried about their clients\u2019 hair, and tell me they\u2019re bracing themselves for a plethora of complex colour correction appointments when they finally reopen. \u201cColour correction can be a long, drawn-out and expensive process,\u201d warns Luke Hersheson, my own stylist and creative director of Hershesons in London. \u201cUntil we know when salons might reopen, it\u2019s much safer to use a temporary fix, like a root touch-up spray or powder that shampoos out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He believes many women can buy a few more weeks by just changing where they part their hair. There\u2019s usually more grey at the temples, so a centre parting is a good stopgap.</p> <p>Top salon colourist Josh Wood isn\u2019t against box dyes \u2013 he even sells them under the Josh Wood Colour brand in Boots. However, the secret to a successful home dye job, he says, is in knowing your limitations. \u201cNow is not the time to transform the colour of your hair, or for tricky techniques like balayage, ombre or bleaching,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20c824ef510e89cf8af1d39d3ff5a450aecd6aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20c824ef510e89cf8af1d39d3ff5a450aecd6aff/0_34_1238_1732/715.jpg\" alt=\"Try a root disguiser to touch up your hair colour, Sali Hughes suggests.\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Try a root disguiser to touch up your hair colour, Sali Hughes suggests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Faria/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Retouching roots or toning existing colour should be the extent of your ambition as an amateur. Wood suggests applying a moisturising hair mask a couple of days before colouring, and \u201calways choosing dye in one shade lighter than you think you need from the picture\u201d, as too dark is impossible to correct. Follow the box instructions to the letter, Wood says, \u201cstarting at the greyest point \u2013 usually the front \u2013 and cover roots for twice the length of time as the lengths\u201d. He suggests enlisting your spouse or teen to do the back.</p> <p>In any case, you must always, always do a skin test in advance, according to instructions, to minimise the risk of potentially serious allergic reaction. It can be a lifesaver.</p> <p>Hersheson (whose team, like Wood\u2019s, is offering video consultations during the crisis) points out that it\u2019s worth considering whether social isolation might be a good opportunity to push through the pain barrier of transitioning to grey. \u201cIt\u2019s also a good time to grow out an unwanted fringe \u2013 you can clip it back and not worry about how that looks, and not have the stress of trimming it yourself,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Hersheson counsels against trimming your fringe, unless you\u2019re very adept. But I have trimmed dozens of fringes in extremis, and if you think you\u2019re up to the job, here\u2019s my own technique:</p> <ul> <li><p>Always start with clean, but dry hair \u2013 never, ever cut when wet or even damp. Clip back the rest of your hair, leaving the dry fringe isolated and loose.</p></li> <li><p>Comb through, and with the comb, gather the entire fringe into a single, flat, one-inch section at the very centre of your forehead.</p></li> <li><p>Clamp it between two flat fingers at the bottom of the section, approximately 1cm from the hair tips (use a plastic freezer bag clip instead, if you prefer).</p></li> <li><p>Take the sharpest scissors you own and cut up into the one-inch section of tips, naturally stopping at the fingers. Do not cut across, only upwards. When you\u2019ve snipped the entire inch-wide section, release your fingers and comb through to assess the length, snipping away any single hairs you may have missed.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>If it\u2019s still too long (always preferable to too short), repeat the process, nudging fingers up only half a centimetre at a time, before combing through and checking. </p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>How to socialise online \u2013 Elle Hunt</strong></h2> <p>Not only is it eminently possible to maintain your friendships under lockdown, talking to people other than those you live and work with is highly advisable if you are to emerge with your sanity intact. Our social lives\u2019 pivot to video just means a bit more planning.</p> <p>If it\u2019s a large group you are trying to meet with, you can gauge everyone\u2019s availability using the easy web scheduling tool <a href=\"http://www.doodle.com/create\">Doodle</a>.</p> <p>The best platform to use is probably the one the majority of people already have an account with. If everyone is using an iPhone or Apple computer, use FaceTime. WhatsApp permits video calls with up to four participants but, without calling on WhatsApp Web, ties you to your phone.</p> <p>For many, Skype is a tried and trusted classic that supports up to 50 participants \u2013 though rarely seamlessly. Otherwise, most people have a Google account, making <a href=\"http://hangouts.google.com/\">Hangouts</a> a straightforward choice.</p> <p>The video conferencing platform Zoom, which has <a href=\"https://www.ig.com/uk/news-and-trade-ideas/how-high-can-the-zoom-share-price-possibly-go--200324\">seen its shares spike since the coronavirus outbreak</a>, limits free group calls to 40 minutes \u2013 but you can always call back.</p> <p>No matter the platform , some lagging audio and frozen faces are inevitable, especially for large groups. Adding some structure \u2013 such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/the-perfect-time-to-start-how-book-clubs-are-enduring-and-flourishing-during-covid-19\">book club</a>, quiz or a table-top role-playing game such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/29/gamers-back-under-dungeons-and-dragons-spell\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> can be helpful in adjusting to an unfamiliar medium and minimising people talking over each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84dbfdb781d3ff9d039a863b9ba91d460ac9b89c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84dbfdb781d3ff9d039a863b9ba91d460ac9b89c/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Houseparty app \u2013 a conversation with eight people.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Houseparty app \u2013 a conversation with eight people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: houseparty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://houseparty.com/\">Houseparty app</a> might be geared more towards younger groups, having been a fad among kids a few years ago. But now it seems to be a royal platform of choice. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I just press a button and all my family pop up,\u201d the Duchess of Cornwall <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8157795/Duchess-Cornwall-chats-family-video-app.html\">reportedly told a friend</a>. The app can alert you when your friends are online, allowing you to effectively drop in on them. It also has in-built games, for up to eight players at a time.</p> <p>Some people have ramped up, or perhaps rediscovered, their love of gaming as a means of socialising at a distance, with popular games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Call of Duty all allowing some in-play communication. It is also possible to play board games online, such as at <a href=\"https://en.boardgamearena.com/\">Board Game Arena</a> and \u2013 for the more hardcore \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/\">Tabletop Simulator</a>.</p> <p>For a more relaxed interaction \u2013 and one that does not demand that you broadcast your face \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\">Netflix Party</a> is a Google Chrome extension that permits you to sync your streaming with friends, like a remote movie night.</p> <h2><strong>How to work from home \u2013 Elle Hunt</strong></h2> <p>Every longtime freelancer knows the secret to effective working from home: put your shoes on. It\u2019s really effective in cueing the mindset shift from \u201chome is where the couch is\u201d to \u201cproductivity ninja\u201d.</p> <p>The goal is to create a distinction, even one that is mostly symbolic, between work mode and home mode, \u2013 especially now that you cannot go anywhere else. Setting up a home office, if only a dedicated corner of your kitchen table, that you can arrive at and leave at the day\u2019s end will help (do make sure you leave).</p> <p>Your new colleagues may also take some adjusting-to. Novelist Julie Cohen<a href=\"https://twitter.com/julie_cohen/status/1243129181174669312\"> shared on Twitter</a> her top tip for working around family, care of her marriage counsellor: a literal work hat. \u201cTrain everyone (and yourself) that when you\u2019re wearing The Work Hat, they should leave you alone. (And when you\u2019re wearing it, you should only work),\u201d she tweeted. It will be a talking point on all those video-conferencing calls, too.</p> <p>Be aware that whatever is visible behind you on your webcam will be under close scrutiny from your colleagues, and inform their judgments of your home, taste and private life. Style accordingly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a93ef64cabd335d1ebda91d7947a3f5f5f719653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a93ef64cabd335d1ebda91d7947a3f5f5f719653/0_711_7216_4330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can you recreate the coffee-shop ambience to work at home?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can you recreate the coffee-shop ambience when working at home?

With the sound of teaspoons tinkling on saucers and hissing espresso machines over gentle indie music, you won\u2019t believe it\u2019s not Starbucks.</p> <p>You can even fudge together your own overly sweet frappuccino concoction. On the video platform Tik Tok, enterprising teenagers <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9581785/dalgona-coffee-recipe-tiktok-trend\">have been filming themselves</a> making \u201cdalgona\u201d coffee to replicate cafe coffee at home. It is easy to make, if high in caffeine and wasteful of milk: mix equal parts instant coffee, boiling water and sugar \u2013 about two tbsp per person \u2013 and whisk. Add more sugar to taste. Once the mixture is stiff and glossy, pour over milk and ice, stir and serve. And whisk it by hand, even if you have an electric maker.

If you already have some equipment in the house \u2013 resistance bands, a skipping rope, a mat, a multi-function Fitt Cube \u2013 you can build your own workouts around those.

If you find it hard to watch and move at the same time, choose one workout and repeat it: after a week, you\u2019ll be doing it from memory, which is good for morale. Swap it over after a fortnight, though, as there\u2019s evidence that you build fitness faster when you do things you\u2019re inept at.</p> <p>Just because there\u2019s no professional asking you whether you have any injuries does not mean you can ignore your injuries. Look up first what to avoid with an gammy knee or similar, rather than typing \u201croutines for one rubbish knee\u201d into Google.</p> <p>The single most important thing is: don\u2019t wait until you feel like it \u2013 wait long enough, and you\u2019ll never feel like it. In the words of the prophet Joe Wicks, the bit where you feel good is at the end of the workout, not the beginning.</p>",

  "<h2>I want to help. Where can I find about about volunteering?</h2> <p>There are plenty of ways to get involved. Many local charities will be keen to attract new volunteers \u2013 especially as older stalwarts are forced to stay at home. Or there are national schemes, such as NHS volunteer responders. Some bigger charities, such as <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/volunteer/\">the Trussell </a><a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/volunteer/\">Trust food bank network</a>, have set up their own online<a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/volunteer/\"> </a>schemes to match volunteers with food banks in their area. <a href=\"https://www.ncvo.org.uk/ncvo-volunteering/find-a-volunteer-centre\">Local volunteer centres</a> and organisations such as <a href=\"https://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/want-to-volunteer/\">Volunteering Matters</a> and <a href=\"https://do-it.org/\">Do-it</a> can link you up with charities close to where you live. <a href=\"https://reachvolunteering.org.uk/\">Reach Volunteering</a> will match people with specialist professional skills, such IT expertise, to charities who need their help. Volunteers in Scotland have options signposted from the <a href=\"https://www.readyscotland.org/coronavirus/volunteering\">Ready Scotland </a>website: people who want to support public services, including the NHS, are directed to a site co-ordinated by the <a href=\"https://reserves.redcross.org.uk/\">British Red Cross</a>; for more general volunteer roles with charities and community groups, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://search.volunteerscotland.net/coronavirus/\">Volunteer Scotland</a>.

Volunteers in Scotland can find out information from a site co-ordinated by the <a href=\"https://reserves.redcross.org.uk/\">British Red Cross</a>.</p> <h2><strong>I\u2019ve got work and family duties</strong><strong>, but </strong><strong>keen to get involved. How can I help?</strong></h2> <p>Keeping an eye out for neighbours and family members is the simplest way to help people who are vulnerable, lonely, self-isolating or busy key workers. Help could mean anything from running errands to the shops to providing a friendly voice of reassurance and support. <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">Covid-19 Mutual Aid</a> was set up to co-ordinate \u201cgood neighbour\u201d initiatives and has lists of local groups in your area, together with details of how to help people safely.</p> <h2><strong>Am I allowed to volunteer under the </strong><strong>\u2018stay at home</strong><strong>\u2019 </strong><strong>rules?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. According to <a href=\"https://blogs.ncvo.org.uk/2020/03/26/are-volunteers-on-lockdown/\">Shaun Delaney of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations</a>, exceptions to the guidance include people needing to travel to provide care to others. \u201cIn other words, people can go out to volunteer if they are providing help to vulnerable people or if their volunteering cannot be done from home.\u201d If you are deemed high risk \u2013 you are aged over 70 or have underlying health issues \u2013 there are volunteering opportunities that you can do by phone or computer from home.</p> <h2><strong>Is volunteering safe?</strong></h2> <p>Be sensible and vigilant. If you are helping out neighbours, please remember physical distancing rules: try to communicate by phone or text; don\u2019t enter people\u2019s houses and always stay at least two metres away. Look after yourself, don\u2019t go on an errand for a neighbour if you are ill or self-isolating. Wash your hands regularly.</p> <h2><strong>What if </strong><strong>volunteering </strong><strong>involves face-to-face contact?</strong></h2> <p>There are inescapable health risks from face-to-face volunteering and no guarantees that you will have adequate personal protective equipment. For this reason many voluntary projects, such as community kitchens and day centres, have shut down services. However, others are adapting to try to minimise the risks of infection through physical contact or close proximity. Some face-to-face befriending services, for example, have been replaced by phone or online alternatives.</p> <h2><strong>Will donating money to charities help?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. Charities both small and large have been devastated by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/charities-face-cash-crisis-as-virus-fears-hit-fundraising\">sudden drop </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/charities-face-cash-crisis-as-virus-fears-hit-fundraising\">in voluntary income </a>caused by the cancellation or postponement of fundraising gatherings, ranging from fetes and coffee mornings to the London marathon. Those with high street retail outlets have also been hit by shop closures. UK charities estimate they will lose over \u00a34bn over the next few weeks. Without cash, thousands of charities, including hospices, health and social care, and cancer support charities will be forced to reduce services, or in some cases even close down.</p> <h2><strong>Where should I donate to help the coronavirus support effort?</strong></h2> <p>The immediate focus is on charities that can provide emergency frontline support to vulnerable people affected by the social impact of coronavirus, including food banks and care organisations helping older, isolated and disabled people and their families. There are more than 14 million people living <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/26/uk-faces-child-poverty-crisis-charities-warn\">on the breadline</a> in the UK, and they will be badly hit by the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Other organisations that need help include those providing welfare advice and emotional and respite support.</p> <h2><strong>How can I ensure my money is getting to the frontline?</strong></h2> <p>One of the safest ways of giving is to donate to the <a href=\"https://nationalemergenciestrust.org.uk/coronavirus/\">National Emergencies Trust</a>. This charity is co-ordinating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/uk-national-disaster-relief-fund-launched-to-help-most-vulnerable\">UK coronavirus disaster voluntary relief effort</a>, providing a single online portal for donations from individuals and companies.

We\u2019ve been talking among ourselves about the things some women will be experiencing as a result of this as bad actors and abusers take advantage of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Bentley, the national chair of Wesnet, the national peak body for domestic and family violence services, says what is needed is a coordinated national response.</p> <p>With face-to-face contact no longer possible, most communication will take place over the internet, by phone, or through police intervention. This raises questions about what will happen if a woman needs to leave home suddenly, or cannot find crisis accommodation quickly.</p> <p>Hayley Foster, CEO of Women\u2019s Safety NSW, says that at least within her own state, police handling of domestic violence cases may have improved greatly in recent times but under the pressure of a lockdown, how they handle interactions will be critical. Without specialised oversight from trained officers, it is possible first responders may make the wrong call, at the wrong moment.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to heavily rely on a police response,\u201d Foster says. \u201cThere was also a significant concern raised in the web conference today about the emergency measures in NSW which will see prisoners being granted bail early.</p> <p>\u201cDomestic violence services haven\u2019t been consulted and we need to know more so we can help assess the risk to public safety in releasing certain DV offenders while also keeping the victims informed of his release.\u201d</p> <p>The other question is one of funding. Dr Merrindahl Andrew from the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance says a spike in demand during extraordinary circumstances will test service providers as they are pushed to their limits.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the problem is all of the funding gaps that existed before the pandemic. Those cracks will be wider now. They are cracks that people will be falling through with even more damaging results because of the pandemic,\u201d Andrew says.</p> <p>One such example is the discontinuation of the Telstra Safe Phone program administered by Wesnet and funded by the Department of Social Services. The department has been contacted for comment but has not responded by deadline.</p> <p>The program which offers women safe, unmonitored phones will now be discontinued as of 1 July this year after funding cuts \u2013 even though it has never been more in demand.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got agencies ringing us, they\u2019re trying to get more phones,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cWe\u2019ve even had an increase in the number of women contacting us directly trying to get hold of phones.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter to senators Maurice Payne, Anne Ruston and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday, the Queensland senator Larissa Waters backed calls from the family violence sector for more funding to restore services like the Safe Phone program, dedicated crisis accommodation, specialised police services and a national awareness campaign.</p> <p>\u201cServices are reporting that the expected increase in violence is now a reality. Additional funding and support for frontline services is essential to keep women and children safe in the coming months,\u201d she said in the letter.</p> <p>Such additions would make a world of difference for vulnerable women and children facing the prospect of being forced to stay inside with an abusive partner.</p> <p>Within New South Wales, Foster says the information her organisation collects from frontline staff may not show an uptick in crisis calls yet, but they are seeing a growing number of inquiries from vulnerable women making preparations ahead of an lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cAs of yesterday we have 40 per cent of our services saying they\u2019re seeing the first cases [relating to Covid-19[ coming through but they\u2019re also saying there\u2019s a lot more complexity to cases,\u201d Foster says.</p> <p>\u201cSo the issues now are how we are going to find housing for people in a lockdown?

  "<p>Everything is connected. It\u2019s hard to imagine right now that, just weeks ago, the truism of ecological politics was treated as hippy nonsense by mainstream politics.</p> <p>Announcing the <a href=\"https://epbcactreview.environment.gov.au/\">statutory review</a> of the commonwealth\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) last October, the Morrison government pitched it as an opportunity to weaken the Howard era laws even further and make it easier still for environmentally destructive projects to be approved.

In the age of consequences, with the climate crisis and a deadly pandemic bearing down on us, it\u2019s impossible to pretend that we are separate from each other and from the natural world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/the-forest-is-now-terribly-silent-land-set-aside-for-threatened-species-entirely-burnt-out\">'The forest is now terribly silent': land set aside for threatened species entirely burnt out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A pandemic, more than almost any other phenomenon, shows that all our lives are inextricably intertwined, for now and forever, whether we like it or not. It brings into sharp focus the impossibility of trying to keep economics, health, environment, education and social justice treated as separate questions with separate answers. It heightens awareness of our vital need, as social beings, to stay connected to each other as well as we possibly can while keeping our physical distance.</p> <p>It shows how the \u201cefficient\u201d, on-demand world that capitalism has constructed is so incredibly fragile that a series of shocks can bring it to the point of collapse. And with the rules of neoliberal economics being broken by governments the world over, it demonstrates that massive policy interventions, shifting the entire structure of the global economy, are possible.</p> <p>With the complete focus right now on Covid-19, it takes an effort to cast our minds back to this summer\u2019s bushfires. They were, of course, far larger and fiercer than ever before, over a season that started when we were barely out of winter. Where previously bushfires had affected a small number of people, this season the smoke blanketing Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and the repeated evacuation of summer holiday spots, meant that <a href=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/three-quarters-of-aussies-impacted-by-angry-summer-bushfires\">most Australians</a> were affected.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Covid-19, among other things, shows us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This heralded a shift in thinking that went deeper than personal impact. Perhaps due to the remarkably low loss of human life compared with the scale of the disaster, there was a tremendous focus on the more than a billion mammals, birds and reptiles killed. We mourned the thousands of koalas and the numerous species being pushed towards extinction if their habitats aren\u2019t restored.</p> <p>The true legacy of this summer could be a vital turning point in recognising that \u201cthe environment\u201d isn\u2019t something \u201cover there\u201d. The environment is the air we breathe and the water we drink; it\u2019s the soil in which we grow our food; it\u2019s the animals we identify with and the landscapes imprinted on our souls; the environment is us, all of us, together, integrally connected with everyone and everything else on this beautiful blue marble floating in space.</p> <p>Damage the environment and we damage ourselves. And not just some of us \u2013 all of us together. Continue to think in our compartmentalised, linear fashion, and we\u2019ll keep missing what\u2019s coming, be it weeks of smoke, runs on toilet paper, or deadly pandemics.</p> <p>What started to become clear thanks to the fires was rammed home by Covid-19. We are only as healthy as the least healthy among us. Everything we do relies on extraordinary networks of activity by people we\u2019ve never met, crisscrossing the globe. And responding to a health crisis that was likely <a href=\"https://ensia.com/features/covid-19-coronavirus-biodiversity-planetary-health-zoonoses/\">triggered in part by environmental destruction</a> has world-changing impacts on the economy, on education, on social justice, on geopolitics.</p> <p>The age of disconnection is over.</p> <p>To bring us back to where we started, where does that leave the review of the EPBC Act?</p> <p>We have an opportunity now to not just push for a new generation of environment laws, but to re-evaluate the whole deal, to cultivate a new political settlement based on ecological principles of living well together in harmony with the natural world, understanding our place as part of it as First Peoples did for millenniums, with an economy designed to serve people and planet.</p> <p>As part of this, in the immediate term we need to advocate for vital improvements to the EPBC. It is extraordinary that the Howard legacy of deliberately excluding a project\u2019s climate impacts from the triggers to require assessment still hasn\u2019t been remedied. That must now be fixed, as must the fact that there is no mechanism for assessing the cumulative ecological impacts of various proposals. After this summer\u2019s destruction of huge areas of remaining healthy ecosystems, we need to institute, in both legislation and the practice of assessment, a presumption of protection instead of a culture of managed destruction.</p> <p>All this will, of course, be attacked as \u201cgreen tape\u201d and we have to be ready to actively defend it instead of changing the subject \u2013 and defend it on ecological grounds. Regulation is a vital part of the connective tissue which holds the body politic together. Removing it sees us fall apart. Covid-19 is, among other things, showing us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more.</p> <p>Having that conversation in this way means we won\u2019t just be advocating for marginal improvements, but will be working to change politics. We\u2019ll be building into the political common sense the idea that corporations absolutely should be regulated to enforce environmental and social responsibilities, and that we can no longer consider shareholder profit to be their sole focus. That helps move our politics towards altering the DNA of corporations so they operate as part of the body politic rather than as cancer cells.</p> <p>The flip side of this systemic shift is to institute legal rights for the natural world. If BHP has legal rights, why shouldn\u2019t the Great Barrier Reef? Rights of nature is an increasingly mature legal field, instituted from New Zealand to Bolivia, India to parts of the US. We can and should at least insert them as a normative principle in the goals of the EPBC.</p> <p>While we\u2019re thinking at that level, a new ecological political settlement will need a rethink of federalism. Our system sees national and state governments cooperating to shut out community participation and scientific advice to facilitate destructive development. An effective regime based on a presumption of protection would see federal, state, territory and local governments enabling communities to collectively develop creative ideas at their local level, within the context of expert scientific advice, and coordinating those ideas at a regional and continental level.</p> <p>If we shift environmental regulation from a process that is primarily responsive to demands of developers into a proactive, constructive, community-led system, we can see it morph from a defensive protection stance into one of active restoration, repair and regeneration. It can lead to the greening of cities and towns as we embrace the fact that habitats are not just \u201cover there\u201d but among us. It can create industrial jobs in coalmine rehabilitation. It can support regenerative agriculture, and cooperative sharing of scarce water. It can even open space for community-led conversations about relocation as the overheating world retreats from rising seas and inland desertification is inevitable.</p> <p>Supporting and enabling communities to make decisions is also vital for rebuilding confidence in democracy, which has collapsed in recent years. The ongoing panic-buying response to Covid-19 suggests that the abject failure of government to provide leadership through the fires worsened this further. This is now an opportunity to rethink governance, reclaim agency for communities, build practices of trust and social cohesion, embedded in respect for expert advice.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s important to recognise that with this government we\u2019re not going to get these kinds of changes. At best we might hold off the push to weaken the EPBC even further. But that shouldn\u2019t stop us advocating for what we need. Quite the opposite.</p> <p>Politics, like the natural world it operates within, is a system. It works in complex ways because all it is is the collected actions of humans, influenced by each other and by external impetuses such as the weather. Or viruses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nature-is-sending-us-a-message-says-un-environment-chief\">Coronavirus: 'Nature is sending us a message\u2019, says UN environment chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Donella Meadows, the modern mother of systems thinking, wrote that the most <a href=\"http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Leverage_Points.pdf\">effective leverage point</a> to change a system is \u201cthe mindset or paradigm out of which the system ... arises\u201d.

  "<p>Australia is facing an unprecedented crisis and our main act of social responsibility right now is to practise physical distancing, which can feel passive. Where we might have usually put our hands up to lend a hand, or taken to the streets in protest , we\u2019re now finding ourselves at home, sometimes alone. But there are still ways to give our time, money or support to others. We\u2019re home but we\u2019re not helpless.</p> \n<p>\u201cAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/publications/2019-publications/caf-world-giving-index-10th-edition\">World Giving Index</a>, which looks at 10 years of data, Australia is the fourth most generous country in the world.

What you can do is identify a charity either because it\u2019s been impacted by the crisis, or a charity that has had increased demand.\u201d Donate money if you can. If you can\u2019t, here are eight more ways you can support others right now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for <em>Coronavirus: Australia at a glance</em>, our daily email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Be a voice of comfort</strong></h2> \n<p>Another insight from the World Giving Index is that 64% of Australians said they\u2019d help a stranger \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing more people reaching out beyond their homes to help others.

Blood donor centres are open and blood is needed for transfusions, cancer patients, car accidents and to replace blood lost during birth. Check your eligibility in this <a href=\"https://www.donateblood.com.au/eligibility#can-i-give-blood\">online tool</a>. Donation centres are also undergoing <a href=\"https://www.donateblood.com.au/page/coronavirus-update\">further sanitation protocols</a>, including social distancing, restricting non-donating visitors and introducing a 28-day donation postponement for any donors returning from overseas.</p> \n<h2><strong>Adopt a healthcare worker</strong></h2> \n<p>Another vital out-of-home service is healthcare \u2013 but you don\u2019t need to step a foot out of the door to help out.

The Western Australia page now has 43,000 members and there is a separate page for every state and territory, as well as pages for Canada, New Zealand, the US and the UK. It\u2019s not a space for medical advice, memes or politics, say the page\u2019s admins (a team of 59 people around the world).</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the interactions go from let\u2019s bake things or take coffee to people organising share-houses, for example, if a healthcare worker is living with someone who is in a high-risk category,\u201d says Nicholas, who is now in isolation. \u201cI think it\u2019s resonated with people because everyday people can get behind it.

Office workers have been ordering its jars of densely packed salads for years, and now that your home is your office you can stock up on a lunchtime feed and throw in some beauty products \u2013 all in the knowledge that someone else will receive the same. Delivery is $15, or free if you\u2019re ordering 10 or more meals.</p> \n<h2><strong>Raid the cupboard</strong></h2> \n<p>Suffering buyer\u2019s remorse over that extra packet of cereal, instant noodles, sanitary towels or toothpaste? There are food banks still accepting donations of unopened and in-date pantry foods including cooking oil, condiments, dry goods, tinned food, long-life milk and instant coffee. The Asylum Seekers Centre has limited operations at its centre in Sydney\u2019s inner west and it is not open for people to visit, but its chief executive, Frances Rush, is still calling for cash donations on its website and <a href=\"https://asylumseekerscentre.org.au/food-and-toiletry-donations/\">food and toiletry donations</a> where possible. The <a href=\"https://www.asrc.org.au/get-involved/donate-food-and-goods/#WaysToDonate\">Asylum Seeker Resource Centre</a> in Footscray is asking for donations to be dropped at collection points, or at the rear of its building, to limit human contact. There is also a <a href=\"https://action.asrc.org.au/covid_19_petition\">petition</a> to introduce government measures to support people seeking asylum in Australia right now.

Community members are also sharing the Viral Kindness postcard, created by a UK resident, Becky Wass, <a href=\"http://neighbourday.org/resources/connection-cards/\">available to download and print here</a>. \u201cPeople who might need help the most, might not be on Facebook or not have access to these groups,\u201d she says.

In the six years since Nic Marchesi and Lucas Patchett set up Orange Sky they\u2019ve provided 142,395 loads of washing and 14,594 warm showers to people living on the streets. In light of the government\u2019s advice, they\u2019ve paused operations in 26 locations across the country, except in remote locations. Training for new volunteers is on hold until April, but once up and running they\u2019ve said they\u2019ll need volunteers more than ever. While you\u2019re at home, consider the charities that are making tough decisions and, if you can\u2019t donate cash, make a commitment to volunteer once it\u2019s possible to do so.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"563c8b83-a2cc-4802-94d7-b888927c9424\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-58sfrZy_Eo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have other suggestions for how to help during the Covid-19 crisis?

  "<h2><strong>How you can help</strong></h2> \n<p>Anywhere but Westminster\u2019s new video series is moving on to its second instalment. We\u2019re working from home, and collecting video people are sending us from around the country. It\u2019s giving us a sense of how they are being affected, and the ways individuals and communities are coming together to help each other. Massive thanks for all the footage that\u2019s been sent in so far, it\u2019s great, and keep it coming: anything that is inspiring, or made you laugh, or any idea you think could be copied elsewhere.</p> \n<p>For episode two we also want to focus on work, and what the Covid-19 outbreak has done to it. Are you in precarious work? Is what you\u2019re doing suddenly difficult and dangerous? Have you lost your job, and are trying to navigate universal credit? Are you self-employed, and waiting for payments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-uk-offers-self-employed-80-of-earnings\">just announced</a> by the government that may not materialise for more than a month? We want to hear from you.</p> \n<h2><strong>How to shoot a video</strong></h2> \n<p>If you fancy shooting video, it\u2019s hugely important that you observe the physical distancing rules. Record a video diary of what\u2019s happening to you, but also turn your phone or camera the other way round, and give us a sense of your immediate surroundings. Any flavour of people\u2019s working lives is great: what they\u2019re having to do, things that are now challenging, their journey to and from their job.</p> \n<p>Shoot landscape rather than portrait. If you can send us video, you can email it or use an FTP service, such as WeTransfer. If there are things we should know about, maybe for future episodes, send us an email. Thanks again for everyone\u2019s work and help. We\u2019re thrilled that the idea is working.</p> \n<h2><strong>How to get in touch with us</strong></h2> \n<p>If you want to send a video now, <strong>you can email us at anywhere.but.westminster@the guardian.com </strong>but if you want to get in touch with us then please share your details in our encrypted form below.

For other admissions into hospitals with those conditions, we test routinely. Also in some other specific areas where people are at high risk, like care homes.</p> \n  <p>The basis for this is you must have clinical symptoms.

We are all at risk and that is why it is so important that we all practise social distancing measures. </p> \n  <p><strong>Stevens</strong> says NHS England wants urgent cancer treatments to continue but specialists should have the opportunity to decide whether it is more risky to embark on treatment at this particular time given that you are more vulnerable to infection if you begin a course of treatment and become immuno-compromised as a result.

  "<p>The motor industry has been accused by campaigners of trying to use the coronavirus crisis to avert stricter environmental regulation, after correspondence showed carmakers had lobbied the EU to defer impending laws.</p> <p>The European carmakers\u2019 association, ACEA, and other groups representing the supply chain called on the EU to delay implementing regulations because the pandemic had affected its \u201cplans to comply\u201d. Laws due to come into effect include tougher targets on vehicle CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p> <p>In a letter to the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the groups said production and sales of cars had stalled in many countries and companies were facing a cash crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-big-drop-air-pollution\">Coronavirus UK lockdown causes big drop in air pollution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While appealing for more financial aid to maintain liquidity, the ACEA said activities such as development and testing would inevitably suffer, which \u201cupsets the plans we had made to prepare ourselves for complying with existing and future EU laws and regulations within the applicable deadlines\u201d.</p> <p>It said: \u201cWe believe therefore that some adjustment would need to be made to the timing of these laws. Please be assured, however, that it is not our intention to question the laws as such nor the underlying objectives of road safety, climate change mitigation and protection of the environment.\u201d</p> <p>European laws on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of new vehicles have applied since 2015 and a further tightening of the rules is due in January 2021. Manufacturers could potentially face huge fines for non-compliance, although the targets have pushed production towards less polluting cars.</p> <p>Campaigners described the call as shameless. <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace UK</a>\u2019s executive director, John Sauven, said: \u201cMany industries are facing difficulties during this challenging period that require governments and corporations to protect their workers. But it would be a mistake to use this crisis as a reason to roll back on environmental regulations. One, it won\u2019t suddenly restart car sales, and two, tackling one crisis can\u2019t be done at the expense of another one.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicle director at Transport and Environment, said: \u201cThe priority now is to ensure the health, safety and job security of the workers affected by the current factory closures. While the overall economic recovery is crucial, we shouldn\u2019t let some opportunistic carmakers use the crisis to shamelessly roll back the EU climate targets for cars. Selling less cars won\u2019t impact compliance with the law. What matters is the type of car you sell.\u201d</p> <p>The big German carmakers Daimler, VW and BMW have already indicated they are aiming to comply with the new CO<sub>2</sub> targets regardless of the current situation.</p> <p>The ACEA director general, Eric-Mark Huitema, said the industry was not questioning any specific laws or the underlying objectives of tackling the climate emergency. He said: \u201cThe primary concern of ACEA and all its members right now is to manage the immediate crisis facing the auto industry, which has essentially come to an abrupt halt \u2013 something the sector has never experienced before.</p> <p>\u201cIn this emergency context, it has not yet been possible to undertake a detailed analysis of the implications of this crisis on legislation affecting our industry. [But] there will inevitably be consequences in this domain.\u201d</p> <p>The European commission said it would respond to the letter from the car manufacturers in due course.</p> <p>However, the commission made it clear that the European green deal, announced last December and the flagship policy of von der Leyen, would continue. The green deal will encompass all aspects of European industry, transport and environmental regulation, and require steep emissions reductions to meet the intended bloc-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe commission is determined to use all the policy tools at its disposal to help protect citizens and mitigate the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s severely negative socioeconomic consequences. We must also ensure that the recovery is as sustainable as possible \u2013 both economically and environmentally.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the UK-based Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \u201cManufacturers are committed to meeting all necessary safety and environmental regulations, but we cannot forecast how this crisis will unfold or what new requirements may be needed.\u201d</p> <p>As governments prepare rescue packages for industry and stimulus packages amounting to trillions around the world, some experts are concerned that emergency stimulus money will prop up fossil fuel companies, and are calling for the spending to come with conditions attached to ensure companies must pursue a greener path.</p> <p>However, the coronavirus crisis has led to calls from some quarters to weaken environmental regulations and ignore CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets.

At halfway he was on course to break Eide\u2019s world record. Then, sure enough, the weather turned, the wind howling at him from the pole with a chill factor of -45 degrees. By the time he finished, he had lost 14.5kg.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m genuinely at peace with it,\u201d he says of the knowledge the speed record seems out of reach in the current climate. \u201cThere are some things I can\u2019t control.

It may be for most of us, but not for epidemiologists, for whom this pandemic is not outside the range of expectation.

I\u2019ve published peer-reviewed papers on modelling disease epidemics with data, and am aware of the limitations of my knowledge in the current situation.

It\u2019s disgusting what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re taking.\u201d</p> \n<p>Packham said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel sorry for the contractors and the police. The police don\u2019t need to be out in the woods at a time of national crisis. They are being put in a position where their safety is being compromised because of political aims and it\u2019s disgusting for the government to treat the police in that way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Greg Smith, the MP for Buckingham, said: \u201cIn this time of national emergency, where it is paramount that people stay at home unless absolutely unavoidable, it is outrageous that HS2 Ltd are carrying on with works that are simply not urgent.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said people in villages in his constituency were frightened by the influx of HS2 contractors from all over the country \u201cpotentially spreading the virus\u201d.</p> \n<p>Smith was sent a video of an HS2 contractor appearing to deliberately cough on a resident to make them move. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a real cough or he was putting it on to frighten them, it is subhuman behaviour at this time of medical crisis where the government is trying to do everything possible to stop the spread of this virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a statement responding to the coughing allegation, the HS2 contractor Fusion JV said it had now paused work at that site. \u201cWe are aware of the video which was filmed prior to the shutdown and investigating the circumstances. The health and safety of our staff and community are our top priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>HS2 responded to the concerns raise by Smith by releasing a statement pledging to pause work on a number of sites. However, in footage taken by campaigners at some locations since that statement, work appears to be continuing. HS2 told the Guardian: \u201cThere may be some short-term work that needs to be carried out at some sites in order to ensure they are in a safe position to pause works\u201d.</p> \n<p>An HS2 spokesperson also said: \u201cThe health and safety on the site is the responsibility of the individual contractors. We\u2019ve been clear that they need to follow government advice, and so far most of our contractors have decided that they cannot continue work in line with that advice. Some sites in the West Midlands are still operational because we have been assured that the kinds of works they are doing are limited in scale and they can reasonably continue within the social-distancing rules. But that is under constant review by them and may well change in the near future.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t instructed construction sites to close down. We\u2019re a government-funded and government-directed project and we have not had that direction from government. Even within the last couple of days, we\u2019ve had government ministers saying construction sites can remain open. We can\u2019t start making up new rules.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThe construction industry has not been asked by the government to stop. HS2 Ltd is reviewing the majority of works on its construction sites in line with government guidance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Laing O\u2019Rourke and J Murphy &amp; Sons, the contractors overseeing the Warwickshire sites, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>Packham said: \u201c[HS2\u2019s] cost on the ground to rare wildlife, endangered habitats and important green spaces is profound. The carbon cost is unacceptable and fundamentally incompatible with our necessary net zero obligations.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe cost to the public purse, which is about to rupture due to the current catastrophe, both human and economic, is absurd. We must stop HS2 as soon as possible \u2013 for all life on Earth.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2020 in three respects: because an earlier version was incorrect to say that activists had constructed treehouses in five woods \u2013 that occurred in Crackley Woods only; to clarify that the statement released by HS2 pledging to pause works on a number of sites was in response to Greg Smith MP, and to add a direct response on that issue which HS2 provided to the Guardian.</p>",

But these days, the firm is actually focused on airports -- handling cargo on the ground, managing luggage at several UK airports, and even operating plane fuelling services.</p> <p>It had employed over 30,000 people, but revealed today that it has reduced global headcount by over 17,500 worldwide in response to the \u201cdramatic fall\u201d in business.</p> <p>Menzies warns:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the period since 10 March 2020, we have seen our international and domestic airline customers ground passenger flights on an unprecedented scale. </p> </blockquote> <p>That includes a 60% drop in passenger flights, and a 20% deduction in cargo flights.</p> <p>It explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As part of our cost reduction initiatives, we have reduced global headcount by over 17,500 in response to the dramatic fall in volume. Reductions are being supported in some countries by governmental schemes and we hope that in the fullness of time a high number of these employees can return to the business. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Update: The good news is that these 17,500 aren\u2019t all sacked. Menzies says the vast majority on different types of leave and with a small portion through permanent role reductions. </strong></p> <p>Menzies board are also taking a 20% pay cut.</p> <p>Curiously, Menzies doesn\u2019t seem to qualify for some of the rescue measures launched by the UK government. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We are engaged with the UK Government as we attempt to secure some of the emergency funding announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and await the refinement of the eligibility criteria for the COVID Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) which we currently do not currently qualify for.</p> </blockquote> <p>CCFF is designed to help UK companies, by buying their short-term debt, as long as it is investment-grade. Unfortunately for Menzies, they\u2019re too small to <strong>have </strong>a credit rating -- but also too big to qualify for measures aimed at small firms....</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T13:03:16.360Z\">at 1.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e7dcc3c8f0878a2a48ab42b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T09:59:05.340Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Outsourcing group Capita has just withdrawn its financial guidance for the year, due to the \u201cunpredictable level of disruption caused by COVID-19\u201d.</strong></p> <p>While Capita\u2019s essential workers in the public sector are busy, the rest of its business has been hit by self-isolation rules.

  "<p>Cabinet government had for most of this week already been replaced by Zoom government, but the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson has contracted coronavirus</a>, and so been forced to self-distance himself from the nation that he rules, raises awkward questions about how the government control room will operate at probably its most testing moment.</p> \n<p>No 10 has offered the reassurance that Johnson, rather than his deputy, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will if possible remain in charge, making the vital decisions in physical isolation in his flat in No 11 for the next week, connected to colleagues only by technology. If so, it brings a new meaning to the oft-repeated dictum that it is lonely at the top.</p> \n<p>The promise that Johnson will remain in charge may be true, or just a holding operation designed to portray an air of serenity in these most abnormal and panicky times. This is an illness that can knock the fittest figure sideways, so it is too early to say how far he will be driven into his bunker. </p> \n<p>Johnson is also someone who thrives in direct personal contact with others, cheering up a room and instinctively reading the mood of the meeting or the audience before coming to a view. It is said he does his boxes, but values a discussion more.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the political leader as recluse is something other countries have absorbed. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/justin-trudeau-coronavirus-sophie-trudeau-canada\">has been in isolation for a week</a> after his wife, Sophie, contracted the virus, leaving him in sole charge of three children and a country bordering Donald Trump. He works from his study and ventures out each day on to the doorstep of his home to hold a press conference. No one else enters except for a single technician with rubber gloves to fix up a G7 Zoom conference. No red boxes, but a box of Lego has been delivered. His children, his aides say, have occasionally been told to shush because \u201cDaddy is on an important call right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>But in Canada, it was only the prime minister\u2019s wife who was incapacitated. In the UK, the virus has hit the bullseye.</p> \n<p>The civil service has experience of working its way round vacuums in power, and Johnson is not the first British leader to be incapacitated in government. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/20/labour.politics\">Tony Blair needed time off for a heart operation</a>, prompting Lord Levy\u2019s wife, Gild, to send him chicken soup, and Clement Attlee\u2019s knee joints became so rickety he could not broach stairs.</p> \n<p>While the Suez crisis cannot be blamed solely on a high fever, Anthony Eden, suffering from an infection of the liver ducts due to a botched operation, became excessively reliant on amphetamines during the autumn of 1956, which might go some way towards explaining his series of miscalculations. Theresa May struggled with diabetes as well as Brexit. Harold Wilson resigned prematurely, sensing that mental exhaustion had overtaken him.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s own great hero, Winston Churchill, suffered two serious illnesses during the second world war, first in February 1943 and then in August 1944. On the first occasion, after an eight-and-a-half-hour flight from Algiers, he came down with a cold and sore throat. It took two doctors \u2013 his personal physician, Sir Charles Wilson, and Geoffrey Marshall, a physician at Guy\u2019s hospital \u2013 to persuade him of the seriousness of his illness. </p> \n<p>Churchill spent a fortnight battling with doctors, nurses and civil servants to ensure that they sent him a steady supply of decisions to make. Even as far away as the US, he developed a reputation as \u201cthe world\u2019s worst patient\u201d.</p> \n<p>On the second occasion, he contracted pneumonia at the age of 70, an illness so potentially serious that his condition was never made public. Again, the supply of papers to his bedroom was curtailed, with only the most critical allowed to enter his chamber. At times Churchill flew into a rage when he realised how much was being held back from him.</p> \n<p>Johnson, unlike some of his aides, probably does not seek to monopolise power and has not been in office long enough to have adopted a definitive governing style. The outbreak of the virus had prompted a reorganisation of his administration in which he was at the apex. Four subcommittees reported to him, marking a formal centralisation of power in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. So his absence will be felt.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the other hand, the ship of state\u2019s broad course has now been set after an initial fortnight of confusion. No matter how hard the headwinds, no great adjustment is planned, so it is not the worst moment for the captain to be forced below deck.</p> \n<p>Two great qualities will be demanded in the next fortnight. The first is a tireless focus on implementing the decisions taken, the remorseless grind of following through and making sure the Whitehall machine delivers. Any minister at the heart of the response to the financial crash in 2008 will recall the sensation of pulling a policy lever in Whitehall, only to realise the lever was entirely disconnected from the real world.</p> \n<p>Decisions taken and announced are not decisions implemented. Johnson\u2019s forte is not in enforcement, so he will not be missed in that department. The Treasury, Work and Pensions, Revenue &amp; Customs and health and business are the lead ministries.</p> \n<p>But if Johnson is truly forced to leave the scene for more than a week, and the national death toll mounts, he will be missed as the person to reassure the nation that recovery is in sight. David Cameron described it as \u201cthe sunny uplands\u201d passage of a speech. It is not a speech that can be delivered from a sickbed.</p>",
  "<p>Pity the people of America. They do battle now with one of the greatest challenges in their history, led by a man who is not only among the worst ever occupants of the White House but whose character makes him the last person on the face of the Earth you would nominate to be in charge at this moment. On Thursday the US reached the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump\">top of the global league table for coronavirus infections</a>, edging ahead of its closest rival for that honour, China. No law of nature dictated that outcome. Much of it is directly attributable to one dreadful fact: that Donald Trump is president of the United States.</p> <p>It\u2019s become a commonplace to note Trump\u2019s lack of basic human empathy, his tendency to be <a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2020/03/06/trump-fails-to-offer-any-sympathy-after-being-told-that-a-young-boys-whole-family-had-been-killed\">unmoved by others\u2019 loss</a>. But that gap in his mindset matters now far beyond an inability to offer consolation to the bereaved: it is warping his approach to a lethal disease.</p> <p>\u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593\">he tweeted</a> in caps lock at the start of the week, shortly after Steve Hilton, one-time adviser to David Cameron, had made that same argument on his Fox News show. (If you look up the word \u201cchutzpah\u201d in the dictionary, it now directs you to a clip of Hilton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aljwhite/status/1241991593806217216\">warning on that same broadcast</a> that austerity policies in the UK caused an extra 130,000 deaths \u2013 failing to mention that he was at the right hand of the prime minister who imposed that austerity.) </p> <p>Trump and his outriders contend that, while mass death is not ideal, it\u2019s better than allowing the US economy to stall. Some, like Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, are explicit, urging the elderly to risk their lives so that their grandchildren might enjoy the fruits of uninterrupted American capitalism. \u201cIf that\u2019s the exchange, I\u2019m all in,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-texas-patrick-abbott.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes\">Patrick said</a>. He was taking his cue from Trump who, while not putting it quite as baldly, has been quite clear. If coronavirus is a stick-up artist asking America, \u201cYour money or your life\u201d, Trump\u2019s response has been: \u201cTake the lives of the old and the weak: I want the money.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An imbecile at the head of the US government would always be a problem. But this is a calamity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, no such choice is available. Even if Trump were to get his way, ditching social distancing and having the US open for business by Easter, the disease would not politely confine its appetite to the groups Trump has deemed dispensable. Instead the virus would run rampant, infecting an estimated half the population. Not that Trump would know or recognise that, thanks to a second character trait that, like the void where his sense of compassion should be, is so fatefully, and fatally, determining the US response to this pandemic: namely, his disregard for science.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just my hunch,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/5/21166031/trump-hannity-coronavirus-who-death-rate\">he said</a> as he dismissed a projection of the likely Covid-19 death rate by the World Health Organization as \u201ca false number\u201d. On Thursday, he said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trump-coronavirus-ventilators-new-york-state_n_5e7d651cc5b6256a7a27c911?ri18n=true&amp;ncid=engmodushpmg00000004\">I have a feeling</a>\u201d that New York would need far fewer ventilators than the tens of thousands the state has requested. \u201cYou know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they\u2019ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re saying can we order 30,000 ventilators?\u201d An imbecile at the head of the US government would always be a problem. But an imbecile so narcissistic that he elevates his own stunted knowledge above the judgment of medicine and science is a calamity.</p> <p>The effect is to undermine whatever public health effort the professionals can mount, as they try to work around the man they serve. At its most visual, it\u2019s the daily press briefing where Trump fails to observe the social distancing measures his administration is demanding of the American public, with himself standing at the centre of a cluster of speakers bunched together by the podium. Note the initial insistence that corona was nothing to worry about, that it was no more than flu, that it would soon disappear, like a \u201cmiracle\u201d. All of that succeeded in lowering Americans\u2019 guard.</p> <p>Since then, it\u2019s been the daily grouching at the stay-at-home directives, the hint that they\u2019ll be relaxed soon, the absurd promises that a vaccine is \u201cvery close\u201d. The impact is plain to see, in data that confirms that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-public-opinion.html\">Americans break down on partisan lines</a> even over the most basic matters of mortality. One in four Republicans still say they are \u201cnot concerned at all\u201d about the virus \u2013 while only 5% of Democrats are similarly unbothered. Only 14% of Democrats trust Trump for information on the virus, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/03/24/who-americans-trust-covid\">compared with 90% of Republicans</a>. Put simply, there is a body of Americans who do not take this threat as seriously as they should, and the blame for that lies with the president.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s dishonesty matters here too. He was rightly derided in 2016 as a \u201csnake-oil salesman\u201d, and the cliche is so well-worn it\u2019s easy to forget what it originally refers to: the 19<sup>th-</sup>century hawkers who sold bogus cures to the gullible.

But instead of leaping to their aid, Trump tells the governors it\u2019s their responsibility, even though they have a fraction of the procurement power of the US government \u2013 adding that if they want help, they\u2019d better grovel. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/us-governors-coronavirus-trump\">Trump said this week</a>. \u201cThey have to treat us well.\u201d Even when lives are on the line, his ego with its paper-thin skin comes first.</p> <p>Americans are paying the price for his lack of foresight, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html\">his closure of a pandemic task force</a> for no better reason than it was established by Barack Obama \u2013 he hates anything with his predecessor\u2019s name on it \u2013 and his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">failure to heed the warnings</a> of a pandemic preparedness exercise, codenamed Crimson Contagion, that identified glaring gaps as recently as last October. Yet still he repeats the line that nobody could have known what was coming. And they are paying the price for his weakness, as he demands steadfastness in a war against an \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d, only to leave heavy hints that he\u2019s ready to<strong> </strong>fold after a week, apparently<strong> </strong>deciding that 15 days is too long to stay at home.</p> <p>America is lucky it has a federal system that means not all power lies with the president, that at least some rests in the hands of responsible mayors and governors, the likes of New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo. The nation is lucky too that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, who crafted a $2.2tn economic bill from what would otherwise have been a trough into which Trump\u2019s corporate pals could sink their snouts.</p> <p>But these are small consolations for America and indeed for the world, which needed the leadership only a US president has the clout to provide.

  "<p>Libyan armed factions have defied a UN call for a <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-03-23/secretary-generals-appeal-for-global-ceasefire\">\u201cglobal ceasefire\u201d</a> by escalating fighting across the country, with forces loyal to eastern warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar claiming to have gained control of a string of towns in the north-west.</p> <p>A spokesman for Haftar said his forces, the Libyan National Army (LNA), had also repulsed an offensive by the UN-backed government of national accord designed to capture its key airbase \u2013 the failure of which will increase the fragility of the Tripoli government and its dependence on its Turkish backers.</p> <p>The two sides in a conflict that has raged since 2014 briefly agreed last weekend to a humanitarian truce, but within 24 hours fighting resumed at an even more intense pace. Both sides seem to believe that with international actors distracted by the coronavirus pandemic now is the right moment to try to take decisive steps in the civil war.</p> <p>Tripoli, the capital, has seen some of the worst bombardments since Haftar launched a renewed offensive in April last year, prompting the government there to launch a rare counter-offensive operation to try to seize Haftar\u2019s al-Wutiya airbase. The bombardment of Tripoli continued on Thursday night.</p> <p>Turkey has started to use drones deeper into LNA-controlled territory in an effort to disrupt the Haftar offensive.</p> <p>The LNA\u2019s spokesperson, Maj Gen Ahmad Al-Mismari, claimed it had captured several areas in north-western Libya, including the towns of Jumail, Regdalein, and Zultun, so surrounding Zuwara 62 miles (100km) west of Tripoli from three sides. He also claimed more than 100 Syrian fighters brought to Libya by Turkey had been killed in the last 72 hours.</p> <p>The upsurge in fighting, probably the worst since the current phase of the civil war began, came as the first coronavirus case was revealed in the country and led to yet another UN security council call for both sides to end the fighting. But the UN\u2019s credibility in Libya is at rock bottom with weapons embargoes openly breached and the UN special envoy, Ghassan Salam\u00e9, quitting in disgust at competition in the country by the big powers.</p> <p>In a statement after closed video discussions and a briefing on Thursday by the acting UN special representative, Stephanie Williams, the UN said it was concerned at \u201cthe significant escalation of hostilities on the ground in Libya\u201d.</p> <p>Jonathan Allen, the UK senior diplomat at the UN, warned it was \u201cnext to impossible for the brave doctors and medical professionals in Libya to do what they need to do to save people\u201d. He added that the generals and politicians were only deluding themselves by claiming there was a military solution to Libya\u2019s political disputes.</p> <p>The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, also signalled a tougher US approach to the conflict, saying suspending military operations in Libya, especially in Tripoli, is a key goal of US diplomacy.</p> <p>He told Arab Weekly: \u201cThose who say that they are concerned about the rise of Muslim extremism or the rise of militias in Tripoli and use this as a justification for the offensive on Tripoli miss the point that the offensive is having precisely the opposite effect. It is empowering militias. It is making the government more dependent on militias. It is giving extremist voices a greater say in what happens.\u201d</p> <p>He also hinted that Washington was piling pressure on external actors \u201cwhose role has sometimes helped to fuel the conflict\u201d. He added: \u201cFor them, a tougher approach is on the cards. It is time to name names.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile the EU reached an agreement on Thursday to launch a naval mission in the Mediterranean Sea to enforce a UN-mandated arms embargo on Libya. Opposition to the mission, mainly from Austria, was overcome.</p> <p>The goal of the mission \u2013 named Operation Irini, the Greek word for peace \u2013 potentially puts the EU at risk of confrontation with Turkey, which is sending its weaponry by boat, while the United Arab Emirates, backers of the LNA, sends its support by air and so is unlikely to come across any EU interdiction.</p> <p>The previous naval mission, Operation Sophia, was discontinued as countries such as Austria and Italy argued that it acted as a \u201cpull factor\u201d for refugees, encouraging migrants attempting to reach Europe via Libya to set out to sea in the hope of being rescued.</p> <p>Greece offered its ports as disembarkation points for migrants saved at sea by the mission\u2019s warships, a Greek government official said. The previous refusal of any country to make this gesture led to the Austrian and Italian objections to the new operation.</p> <p>Libya\u2019s preparation for a coronavirus outbreak comes as the country\u2019s financially debilitating oil stoppage has also continued from January, costing the nation nearly $4bn (\u00a33.2bn) so far, the Libyan National Oil Corporation has said.</p> <p>The recent collapse in the worldwide oil price will make it more difficult for the country to stem its deficits once oil production starts.</p>",

If it takes a once-in-100-years global pandemic to jolt people in public office into the realisation that nurses are actually quite valuable, it\u2019s pretty hard to scale up for the next logical step. You\u2019re essentially looking at an extinction-level event to nudge them into the headspace where we reward said nurses even slightly better.

On the one hand, it\u2019s the absolute bare minimum, staged solely out of fear for their future bottom lines. On the other, it could be the darkest harbinger yet. Indeed, if you\u2019ve currently got the Book of the Revelation open, you might have been expecting them. Two hoarse men of the apocalypse, gruffly locating some knock-off contrition.

I can\u2019t tell you it divided the critics. Even in normal lighting, Martin looks like he\u2019s holding a torch under his chin and telling you a ghost story about what\u2019s going to happen to you in one of his pubs. Then again, every night is Halloween night down the \u2019Spoons, and Martin always wears the same costume: coarse fisherman whose wife is missing after 30 years of coercive control.

Derbyshire police could then track and film one man\u2019s desperate attempt to get back to civilisation.

The upcoming trial will be critical for assessing the feasibility of vaccination against Covid-19 and could lead to early deployment.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Oxford team previously worked on a rapid vaccine response during the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014. Hill said coronavirus had posed an \u201ceven greater challenge\u201d.</p> \n<p>The team needs people without Covid-19 and is likely to exclude anyone on medication and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or intending to become pregnant during the study. Some will be injected with the vaccine and others with a control injection for comparison. It is expected to be months before scientists know whether the vaccine is effective, as larger trials will be needed and participants\u2019 immune response will need to be monitored.</p> \n<p>The team started work on 10 January, the same day China reported details of the novel coronavirus to the World Health Organization. Since then, it has progressed rapidly from candidate vaccine to animal testing to human trials.</p> \n<p>Under normal circumstances, trials in humans would not begin until animal experiments had been completed. But because similar vaccines have worked safely in trials for other diseases, and due to the overwhelming challenges posed by the pandemic, the work has been accelerated. The trial has been approved by UK regulators and ethical reviewers.</p> \n<p>Prof Stephen Evans, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cThere are risks that some aspects of pre-human testing have been reduced or omitted, but the benefits of getting the vaccine as quickly as possible could outweigh such potential theoretical risks.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, suggested this month that 12-18 months was a realistic timeframe for a vaccine to be available, but the Oxford team is aiming for earlier than this.</p> \n<p>The vaccine is an intramuscular injection that uses a harmless, non-replicating virus to carry RNA (genetic instructions) from the coronavirus into the body\u2019s cells.</p> \n<p>Once inside, the body\u2019s cells absorb the instructions and start churning out copies of the \u201cspike protein\u201d on the surface of the virus. In theory, these proteins are released into the body and should trigger the immune system without causing any illness.</p> \n<p>Previous studies suggest the vaccine should work with only a single dose. Vaccines that operate the same way have been used safely in thousands of people, aged from one week to 90 years, for diseases ranging from malaria and TB to Mers, another coronavirus, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a>. None is in any routine immunisation programme, but they have been used previously in the UK.</p> \n<p>In parallel with the trial, production of the vaccine is being increased ready for larger trials, and, if these are successful, rapid deployment, especially for NHS workers, elderly people, and those with underlying health conditions.</p> \n<p>The UK effort is one of several around the world, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/first-participant-us-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-moderna-dose\">a trial by the US company Moderna</a>, which gave the first dose to a participant last week.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 March 2020.

Your dog does not need to be driven to Dartmoor.\u201d</p> <p>He said some people in his area saw coronavirus as a \u201cLondon thing\u201d, but it was spreading.

Igor Levit is doing it every day for all of us. As the sun goes down, he walks over to the Steinway in his Berlin living room and gives a concert, live on Twitter. There\u2019s absolutely no formality. Levit wears whatever he has got on that day. He gives a brief introduction, in German and English, maybe with a reflection or two on our strange times \u2013 for Levit has always been a concerned citizen in every sense \u2013 and these concerts come from the heart. Some nights he plays Beethoven, other nights it\u2019s Schubert or Brahms. The sound quality is often variable and poor but you hardly care about that. That\u2019s because if you really listen to, say, his playing of Schubert\u2019s B flat sonata D960, he is saying something so much larger about the work he chooses. He is saying that music is humanity at its best and that we and it will survive. It\u2019s the fact of Levit\u2019s wish and need to play for his worldwide audience that makes this feel so gripping and life-enhancing. It is an artistic act that is at once very informal yet also deadly serious. <strong>Martin Kettle</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ee0e872d7b857a92b8eaa93942310b5772a9ef9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ee0e872d7b857a92b8eaa93942310b5772a9ef9/166_46_1523_914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An intelligent and compelling staging...

This is in-house dress rehearsal footage, unedited and filmed in long shot from the stalls, and you get a real sense of watching a performance in the actual theatre. Current offerings include <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stjk0lOp3Lc\">Verdi\u2019s Nabucco</a>, Domenico Cimarosa\u2019s 1792 comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEy2AVeLu8c\">Il Matrimonio Segreto</a>, and last December\u2019s Carmen in a wonderfully intelligent and compelling staging by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Medcalf_(director)\">Stephen Medcalf</a>, conducted by Giacomo Sagripanti. Refusing to sentimentalise, Medcalf updates Bizet\u2019s masterpiece to the Spanish Civil War, where Andrea Car\u00e8\u2019s unstable Jos\u00e9 goes AWOL from Franco\u2019s army and the smugglers are gun-running for the Republicans. Using the Turin stage\u2019s vast space, Medcalf pulls off a big <em>coup de th\u00e9atre </em>at the start of Act III, but elsewhere carefully uses spectacle as a backdrop to the catastrophic relationship between Jos\u00e9 and Varduhi Abrahamyan\u2019s provocative but self-assured Carmen. Marta Torbidoni makes a lovely Micaela, while Lucas Meacham is a laid-back, more subtle Escamillo than most.

With her rich lower range and fine coloratura, Harteros\u2019 singing is rather wonderful and she is a remarkably graceful presence, in part for being required to play Leonora as blind. That was presumably to explain managing to confuse her lover with the baddie Conte di Luna \u2013 the same after-shave? \u2013 but surely unnecessary since mistaken identities and the wrong babies are everywhere in opera. Kaufmann is not an Italianate Manrico, but that hardly matters: he is gloriously passionate and tender both in his love for Leonora and for his gypsy mother, Azucena, whose tortured relationship with her own mother\u2019s death haunts the staging from the outset. Verdi\u2019s music moves inexorably to the tragic ending, yet there is something almost comic and frankly perverse in Olivier Py\u2019s <em>Regietheater</em> spectacle: an elaborate multi-scened revolve, dance, acrobatics, martial arts, and a lot of naked flesh suggest that plot was the least of his priorities. Don\u2019t even bother trying to work out why a single figure beats out the Anvil chorus on a version of Stephenson\u2019s Rocket.

In retrospect it feels worryingly reckless to have gathered the orchestra together one last time without any physical distancing. But at the time it sent a message of human and artistic connection, not in spite of the circumstances but because of them. When large gatherings were banned in Germany on 12 March, concerts were cancelled. Normally, that would have been the end of it, but the Berliners\u2019 concert had been due to be live-streamed on the orchestra\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/concerts\">Digital Concert Hall </a>website and so the self-governing musicians decided to go ahead in their empty Philharmonie hall.</p> <p>This, then, was a first: a public concert entirely without the public, life-streamed for free and then available on demand (<a href=\"https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/\">and free with a specially issued voucher that needs to be redeemed by 31/3</a>). As weird concert experiences go, this concert of Berio and Bart\u00f3k was right up there. But as the pandemic rages, this concert was a catalyst for the dozens of efforts by self-isolating musicians to adapt their performances to the possibilities of reaching their publics through modern media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e3c37286211b9ea3bfa1047907e8ae7f232642d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e3c37286211b9ea3bfa1047907e8ae7f232642d/0_280_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Simon Rattle conducts earlier this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Human and artistic connection\u2019...

The musicians dressed up for the event. The orchestra took their places and tuned up. Then the Neue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart, the eight singer soloists for Berio\u2019s Sinfonia, entered, followed by Rattle. There was applause, but only from the orchestra and only within the decorous conventions of orchestral music, with string players striking their music stands with their bows and brass and percussion players tapping their instruments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/concert/52535#\">Sinfonia</a>, the freewheeling collage written by Berio for the New York Philharmonic in the tumultuous year of 1968, proved a life-enhancing piece for the occasion, teeming with originality and fascinating juxtapositions. <a href=\"https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/concert/52535#\">Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra </a>produced an altogether more sombre effect, suffused as it is by loneliness and memory, and proving ultimately more powerfully appropriate to the strange isolation of the event. As Rattle had predicted, the oddest moment came when the music ended. He mouthed quiet words of thanks to the players, put his hands together in a gesture of gratitude and prayer and left the stage. The musicians followed silently. For the invisible audience across the world, the music was still alive. Let us pray that Rattle and the orchestra do not come to regret it. <em>(Available to watch on the <a href=\"https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/\">Digital Concert Hall</a>, free with a voucher that must be redeemed before 31/3) </em><strong>Martin Kettle </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e9144cfe031cc2e0147775d48c02334bc4c6287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e9144cfe031cc2e0147775d48c02334bc4c6287/0_113_3195_1917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018As an exercise in dramatic repackaging the production is hard to fault\u2019 Bavarian State Opera\u2019s production of Judith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As an exercise in dramatic repackaging the production is hard to fault\u2019 ...

Mitchell prefaces it with a performance of the composer\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra, which becomes the accompaniment to the screening of a film presenting the backstory to her treatment of the narrative. Translated to contemporary London, the central character is now a police detective, sung by <a href=\"https://ninastemme.com/\">Nina Stemme</a>, who takes on the name Judith when she poses as an escort to trap a serial killer preying on sex workers, drugging and imprisoning them at his home. The opera proper begins on stage (without its spoken prologue) when Bluebeard (<a href=\"https://www.artistsman.com/en/artists/john-lundgren/\">John Lundgren</a>) and Judith arrive back at his house.</p> <p>As an exercise in dramatic repackaging the production is hard to fault; it\u2019s imaginatively conceived and expertly realised, and superbly sung and acted by Stemme and Lundgren, even if his baritone is not as dark-hued as it might be for the role. But Mitchell\u2019s treatment is essentially reductive. \u201cJudith\u201d may get her man in the end, bringing closure to the drama, but the ambiguity at the heart of the opera as Bart\u00f3k conceived it is destroyed, turning a piece of symbolist music theatre, with a profoundly troubled and troubling central character, into an all-too-familiar TV-style police hunt for a sadomasochistic killer. <em>(<a href=\"https://operlive.de/judith/\">Available until midday, 26 March</a></em>) <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/16/classical-music-opera-livestream-at-home-coronavirus\">Lockdown listening: classical music and opera to stream at home</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2><strong>HOT TIN TIME MACHINE</strong></h2> \n<p>The Fiver woke up late to discover there\u2019s a reasonable chance Dominic Raab will be in temporary control of the country soon. We thought about that for a moment. Then we thought about necking the rest of that Mogadon and Dettol cocktail we\u2019d fixed for ourselves last night but didn\u2019t quite finish before blackout. But instead we decided to run. So we ran. And we ran.

  "<p>The family of a disabled boy who has been \u201cstuck\u201d in hospital unnecessarily for a year have been evicted from their temporary accommodation by a charity backed by the McDonald\u2019s fast food chain because of coronavirus concerns.</p> <p>The boy\u2019s local MP, Lucy Powell for Manchester Central, described the incident as \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d and said she was \u201cpretty disgusted\u201d after the family was asked on Wednesday night to leave Ronald McDonald House, a block of flats opposite Royal Manchester children\u2019s hospital that houses families while their child is in hospital, funded by McDonald\u2019s.</p> <p>Ten-year-old Ahmed, who has developmental disabilities including cerebral palsy and scoliosis, is fed through a tube and is registered blind.</p> <p>He was admitted to the hospital on 1 March last year with breathing difficulties. Within six weeks, he had recovered enough to be discharged, but his doctors refused to let him leave because the family were homeless and \u201csofa surfing\u201d in a friend\u2019s living room.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/09/severely-disabled-boy-stuck-in-acute-nhs-bed-for-nearly-a-year\">the Guardian reported</a> on his plight this month, Manchester city council found the family a suitable home in south Manchester. They were unable to move in straight away as the house is not yet inhabitable. Renovation works were postponed as the coronavirus hit and the family had to continue their stay in Ronald McDonald House.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, Ahmed\u2019s mother, who the Guardian has agreed not to name to protect the family, said she was told the family had to leave Ronald McDonald House because of fears Ahmed may have coronavirus and could have passed it to them.</p> <p>Ahmed developed a cough this week and was tested for coronavirus. At the time of the family\u2019s eviction the results had not come back, but on Thursday the hospital said he had tested negative.</p> <p>Powell said she was working with council officials to find a resolution for the family.</p> <p>\u201cMyself and Manchester city council \u2013 at the highest level \u2013 are extremely disappointed with the actions of Ronald McDonald House. We are pretty disgusted. This is not how anyone should be treated,\u201d the MP said.</p> <p>\u201cThe family have hotel accommodation now and [the council] is expediting the adaptions to the house and are working on them with universal credit issues too.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed\u2019s parents and two siblings are currently in an aparthotel in Manchester city centre, paid for by the council.</p> <p>Ahmed\u2019s mother pleaded with the charity to let the family return to Ronald McDonald House so she could be near her son. She said restrictions on public transport made it difficult to reach the hospital from the hotel.</p> <p>\u201cThe result of examining my son is negative and he is in good health and also all my family. We do not have any symptoms. In addition, I will not be able to follow the government\u2019s law and stay at home,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, we are a very vulnerable family. We have a lot of problems and stress. Me and my children have experienced difficult times in our journey. We only want the opportunity to stay beside my son and take care of the three children during these difficult circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Jon Haward, the executive director of Ronald McDonald House Charities UK, said: \u201cAt Ronald McDonald House Charities UK, we continue to care for those families whose children are undergoing critical care in hospital at this time.</p> <p>\u201cDuring Ahmed\u2019s treatment, his family stayed with us in one of our houses. When the time came for him to be discharged from hospital care, the specialist housing he required was not yet available to him. We therefore made the decision to accommodate his family on a short-term basis in good faith until his housing was ready. We understand that Ahmed continues to be in the care of the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cDue to the ever-evolving coronavirus (Covid-19) situation, we have taken vital measures to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our staff and other families in our houses. This means reducing the number of families in our houses at any one time and temporarily suspending new intakes of families. This also means we cannot re-admit families who have left our houses. These decisions are by no means easy to make, but we are adhering to the government guidelines as closely as possible. This includes advice about social distancing and how movement between \u2018households\u2019 should be prohibited, due to risk of infection.</p> <p>\u201cWe wholeheartedly sympathise with the difficulties Ahmed\u2019s family is facing. In light of the pandemic we continue to take these special measures, in keeping with hospital and government guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>Suzanne Richards, Manchester city council\u2019s executive member for housing and regeneration, said: \u201cWe are committed to helping Ahmed\u2019s family in any way we can during this challenging time and crucially we will make sure they do not face homelessness.</p> <p>\u201cWe will support the family with paid-for hotel accommodation until they can move directly into their fully adapted home, which we hope will be available next week. A dedicated support worker will remain in contact with the family through this period to ensure they receive any further welfare support that they are entitled to.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The article was amended on 28 March 2020.

Women don\u2019t want other people to think they are weird, but the statistics show that one in three women suffer. Not just one in three women over 40.<br><br>\u201cIt could be a short-term problem associated with an infection. It\u2019s not just caused by childbirth and the menopause. Some women simply don\u2019t have good pelvic floor muscles. Sometimes there are things you can do about it, but you don\u2019t know until you tell someone.\u201d<br><br>The first stop, Morris says, is always to talk to your GP, who will tell you if it is an infection that can be sorted out with a course of antibiotics. Alternatively, it could be due to a reduction in oestrogen because of something like the menopause, when hormone replacement therapy or oestrogen pellets could be prescribed.<br><br>\u201cYour GP could help, so you don\u2019t even need to talk to your partner. The trouble is if you are avoiding sex because you are scared of incontinence and you don\u2019t do anything about it. If that includes not talking to your partner, they are quite likely to imagine it is them you are avoiding, not the sex. Which creates a whole different problem in your relationship.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/tena/diary1.html\" data-alt=\"Confidence\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/tena/diary1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Confidence</a> </figure>  <p>However, choosing the time and the place to tell all is never easy.<br><br>\u201cIdeally, don\u2019t have the conversation in bed when you are both naked and feeling vulnerable, when sex is about to take place or just has. I am a therapist and I understand how difficult it often is for people to say things out loud. It is easier to say something when you are side by side and not looking at each other, when you are going for walk, for example, and you are not likely to be interrupted.\u201d<br><br>Morris has other practical advice too, from finding the right sex positions (spooning \u2013 lying side by side \u2013 is better than acrobatic moves where gravity will not be your friend) to changing your drinking habits.<br><br>\u201cIf you know you are going to be having sex, don\u2019t drink anything for a while before, especially drinks with a high sugar content or caffeine, which can act as diuretics and make you want to wee,\u201d she explains. \u201cRestrict yourself to just sipping water in the hour or so before.\u201d<br><br>One woman would only have sex when she and her husband had both been drinking heavily, hoping he wouldn\u2019t notice, and if he did she could blame it on being drunk. Not a great basis for a happy love life.<br><br>\u201cEmpty your bladder before sex, and when you think you are empty try to go again. It may be unromantic, but you can also always get up for a quick wee after foreplay,\u201d says Morris. \u201cA lot of women want to go to the loo after they orgasm. You can explain to your partner in a flattering way that sometimes when you are really excited your body really lets go and that may include some wee. You can say: \u2018I just want to check that doesn\u2019t freak you out.\u2019 They may take it as a compliment.\u201d</p> <p>It should obviously be easier to have the conversation with someone you are in a long-term relationship with, but what you have to remember is it is a common biological fact and isn\u2019t anything to be embarrassed about.<br><br>\u201cStress incontinence happens if your pelvic floor muscles are weak. You can improve them with kegel exercises \u2013 squeezing and releasing your vaginal muscles when you urinate or are having sex.<br><br>\u201cThe trouble with women not talking about the problem with each other, as well as their partners, is that they don\u2019t know how normal and very ordinary it is,\u201d says Morris. \u201cPeople are squeamish, but, when I lived in Paris, they regarded such stuff as ordinary, healthy conversations.\u201d</p> <p><em>As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

If you had any real gumption, you\u2019d have followed the footsteps of the Canadian director Mostafa Keshvari and already written and shot an entire coronavirus feature film.</p> <p>Because, incredibly, Keshvari appears to have done just that. Entitled Corona, the film takes place entirely within the confines of an elevator. Neighbours of different backgrounds enter \u2013 a Chinese lady, a pregnant woman, a wheelchair-bound Nazi with a swastika tattoo on his forehead \u2013 and panic begins to spread just as quickly as the disease. Or, as the movie\u2019s tagline puts it, \u201cFear is a Virus\u201d.</p> <p>A trailer for the film has already been released. Not to give too much away but \u2013 if I\u2019m reading this right \u2013 the Chinese woman starts coughing, which causes the elevator to stall. The lights go out. The emergency lights kick in, and for some reason they\u2019re red flashing submarine-style lights. Someone screams: \u201cWe\u2019re all going to die in here!\u201d The Nazi pulls out a gun. The Chinese woman starts crying. And then a man says: \u201cI think we\u2019re all being tested,\u201d which leads me to believe that Corona will posit that the spread of Covid-19 is down to an evil Saw-style puppet who created the virus in a lab as an unnecessarily complicated no-win morality test for humanity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6kMjE90Mg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fi6kMjE90Mg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I could be wrong, and I won\u2019t know until Corona hits the streaming services soon. But still, you can\u2019t knock the director\u2019s ambition. Keshvari had written the film, shot it and cut the trailer by 8 March, days before overt public jumpiness and weeks before the lockdown. You may have seen the spectre of the virus as a threat to your friends and family, but not Keshvari. He saw it as an opportunity to make a name for himself.</p> <p>He\u2019s by no means a beginner \u2013 his short film I Ran was selected in the 2015 Cannes Short Corner Film Festival \u2013 but by almost definitely making the world\u2019s first coronavirus feature film, Keshvari\u2019s stock is bound to rise. Not an awful lot is known about him but, judging by his IMDb page, he used to be a banker, he gained a scholarship at Vancouver Film School, he\u2019s making a thriller about women\u2019s rights, he\u2019s a published poet and his personal quotes include: \u201cYour life is a movie, direct it before someone else will\u201d and \u201cPoint the camera where the light is and pull focus on your dreams.\u201d Hopefully he has a long movie career ahead of him. But, if he doesn\u2019t, you get the feeling that he\u2019d do quite well in the inspirational vinyl wall decal business.</p> <p>What\u2019s even more impressive about Corona is that Keshvari was able to add a level of en vogue artistry to the film, by recording the whole thing in a single shot. It should be seen as a distant cousin to 1917, perhaps.</p> <p>When all this blows over and we\u2019re hit with a deluge of Contagion-style films about the virus \u2013 some by established auteurs, some by plucky up-and-comers \u2013 we should make sure that we don\u2019t forget about Corona. We shouldn\u2019t have to watch it, because God knows time is precious, but we shouldn\u2019t forget about it.</p>",

The documents clearly state that the scientific evidence did not support a vast increase in procurement expenditure on face masks with integrated eye protection for pandemic influenza.\u201d</p> \n<p>The DHSC is now scrambling to find ways to better supply hospital staff as it faces Covid-19, a highly infectious respiratory disease, with reports of doctors and nurses frantically trying to buy their own PPE and a particularly acute need for eye protection.</p> \n<p>At prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, highlighted that the Healthcare Supplies Association had appealed to DIY shops to donate PPE. On Twitter, the association said it needed visors and protective glasses, tweeting: \u201cDo we have to commandeer the stocks of DIY stores?????\u201d</p> \n<p>Hunt, who ran the department between 2012 and 2018 and now chairs the House of Commons health select committee, has in recent days led calls to better equip frontline staff battling the coronavirus. Last week, he told the BBC: \u201cWe must sort this out. We are asking people to put their own lives at risk on the NHS frontline...It is absolutely heartbreaking when NHS frontline professionals don\u2019t have the equipment that they need.\u201d</p> \n<p>His spokeswoman told the Guardian: \u201cJeremy does not believe he was personally involved in decisions about PPE for NHS staff, but was acutely aware of the shortage of funds in the NHS budget which was why that year he fought for and secured an \u00a38bn rise in the NHS annual budget followed by a \u00a320bn rise two years later.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, the documents suggest the efforts by Hunt\u2019s department to water down the advice on PPE impacted a round of procurement that was due to take place in 2017 to stockpile for a possible pandemic.</p> \n<p>In addition to the discussions over eye protection, the documents also raise questions about the UK government\u2019s policy regarding face masks for doctors, nurses and other health professionals dealing with Covid-19 patients.</p> \n<p>In 2016, Nervtag advisers told the government that intensive care units (ICUs) should be designated \u201chot spots\u201d carrying out aerosol generating procedures. Therefore, they said, a particular kind of mask known as an FFP3 respirator \u201cshould be recommended for all staff at all times in these areas when a patient with pandemic influenza is present\u201d, except for some circumstances.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/uk-hospitals-being-sent-untested-coronavirus-protection-say-medics\">UK hospitals being sent untested coronavirus protection, say medics</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One intensive care nurse at a hospital in Yorkshire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/uk-hospitals-being-sent-untested-coronavirus-protection-say-medics\">told the Guardian earlier this week</a> she had had to spend \u00a3100 of her own money to buy a full FFP3 respirator mask online.

The guidance, they said, needed to recommend PPE usage \u201cin line with the current evidence base and guidelines\u201d.</p> \n<p>In June that year, the department responded to Nervtag\u2019s initial recommendations about pandemic stockpiling, saying work to reflect the advice was being prioritised and progressed. However, with regard to updating the control guidance to bring it in line with current evidence, officials replied: \u201cThis work is not considered a priority at this time and will be deferred for consideration at a future time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Frontline doctors and nurses have said recent changes to official advice in the UK have meant many NHS staff have been wearing less protective gear than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends when caring for Covid-19 patients.

  "<p>When John Erskine signed up a teenage Keir Starmer to the Labour club at Leeds University freshers\u2019 week in 1982, he had hoped to find a new recruit in the factional dogfight raging inside the party.</p> \n<p>But he was disappointed. Erskine recalls the young law student\u2019s politics as being of the \u201cnon-aligned, conscience-driven left\u201d \u2013 something like a kind of political Methodism.</p> \n<p>Instead of joining in the running battles with Militant, Starmer took the view there were \u201cno enemies on the left\u201d and cracked on with his studies.</p> \n<p>The overwhelming favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, who steps down next weekend, Starmer has defied categorisation, declining to become a fully paid-up member of any of Labour\u2019s many overlapping sects.</p> \n<p>He is neither a Corbynite nor a Blairite (to the extent that they still exist) and is irritated by other people\u2019s urge to pigeon-hole him.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian as he launched his pitch for the leadership last December, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t find the badging of people helps, really. I don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. There are fundamental principles.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer arrived at Leeds from Reigate grammar school, the only one of five siblings from a modest semi-detached house in Oxted, Surrey, to get to university.</p> \n<p>He has spoken movingly about his mother\u2019s 50-year battle with Still\u2019s disease, which ultimately led to her being confined to a wheelchair and unable to eat. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have moaned. If you\u2019d asked her how she was, she\u2019d say \u2018fine, how are you?\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>After a postgraduate degree at Oxford, Starmer moved to London where he shared a rickety flat in Archway with old school friends.</p> \n<p>He joined the fashionably radical Doughty Street Chambers while carrying out pro-bono work for a string of apparently lost causes.</p> \n<p>Conor Foley, an international human rights lawyer and aid worker who now lives in Brazil, worked alongside Starmer at the campaign group Amnesty International in the 90s.</p> \n<p>The pair wrote a pamphlet, Foreign Policy, Human Rights and the UK, in 1998, making a string of recommendations, many of which were subsequently taken up by the Labour government.</p> \n<p>Tony Blair\u2019s incorporation of the provisions of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK law in the Human Rights Act catapulted Starmer and his fellow human rights lawyers from the lefty fringe of their profession to the mainstream, as the judiciary scrambled to absorb its implications.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere were various people who were, three years before, on the unacceptable left, suddenly found themselves in positions of authority,\u201d says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the LSE and another old friend. \u201cBecause we knew about it and nobody else did.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foley agrees. \u201cThe Human Rights Act - there are probably four or five people in Britain who got that legislation and understood the importance of that legislation, and Keir and I were two of them. There were other people who played a more prominent role. But he has always understood the strategic significance of international human rights law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foley says that while the pair were working together at Amnesty he didn\u2019t sense any burning ambition in Starmer to enter party politics. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t where we were at. I think he wanted to be a human rights lawyer. I think that was really his dream.\u201d</p> \n<p>And anyway the Labour party of the time wasn\u2019t much to their liking, he says. \u201cThe Blairite party wouldn\u2019t have been something either of us were comfortable with. Not that we were anti, we just weren\u2019t that comfortable with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer\u2019s appointment as director of public prosecutions (DPP) \u2013 a campaigning human rights lawyer turned the nation\u2019s chief prosecutor \u2013 surprised some of his radical friends.</p> \n<p>Leftwing critics tend to describe his five-year stint at the top of the 6,000-strong Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as the final stage in Starmer\u2019s metamorphosis from firebrand QC to well-coiffed pillar of the establishment.</p> \n<p>They point to the all-night court sittings held to administer swift punishment to the 2011 rioters \u2013 which Starmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/03/riot-prosecutions-sentences-keir-starmer\">subsequently claimed</a> had helped quell the disorder; and tough prosecuting guidance that imposed sentences of up to 10 years on benefits fraudsters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"857831f4-ed8c-4dc5-9e5c-f4e3092b4731\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.</p>\n    <p><b>Pitch&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\">Promising to champion \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories.

But in private, says one shadow cabinet colleague, the discussions were more robust.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe stretched the case as far as he could go but not to a point where he could be said to be out of line. But in the private meetings he was pushing very much harder. At every stage, we felt, and I said this many times, this is just a fucking ratchet.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some former MPs who lost their seats in pro-Brexit constituencies blame Starmer, in part, for the party\u2019s policy, which took many months of wrangling to arrive at and which infuriated leave voters.</p> \n<p>He insists it was a sensible way of dealing with a deeply divided party, with a deeply divided electorate, that once arrived at was not explained or sold to the public.</p> \n<p>Certainly he made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, instead touring local constituencies to boost morale with members and candidates, a role he had also played in 2017, awarding himself the moniker Captain Marginal.</p> \n<p>Is he now more politician than lawyer? Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, who has sat in the shadow cabinet throughout Starmer\u2019s time in parliament, believes so.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who\u2019s dealt with the Labour party, the shadow cabinet, the issues that he\u2019s dealt with over the past few years, could be accused of not being a politician,\u201d Lady Smith says.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of weirdly Machiavellian type some people associate with the word politician, but he gets the politics of an issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Erskine, who has watched Starmer\u2019s progress from afar since the Leeds days, says \u201ceverything is of a piece. It\u2019s of conscience, it\u2019s about incredible intellectual rigour, it\u2019s about being measured. And whilst it\u2019s not me, I have a lot of respect for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>That measured style until recently appeared out of political fashion. Whatever Corbyn\u2019s shortcomings, he was capable of rousing passion in his army of supporters. Even Starmer\u2019s most staunch supporters concede that is not really his style.</p> \n<p>One old friend recalls asking him to make a speech to a school about how he had risen from a pebble-dashed semi in Oxted to the top of his profession. It was an inspirational story, he recalls, but not an inspirational speech. \u201cHe\u2019s no David Lammy, Keir.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another cites what they recall as a serviceable but not outstanding address at the funeral of his predecessor in the Holborn and St Pancras seat, Frank Dobson, last December, with the great and the good of the Labour party, including four past and present leaders, in the congregation.</p> \n<p>One mourner recalls a non-plussed Labour grandee muttering afterwards: \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with Keir: he doesn\u2019t rise to the occasion.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Smith, who has seen Starmer up close over the past five years, has little sympathy for those who complain that he lacks pizzazz.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get quite irritated when people talk about him being dull. He\u2019s serious \u2013 and I rather like people being serious, particularly when you\u2019re dealing with serious issues,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>And with politics-as-usual on hold as the world wrestles with Covid-19 and its consequences \u2013 which have already swept decades-long orthodoxies in their wake \u2013 she adds: \u201cHe\u2019s a serious grownup politician. I think he\u2019s the right person at the right time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has suspended its enforcement of some environmental laws during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>In an extraordinary move that has stunned former EPA officials, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/oecamemooncovid19implications.pdf\">the Trump administration said</a> it will not expect compliance with the routine monitoring and reporting of pollution and won\u2019t pursue penalties for breaking these rules.</p> <p>Polluters will be able to ignore some environmental laws as long as they can claim in some way these violations were caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the event of an imminent threat to public health, the EPA will defer to the states and \u201cconsider the circumstances\u201d over whether it should intervene.</p> <p>There is no end date set for this dropping of enforcement.</p> <p>Andrew Wheeler, administrator of the EPA, said that coronavirus had made it difficult for businesses to protect workers and the public while adhering to clean air and water rules.</p> <p>\u201cThis temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment,\u201d Wheeler said.</p> <p>The new stance has caused uproar among former EPA officials and environmental groups who warn that the sweeping will pose a further risk to public health amid the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cEPA should never relinquish its right and its obligation to act immediately and decisively when there is threat to public health, no matter what the reason is,\u201d said Cynthia Giles, who was head of EPA enforcement during the Obama administration.</p> <p>\u201cI am not aware of any instance when EPA ever relinquished this fundamental authority as it does in this memo. This memo amounts to a nationwide moratorium on enforcing the nation\u2019s environmental laws and is an abdication of EPA\u2019s responsibility to protect the public.\u201d</p> <p>A letter sent to the EPA by Giles and a number of other environmental advocates states that while it may be \u201creasonable in limited circumstances\u201d to relax certain enforcement during the crisis, the blanket waiver of environmental requirements poses a danger to the American public.</p> <p>There is particular concern over air pollution emitted by industrial facilities, which are predominantly located in communities with large numbers of low-income people and people of color. Covid-19 attacks the respiratory system, with its spread causing states to scramble for more ventilators to prevent thousands of infected people from dying.</p> <p>The air pollution that industrial plants will not have to monitor damages the respiratory system, which is especially dangerous for already at-risk populations who may also become infected with Covid-19, which attacks the lungs.</p> <p>\u201cExcusing the potential release of excess toxic air pollutants and other pollution that exacerbates asthma, breathing difficulty and cardiovascular problems in the midst of a pandemic that can cause respiratory failure is irresponsible from a public health perspective,\u201d the letter states.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about reporting and paperwork,\u201d said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re flying blind because you\u2019re not monitoring for pollution and the public\u2019s flying blind because you\u2019re not reporting it, a lot of problems that come to light when you do those things are going to stay hidden,\u201d Schaeffer said.</p> <p>In one example, oil refineries will not be compelled to report on and reduce their carcinogenic <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2020%2Ffeb%2F06%2Fus-oil-refineries-exceeding-limits-for-cancer-causing-benzene-report-finds\">benzene emissions</a>. Ten refineries, most of them in Texas, have already been exceeding limits.</p> <p>The relaxation of environmental laws follows lobbying from the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, which sent the EPA a letter this week calling for the suspension of rules requiring repair of leaky equipment as well as monitoring of pollution.</p> <p>The EPA\u2019s move goes even further than this request, although the regulator said it expects businesses will comply with laws \u201cwhere reasonably practicable\u201d and that it will not tolerate flagrant, intentional breaches of the law.</p> <p>However, Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, indicated that the move may be challenged in the courts. \u201cWhile there may be no limit to the lengths Trump and Wheeler are willing to go for corporate polluters, there is a limit to what the public will allow,\u201d Brune said. \u201cThis illegal and reckless action will not go unchecked.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 8 May 2020 to clarify that it is only the enforcement of some environmental laws that has been suspended.</p>",

  "<p>Speaking before the largest inauguration crowd in human history, Donald Trump made a bold prediction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-us-live-news-trump-stimulus-vote-house-thomas-massie-latest-updates\">Coronavirus US live: single Republican may stall $2.2tn stimulus package</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.

America will start winning again, winning like never before.\u201d</p> <p>And so it came to pass that America is indeed winning like never before. First among nations, to be sure. With all the new vision that an ostrich has while examining the sand from below.</p> <p>The news that Donald Trump\u2019s America is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump\">first</a> in the world for coronavirus cases should give nobody any pleasure. The fact that the nation passed this grim milestone on the same day it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">reported</a> a record number of unemployment claims \u2013 3.3 million in just one week \u2013 underscores the superlative nature of this presidency.</p> <p>He represents the greatest, the biggest, and the most tremendous failure of leadership in living memory. He has made America great again in ways nobody could ever imagine or conceive.</p> <p>How did Trump mark this date which will live in infamy? By praising himself, of course. If he had been president at the time of Pearl Harbor, he would have claimed that the bombing was just confirmation that he had built the world\u2019s greatest navy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to the amount of testing that we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing tremendous testing, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that\u2019s a little hard.\u201d</p> <p>To be honest, it\u2019s a little hard to tell what\u2019s happening here too. As of Thursday evening, there have been 519,000 tests <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/\">performed</a> in the United States, among a population of 327 million. That\u2019s 0.15% of all Americans. In South Korea, with a population one-sixth of the size, they have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/coronavirus-testing-trump-south-korea-fact-check/index.html\">performed</a> more than 357,000 tests.</p> <p>Overtaking South Korea in total tests was of course a reason to celebrate in Trump\u2019s very small book. It was also a reason to lie.</p> <p>\u201cJust reported that the United States has done far more \u2018testing\u2019 than any other nation, by far!\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242824631230308353\">tweeted</a>. \u201cIn fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job!\u201d</p> <p>Yes, great job! Totally awesome. We\u2019re only six times behind where we should be on the South Korean scale of what Trump considers to be \u201ctesting\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not entirely clear that anyone has \u201ctested\u201d Trump with a multiple-choice quiz about this pandemic and how to end it. Lobbed an obvious question about the tests on Wednesday, he spun his tale of failure into a Technicolor tapestry of dopey lies and lazy delusions.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tested, by far, more than anybody. We\u2019re testing more than anybody right now. There\u2019s nobody even close. And our tests are the best tests. They\u2019re the most accurate tests,\u201d he riffed, as if his words had uncoupled themselves from the gravitational pull of meaning and begun floating into the upper reaches of his empty skull.</p> <p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to test 350 million people,\u201d he continued, \u201cI disagree with it. We can go to certain states \u2013 I could name them now, but I\u2019m not going to do that \u2013 but we can go to certain states right now. They have virtually no problem or a very small problem.\u201d</p> <p>There is only one place where that claim is true, and that would be the state of denial: Donald Trump\u2019s home state when the going gets tough.</p> <p>For those looking at far less important numbers, like Trump\u2019s rising approval ratings or the yo-yo stock market, these are confusing times. How can anything be rising when we have such catastrophically incompetent leadership?</p> <p>This is the crackerjack team that is dithering over a $1bn deal to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">produce</a> 80,000 critically needed ventilators while waving through a $2tn stimulus bill that includes $50bn for airlines. Flying may be important to the economy, but breathing is surely worth one-fiftieth of the support.</p> <p>Trump would dearly love to tell a story about Democratic states suffering while Republican ones are virus-free. But Florida complicates that picture, and the pesky numbers show the virus has reached every state in the union. Even with the fractional testing that we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Like every con artist, Trump knows when the mark has moved on. You can fool some of the people all of the time, especially if they watch Fox News. You can even fool a plurality of the people at election time, with a billion dollars of Facebook disinformation. But you can\u2019t fool all of the people, especially at a time of pandemic and recession.</p> <p>So his numbers are sliding <a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Public-Opinion-on-Coronavirus-Navigator-Daily-03.26.20.pdf\">downwards</a> just as surely as the virus numbers are climbing upwards.

But what has so many people wondering tonight, [is] why Bill Ackman, who maybe has the right idea, or very good intentions, would put on such a ridiculous show and cause such damage to an already panicked market. That\u2019s what\u2019s puzzling.\u201d</p> \n<p>The puzzle appeared to have been solved this week when Ackman revealed in a letter to his shareholders that since late February he had been buying \u201ccredit protection\u201d hedges \u2013 bets that the markets would fall.</p> \n<p>Those hedges have paid off and Ackman\u2019s fund used the gains to buy shares in \u201ccompanies we love at bargain prices\u201d.</p> \n<p>While people around the world have been watching their savings shrivel, and 3 million Americans lost their jobs last week alone, Ackman\u2019s deals made him and his shareholders $2.6bn.</p> \n<p>Ackman was already rich. His net worth before the crisis was estimated by Forbes at about $1.3bn. The son of the boss of one of New York\u2019s premier real estate financing firms, Ackman has inherited a love for luxury property. He splits his time between a $22m 13-room two-storey penthouse in the Upper West Side and a three-house complex on the beach in the Hamptons.</p> \n<p>In 2015 he bought the penthouse of the 1,005ft skyscraper One57 for $91.5m as a \u201cfun investment\u201d. He uses the apartment on the 75th and 76th floors for extravagant parties to entertain his business and celebrity friends. Ackman planned to hold on to the six-bedroom, eight-bathroom penthouse with views of Central Park for a few years before \u201cflipping it\u201d \u2013 selling it at a huge profit in a few years.</p> \n<p>Ackman, who studied for both his undergraduate history degree and MBA at Harvard University, set up his first hedge fund Gotham Partners with a fellow Harvard grad, David Berkowitz. The fund closed in 2002 shortly after the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) investigated alleged market manipulation in Gotham\u2019s shorting of shares in investment firm Municipal Bond Insurance Association (MBIA). The regulator found no evidence of wrongdoing, but six days of embarrassing public disclosures left the firm\u2019s reputation in tatters.</p> \n<p>Ackman was not deterred though and went on to establish Pershing Square Capital with $54m of investment. It now has more than $8bn under management.</p> \n<p>He prided himself on the diversity of the funds hires, with early recruits reportedly including a fishing trip guide, a tennis coach and a guy he had met in a cab.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On Thursday night Ackman <a href=\"https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/03/26222617/Pershing-Square-Capital-Management-L.P.-Releases-Letter-to-Investors-March-26-2020.pdf\">released a statement defending himself</a> against charges that his CNBC appearance was designed to spook the markets. \u201cOn CNBC, I disclosed my beliefs to the best of my ability,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I got somewhat emotional as I talked about protecting my immune-compromised father from the ravages of the virus. </p> \n<p>\u201cBut I had become bullish because of my belief that the entire country would soon go into lockdown, and that would be the fastest and best way to minimise the impact of the virus. And that was why I explained that we were buying stocks. I also wanted to shout from the rooftops about the importance of taking the virus seriously so that we would build a consensus to lockdown the country as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn light of our concerns we had two choices: we could either sell all of our investments or hedge our portfolio. We chose to hedge coronavirus risk rather than sell because we are long-term investor, and we believe that all of our companies would eventually recover, and create substantial value over the long term.\u201d</p> \n<p>The bet revealed this week is not the first time Ackman has profited from the coronavirus pandemic.

  "<p>Three weeks ago, Tony Robinson completed a six-part series for Channel 5 \u2013 it starts tonight \u2013 charting a journey that took him around the world by train. Now, like the rest of us, he is being told not to walk to the end of the street. We were due to meet face to face for this interview, but we have to talk by phone instead. The upside is we have all the time in the world. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who a few weeks ago would have looked at my watch and said: \u2018Is 10 minutes all right?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut now \u2026\u201d He trails off. Everything has been cancelled: shooting on two other series; preparing a pitch for a third. What had been a crowded diary is empty.<br><br>\u201cAll my performance work went in one day,\u201d he says. \u201cHad that happened at another time I would have been so pissed off you can\u2019t imagine. But when it\u2019s happening to everybody, you just think: \u2018Oh, this is the way life is now.\u2019\u201d What did annoy him was that some of those postponing projects thought his age \u2013 he is 73 \u2013 might mean he couldn\u2019t resume them in the future. \u201cThat was distressing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just old-fashioned ageism.\u201d<br><br>What is filling his life instead is a six-year-old west highland terrier he and his wife Louise have just brought back from an RSPCA rescue centre in Derby. \u201cIt was probably our last long car journey for a year. Who knows?\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s called Holly Berry and our flat [in west London] is full of joy. She\u2019s had a gruelling life and it\u2019s nice to pour our interest into an animal whose confidence is growing by the day.\u201d<br><br>Robinson is an obsessive worker, a fact obvious from a CV that encompasses acting, presenting, writing (TV series, children\u2019s books, an autobiography) and politics \u2013 he was on Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee from 2000 to 2004. He says he will carry on writing during the crisis, but also looks forward to spending more time with his wife and will \u201ctidy drawers that haven\u2019t been tidied for at least seven years\u201d.<br><br>Fortunately, the series for Channel 5 survived the lockdown. He travels across southern Europe, glories in the street life of South America, takes a train through Mexico and California, explores Canada and heads home via Russia and Scandinavia. It is an epic undertaking, conducted at whistlestop speed, and there are times when he looks knackered.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life, a celebration of other people, a celebration of the world and of adventure,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything is so gloomy at the moment, but I was doing the final voiceover at a time when we could just explode with fun and laughter and my idiocy in the face of adversity, and we need to hold on to that. There\u2019s a limited amount of time during which we can mourn what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc68bdc01ca50454863bccdca5d45a5639edb10a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc68bdc01ca50454863bccdca5d45a5639edb10a/0_204_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s a celebration of life, of other people\u2019 \u2026 Robinson with one of the Uros people who live on floating islands on Lake Titicaca.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a celebration of life, of other people\u2019 \u2026 Robinson with one of the Uros people who live on floating islands on Lake Titicaca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rumpus Media Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among other adventures, Robinson gets licked on the face by a wolf at a polar park in Norway \u2013 he looks suitably terrified, not least as the wolf is about a foot taller than he is. He also tries to learn the tango in Argentina, dancing with a woman who is also about a foot taller than him \u2013 he accuses me of aggressive questioning when I point this out, though I assume he is not serious. Not too serious, anyway. He is very businesslike, focused and articulate \u2013 in every way the opposite of his great creation Baldrick, the originator of many ill-starred cunning plans in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/24/blackadder-returns-cunning-plan-where-when-set\">the four series of Blackadder</a> that were comic high points of the 1980s.<br><br>It is tempting to see Robinson\u2019s career as this golden six-year Blackadder period and then everything else, but he is keen to resist this. He reminds me that immediately after he did Blackadder, he wrote and starred in the award-winning children\u2019s series Maid Marian and her Merry Men. He would also like the history and travel programmes he presents to be treated with a bit more respect. But he admits that Baldrick, which he did for the first time in his late 30s, transformed his career.<br><br>\u201cI had been working since I was 12, initially as a performer but later also as a writer and director, but in a very small way. Once I\u2019d done Blackadder, people thought I was one of those people like Stephen Fry and Richard Curtis who had that kind of capacity for wit and creativity, so for the first time in my life it was dead easy to get in the office door, and that\u2019s all you want really: to pitch and be taken seriously.\u201d<br><br>An only child \u2013 he reckons that is very significant \u2013 Robinson was brought up in north-east London. His father, who worked as a clerk for the local council, was an amateur pianist who doted on his son, and both his parents were keen on amateur dramatics. Robinson never seems to have given a thought to doing anything else but acting \u2013 despite being bright and going to a grammar school, he only managed four O-levels and gave up on his A-levels halfway through.<br><br>He made his professional debut at the age of 13 in the original production of Oliver! and went to the Central School of Speech and Drama when he was 17. He then spent 20 years as a jobbing actor and director, always managing to earn a reasonable living but never setting the showbiz world alight. The Blackadder producer John Lloyd told Robinson Baldrick would transform his career, and despite an iffy first series that almost led to the series being killed off, it did.<br><br>The irony is he didn\u2019t think much of the part of Baldrick when it was first offered to him, and says he only got it because no one else wanted it. Baldrick had been relatively smart in the first series, with Rowan Atkinson\u2019s Blackadder the dim one, but the relationship was inverted in series two to brilliant comic effect. He thinks Ben Elton joining as a writer for the second series was crucial. \u201cHe could look at it afresh,\u201d says Robinson, \u201cand realised Blackadder had to inhabit two worlds: in one he feels he is very smart, but in the other he\u2019s proven to be a complete tit, which is exactly the model of Hancock and Steptoe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97f0d31f800a964c3d85c73a9cd7a95f7fa270cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f0d31f800a964c3d85c73a9cd7a95f7fa270cc/0_61_1936_1161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robinson with Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder, 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robinson with Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder, 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robinson says \u201cthe world was my oyster\u201d after Blackadder, and he became a regular on TV comedy shows. Yet within five years he had moved into presenting work. Had the acting and comedy world ceased to be his oyster? \u201cNo,\u201d he insists, \u201cbigger oyster in a different ocean. I\u2019ve always been very politically and socially engaged, so it was never difficult for me to make documentaries.\u201d He says he had addressed so many Labour party branch meetings that bringing dry subjects to life came naturally to him.<br><br>The success he had with the Channel 4 series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/23/time-team-a-tv-gem\">Time Team</a>, which featured high-speed archaeological digs and ran from 1994 to 2014, marked the changeover from actor-presenter to presenter-actor. Critics were nonplussed by the switch. \u201cWhen I started presenting Time Team, there was some resentment,\u201d he says, \u201ccertainly among the more highbrow papers that could never resist a kind of waspish sting that someone who had previously earned their living as a comedian was addressing serious issues. It wasn\u2019t something I ever experienced from members of the public. No one ever came up to me in the street and said: \u2018What the fuck are you doing making documentaries when you are supposed to be telling jokes?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a real honour for an actor to have played a character who is so iconic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But doesn\u2019t he miss the acting? \u201cI\u2019ve never really enjoyed doing eight shows a week [in the theatre],\u201d he says. \u201cDoing something repetitiously in that way is a bit of a killer.\u201d Does it bother him that, no matter what else he does, people still think of him as Baldrick? \u201cNot at all,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s a real honour for an actor to have played a character who is so iconic. Maybe if it had happened when I was younger, I would have got a bit more precious about it, but I see it as bloody lucky.\u201d<br><br>His remarkably varied career \u2013 actor, presenter, public educator, political activist \u2013 led to him being knighted in 2013 for public and political service. Some wondered whether it was appropriate for a socialist to accept such an award, but he says that\u2019s a ridiculously \u201cbinary\u201d view. \u201cThe people who gave me that award were the honours committee, which is one of the best legacies of the Blair government. You are picked out for services to the state; it has nothing to do with the monarchy.\u201d<br><br>He also received flak for his marriage in 2011 to Louise Hobbs, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1832834/tony-robinson-70-defends-marriage-to-woman-younger-than-his-daughter-after-being-quizzed-by-stacey-solomon-on-loose-women/\">who is more than 30 years his junior</a>. When he appeared on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b0128hsb\">Desert Island Discs</a> in the same year, he dismissed the attacks as \u201cnasty, misogynistic press\u201d and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame really because it means I don\u2019t want to talk about her, whereas actually what I do want to do is talk about her.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s foolish to discuss anything to do with that,\u201d he says now, \u201cbecause it just starts the whole machine whirring again.\u201d The key thing, he says, is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/14/tony-robinson-my-daughter-used-to-call-me-tony-now-she-calls-me-dad\">it hasn\u2019t undermined his relationship with his two grown</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/14/tony-robinson-my-daughter-used-to-call-me-tony-now-she-calls-me-dad\">up children</a>, to whom he remains very close. When I remark that his daughter, <a href=\"https://www.laurashepherdrobinson.com/\">Laura Shepherd-Robinson</a>, is a novelist, he chides me. \u201c<em>A</em> novelist!?\u201d he says, his voice rising. \u201cShe\u2019s a very successful novelist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfefbacd581d2881e8fa481163d8c785075b4df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfefbacd581d2881e8fa481163d8c785075b4df3/0_198_2320_1392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robinson on Time Team, 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robinson on Time Team, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Lawn/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Like many who have worked in comedy \u2013 Tony Hancock and Les Dawson spring to mind \u2013 Robinson is a deeply serious person. The lifelong political engagement, born perhaps of his Jewish heritage and a father who loved a dialectical argument with his son, he insists is real and not an actorly pose. \u201cI\u2019m lucky being a performer because it means a lot of people will listen to me for the first 25 seconds, and for someone who wants to air ideas and political positions that\u2019s a great boon. But I don\u2019t articulate them because I\u2019m a performer. You have a responsibility to do it. I was instinctively very political from about the age of 13 and got involved in CND and anti-apartheid.\u201d<br>In 2014, he had a public spat with Michael Gove, the then minister for education, over whether Blackadder and Oh! What a Lovely War <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25612369\">should be shown in schools</a>. Gove thought they were unfair to the officer class; Robinson says that in reply he was \u201cvery robust about his [Gove\u2019s] failure to understand how teachers use teaching aids \u2013 it\u2019s not as though you wouldn\u2019t use Rupert Brooke to study the first world war because children might think the whole war rhymed\u201d.<br><br>Robinson insists his politics colours everything he does \u2013 even a round-the-world travel programme where he has chosen to travel by eco-friendly train and in which he often alludes to the effects of tourism and globalisation on the local population. <br><br>\u201cI see politics in everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t do is agitprop because I don\u2019t think it works. If you look at Maid Marian, that must have been the most political thing on children\u2019s television at the time. Look at Time Team \u2013 all of us were intensely political and passionate about bringing things to ordinary people who hadn\u2019t been to university and wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had them. Look at the documentaries I\u2019ve done.\u201d (Those include the powerful Me and My Mum in 2006 that dealt with his mother\u2019s dementia and her death in a nursing home.)<br><br>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership tested Robinson\u2019s lifelong commitment to Labour, and he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tony_robinson/status/1124297214472400898?lang=en\">quit</a> last year after 45 years in the party, citing antisemitism, the muddled response to Brexit and poor leadership. He hasn\u2019t yet rejoined \u2013 he says he will \u201cwait and see what happens over the next year or so\u201d \u2013 but gets a vote in the leadership election through his membership of Jewish Labour. He won\u2019t tell me how he voted, but hints strongly it was for Keir Starmer.<br><br>He is, however, doubtful whether the centre can reassert itself. \u201cAll of us who are interested in politics have been saying the centre cannot hold. I think we\u2019ll feel that in spades by the time we\u2019ve got through this [the coronavirus crisis].\u201d He thinks the lockdown we are now enduring will lead to a fundamental reassessment of politics, and of culture too. When the crisis is finally over, it is unthinkable that the arts can just pick up where they left off because the world will look completely different. \u201cSitting in our houses and flats over the next however long it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he reflects, \u201cwe have the luxury of reinventing everything.\u201d <br><br><em>Around the World by Train with Tony Robinson starts at 8pm </em><em>tonight on Channel 5</em></p>",

As a classically trained pianist, her acerbic, sinewy songwriting nonetheless resists convention, pulling in off-kilter percussion and woodwind to explore the outer reaches of what might otherwise be reduced to \u201cadult contemporary\u201d. Her singular approach to rhythm and instrumentation sometimes verges on vaudeville. But she is best-loved for her lyrics (and her voice), betraying a self-knowledge \u2013 and sometimes a bitterness \u2013 beyond her years, and honesty sometimes to a fault. \u201cWhen I have something to say, I\u2019ll say it,\u201d she has said.<br><br>The unwieldy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Pawn...\">90-word title of When the Pawn \u2026</a> is infamous, but Apple\u2019s second album is a perfectly-formed whole, running the gamut from rage to regret in just under 45 minutes. Produced by Jon Brion, with artwork and videos by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-thomas-anderson\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> (Apple\u2019s partner at the time), it featured Apple as sole songwriter on all 10 tracks, written following her fall from favour with the music industry. Two years earlier, she had accepted the prize for best new artist at the MTV Video Music awards with a controversial speech in which she expressed her ambivalence about celebrity and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVHQJlogH0k\">called \u201cbullshit\u201d on the entertainment industry as a whole</a>. It came to define her, transforming her, in her words, from a \u201ctragic waif ethereal victim\u201d to a \u201cbrat bitch loose cannon\u201d.<br><br>With When the Pawn ..., she returned deliberately and defiantly, on her own terms. The lurching piano of opener On the Bound sets the tone, Apple breathing nimble smoke rings in the verse (\u201cHell don\u2019t know my fury\u201d) before erupting into flames with the chorus (\u201cYou\u2019re all I need\u201d). Through defiance (A Mistake, Limp) and desperation (To Your Love), she comes to something approaching acceptance with I Know, her voice bruised and beautiful over brushed drum and double bass.</p> <h2><strong>The three albums to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tidal (1996)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOzayDpWoI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FFOzayDpWoI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Fiona Apple: Criminal \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Apple was 19 when she released her debut album, after a demo tape wound up in the hands of producer Andrew Slater via his babysitter; it went on to go triple platinum. She is still best known by many for the first single, Criminal \u2013 and the controversy surrounding her state of undress in its video. Apple wrote it in less than an hour at Sony\u2019s request for a hit. But opener Sleep to Dream \u2013 with its slumping, tumbling percussion and shimmery strings \u2013 better represents her singular style, somewhere between piano ballad and R&amp;B, with unflinching lyrical honesty to the fore.

The Idler Wheel is almost a folk-country record, and finds the 34-year-old older, wiser and more ready to take responsibility for turbulence in her relationships than she had been in the past. \u201cI could liken you to a shark the way you bit off my head / But then again, I was waving a bleeding old bone,\u201d she admits on Werewolf, before concluding: \u201cNothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Extraordinary Machine (2005)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azx6F2fYPa0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Azx6F2fYPa0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Fiona Apple: Oh Sailor \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After long delays, Apple\u2019s third album made its inauspicious debut unfinished on file-sharing sites; it was officially released months later and named album of the year by many outlets. Co-producer Brian Kehew has said Apple\u2019s lack of clear vision was one factor in the hold-up (along with a micromanaging record label), and that comes across in the finished product. Extraordinary Machine is Apple\u2019s most experimental record, as well as the most sonically rich \u2013 the opposite of what she would go on to achieve with The Idler Wheel seven years later. On Tymps (The Sick in the Head Song), every idiosyncrasy seems indulged, giving it the feel of a Disney soundtrack \u2013 or the Beatles at their most whimsical.</p> <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Across the Universe (1998)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A8FK3C2OOk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3A8FK3C2OOk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Fiona Apple: Across the Universe \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The most successful of Apple\u2019s covers, of a stylish repertoire (mostly from live sets) taking in Sinatra and Hendrix, is her take on the Beatles\u2019 Across the Universe, recorded for the Pleasantville soundtrack in 1998.

  "<p>A key worker responsible for preventing crime during the coronavirus outbreak is facing eviction after her landlord said her job meant she risked contaminating his family.</p> <p>Shannon Harford, a probation officer in west London whose job involves meeting prisoners out on licence, albeit from behind a screen, has been given just over a month\u2019s notice to leave the flat where she is a lodger. She said the decision showed \u201cno empathy or compassion\u201d.</p> <p>The landlord gave her notice before Thursday night\u2019s announcement by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, of a full ban on evictions for the next three months.</p> <p>Labour and renters\u2019 campaign groups had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-eviction-ban-promise-broken-say-critics\">accused the government of breaking its promise</a> to protect people from evictions during the coronavirus epidemic after emergency legislation tabled on Monday evening only extended the notice period that landlords must give tenants before they can evict them from two months to three. It did not include a ban on evictions currently under way, but they have now been included in new measures.</p> <p>Harford said on Friday she was nevertheless still leaving.</p> <p>\u201cIt is horrible for someone to make you feel like you are contaminated,\u201d Harford said. \u201cIn lockdown how am I supposed to do viewings or even move?</p> <p>\u201cI am aware of the health risk I am putting myself at by going to work,\u201d she said. \u201cI am passionate about keeping people safe. But that\u2019s not how they [the landlord] seem to see it.\u201d</p> <p>Harford is a lodger in a shared two-bedroom flat, which is also used as a home office by one of the owners. She was told the owner was \u201creluctant to work in his office as you are still going to work to meet people \u2026 We therefore would want to give you notice to the end of April\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe would put us at risk in a way,\u201d the landlord said, asking not to be named. \u201cBut I do understand the situation as well. It is not as if I am kicking her out on the street.\u201d He said she could go and live with her boyfriend, but she countered that this was an unreasonable assumption to make and that their relationship was relatively new. She is, however, now planning to do just that.</p> <p>Her case is an example of the confusion that has surrounded protections for renters. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-law-to-ban-uk-landlords-from-evicting-tenants\">Jenrick had promised</a> a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/complete-ban-on-evictions-and-additional-protection-for-renters\">\u201ccomplete ban\u201d on evictions</a> \u201cwhile this national emergency is taking place\u201d, but the coronavirus bill issued on Monday stated that landlord proceedings to evict a statutory tenant may not be commenced during the period of the crisis \u201cunless the notice period is a period of at least three months\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The housing charity Shelter said this did not protect around 20,000 renters who could still be evicted in the next three months where eviction cases were already in progress in the courts.</p> <p>\u201cThis means people trying to isolate or socially distance, and even some within the shielded group, could still lose their home in the coming weeks, and even more may face eviction by mid-June,\u201d said Polly Neate, the charity\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>On Thursday night, Jenrick bowed to pressure to widen the protections. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-support-available-for-landlords-and-renters-reflecting-the-current-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak\">said</a>: \u201cThe court service will suspend all ongoing housing possession action \u2013 this means that neither cases currently in, or any about to go in the system can progress to the stage where someone could be evicted.\u201d</p> <p>The suspension will initially last for 90 days, but can be extended, and will apply to all private and social renters in England and Wales, as well as those with mortgages and those with licences covered by the Protection from Eviction Act 1977.</p> <p>Shelter said Jenrick deserved \u201ca lot of credit for having listened and taken further action \u2013 as a result many thousands of people can now stay safe in their homes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNow that we know courts will not take forward any evictions, it is crucial that renters know that they are protected and that they can stay put,\u201d the charity said. \u201cEven if they do receive an eviction notice they should not feel pressured to leave whilst this coronavirus crisis is ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>Harford, however, started moving out on Friday.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> \n<p>So here is how my typical day begins. I wake up early and for a brief nanosecond all is well with the world. Then my mind turns to the nightmares I have consistently experienced for some months now and to the reality of the coronavirus pandemic. Anxiety electrifies me. It\u2019s not just some sense of existential dread, it\u2019s a parasitical physical entity that takes over my entire body.</p> \n<p>My shoulders and upper arms tingle with fear, there is a ball of dread in my guts and my legs cramp. I am literally immobilised for the best part of an hour. I know I should be getting out of bed, but I am too afraid to do so. Frequently, I close my eyes in a feeble attempt at mindfulness, repeat the serenity prayer \u2013 all those years in Narcotics Anonymous have paid off despite my having no belief in God \u2013 and hope that when I open them again I will somehow have acquired the willpower to get up.</p> \n<p>When I have eventually found the courage to get up, I do two sets of 20 press-ups. Partly as a way of staying fit, but mostly as it\u2019s the best way I\u2019ve found of releasing some of the terror-tension in my upper body. I repeat this at least eight times during the remainder of the day. Then breakfast, which is a piece of toast that I have to force myself to eat. At times of high anxiety, my appetite falls away. Still, I should be losing weight. Only after all this do I manage to catch up on the news and go back to my bedroom. At present I can\u2019t face being in my study at home. I feel too alone and unsafe. Bizarrely, having gone through this routine \u2013 though I can still scarcely read more than a page of a book at a time as my concentration levels aren\u2019t up to it \u2013 my mind settles a little and I can start work. Writing gives me, if not a momentary illusion of control, then at least a welcome distraction from my self.

The new rules are more or less the same ones I imposed on myself two weeks previously, when I started working from home and not seeing friends and family. It just feels like reality has finally caught up with my own sense of neurosis and anxiety. Which may be deeply worrying for most ordinary people, but is somehow almost reassuring for me. Almost.</p> \n<p>Not that I\u2019m not feeling a profound sense of loss. My children, other family members and friends feel unbearably distant despite the discovery that the phone can also be used as a phone, and I also miss all my Guardian friends \u2013 they are more than colleagues \u2013 with whom I have shared an office in Westminster for more than six years. I\u2019d also like to update you on one battle. Last week I wrote that I was at least looking forward to spending some of the refunds I would be getting on opera tickets already booked \u2013 the companies made a huge error in asking whether you wanted your money back or would donate the total ticket price as a gift; I would happily have donated 20% but there wasn\u2019t that option \u2013 and that my wife was insistent it be put towards mending things around the house that had been broken for years.

But my paranoia levels are now so high, I am worried that I may have been left off the list by accident and that the NHS has forgotten that I once had pneumonia when I was 16 and that I nearly had to have my leg amputated after my knee replacement became infected.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s also crossed my mind that the government may actually want to have me killed \u2013 sketch writers are probably high on Dominic Cummings\u2019 hit list \u2013 and has deliberately kept me misinformed. Anyway, I\u2019m taking no chances. Nor am I entirely reassured by reports from Spain and Italy that under-60s are getting preferential treatment for ventilators. If anyone knows how to doctor a birth certificate, please get in touch.</p> \n<p>Otherwise I am coping reasonably well, sticking to the rules and cycling up and down the same half-mile hill. I prefer my exercise to be mindless and repetitive, so that suits me fine. The one member of the household to be finding the new restrictions annoying is the dog. Initially he was thrilled to have both my wife and I at home, but now he is getting fed up with being taken for extra walks on the common. He\u2019s also taken to social distancing from us. Normally when we go to bed, he\u2019s the first up the stairs to nab the prime spot on the duvet. Now he\u2019s taken to sleeping at the bottom of the stairs. He needs a bit of me time.

The only story is coronavirus \u2013 who\u2019d have guessed Brexit could take a back seat so quickly? \u2013 and there is nothing remotely funny about the pandemic. So I\u2019ve often agonised over what tone to take. Most readers who have got in touch seem to think I have got it about right, but there are some who feel I should be less critical and get more behind the government. My feeling is there should always be room for light relief \u2013 I\u2019m using Shakespeare as my role model here \u2013 and that now, more than ever, journalists should be allowed to ask members of the government the tough questions. As such, my sketches have tended not to focus on the measures the prime minister has taken but on the ones he hasn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>I may be more health-anxious than many, but it seemed to me almost inevitable that what was happening in China back in January would be coming to Europe down the line. And yet the government did almost nothing except argue whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jan/31/britain-leaves-the-eu-to-virtual-bongs-and-god-save-the-queen-video\">Big Ben should bong for Brexit</a>, fail to deal with the floods and take 10 days off over the half-term break. Ministers may have been working flat out for the last three weeks, but if they had started a couple of months earlier we might have had a more coherent plan in place. Not to mention more coronavirus tests, ventilators and protective equipment for NHS workers. There\u2019s also been an undeniable sense of pathos to my sketches.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/lucky-man-sunak-dishes-the-dosh-and-eyes-up-johnsons-job\">Lucky-man Sunak dishes the dosh and eyes up Johnson's job | John Crace</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Boris has always longed to see himself as the next Churchill, but his response to the coronavirus was initially one of appeasement.

So what do I know?</p> \n<h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> \n<p>Shortly before 8 o\u2019clock last night, my wife and I rather self-consciously opened the front door and went out into the front garden expecting almost no one else to be around. Instead, nearly all our neighbours were out too and the applause for NHS staff \u2013 not to mention the klaxon that came from the balcony of the flats opposite \u2013 was prolonged and deeply moving. It was a wonderful moment of unity and I was only sorry that our next-door neighbour, who is a paramedic, wasn\u2019t also outside to hear how much he was appreciated. I\u2019m guessing he was working.</p> \n<p>Perhaps we should make this kind of thing a regular Thursday night event. We need all the community we can get. With so much terrible news, I\u2019ve started to appreciate the small things all the more. While out walking the dog, my wife pointed to some green shoots that we had passed the day before and had grown just a little more. Stuff I would ordinarily miss but am now training myself to observe. My garden is also coming back to life: I have recently given the lawn its first mow of the year, and almost all my bananas, ferns and architectural plants appear to have survived the winter, though it\u2019s still too early to remove their fleeces. One echium bush, covered with budding blue spiral thingies (a technical term), has already grown far bigger than I expected and really needs moving, except I can\u2019t bear to replant it in case I accidentally kill it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fded3c2070dc8dc96ab5e784cf6b16fd5aed234\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fded3c2070dc8dc96ab5e784cf6b16fd5aed234/0_66_480_480/480.jpg\" alt=\"One echium bush\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One echium bush</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Crace/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But my real highlight of the coming weekend will be the clocks going forward an hour so that it won\u2019t get dark till 7.30. It\u2019s a yearly milestone that never fails to fill me with hope even at times of deep despair. The extra evening daylight does wonders for my soul and I look forward to celebrating with a Diet Coke out on the patio. Even if it\u2019s raining.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott\">Ridley Scott</a>, the director of Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator and The Martian, has taken aim at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson over their leadership during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to Variety from his home in Los Angeles, Scott, 82, said he thought \u201cthis orange-headed fellow that\u2019s running us\u201d is \u201ca nutcase, isn\u2019t he\u201d?</p> <p>Looking more widely, Scott suggested that half the world\u2019s leaders were \u201cidiots\u201d and the other half \u201cdespots\u201d. \u201cThere are very few worthwhile ones,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone has half a brain, they wouldn\u2019t want to go into politics anyway, right?\u201d</p> <p>Scott, who was born shortly before the second world war, suggested that countries, the UK in particular, should reintroduce rationing because \u201cpeople are buying so much food and then the food is rotting\u201d.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cJesus, Boris, get out your thinking cap, cos what we\u2019re now talking on is an iPhone: a perfect coupon distributor to limit what you can buy each time you go to the shops. And that way, you have order. You must have order and calm.\u201d</p> <p>At the time of the shutdown, Scott was shooting The Last Duel, a drama set in medieval France, starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. He remains hopeful filming can resume later this year.</p> <p>Scott also said the disparity in the quality of coronavirus coverage across the US news networks was \u201cinsane\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI still think CNN\u2019s the best, and they are in dismay at how it\u2019s not being handled properly.\u201d</p> <p>Scott reiterated the advice for people to remain in their own homes, saying: \u201cIt\u2019ll be an experience of mild to severe flu for most people and old geezers like me have gotta watch my back.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Doug Paton burst from his trailer on a warm spring afternoon, he expected to confront yet another stray dog agitating the livestock on his sister\u2019s farm outside Victoria, a city on Canada\u2019s west coast. Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf.</p> <p>\u201cIt stopped dead in its tracks and it stared me down,\u201d he says. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the wolf trotted away, pausing once to stare back at Paton before clearing a five-foot metal gate and vanishing.</p> <p>\u201cJust like a person, you might not remember a name, but you never forget a face,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that face as long as I live.

From there, the wolf swam nearly two miles towards a scattering of tiny islands within sight of the city.</p> <p>In the eight years that followed, the wolf \u2013 named Takaya (the Lekwungen word for wolf) by the Songhees, a local First Nation whose territory encompasses the islands \u2013 quickly became a legendary figure, drawing fans from around the world captivated by stories of the resilience \u2013 and tenderness \u2013 of the young predator.</p> <p>But his life ended in tragedy on Tuesday, in a series of events that laid bare both the cold uncertainties of life in the wild and the limits of an often-strained bond between humans and wild animals.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Tayaka was a rare species of canine known as the coastal or sea wolf. These predators thrive in marine environments and have become adept at living off a diet of salmon, shellfish and seals instead of deer. Fifty years ago, there were few coastal wolves in the region, victims of overhunting and habitat degradation. Today an estimated 250 of them roam the 12,000 sq miles of Vancouver Island, a remarkable turnaround for the embattled predators.</p> <p>Two years after Paton\u2019s experience, Cheryl Alexander got her first glimpse of Takaya, in May 2014. Like many of the 370,000 residents of greater Victoria, the environmental consultant and photographer was curious about how the wolf could survive among the wind-battered trees of the tiny islands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ccdb3c7432740770756519eefb13aecad04cd2ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccdb3c7432740770756519eefb13aecad04cd2ea/0_0_5286_3529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya at the edge of Vancouver Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya swam two miles to a scattering of tiny islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She saw Takaya emerge from the ocean briefly and slip into the trees. The piercing howls that followed were a chilling and powerful experience. \u201cIt had emotions associated with it that were very melodic,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone was almost moved to tears.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Much of the excitement surrounding Takaya came from the unlikeliness of his journey. Few wolves have ever traversed the heart of Victoria, and the islands Takaya took up residence on were tiny, 10 times smaller than the narrowest known range for a wolf pack in the wild.</p> <p>Most notably, he arrived alone. Wolves almost always live in nuclear families; two parents and their pups. Occasionally, one will break away to form a new group. But the dangers of hunting \u2013 the sharp antlers and stomping hoofs of panicking animals \u2013 are often fatal for a lone predator. That Takaya travelled solo \u2013 and seemed content to remain alone \u2013 added to the myth and excitement.</p> <p>In recent years, new housing developments have marched steadily outwards from Victoria, swapping land that was once forested and wild for cul-de-sacs and two-car garages.</p> <p>But the chain of islands close to the city is a rare enclave of untamed nature. Pine and fir, punctuated by the rich amber hues of arbutus trees, create thick inland forests. Seals haul themselves on to the shores and small mammals \u2013 mink and otter \u2013 scurry among the rocks.</p> <p>Takaya quickly got to work, feasting on the seals and otters and sharpening his ability to catch fast-moving fish. But with no permanent streams on the island, he also had to use his ingenuity to survive. Drizzly winters created temporary wetlands, but summers in the region are dry. In a move that astounded biologists, he began digging wells on the island.</p> <p>\u201cHe really pushed the envelope of what\u2019s possible ecologically, both in terms of how he made his living, and the small amount of space that he actually required to do so,\u201d says Chris Darimont, a wolf expert at the University of Victoria and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Takaya was an \u201cextreme data point\u201d on the spectrum of anything researchers had previously encountered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6089046a3deaefe33a9a670b61c67786fdd0288b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6089046a3deaefe33a9a670b61c67786fdd0288b/0_0_2947_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya lying on a rock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya was known to dig wells to find drinking water in the dry summers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People began paddling out to the islands, hoping to catch a glimpse of this miraculous wolf thriving in the ever-vanishing wild around them.</p> <p>But as his popularity grew, fed by a steady flow of stories in the local media, government authorities feared a dangerous encounter with humans had become inevitable and in the summer of 2012 and winter of 2013, conservation officers set up a series of traps. But Takaya seemed untrappable, ignoring the bait laid out for him.</p> <p>Plans to capture Takaya put the province at odds with the Songhees First Nations, who vigorously protested the idea of removing the wolf. Long a symbol of the Lekwungen people, there was an excitement among the community that a wolf had finally returned.</p> <p>Resistance to capturing the wolf also unearthed longstanding grievances over control of the islands. Known as Ti\u2019ches in Lekwungen, the archipelago has long been a source of natural medicines found in the woods and fish in the surrounding waters. When the colonial government enacted a ban on traditional indigenous ceremonies in the 1800s, the Songhees would travel to Ti\u2019ches to practise in secret.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.discoveryisland.ca/\">Archival photographs</a> show large wooden structures along the shore, all of which have long disappeared; dismantled, destroyed or stolen over the years. Today the Songhees own all of Chatham Islands and share a portion of Discovery Island with the province of British Columbia. But even the name of the area \u2013 Oak Bay Islands Ecological Reserve \u2013 remains a vestige of colonialism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902ZX7t06JDDhXQ/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902ZX7t06JDDhXQ/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge piece of culture that\u2019s not known or appreciated,\u201d says Mark Salter, the former tourism manager for the Songhees Nation, who has worked to educate the public about the history of the islands. On numerous occasions, he has had to put out fires left by campers and pick up garbage left on the shore. \u201cPeople invite themselves out here, not knowing this is reserve land. But they\u2019re not welcome.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, a group ignored a ban on bringing pets to the islands, travelling with their two dogs. As they walked through the forest, they soon realised they had acquired a third canine in their group. The group panicked and scrambled on to the roof of a nearby lighthouse building, where they called coastguard rescue. Armed conservation officers also arrived, prepared to deliver a fatal shot if needed. Takaya was spared, but the encounter chilled Salter, who worried the wolf\u2019s fame, which only increased over time, could be his undoing.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Howls still echoing in her mind, Alexander began boating around the islands, eager to repeat her first encounter. This time she came prepared with telephoto lenses. Her early sightings of Takaya were rare and infrequent. He was ghostlike, quickly vanishing from view.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something very captivating about him,\u201d she says. \u201cFor whatever reason, I felt a really intense connection. I just wanted to learn about his life.\u201d She returned to the islands week after week. With permission from the Songhees Nation, Alexander was able to set foot in the forests where Takaya often hid. Walking gingerly among the pine and fir, she could sense his presence, even as he remained camouflaged among the trees and tall grass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ce75afa63a5781c171c8ea85704667def02f6a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ce75afa63a5781c171c8ea85704667def02f6a8/0_159_4896_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheryl Alexander speaks with Thomas Riemchen and Sheila Douglas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographer Cheryl Alexander, centre, with biologists Thomas Riemchen and Sheila Douglas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leyland Cecco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He began appearing \u2013 and vanishing \u2013 more frequently. In their hundreds of encounters \u2013 including one in which he sat just three feet from her \u2013 Alexander felt drawn to his tenderness. \u201cWolves want what we want,\u201d she says. \u201cThey play. They touch. They care deeply about other members of their family.\u201d It was these human-like characteristics that moved people the most. His lonely howls could often be heard from the city during calm weather. Wolves, like humans, crave companionship in some form. As Takaya aged, outliving most wild wolves, he did so alone.</p> <p>No wolf had ever been recorded living alone for so long, says Darimont. And lone wolves typically avoid howling, so as not to draw the attention of nearby packs. Nearly everything about Takaya, it seemed, was exceptional.</p> <p>In 2019, a documentary featuring Takaya that Alexander helped produce aired in Canada and on the BBC, further cementing his fame.</p> <p>Then, in February 2019, a lone female was spotted on the rocky shores of the mainland, across from where Takaya made his swim. Experts doubt she swam the channel \u2013 but her presence ignited hope that Takaya might soon be reunited with one of his own.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something about his aloneness \u2026 his alienation from his own kind \u2026 that spoke to people\u2019s own feelings of alienation and aloneness in the world,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cPlus, we\u2019re all hopeless romantics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2053d955437284cbeb0d83303fedd8eec7e5bc99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2053d955437284cbeb0d83303fedd8eec7e5bc99/0_0_5003_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya howling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya\u2019s howls could be heard in the city on calm days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others found strength in the wolf\u2019s solitude. Paton, whose spring encounter in 2012 was likely the first recorded sighting of Takaya, was locked in a bitter custody battle and divorce when the two crossed paths.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight any more. And then I saw this lone wolf and thought, \u2018If he\u2019s healthy \u2013 if he\u2019s doing fine by himself, then so can I,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cFrom that day forward, I just changed my attitude towards things. I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I felt more invigorated than ever to get things right in my life. And I never looked back.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after, Paton had the words \u201cLone Wolf\u201d tattooed on his forearms in permanent tribute.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>With all the success Takaya had enjoyed on the islands, no one is sure why, on 25 January this year, he dipped his 10-year-old body into the swirling emerald waters one last time and swam towards the city.</p> <p>Emerging from the ocean on the opposite shore, he was greeted by a scene of parks and forest, interrupted by condominiums and family homes. Darimont believes the most likely reason, despite the popular conception of Takaya as a lonely figure, was that he was overcome by the annual hormonal urge to mate, which occurs in January.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect he gave up tranquil retirement on the islands to go find a mate,\u201d he says. Conservation officers have their own theories. They believe a string of intense storms in the winter months, which had blown fierce winds across the islands, might have disrupted Takaya\u2019s access to food. The greenery of city parks across the water and the potential of a new source of food might have been enough to lure a hungry wolf.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22e7d03a9170b48a461d39e120436f0419052ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22e7d03a9170b48a461d39e120436f0419052ee5/0_0_4557_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beacon Hill park in Victoria city\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya was spotted in Beacon Hill park, a sprawling green space in downtown Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leyland Cecco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexander, however, rejects mating and food loss as likely explanations for Takaya\u2019s journey. In the days leading up to his departure, trail camera images showed a healthy, robust wolf. And if the previous nine years of hormones hadn\u2019t been enough to move him from the island in search of a mate, she wondered why \u2013 at nearly 11 years old \u2013 he suddenly felt the urge to leave. Instead, she feared he might have misjudged the swift ocean currents and been swept towards the mainland. Or that the sound of poachers on the island \u2013 hunting ducks in the winter \u2013 might have prompted the skittish wolf to seek refuge in the water.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt that he was intending to leave permanently. I just can\u2019t see it. It was his territory. It was really the only thing he knew. He\u2019d been there all of his life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For nearly 48 hours, Takaya, briskly trotting through parks and along sidewalks, led police on a wild chase through the city.</p> <p>The city remained transfixed as police posted the wolf\u2019s progress on social media. Alexander remembers a night riddled with anxiety as she received constant updates on the chase. Eventually police tracked Takaya to a house, finding him wedged between a garage and a fence. Alexander pleaded with officials to let her see Takaya, but was held back. \u201cI was nearby and I believe that he could smell me,\u201d she s ays.</p> <p>Takaya was sedated and carried upside down, his tongue hanging from the side of his mouth, and placed into a metal barrel.</p> <p>After snapping photos of his limp body being carried away, Alexander returned home to celebrate her husband\u2019s birthday and then went to bed. \u201cThe next morning, I just woke up, and cried,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Two days later Takaya was released back into the wild, emerging from the stupor of drugs on a gravel logging road. Conservation officers decided to relocate him more than 100 miles from the islands. He was moved inland, where the forest is thick and impenetrable, along the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island.</p> <p>Away from the familiarity and comforts of his small islands, Takaya faced a daunting list of new threats. Packs of wolves in the area might kill him if their paths crossed. Leg-hold traps, laden with bait, might prove too tempting to a starving wolf. Even the new prey \u2013 elk and deer \u2013 were unfamiliar. \u201cThere was tons of stuff that he hadn\u2019t had to deal with in his life,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cI was very worried.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b951b8e94ba2bd204293873fa54c54012a7a674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b951b8e94ba2bd204293873fa54c54012a7a674/0_0_4768_3576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya on Vancouver Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya on Vancouver Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNature is nature and you can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said conservation officer Mark Kissinger, who tranquillised Takaya and set him free, at the time. \u201cBut hopefully things go well for him.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Each time she visited the islands in the weeks that followed, Alexander was struck by an overwhelming sense of emptiness. \u201cThere\u2019s an absence now of energy. There\u2019s an absence of possibility,\u201d she said, steering her boat through a narrow channel one sunny February afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cHe gave us a portal into the wild and into nature \u2013 and into something that we often don\u2019t get to see. And if we do, it\u2019s only just a glimpse.\u201d</p> <p>Then, at the end of February, Alexander received an email from a woman who had spotted a wolf while out<strong> </strong>walking near the fishing community of Port Renfrew.<strong> </strong>It had peered at her from the forest and showed no signs of aggression when her dog approached it.</p> <p>Alexander travelled to meet the woman but returned home without any sightings. Then, that night, she was sent a photograph from a man who had a series of trail cameras in the area. Alexander took one look at the picture, and recognised Takaya.

  "<ul> <li><p><em>This article was first published on 3 February 2012</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>1) Scotland 1\u20130 England (1871)</h2> <p>It\u2019s \u201cabout three o\u2019clock\u201d on Saturday 5 March 1870, and at the Kennington Oval, south London, 22 \u201cexpert players\u201d of the Association Football code set the ball in motion for a kickabout. But it\u2019s no ordinary game: it\u2019s the first-ever England versus Scotland international!</p> <p>Except it\u2019s not, not really. Scotland\u2019s team isn\u2019t a Scottish team at all. Cobbled together by a shower down south, the \u201cScotland\u201d XI\u2019s star man is Mr WH Gladstone, Welsh son of the serving prime minister. Most of the rest of the side are Londoners born within the sahnd of yer actual Bow Bells. The game ends in a 1-1 draw, England scrambling an equaliser in the dying seconds, though the Scots aren\u2019t having any of it. The game won\u2019t count. Everyone will have to wait until November 1872 for the first official football international. (And what a game that will be, 0-0 between Scotland and England at the West of Scotland Cricket Club, Partick. But that\u2019s a tale for another day.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/13/the-joy-of-six-champions-sport-different-kinds\">The Joy of Six: champions | Daniel Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The impudence of the English in setting up the 1870 stramash without actually asking anyone north of the border about it! This sorry state of affairs led a collection of Scottish clubs \u2013 Edinburgh Academical, Glasgow Academical, West of Scotland, Merchistonian, and St Salvator of St Andrews \u2013 to challenge England\u2019s Football Association to an official international game of football. However, these clubs had \u2013 unlike the English, and a small smattering of folk in Scotland \u2013 yet to embrace association, and so the \u201cfootball\u201d challenge actually referred to the old rugby football rules.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the FA \u2013 concentrating on new-fangled soccer \u2013 ignored this challenge, but Blackheath picked up the gauntlet and set about arranging a squad to represent England in a rugby game to be held at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, on Monday 27 March 1871.</p> <p>And so to the game which, sad to say, was a lot of nonsense. With both teams fielding 20 men, the match was effectively a 100-minute maul. It didn\u2019t help that the English considered the pitch far too narrow; it restricted their speedy backs, and played into the hands of a fitter and stronger Scottish pack.</p> <p>After a scoreless first half, the Scots heaved Angus Buchanan over the line for rugby\u2019s first-ever international try. Whether it was kosher or not is a moot point: it was unclear whether the ball had been grounded, and referee Dr HH Almond \u2013 a local headmaster instrumental in the early development of rugby in Scotland \u2013 had a decision to make. With England complaining vociferously, he sided with the Scots, arguing that \u201cwhen an umpire is in doubt, he is justified in deciding against the side which makes the most noise. They are probably in the wrong.\u201d And yet Buchanan\u2019s try didn\u2019t trouble the scorers; all it did was give place kicker William Cross the chance to \u201ctry\u201d for a goal. Cross converted the kick for one rugby football point!</p> <p>England crossed the tryline themselves through Reginald Birkett \u2013 who would later play for the soccer team in between the sticks \u2013 but his try wasn\u2019t converted. Cross went over for Scotland \u2013 umpire Almond again at the centre of controversy, this time ignoring a knock-on \u2013 but he missed his second kick, and the game ended 1-0 to the Scots.</p> <h2>2) England 16\u201321 Scotland (1938)</h2> <p>One hundred years later to the day, Murrayfield staged a friendly to commemorate the centenary of that historic game. Once again, Scotland ran out victors, only this time it was a wee bit more resounding: England were hammered 26-6, having conceded a try after 13 seconds, captain John Spencer fumbling near his line to allow John Frame to nip through and score. The margin of victory \u2013 a five-try rout \u2013 was Scotland\u2019s biggest against England since 1905. The win capped a heady week for Scottish rugby. Scotland had won the Calcutta Cup seven days previously, winning at Twickenham for the first time in 33 years \u2013 and dramatically so, Peter Brown converting Chris Rea\u2019s last-minute try to edge out the auld enemy by a single point, 16-15. (They were also recipients of the wooden spoon in that 1971 Five Nations, but let\u2019s not fudge the point.)</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s previous win at HQ, in 1938, was one of the classic routs. Not that the winning margin \u2013 21-16 \u2013 was anything to write home about. But the Scots ran in five tries to England\u2019s one \u2013 tries were only worth three points in 1938 \u2013 and would have recorded a thumping victory had they converted all their scores. As it was, they missed all their conversions, though kicker Wilf Crawford can\u2019t be blamed too much: the match was played in mist and high winds, and he did belt over two penalties, one from over 50 yards.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s man of the match was Wilson Shaw, who set up the first, early try of the match with a kick to the corner, scored himself later in the first half, and sealed the deal with a sashay through a thicket of players late in the game; the Guardian talks of a \u201clightning\u201d player who \u201cran clean through the defence and scored amid pandemonium\u201d. Shaw was carried off the field \u201cshoulder high in triumph\u201d. It was just as well Scotland grabbed the opportunity to celebrate with both hands. Since Shaw\u2019s match, they have only subsequently won at Twickers on two occasions: the aforementioned 16-15 win in 1971, and a Roy Laidlaw inspired 22-12 win in 1983 which, while deserved, was a scoreline slightly embellished by seven points added in injury time.</p> <h2>3) Scotland 12\u201330 England (1980)</h2> <p>England sealed their first grand slam since 1957 here, ending 23 extremely dull years of waiting. Now, the game of the campaign was the rumble against Wales at Twickenham. Paul Ringer was sent off for the visitors after a 14-minute cameo which included two episodes of windmilling fists and a high tackle. A late try by Elgan Rees should have sealed the win for the Welsh \u2013 who had won four of the last five Five Nations \u2013 but Rees neglected to ground the ball near the posts, and the conversion was missed, all of which allowed England to steal the victory thanks to an injury-time penalty from Dusty Hare. Having already beaten Ireland and France, the triple crown, championship, and grand slam was on. \u201cIt is a great feeling, and a strange one, to have played three and won three,\u201d said captain Bill Beaumont. (His disbelief was understandable; England had been 8-1 shots to win the championship back in January, fourth in a field of five behind Wales, France and Ireland.)</p> <p>At Murrayfield, with glory beckoning against a team who had started the campaign as 20-1 outsiders, Clive Woodward stepped up to the plate for England. First he skedaddled down the left wing to set up Mike Slemen for the opening try of the game. Soon enough, he was repeating the trick down the opposite flank, John Carleton the beneficiary. Carleton quickly added another and, by the time 30 minutes were up, England were leading 16-0 and cruising to victory.</p> <p>After the break, Scotland started flinging the ball around, opting to run everything in the swashbuckling manner. They were rewarded with two tries \u2013 one a superlative solo effort by John Rutherford \u2013 but England went over the line two more times themselves, Carleton becoming the first player to score a hat-trick of tries since 1924. \u201cI am a bit resentful that some people have labelled us a poor side,\u201d said Beaumont after being hoisted around Edinburgh on white-shirted shoulders. \u201cIt seems like sour grapes to me. Any team that wins both away matches by scoring heavily\u201d \u2013 they had won 17\u201313 in Paris against a much-fancied French side \u2013 \u201cmust deserve the sort of rewards we have earned.\u201d</p> <h2>4) Scotland 6\u20139 England (1988)</h2> <p>Nobody would claim the Calcutta Cup as an aesthetic masterpiece \u2013 a stumpy little pot, it\u2019s the Gareth Chilcott of international sporting trophies \u2013 though it does have a beautiful history. Ex-pats in India had briefly formed the Calcutta Football Club in the mid-1870s, only to disband and melt down the remaining silver rupees in the club kitty (\u00a360 worth) to make a cup bearing the club\u2019s name, which the Rugby Football Union back at home could use for the big England-Scotland showdown. The three-handled cup \u2013 the handles being cobras, and an elephant on the lid \u2013 was first contested in 1879, retrospectively awarded to the teams for their earlier wins between 1871 and 1878, and has been an annual fixture, wars aside, ever since.</p> <p>Sadly, it is now jiggered beyond belief. England like to show it off in the Twickenham museum whenever they win it, but only from behind the glass of a safety case, inside which it revolves slowly like a prize on a 1970s game show. The Blankety Blank chequebook and pen of international sporting trophies HA. The most infamous damage to the trophy was sustained in 1988, when \u2026 ah, but first, the game. About which there\u2019s happily not much to say: Rob Andrew scored a drop goal, while Gavin Hastings and Jon Webb slotted two penalties apiece, one of Webb\u2019s a 50-metre matchwinner. \u201cEngland may have been the birthplace of rugby but today they effectively killed the game stone dead,\u201d cried Scotland coach Derrick Grant after the game, of the victorious side\u2019s spoiling tactics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as anyone who has ever quaffed real ale through hosiery will attest, rugby is not just about the football. And this dire spectacle was retrospectively transformed into one of the most memorable Calcutta Cup occasions at the after-match banquet. England had turned up late to the dinner, only to find the Scots \u2013 who had finished their Five Nations campaign and were busy unwinding \u2013 had drained all the free bottles of whisky that had been provided. Predictably enough, the event soon descended into a food and booze fight. In the bedlam, Scotland\u2019s John Jeffrey and English police constable Dean Richards filled the cup with champagne, dispatched the contents into Brian Moore\u2019s face, and scampered out of the hotel and down the Royal Mile. Richards was wearing a tea cosy as a hat.</p> <p>After an evening showcasing their passing and kicking skills on the cobbled Edinburgh avenues, the cup \u2013 along with the players \u2013 were the worse for wear the morning after. \u201cWhoopees with the rupees,\u201d punned the Guardian, reporting that blazers from both the Scottish and English unions were investigating the matter. Jeffrey was banned for six months, Richards for a game. An Edinburgh jeweller did his best to knock the battered old trophy back into shape, and the world \u2013 like the display case at Twickers \u2013 continued to turn. Although if this sort of charming buffoonery were to happen in today\u2019s painfully serious climate, you can bet your last melted-down coin that it would suddenly stop.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO3YaUdERpg\" title=\"\">5) Scotland 13\u20137 England (1990)</a></h2> <p>Both teams went into this match, their final game in the 1990 Five Nations, with a chance to win the grand slam. Only one team was given a hope, though. \u201cScotland will start as underdogs,\u201d reported the Guardian on the morning of the winner-takes-all slam showdown, a first in Five Nations history. \u201cEngland are the bookmaker\u2019s favourites at 3-1 on, at the climax of a season that has followed an ever upward curve. If international rugby was a rational business, then the Scots\u2019 creaking performances against the Irish and the Welsh would point to a severe drubbing by England. Thus far, David Sole\u2019s team have scored just five tries compared to England\u2019s 11, with two of them coming against the 14 men of France. In addition, the Scots have been missing a worrying number of penalties, while the England full-back, Simon Hodgkinson, has kicked 74 points in five games for his country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/20/the-joy-of-six-unsung-sporting-heroes-of-2017\">The Joy of Six: unsung sporting heroes of 2017</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If international rugby was a rational business \u2026 but when Sole led his men out slowly into the Edinburgh afternoon, a show of measured determination that put hot favourites England into a flat spin, we were offered proof that it was not.

Jeremy Guscott waltzed over for a try down the left to pull the score back to 6-4, but England would never draw level. Hodgkinson was unwilling to trust his boot in the high winds, so captain Will Carling was forced to run penalties \u2013 decisions the Scots took as arrogance. England\u2019s attempts to break through the thin blue line repeatedly came to nothing; Carling, Rory Underwood and Richard Hill were battered by John Jeffrey, Finlay Calder and Scott Hastings.</p> <p>When Tony Stanger bombed over in the right-hand corner to give the Scots a 13-4 lead early in the second half, the jig was effectively up for the visitors. England, defeated, nevertheless ended the championship with a points difference of plus 64, one short of the Five Nations record. But the Scots had grabbed the prize. \u201cThat solemnity was a totally conscious decision,\u201d said Sole of his pre-match psych-out. \u201cIt stemmed from the belief that we wanted England to know from the outset that a grand slam meant as much to us as it did for them, and we were not for a moment going to flinch or be afraid of the battle. The English were extremely confident; we were extremely hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish you could have heard some of the lip Finlay was giving them at the end of the lineout,\u201d added Jeffrey. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t print it if I told you.

There is no questioning what the greatest individual effort is. At the end of the 2003 World Cup final, Jonny Wilkinson famously kicked the drop goal that won the Webb Ellis Trophy for England. One thousand, one hundred and sixty eight injury-ravaged days later, he played his next game for his country. He made sure everyone noticed he was back.</p> <p>\u201cImagine Tiger Woods missing 30 major championships in a row then shooting a 63 in his comeback at the Open,\u201d wrote Robert Kitson in this paper. \u201cOr Roger Federer strolling into Wimbledon after an injury-strewn three-year sabbatical and not dropping a set in the first week.

Admittedly his try was dodgy in the extreme, and Exhibit A when you\u2019re arguing with any fool who claims video evidence in sport does away with controversy \u2013 Wilkinson\u2019s foot was miles into touch, but was waved through by the video referee anyway \u2013 but Scotland were on the end of a four-try battering anyway, Jason Robinson scoring twice, Magnus Lund the other.</p> <p><em>\u2022 With thanks to Cris Freddi</em></p>",

The research has involved hanging out with millenarian fruitcakes, disaster profiteers and the uber-rich, not to mention tooled-up, swivel-eyed anarcho-libertarians from America to Australia.</p> <p>Garrett became known in 2012 for climbing the Shard before it opened. As part of his ethnographical research into hidden aspects of cities he joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/09/shard-explorers-new-targets-london\">group of trespassers called London Consolidation Crew</a>. In 2014, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/22/oxford-university-academic-shard-jail-place-hacker-garrett\">pleaded guilty to committing criminal damage</a> during sorties into disused London Underground tunnels and published <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/urban-exploration-robert-macfarlane-bradley-garrett\">Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City</a></em>.</p> <p>The catalyst for his new book lies below Wiltshire. As part of his place-hacking adventures, Garrett had visited the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/dec/16/a-cinema-a-pool-a-bar-inside-the-post-apocalyptic-underground-future\">Central Government War Headquarters</a>, a 35-acre cold war bunker just outside Bath. The complex, called Burlington Bunker, under RAF Corsham, includes 60 miles of roads, 100,000 lights, sleeping quarters, a bomb-proof radio station, laundries, a drinking water reservoir, and a library from which Garrett nicked a few empty notebooks. \u201cI kept the notebooks with me, waiting for a story worthy of them. I finally saw my chance in 2016, when the secret city was listed for sale, put on the market for \u00a31.5m.\u201d One of the prospective buyers was Robert Vicino, whom Garrett calls a doomsday realtor, and who markets bunkers to survive whatever apocalypse you might dread. \u201cWhat these guys are selling is time,\u201d Garrett says. \u201cYes, they\u2019re selling space, but that\u2019s the wrapper. The time to hunker down is really what\u2019s on offer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6faf7c37eec9c3874ba4b8d4153db16592e09fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6faf7c37eec9c3874ba4b8d4153db16592e09fc/395_179_1051_630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We will survive as a species.

Hall transformed this Kansas facility into a 15-storey inverted skyscraper called Survival Condo, where up to 75 individuals can weather a maximum of five years inside. Half-floor apartments cost $1.5m, full-floor apartments $3m, while a 335-square-metre two-storey penthouse has sold for $4.5m. One resident made a year-long video film of the view from her Manhattan loft apartment over Central Park, during all four seasons, day and night, together with the cacophonous sounds of urban life. That film is now projected on to a wall of the silo, along with a mock-up of her balcony. The result? A Baudrillardian simulacrum to soothe her through five years in lockdown, while above ground presumably resembles a scene from <em>The Walking Dead</em>.</p> <p>In <em>Bunker</em>, Garrett discusses Navajo and Hopi cosmology, which posits that the era we live in now \u2013 the \u201cFourth World\u201d \u2013 is likely to end as a result of human hubris. \u201cThose Native Americans were on to something,\u201d he says. But his sense is that disaster gives us an opportunity to rethink how we live. What will we learn? \u201cThat so much of what we do is bullshit. Work life destroys the planet because of travelling everywhere.\u201d I suggest that he sounds like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/21/books-interview-david-graeber-the-utopia-of-rules\">the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber</a>, whose 2013 article <a href=\"https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/\">\u201cOn the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs\u201d</a> suggested many people spend their entire working lives performing tasks they believe to be unnecessary. \u201cHe\u2019s right!

But I\u2019ll tell you something \u2013 it gives me solace right now.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett tells me that he began work on the book expecting to meet \u201cthe kind of people who are so rich that, after they\u2019ve bought the second and third homes and the yacht they wonder what other real estate to buy. Hence bunkers.\u201d But he also met people who regard survivalism as an antidote for an ailing species poised to plummet into an abyss of its own creation. Most are evangelical Christians. Among them are a group of women in Tennessee who live off-grid, crafting and repairing stuff rather than buying it. They, too, are readying themselves for the apocalypse, whether brought on by AI, nuclear catastrophe or Covid-19.</p> <p>There is a collective noun for all the people preparing for the end \u2013 preppers \u2013 and 1% of the United States population, or 3.7 million people, self-identify as such. Not that they form a homogeneous group. In fact the bunker crowd are despised by a sub-group called prepsteaders. \u201cStockpiling guns and food buckets is only going to get you so far,\u201d Daisy Luther, the self-styled Organic Prepper, told Garrett. \u201cSoon you\u2019ll need people who know how to build things, grow things. We\u2019ve all become consumers that don\u2019t produce anything. We\u2019ve got to flip that logic on its head.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b48cf5f4f6fff97acd0ae49fdcda76ce36da9480\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b48cf5f4f6fff97acd0ae49fdcda76ce36da9480/0_0_1689_1127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The library in Survival Condo, Kansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disaster reading ... the library in Survival Condo, Kansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SurvivalCondo.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/time-to-join-preppers-survive-climate-change-apocalypse\">Preppers use acronyms</a> that Garrett helpfully explains in his book\u2019s glossary: they are, for instance, ready for TEOTWAWKI (The End of the World as We Know it). Many have packed Inch bags (I\u2019m Never Coming Home), and believe that when the government isn\u2019t providing essential services, it\u2019s best to be a Yoyo (You\u2019re on you own).</p> <p>Spending time with preppers has changed Garrett. He recently spent two months driving more than 11,000 miles across Australia in a Jeep Wrangler bug-out vehicle with his partner, Amanda, imagining the apocalypse. And now he\u2019s ready to leave at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cI always reverse my car into the garage,\u201d he says. And instead of keeping his Inch bag under the bed, he has it \u2013 tent, basic supplies, stove, sleeping bag \u2013 stowed in the boot for a quick getaway. \u201cCities are not the place to be in extremis. When the shit goes down, better to be in Idaho.\u201d He cites the French Marxist Paul Virilio, who worried that as space and distance were compressed by speed and connectivity, we would become more vulnerable to disaster. \u201cIn other words, progress and disaster go hand in hand,\u201d Garrett explains.</p> <p>He also draws on the wisdom of Drew Miller, whom he interviewed for the book. Miller\u2019s slogan is \u201cprepare for the worst, enjoy the present\u201d and the former USAF colonel\u2019s business model involves constructing 12 survivalist encampments across the US, each for 50-500 people, and built to repel attacks by roaming post-apocalypse hordes. By buying into Miller\u2019s scheme, for $1,000 a year, members can use the spaces to holiday, and then retreat to them as disaster strikes.</p> <p>Miller, whose staff call him Captain Paranoid, wrote the chillingly titled novel <em>Rohan Nation: Reinventing America After the 2020 Collapse</em> and published a paper arguing that cities are bad for you. Unlike \u201cthe largely rural, resilient population that weathered the 1918 flu pandemic \u2026 our urbanised society, dependent on electricity, daily deliveries of food\u2026 is a dependent population that may face both a much worse virus and economy in total collapse with widespread loss of law and order\u201d. Garrett is sympathetic to such doom-mongering, writing in <em>Bunker</em>: \u201cThe 1918 Spanish flu pandemic alone infected 500 million people, killing off 3-5% of the world\u2019s population. If such a pandemic tore through the world\u2019s major cities today, spreading via international trips by plane and sea, we\u2019d lose a lot more that 500 million people.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that appeals to him about prepping is a newfound sense of agency. \u201cWe\u2019re all familiar with dread, aren\u2019t we? Well, dread is unbearable because it has no object, so you can\u2019t do anything about it. Overcoming the dread is what it\u2019s about. When we give shape to the things we dread, we make them manageable.\u201d Having agency in the face of disaster is particularly appealing to Americans in 2020, he argues. Garrett grimly offers a reminder of the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/donald-trump-barack-obama-legacy\">Trump in 2018 dismantled</a> the Obama-created National Security Council directorate charged with preparing for a pandemic. \u201cWhen the government doesn\u2019t prepare for emergencies, you do it yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"027cecdc88c794f45d239fbc0dac06970d7bcbd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/027cecdc88c794f45d239fbc0dac06970d7bcbd0/0_0_7861_5243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prepper long-term food storage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lunch buckets ... prepper long-term food storage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley L Garrett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garrett\u2019s suggestion is that behind such ill-advised cutbacks lurks the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/steve-bannon-far-right-radicalise-europe-trump\">uber-disruptor Steve Bannon</a>, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist. For Bannon, short-term disaster is to be welcomed, perhaps even provoked, since it can be used to leverage power. Garrett notes that Bannon would arrive for White House meetings with a book called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/04/white-house-agenda-collapse-global-order-war\">The Fourth Turning</a></em> under his arm. That book, by William Strauss and Neil Howe, proposed a cyclical understanding of history called generational theory, which holds that major events take place in 100-year cycles. Each cycle is made up of \u201cseasons\u201d lasting roughly 25 years: growth (The High), maturation (The Awakening), entropy (The Unravelling), and destruction (The Crisis). For the past 20 years, the US has been in entropy. But after entropy, narcissism and spiritual decay comes revivifying destruction. At least, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up\">Bannon argued in his 2010 film </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up\">Generation Zero</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up\">.</a></p> <p>But if cultivating chaos for political ends sounds like a manifestation of American exeptionalism, Garrett suggests we should consider what happened in 2017 at a hotel in London. Bannon and Jacob Rees-Mogg met to discuss how to further the conservative cause in the UK. Garrett writes: \u201cIt seems no small coincidence that both men were the puppet masters behind what we might call \u2018pro-collapse governments\u2019 in both the US and UK. Leaders in these movements see chaos as an opportunity to seize wealth and power.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s more, Garrett reminds us, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans\">Rees-Mogg\u2019s father, William, was one of the authors</a> of the 1997 neoliberal text <em>The Sovereign Individual: How to Survive and Thrive during the Collapse of the Welfare State</em>, which opens with the quote \u201cThe future is disorder\u201d, from Tom Stoppard\u2019s play <em>Arcadia</em> and predicts that digital technology will make the world hugely more competitive, unequal and unstable.</p> <p>I suggest to Garrett that it is not only neoliberals who yearn for disorder to revolutionise the world but a certain type of Marxist, too. \u201cExactly. And prepping is caught in the middle of those narratives. On the one hand prepping is to do with living communally and on the other it\u2019s shooting at people who want to get into your bunker.\u201d As many businesses shut in the US last week, footage emerged on social media of long queues outside LA weapons stores as residents flocked to buy guns.</p> <p>For those of us without millions to sink into silos, there is an alternative. \u201cBloom where you\u2019re planted,\u201d Daisy Luther says. Sustainability, self-sufficiency and community, Garrett agrees, are the keys to survival. The lesson he takes from the preppers he met is that \u201cdisasters aren\u2019t ends but irreversible transitions \u2026 They\u2019re always something less than an extinction. Catastrophe, by its very nature, falls short of finality. It\u2019s the end of <em>something</em> but never the end.\u201d</p>",

He noted that cases of cruise ships being turned away from ports as a result of coronavirus fears began as early as January and escalated in February, with passengers being quarantined on the Emerald Princess in Japan on 3 February.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a level of greed on the part of these companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to make every penny \u2013 and they make money when people are on the ships.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cruise ships are drawing increasing government scrutiny for not doing enough to protect their passengers during this pandemic. In Florida, the attorney general\u2019s office is investigating potentially misleading sales practices, after the Miami New Times obtained leaked emails showing representatives for Norwegian Cruise Lines may have downplayed the coronavirus in sales pitches to passengers, even as the pandemic was disrupting trips. \u201cThe Coronavirus can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise,\u201d said one sales script obtained by the paper.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebe162f544392e494a07e7ce06bf4d29a7edcac8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebe162f544392e494a07e7ce06bf4d29a7edcac8/0_44_2918_1752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers sit in quarantine aboard a cruise ship in Fremantle, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers sit in quarantine aboard a cruise ship in Fremantle, Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite Donald Trump\u2019s repeated vows to bail out the cruise ship industry, money for cruise companies was not a part of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/senate-stimulus-bill-coronavirus-2-trillion-list-what-is-in-it/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3\">$500bn</a> in aid for large employers included in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/25/coronavirus-relief-stimulus-bill/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3\">stimulus bill</a> passed by Congress on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Most of the major cruise operators register their companies in countries such as Panama and Liberia, thereby avoiding most US taxes and labor laws. Thus, the cruise industry\u2019s trade group said on Thursday the companies will not have access to the US aid for large employers, according to the Washington Post.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile a report from the US Centers for Disease Control this week laid the blame on cruise ships for spreading the virus in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak, linking hundreds of cases to the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess.</p> \n<p>\u201cCruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of their closed environment, contact between travelers from many countries, and crew transfers between ships,\u201d the CDC report concluded.</p> \n<p>Back aboard the Zaandam, passengers are passing the time however they can. Some chat with other cabins on a Facebook group, others enjoy the free liquor, snap pictures of brown boobies flying outside their windows, or partake in meditation, yoga classes and a daily quiz offered via the ship\u2019s TV.

  "<p>\u2018We all know that the president is a pathological liar,\u201d Mehdi Hasan says from his office in Washington DC. \u201cBut the lies he\u2019s been telling about the coronavirus \u2013 they\u2019re no joke; they cost American lives. The US media\u2019s failure to call Donald Trump out on those lies in real time makes part of the media, I\u2019m sorry to say, partly complicit in those deaths, too.\u201d Hasan, who moved from the UK to the US in 2015, is that rare species of TV interviewer: not in it to make friends, to network or to gain access. His passion for grilling his subjects is only matched by his frustration at his peers who do not do the same.</p> <p>When the White House press corps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/29/white-house-correspondents-dinner-michelle-wolf-stuns-media-with-sarah-sanders-attack\">turned on the comedian Michelle Wolf</a> after the 2018 White House correspondents\u2019 dinner and defended Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, it was the last straw for him. In that moment, he realised that the US media is almost \u201cirredeemable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to stand up against this administration\u2019s secretary, then who?\u201d A credulous New York Times headline in the wake of the 2019 El Paso shooting, \u201cTrump Urges Unity vs Racism\u201d, was, to him, just another stitch in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/07/trump-praises-new-york-times-headline-that-sparked-uproar-after-shootings\">the pattern of this submission</a>. \u201cThe American press doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat, and so things are just reported straight.\u201d</p> <p>Such forthrightness has served Hasan well. Not only have his hard-hitting political interviews become regular viral hits, he has also become a fixture on the high-profile US cable news circuit. Rumours are beginning to circulate on the east coast about offers to host his own show on a US network. On such approaches he is coyly amused when I ask him, maintaining only that he very much loves his job at the moment.</p> <p>As an interviewer, he is relentless, a quality that boosted his profile after Trump came to office and the US media seemed unable to land a glove on the new president or his surrogates. As a columnist for the online magazine <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/\">the Intercept</a> and the host of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/\">UpFron</a>t and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/headtohead/\">Head to Head</a> on Al Jazeera English, Hasan has developed a reputation for somehow managing to nail dissimulating politicians by being forensic and refusing to move on until his point is made. His technique is simple. \u201cMost people ask the question and move on whether they get an answer or not,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan, 40, was already a successful journalist in the UK when he moved to the US to host an interview show for Al Jazeera English. An established pundit and political analyst with a diverse journalistic background, he has worked in TV at Sky News and Channel 4, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/15/ed-miliband-mehdi-hasan-james-macintyre-review\">co-authored a book about Ed Miliband</a>, and served stints as the political editor of the New Statesman and political director of the Huffington Post UK. For all that it seems like a charmed career, Hasan describes it as \u201crandom\u201d. He started out on the bottom rung as a freelance news assistant at ITN and puts his success down to those \u201cwilling to take a chance\u201d on him.</p> <p>But it was in the US where he really began to cut through. Clips of his Al Jazeera English interviews began to catch fire online. A clash with the Trump adviser and Fox News regular Steven Rogers in November 2018 heralded Hasan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbh2Y-V0Cqc\">arrival in the mainstream</a>. In it, he questions Rogers on Trump\u2019s lies on birth right citizenship, among other falsehoods. Rogers starts out with bluster before quickly squirming and deflating under Hasan\u2019s barrage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d3ffb139275ca686cd3a5a675b0e7835241c41d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3ffb139275ca686cd3a5a675b0e7835241c41d/56_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mehdi Hasan interviews Steven Rogers on Al Jazeera English\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mehdi Hasan interviews Steven Rogers on Al Jazeera English.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Jazeera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To date, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan/status/1062706401804455937)\">clip of the interview</a> in which Hasan pummels Rogers has had almost 8m views on Twitter alone. It brought him to the attention of Seth Myers, who, when interviewing Hasan, called the Rogers interrogation \u201cthe template for talking to people within the Trump-sphere\u201d. Hasan has recently also developed a following among Hollywood stars with an activist bent. Mark Ruffalo tweeted the Rogers interview saying: \u201cThere is such thing as the truth, even today. This is how a journalist does their job to uncover it.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan seems an unlikely figure to break America. And he has done it thanks to online word of mouth; shares, clicks and endorsements from high-profile figures. He is a practising Muslim and unabashedly leftwing. He is abrasive and pugilistic, with an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">endless appetite for Twitter beef</a> that is often beneath him. He sees these \u201coutsider\u201d qualities, as he calls them, not as weaknesses but as strengths that enable him to transcend the pitfalls of a US news media paralysed by an old-fashioned courteousness towards those in political office.</p> <p>But despite the rough edges, he is a public school boy, and he admits that the confidence his private schooling and Oxford education (he studied that favourite of future prime ministers, Politics, Philosophy and Economics), has been invaluable in compensating for the fact that there are very few people like him in the British or US media. The \u201coutsiderness\u201d was from being a Muslim and the son of immigrants.</p> <p>He describes the household he grew up in as, although conventional, \u201cdisputatious\u201d. And Hasan certainly enjoys sparring, but one gets the sense that it is not just this that holds the key to his interviewing technique. It is a lack of respect for power, for default authority, that animates him. \u201cWhen I used to watch American TV religiously during the Bush and Obama years,\u201d says Hasan, \u201cI would joke about if you parachuted in a John Humphrys or a [Jeremy] Paxman, what would happen? The British press, the British media, for all its flaws, does not have this culture of deference when it comes to interviewing a person in power. I am amazed that the press stands up when the president enters the room. They don\u2019t do that for Boris Johnson.\u201d</p> <p>Even in the US, he says, the interviews that create a buzz are those by British interviewers: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwN1py3dV2g\">Emily Maitliss talking to Sean Spicer</a>, or Andrew Neil to rightwing controversialist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VixqvOcK8E\">Ben Shapiro</a>. \u201cShapiro lives on US TV, not just on Fox, on CNN, on Bill Maher and all sorts of shows. Why did it take Andrew Neil to come along and poke holes in the complete facade of Ben Shapiro? There\u2019s a culture of deference not just to people in power, it\u2019s the politeness. You have to get in people\u2019s faces.\u201d</p> <p>It is something he advises British journalists to do with Johnson, for whom Hasan interned at the Spectator, when the now prime minister was the magazine\u2019s editor. He recalls a genial and polite Johnson, but remembers how the \u201cuntucking of the shirt and the ruffling of the hair\u201d was clearly a deliberate act before meetings. While he does not believe that Johnson is as bad as Trump (who he says is \u201cunique\u2019 in his pathologies), he sees the danger of Johnson\u2019s populism and the media\u2019s complicity in both creating him and continuing to be soft on him. \u201cI use the L-word, \u2018lie\u2019, I use the R-word, \u2018racism\u2019. In the Trump era, you have to be able to use these words. In the Brexit era, you have to be able to use these words. And there\u2019s still a real shyness and reluctance for journalists to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9573083fbfba6f1d77754b4ec3449842193b1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9573083fbfba6f1d77754b4ec3449842193b1ee/0_105_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mehdi Hasan being interviewed on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tables are turned \u2026 Hasan being interviewed on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hasan\u2019s righteousness is infectious, but it has not always served him well. A zealous address he made over a decade ago to a Muslim congregation in the UK has cast a long shadow. The remarks are recycled and used against him by his opponents on a regular basis. His observations, caught on camera, on <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/al-jazeera-host-mehdi-hasan-apologizes-for-past-criticisms-of-non-believers/\">non-Muslims</a> (\u201ccattle\u201d), homosexuals and atheists, are hard to style out. He has addressed these comments often, most recently on Twitter, where he said: \u201cLike a lot of journos (humans?) I\u2019ve said things years ago that I now deeply regret.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask him about this, he is prepared. \u201cDumb comments,\u201d he says. But his contrition is laced with a defiance, because he believes that non-Muslims are not held to account in the same way. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s comments haven\u2019t stopped him from being prime minister, ones he hasn\u2019t even disowned. Why?\u201d he asks. \u201cBecause I\u2019m Muslim; there\u2019s no debate about that.\u201d</p> <p>His argument is borne out by an incident last July when Marco Rubio posted a clip of a 2018 Hasan interview with Ilhan Omar, aggressively edited to make her appear racist against white people. \u201cIt increases abuse and death threats to her, and to me. I wish I could switch off,\u201d he says. The political climate in the US is one of constant threat to public figures such Omar and himself.</p> <p>Despite the prejudice and scrutiny that he says he and other Muslims and minorities in the public eye face, he sees a counterintuitive solidarity with Muslims developing in the US. Trump has been so nakedly Islamophobic and xenophobic that it has pushed \u201cmany people off the fence\u201d, he thinks. The \u201csilver lining\u201d is that the open season on Muslims and immigrants has created a group of Trump\u2019s opponents that is happy to support them. Hasan\u2019s American experience is of a country that is becoming less Islamophobic and less anti-immigration, even as Trump\u2019s Islamophobic rhetoric intensifies. He maintains that he has been embraced warmly by many in the US media, and is often asked for interview tips.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9f681e89b63ca5e8c36e50d523ba3d77a0e87aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f681e89b63ca5e8c36e50d523ba3d77a0e87aa/0_270_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mehdi Hasan on UpFront\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hasan on UpFront \u2026 \u2018You have to get in people\u2019s faces.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Jazeera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When talking about this welcome, an earnestness and warmth creeps into his voice. Hasan has clearly been on a journey over the past few years, and when he talks about what really drives him, the professional interlocutor tenor, which sometimes feels like a hammer dropping relentlessly on an anvil, changes to a softer tone. \u201cFundamentally it\u2019s about one thing, it\u2019s about avoiding the dehumanisation of other people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe No 1 issue in my lifetime right now is tribalism. I\u2019m going to be there for human rights and civil rights. When I see the stuff I said in my 20s, across the board should I have been more careful? Yes. Because you cannot speak about people in sweeping terms. That is the No 1 lesson of life.\u201d</p> <p>That, however, doesn\u2019t mean he holds back on sweeping terms when criticising the rest of the US media.

  "<p>While epidemiologists are still trying to come to grips with the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, with different models predicting different outcomes, the pundits are already certain \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/coronavirus-effect-economy-life-society-analysis-covid-135579\">coronavirus will change the world permanently</a>\u201d. Social and traditional media are also full of hot takes, mostly that coronavirus will change globalization \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/the-coronavirus-outbreak-shows-us-that-no-one-can-take-on-this-enemy-alone\">hugely for the better</a>\u201d and that it could \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-coronavirus-kill-populism-11585004780\">kill populism</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike these pundits, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but comparative analysis and historical experience warn against such big expectations. On the former, let\u2019s just look back a mere 10 years, and see how much \u201cglobalization\u201d has changed since the Great Recession. The answer is: not much. In <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-guide-to-the-financial-crisis--10-years-later/2018/09/10/114b76ba-af10-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html\">the US</a>, banks are bigger than ever, Wall Street is handing out near-record bonuses again, and almost no one of significance went to jail.</p> <p>But if the structures remain unaffected, will the players be changed? Will \u201cpopulism\u201d be the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-next-victim-populism-uk-boris-johnson-us-donald-trump/\">next victim</a>\u201d of coronavirus? Many hundreds of columns have been written about the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-pandemic-leadership-131540\">incompetent</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKgq0rnIR7g\">dangerous</a>\u201d responses by Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, who, we are told, have shown us the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/05/the-coronavirus-is-exposing-the-limits-of-populism/\">limits of populism</a>\u201d. But, despite the obsessive coverage of these two leaders, they are not the only populist leaders \u2013 they are and not even the best examples of populists.</p> <p>If we look a little bit further, we see very different responses by populists around the world. There are some highly prominent examples of the stereotypical approach, ie populists denying reality, distracting the public with conspiracy theories and offering slow and halfhearted policies. Far-right presidents like Trump and his Brazilian wannabe, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/brazils-bolsonaro-coronavirus-concern-overblown-69782788\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, are much-cited examples, though the Mexican president, <a href=\"https://www.americasquarterly.org/content/politics-amlos-coronavirus-approach\">Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador</a>, a nominal leftwing populist, is hardly better.</p> <p>But other populists have taken the threat much more seriously. In fact, in <a href=\"https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/17/mps-praise-dutch-pms-covid-19-speech\">the Netherlands</a>, the populist radical right Forum for Democracy (FvD) and Party for Freedom (PVV) have criticized the mainstream coalition government of conservative Mark Rutte for being too lax, and have been urging him for weeks to not just close the borders, but adopt similar \u201clockdown\u201d policies to those most other EU countries have enforced. And let us not forget that the hardest-hit country in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51810673\">Italy</a>, which has in many ways set the tone for responses elsewhere on the continent, is governed by a coalition of the center-left Democratic party and the populist Five Star Movement.</p> <p>Similarly, in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html\">India</a>, Narendra Modi, one of Trump\u2019s biggest allies and the leader of the largest populist radical right party in the world, has locked down his country of 1.3 billion people for 21 days. \u201cEvery state, every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,\u201d Modi stated. To be fair, this kills two birds with one stone, as his government has faced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52015464\">mass street protests</a> over a host of issues in recent months, which will now become impossible.</p> <p>Other populist leaders have used the coronavirus to push through authoritarian \u201cemergency measures\u201d too. Viktor Orb\u00e1n is continuing his transformation of <a href=\"https://hungarianspectrum.org/2020/03/21/kim-lane-scheppele-orbans-emergency/\">Hungary</a> into an authoritarian regime with draconic new measures, while Benjamin Netanyahu has used the coronavirus to execute an <em>autogolpe</em> (self-coup) in <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/israel-suspends-two-branches-government-battle-over-democracy-long-history\">Israel</a>, suspending the courts and parliament. But many non-populist leaders have declared states of emergency too, whereas some populists, including surprisingly Trump, have (so far) done little.</p> <p>In short, there is not one single \u201cpopulist response\u201d to the coronavirus pandemic. There is not even a single \u201crightwing populist response\u201d. Populist parties and politicians have responded very differently, in part depending upon whether they are in government or opposition. They are also faced with very different contexts, both in terms of number of infections and control of the media.</p> <p>For example, while Johnson and Trump are criticized daily by the majority of their respective national media, and have to rely on the uncritical loyalty of their supportive conservative media complex, populist radical right leaders in Hungary and Poland have full control of the state media, which boast about the low level of infections, without telling their audience about the low level of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phil_ipp_fritz/status/1242778265414221825\">tests</a> in the country.</p> <p>It is far too early to make grand predictions on how the coronavirus will change the world. But we can already say that it will almost certainly not \u201ckill populism\u201d, for the simple reason that \u201cpopulism\u201d does not have one, unitary response to the pandemic. Based on recent historical experience, I would put my money on the coronavirus crisis having at best a moderate overall effect on populists: some will win, some will lose and some will stay the same.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia.

  "<p>It was the end of the school day in early December 2018 and Ben, my eight-year-old, jumped into the passenger seat of my silver Ford Ka. He attended the same primary school I taught at, so we had a very easy routine. I turned the key in the ignition and we set off for the 30-minute drive to our home in Essex.</p> <p>We chatted about all the normal things: what he wanted for dinner, what homework he had. About five minutes from home, I pulled on to a fairly busy dual carriageway. Our turning was two miles away, so I navigated into the left-hand lane. I was doing 65mph. The radio was on and Ben turned it up when his favourite song came on. Singing along with him to Paris by the Chainsmokers was the last thing I remember.</p> <p>In the months since, Ben has filled in what happened next. He turned the music up, we were singing, and he asked me a question. Apparently, I was staring into space, eyes wide open, not blinking. I didn\u2019t answer. He looked over at me and yelled: \u201cMum?!\u201d He thought I was joking around. He waved his hand in front of my eyes, trying to make me blink. But after about 10 seconds, I started shaking vigorously. I was dribbling and my eyes rolled into the back of my head. Because my muscles were tensing, my foot pushed down on the accelerator and the car sped up. Ben knew something was really wrong.</p> <p>I gripped the steering wheel tightly, then let go. That\u2019s when we began swerving to the right. Other cars were beeping. We crashed into the central reservation and scraped along it as the car continued to pick up speed. Ben said I was still shaking and making strange noises. My foot was jammed on the accelerator, so Ben leaned over and took the wheel. He steered us back into the right-hand lane. But we were getting faster and approaching the car in front. He steered into the left-hand lane, where the same thing happened; again he was able to avoid an impact.</p> <p>Eventually, my foot slipped off the accelerator and we started to slow down. I\u2019d gone completely limp and was slumped over the wheel. Ben saw the grass verge and navigated us there, putting the hazard lights on in the process. He was scared, he said, because he didn\u2019t know what was happening, or if the car would speed up again. But when we reached the grass, the car stalled. If he hadn\u2019t taken control we could easily have had a high-speed crash that could have killed us and other road users.</p> <p>People in a van had noticed what was going on \u2013 they had thought it was someone drunk and had sped up to drive parallel to us. They said that they saw me slumped over the wheel and Ben\u2019s hands reaching over from the passenger seat, steering the car. They pulled over with us when our car stopped. One of the men opened the driver\u2019s door and asked if I was OK. Ben kept saying: \u201cPlease save my mummy.\u201d</p> <p>When I came round, it felt as if I\u2019d blinked. I turned to Ben and said: \u201cWhere are my keys?\u201d I was trying to find them and Ben said: \u201cMum, something happened.\u201d I laughed because I thought he was joking.</p> <p>Then I realised we were on the side of the road, and saw people standing around the car, and that the passenger door was open. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d never passed out before. I\u2019m fit and healthy, and I\u2019d felt fine all day. It didn\u2019t feel real.</p> <p>The men from the van stayed with us until the ambulance arrived. At the hospital, tests indicated I\u2019d had a seizure. I may never know why it happened. Ben had been so brave during the whole experience, but once we got to the hospital and he saw my partner, he ran over to him for a cuddle and had a little cry.</p> <p>After you have a seizure, you can\u2019t drive for six months, so my licence was revoked. I\u2019m driving again now. I\u2019d always thought of myself as a good driver \u2013 confident and careful, especially when Ben\u2019s in the car. I passed my theory and driving test first time, with no minors. But sometimes, now, particularly if I\u2019m alone, I feel nervous.</p> <p>A taxi driver behind us caught it all on his dashcam, and the footage ended up <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000g0r2/saved-on-camera-series-1-episode-8\" title=\"\">in a BBC show</a> about people who are filmed on CCTV saving lives. Everyone always asks Ben how he knew what to do. But he doesn\u2019t think he did anything special. He was cool, calm and collected. I\u2019m so proud of him. Ben\u2019s always a great passenger; this is proof that when he\u2019s older, he\u2019ll be a great driver, too.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>As told to Sophie Haydock</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>The nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak has led to big drops in air pollution across the UK\u2019s major cities, new data analysis shows.</p> <p>Levels of toxic pollutants were likely to fall even further, scientists said, as traffic remained off the roads but prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic returned. Current easterly winds are bringing additional pollution from continental Europe to Britain.</p> <p>The data shows drops in tiny particle pollution of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, falls of about quarter in Manchester, York and Belfast, with smaller declines in Glasgow and Newcastle. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution, the data also shows declines of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, and drops of 10-20% in the other cities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:43:36/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Particulate matter pollution graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:43:36/embed.html\">Particulate matter pollution graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Air quality improvements have been seen in nations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\">around the world from Italy to China</a>, as much transport and industry has ground to a halt. Public health experts have warned that the health damage inflicted on people by longstanding air pollution is likely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/17/air-pollution-likely-to-increase-coronavirus-death-rate-warn-experts\">increase the death rate from Covid-19</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe air is definitely much healthier,\u201d said Prof James Lee at York University and the <a href=\"https://ncas.ac.uk/en/\">National Centre for Atmospheric Science</a>, who analysed the data. \u201c[Tiny particles and NO2] are the two air pollutants that have the biggest health impacts on people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese are big changes \u2013 pollution levels are the equivalent at the moment of a holiday, say an Easter Sunday,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we will see an even starker drop off when the weather changes.\u201d</p> <p>The data comes from background air monitoring stations in cities, sited away from main roads. \u201cWe chose these because that is where people live,\u201d said Lee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:44:11/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Nitrogen dioxide levels graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:44:11/embed.html\">Nitrogen dioxide levels graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The average pollution levels for the six-week period before the onset of coronavirus outbreak around the 10 February were compared with the six weeks after. Lee also compared the period after the outbreak with the average of the same period over the last five years. Both comparisons showed large cuts in pollution.</p> <p>The analysis is preliminary as full calibration of the data takes time, but Lee said it was very clear there had been a significant fall in pollution. The biggest factor is the reduction in road traffic, as other contributors such as gas power station operations, heating for buildings and emissions from farms are unlikely to have changed overall.</p> <p>One pollutant \u2013 ozone \u2013 has risen. This is because chemical interactions in the air normally result in NO2 and small particles reducing ozone levels. So as they have fallen, ozone has risen. But Lee said: \u201cThe ozone increases are small, and it usually doesn\u2019t become a problem until the summer months anyway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:44:23/embed.html\" data-alt=\"ozone air pollution fall due to coronavirus\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:44:23/embed.html\">ozone air pollution fall due to coronavirus</a> </figure>  <p>Some scientists have suggested that the number of early deaths avoided due to cleaner air <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/17/air-pollution-likely-to-increase-coronavirus-death-rate-warn-experts\">might potentially outnumber the deaths from coronavirus</a>. \u201cIt is going to be a very interesting epidemiological study, but they take years to do,\u201d said Lee. He said analysis would be difficult because the health impact of the coronavirus was fast, while that of air pollution was slower, and because older people were most at risk from both factors.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no silver lining to the Covid-19 situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it shows we can actually achieve quite a lot without travelling. It shows that if we did work from home more in normal times then we would have an effect on air pollution.\u201d</p> <p>Levels of NO2 in most urban areas of the UK have been illegally high since 2010 and many areas have levels of small particles above the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. This pollution is estimated to cause about 110 premature deaths every day.</p>",
  "<p>Workington Asda is stripped of tinned marrowfat peas and rich tea biscuits, the online store says. No ETA on stocks, either. Cumbria is prepping. I ponder the merits of tinned mushy peas instead \u2013 always a touch tasteless \u2013 then wonder if I can placate with fig rolls. My mother, in her 80s, is being guarded like a rare Faberg\u00e9 egg, albeit a furious egg that finds this enforcement ridiculous. House arrest is a very strong term, but I am not above a rugby tackle. \u201cNo marrowfat peas in west Cumbria?\u201d she gasps down the phone.</p> <p>Now this is a dire situation. This week\u2019s column was meant to be about a jocund lunch at The <a href=\"https://www.dorchestercollection.com/en/london/the-dorchester/restaurants-bars/the-grill-at-the-dorchester\">Dorchester</a> Grill in Mayfair. Oh, wasn\u2019t the lobster thermidor tart delicious? Boy, life came at me fast.</p> <p>It came for millions and millions of people, now bombarding supermarket online sites and hoping, praying, for a delivery slot. Each time I try to amend the order, the website falls over, punch-drunk and exhausted. For a few terrifying minutes, it flounders. Then it stands up again and refreshes, suggesting frozen petits pois and mint Viscounts as alternatives.</p> <p>Seven hundred people died in Italy today, another window on my laptop says. A whole generation is fading. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they were probably all auld bodies,\u201d mother says. \u201cIt\u2019s done a lot of us buggers a favour.\u201d I check out her order quickly, adding some Cornettos, which we used to eat together in the 1970s when the ice-cream van came before Corrie. My order being accepted is a tiny glint of positivity in what has been a very odd day.</p> <p>Millions will be in my position right now, choosing groceries for the isolated. It\u2019s a delicate process. What we eat at home, behind closed doors, is personal. Our secret snacky peccadilloes do not bear scrutiny. When I was young enough to work at the Guardian Guide, we once covered our go-to TV dinners; my love of cheap tinned soup with marge-slathered Ryvita and mini pickled onions was shameful to admit.</p> <p>Similarly, it takes days of gentle questioning to reveal the things the isolated actually want, once they\u2019ve got over refusing help or being grateful. \u201cA jar of beetroot, sliced, not whole,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cSome microwave meals for the freezer, but none with fish. Heinz chicken noodle soup, but not cream of chicken.\u201d \u201cNo fish,\u201d I write on my whiteboard, where, via columns of to-do lists, I aim to ride out this planetary blip.</p> <p>I began gathering three weeks ago, in tiny stages, surreptitiously, ashamed of being seen as dramatic. Some chickpeas here, some rice pudding there. I bought these as they quarantined Lombardy. By the time they closed Spain, I was shredding and freezing spring greens and putting individual anchovies in ice-cube trays, which felt incredibly proactive but was, I know now, merely displacement activity. \u201cI\u2019ve never really liked fish,\u201d my mother tells me on one of our now twice-daily phone calls. \u201cBut I do like sardines in tomato sauce.\u201d This is totally new information. What else do I not know about her?</p> <p>When the madness passes, which it will, because all things do, I hope we remember how the supermarket staff really served us. It\u2019s ironic how many of us slagged off these places for decades, told the masses to avoid them. Let\u2019s all eat risottos of foraged acorns made with small-batch artisan butter from our bi-weekly farmers\u2019 market! And then this happened, and the Aldi car park is full of Audis jam-packed with Super Noodles. It\u2019s almost as if River Cottage never happened.</p> <p>I hope we remember the selfless hard work of the till workers and midnight shelf-stackers, the people on self-service checkouts who sort our unexplained item in the baggage area problems without maintaining a safe distance. Forever touching the screens we\u2019ve just touched, keeping the queues moving and, by default, breathing in our germs. As shoppers ransacked the pasta and fought over UHT, they had no time to plan for their own families or to watch rolling news or to think too hard if their sweat was the mark of hard work or a fever. I would hug, if I could, the team at my Sainsbury\u2019s Local, who open at dawn every day, always jolly, with the shelves restocked with small amounts of almost all vital items. I\u2019m especially indebted to the drivers whom I\u2019m trusting to get to my mother. They\u2019re taking up the slack on what is now my biggest life problem. I\u2019m trusting total strangers to feed her, not upset her, not frighten her, to keep their distance and to leave the boxes somewhere handy. And to explain to her why there are no rich teas. I wouldn\u2019t call that job unskilled at all.</p>",

  "<p>Nostalgia isn\u2019t what it used to be. And neither is children\u2019s telly. Even before the internet made viewing anything possible at any time, the explosion of cable channels such as Nickelodeon and CBeebies churned out enough comedies, cartoons and TV movies to turn any child\u2019s eyes square.</p> <p>Not so in my formative years, the late-60s to mid-1970s. We had time to burn then, especially when that nice Mr Heath was prime minister and only made us go to school three days a week. Of course, we were free to roam the streets without fear, unlike today\u2019s forcibly school-deprived youngsters; plus, indoors, the TV was rarely on. Kids\u2019 programmes \u2013 practically <em>any</em> programmes apart from the lunchtime news and Watch with Mother \u2013 didn\u2019t start on the BBC until 4pm.

Likewise summer holidays, and Saturday mornings. I\u2019d venture the Beeb only owned about a dozen kids\u2019 series, which it played in rotation. Every holiday. For years. Searching YouTube for the theme tunes brought it all flooding back. If you liked your children\u2019s TV in English, you could enjoy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5CHUxn9kCo\">Daktari</a>, about a vet in east Africa starring Clarence the cross-eyed lion, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hps6L5vS0sc\">Casey Jones</a>, about a wild west train driver, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsQwBNMFWfI\">Champion the Wonder Horse</a> (wild west heroics of a boy and a wild nag), <a href=\"http://www.tvparty.com/50-whirlybirds.html\">Whirlybirds</a> (helicopter pilots for hire), <a href=\"banana%20splits%20intro\">Banana Splits</a>, or the homegrown fun of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsEeVOchA78\">The Double Deckers</a> (starring a young Peter Firth and Aswad\u2019s Brinsley Forde). The rest \u2013 perhaps reflecting a national mood to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/22/uk-enters-europe-eu-1-january-1973\">join Europe</a> \u2013 were dubbed efforts by our continental neighbours: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc_09iQ4l5k\">Belle and Sebastian</a>, a sort of modern Heidi with a cute boy and a white mountain rescue dog (after which the Scottish band named themselves); <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoxHhYyRIL0\">The Aeronauts</a>, about a pair of swinging French air force pilots; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRLJYbXHAuI\">White Horses</a>, the one with the pretty girl on the ranch where they grow Lipizzaner horses; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Sb9AoirSU\">The Flashing Blade</a>, a swashbuckler about a French chevalier and a garrison besieged by an army in tin hats, possibly Spaniards (the historical context wasn\u2019t immediately clear to a boy in Kent).

I\u2019ve got it on VHS in the loft. Over 13 episodes, it faithfully retells Daniel Defoe\u2019s epic story of shipwreck, loneliness and the rescue of a companion, Friday, from the clutches of cannibals. By today\u2019s standards, the pace is rather slow: its Austrian star, Robert Hoffman, bimbles about catching goats, or rigging up a rope bridge to his wrecked ship to salvage candelabras and barrels of rum. I was in the Cub Scouts back then, and I can tell you it was slow enough to keep up with his knotting technique. I\u2019ve watched this Crusoe so many times I feel confident in my bones that, should I become shipwrecked, I\u2019d be able to fashion a comfortable home out of poles and fronds with my eyes closed, using the very same knots.</p> <p>My DVD collection completes the rest of the schedule regulars: start with a Tom and Jerry cartoon, or Herg\u00e9\u2019s Adventures of Tintin; practise survival with Robinson Crusoe; let off steam with Laurel and Hardy (check out Busy Bodies, The Music Box or Towed in a Hole); and end the morning with a classic Elvis Presley film.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZCPkHCf8O8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jZCPkHCf8O8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s more for the afternoon.

Wherever Batman would have a fight, the Monkees would sing a song and run around giddily. I didn\u2019t know 50 years ago that David Jones, Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith were a band stitched together in the head of a US television producer.

The televisual light that has never dimmed for me shone, for once, on ITV. My favourite ever kids\u2019 programme is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2009/feb/07/gerry-anderson-thunderbirds-memorabilia\">Thunderbirds</a>, best marionette-based, gadget-rich kids action drama of all time. Who wouldn\u2019t want to work for International Rescue? It\u2019s got futuristic flying machines, a funky pink Rolls-Royce driven by an ex-con butler, and an inventor called Brains. The team\u2019s arch enemy is a psychic villain who lives in a Burmese temple and makes people faint when his eyes light up.

Most of us will get bored and crave our old freedoms \u2013 shopping, going to the pub, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/24/its-not-a-holiday-police-clear-sunbathers-from-london-park-during-coronavirus-lockdown-video\">lounging in the park</a> with friends as the weather warms up. While trapped inside, many of us will rely on technology to pass the time.

The effects of self-isolation \u2013 countless hours with often no more company than a computer screen \u2013 are also the perfect conditions for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-gambling-firms-urged-to-impose-betting-cap-of-50-a-day\">online gambling</a>. Gambling companies have realised this and already appear to be using our newfound isolation to their own advantage. Where quarantine has meant a downturn for many businesses, gambling companies may see this period as a huge opportunity to increase their profit margins.</p> <p>My inbox has been inundated with messages about targeted advertising, and offers aimed at people who usually place sports bets to trial other much more addictive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-gambling-firms-urged-to-impose-betting-cap-of-50-a-day\">casino-style games</a> instead.</p> <p>For some people, online gambling may be a welcome, fleeting distraction from the real world \u2013 a momentary interruption to an otherwise monotonous day. But we\u2019ve seen time and again how unscrupulous this industry can be, where money seems to matter more than customers\u2019 safety and wellbeing.</p> <p>The industry long resisted a stake reduction for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-fobts\">fixed</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-fobts\">-odds </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-fobts\">betting </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-fobts\">terminals</a> (FOBTs). Earlier this year it emerged that some companies only allowed customers to watch live matches if they opened betting accounts. Just two weeks ago, the gambling firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/record-116m-uk-gambling-fine-meted-out-to-betway\">Betway was given a record fine</a> for accepting stolen money from high-spending VIP customers, some displaying clear signs of addiction.</p> <p>I am deeply concerned that as we move further into this crisis, greater numbers of people will turn to online gambling as a distraction. In the absence of legislation, the industry itself must act responsibly. This week I wrote to the industry and called on them to impose daily spending limits. The companies haven\u2019t been receptive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/fear-of-covid-19-is-a-mental-contagion-ben-okri\">Fear of Covid-19 is a mental contagion \u2013 and that's something we can fight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than ever, we need online gambling companies to introduce a \u00a32 stake for slot games, and greater controls on casino content. Such limits introduce \u201cfriction\u201d \u2013 slowing down the speed of play, and preventing problematic gambling. Indeed, introducing a \u00a32 limit has dramatically reduced the harm associated with FOBTs.</p> <p>Online gambling isn\u2019t regulated by the same rules that exist for machine-betting shops or arcades, where there are stake or spend limits. Sitting at home on your computer, you can spend thousands of pounds in minutes, with little, if any, restrictions.</p> <p>If the industry were to impose reduced stake limits, it would demonstrate that they are willing to both protect their customers\u2019 safety and exercise some moral judgment. We are all facing a period of great uncertainty. I hope the gambling industry will take the necessary steps to protect the vulnerable at a time when it\u2019s needed most.</p> <p>\u2022 Carolyn Harris is the Labour MP for Swansea East</p>",
  "<p>The fight to ban plastic bags, many of which end up polluting oceans and rivers, has taken a step backward as conservative US think-tanks exploit the fear of Covid-19, campaigners have said.</p> <p>Articles warning that reusable tote bags are worse than plastic ones for spreading coronavirus have been linked to major rightwing nonprofits such as the Manhattan Institute, and contain misinformation aimed at defeating or repealing plastic bag bans, said Greenpeace USA.</p> <p>The effort \u201crisks further confusion\u201d amid a global public health crisis, it said.</p> <p>Recent studies have found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic and steel for <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home\">up to three days</a>, compared with 24 hours for cardboard and four hours for copper. The studies have not examined how long the virus remained on tote bags and there is little scientific evidence comparing reusable bags with plastic.</p> <p> Last week a number of US states and cities nevertheless took the decision to roll back plastic bag bans, citing the coronavirus. Maine repealed its ban. The governor of New Hampshire went further by issuing an order banning reusable bags, saying they risk spreading coronavirus. The governor of Massachusetts banned reusable bags and lifted plastic bag bans. And New York state, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/01/new-york-plastic-bag-ban-starts\">implemented its plastic bag ban</a> on 1 March, will <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/governor-bans-reusable-shopping-bags-10-new-coronavirus-cases-reported-in-nh/ar-BB11w3nC\">delay enforcement</a> until June.</p> <p>The moves follow articles by researchers at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) \u2013 a libertarian nonprofit instrumental in persuading the Trump administration to abandon the Paris climate agreement \u2013 suggesting reusable grocery bags are riskier than plastic, and in a journal published by the Manhattan Institute suggesting sustainable bags can carry viruses for up to nine days.</p> <p>While nonprofits are not required to disclose their donors, both have reportedly received money from fossil fuel companies. Among the sponsors for a CEI gala last year were the Charles Koch Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-cei.html?auth=login-facebook\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Greenpeace USA criticised the Manhattan Institute and the CEI for a series of articles suggesting that reusable bags are a higher risk for transmitting coronavirus than plastic bags, misrepresenting recent research that shows the virus survives at least as long on plastic.</p> <p>Such misinformation is already being used to lobby state legislatures to defeat or repeal plastic bag ban legislation, it said.</p> <p>John Hocevar, Greenpeace USA\u2019s oceans campaigner, condemned what he described as industry groups that have \u201cseen the crisis as an opportunity to exploit people\u2019s fears around Covid-19 to push their pro-pollution agendas\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven in the short term, plastic does not inherently make something clean and safe, and we should not confuse corporate public relations with factual medical research,\u201d Hocevar said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11b67b5579d63120dc8eeba7e42fdd3a19625d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b67b5579d63120dc8eeba7e42fdd3a19625d29/0_0_5165_3098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio distributes reusable bags in Union Square Park on 28 February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York was the third US state to outlaw non-biodegradable carrier bags, but the ban is yet to be enforced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similar moves are under way in Britain, where the environment secretary, George Eustice, has waived the 5p charge on plastic bags for supermarket shoppers online. Eustice said it was a temporary measure aimed at reducing potential cross-infection between delivery workers and those in isolation, and to speed up deliveries.</p> <p>Plans to further reduce single-use plastic, under the environment bill, have been put on hold due to Covid-19.</p> <p>The timing of the Welsh government\u2019s plans to restrict single-use plastics is also under review, it told the Guardian.</p> <p>In the US, the misinformation campaign against reusable bags ramped up after two recent studies. The first, from the University of California, published last month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, reported that viruses similar to Covid-19 could remain on plastic for up to nine days. The <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home\">second</a>, published on 17 March in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic for up to three days. The viruses could be inactivated by disinfection. Neither study examined reusable bags.</p> <p>However, the day after the first study was published, the Plastics Industry Association wrote to the US Department for Health and Human Services, urging the government to make a pronouncement supporting single-use plastic. The association claimed \u201cstudy after study\u201d showed reusable bags to be a health risk. It did not mention the University of California study.</p> <p>Then on 12 March, the City Journal, published by the MI, ran an article claiming: \u201cThe \u2018sustainable\u2019 bags that environmentalists and politicians have been so eager to impose on the public \u2026 can sustain the Covid-19 and flu viruses and spread the virus throughout the store.\u201d</p> <p>The piece, headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/banning-single-use-plastic-bags-covid-19\">Greening our way to infection</a>\u201d and written by John Tierney, cites unnamed research that Tierney claims showed viruses and bacteria can survive on tote bags for nine days. It offers no evidence to back this claim \u2013 in fact, it links to a study showing viruses <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/how-long-coronavirus-last-surfaces.html\">can remain on plastic for nine days</a>.</p> <p>The piece also quotes <a href=\"https://www.neha.org/node/60021\">a 2018 study</a> published in the Journal of Environmental Health where researchers found traces of a surrogate virus on surfaces and the hands of shoppers and store staff high enough \u201cto risk transmission\u201d. They recommended in-store hand hygiene and washing reuseable bags. They did not compare the risk of reusable bags with new plastic bags.</p> <p>Another piece by Tierney, with a similar argument, appeared in the New York Post entitled \u201cUsing tote bags instead of plastic could help spread coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Washington Examiner published a piece by Angela Logomasini of the Competitive Enterprise Institute on 18 March, a day after the New England Journal of Medicine study, headlined: \u201cPlastic bag bans aren\u2019t helping us fight against coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>Logomasini quotes the same 2018 study as Tierney, as well as a 2011 study on reusable and plastic bags that looked at bacteria, not viruses, and was partly funded by the American Chemistry Council.</p> <p>Ivy Schlegel, a researcher at Greenpeace USA, said: \u201cThis is a classic PR tactic. After new studies showing Covid-19 lasts longer on plastic, they have pulled back into their bag of tricks to redeploy old studies, linking them to legitimate public fear of the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Hocevar said: \u201cThe truth is that we don\u2019t have all of the answers to this Covid-19 emergency yet, and for industry to use this as an opportunity to increase profits for the fossil fuel and plastics sectors is dangerous and irresponsible.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we do know is that there is no substitute for strict hygiene. Just because a material is made from single-use plastic does not make it less likely to transmit viral infections during use; in fact, plastic surfaces appear to allow coronaviruses to remain infectious for particularly long periods compared to other materials.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe decisions we make for our families in this health crisis should be based on science and the advice of medical professionals, not lobbyists for the fossil fuel and plastics industries. Wherever reusables are an option, it is incumbent upon all of us to do our part to protect one another by washing them thoroughly after every use.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"036d632110d4bf69eac2cd224311f6f63e725abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/036d632110d4bf69eac2cd224311f6f63e725abb/0_0_5275_3517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic bags tangled in the branches of a tree in New York City\u2019s East Village neighbourhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenpeace USA have said reusables should continue to be used wherever they are an option.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for the Manhattan Institute said: \u201cA clear reading of Mr Tierney\u2019s City Journal article shows support of his argument by multiple scientific studies on the use of reusable bags in supermarkets.

She said: \u201cGreenpeace\u2019s assertions that promoting clean single-use plastic bags over reusable ones exploits Covid-19 fears and is part of a pro-pollution agenda are ridiculous.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly helpful \u2013 not exploitative \u2013 for people to point out the relative risks associated with reusable grocery bags and single-use plastic bags. Greenpeace basically admits that the reusable bags can harbour dangerous pathogens, including Covid-19, by explaining that people should wash them after every use.\u201d</p> <p>A CEI spokesperson said: \u201cAngela Logomasini is a well-respected expert with 30 years of working on plastic issues.

Sign up and Quarantine Chat (via the app Dialup) will phone you randomly, approximately once per day. Or sign up for themed calls at scheduled times \u2013 read Tarot cards with a stranger on Thursdays; read poetry together on Tuesdays; compare weekend projects on Saturdays; chat about farming on Sundays.</p> <p>Created by the artists Danielle Baskin and Max Hawkins, <a href=\"https://quarantinechat.com/\">Quarantine Chat</a> is a \u201cresponse to the coronavirus causing people in cities to be in quarantine, isolating humans from each other\u201d. Though Baskin and Hawkins began Dialup a year ago as a way to connect communities in random one-on-one calls, Quarantine Chat officially launched on 1 March.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought it was for cheering up people in self-isolation or in quarantine, but it became more relevant as cities started mandating lockdown,\u201d said Baskin. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing so many stories from people using it \u2026 Someone in Connecticut spoke to someone in London and exchanged recipes. Someone in Pakistan matched with someone in Oman while he was out grocery shopping.\u201d</p> <p>To explain why this was instantly compelling to me, I\u2019ll say this: I was a teenager in the 1990s, during the nascent era of AOL chat rooms, when corresponding with anonymous strangers was a common after-school activity. I liked the phone, too, and I spent so many hours talking to friends and crushes \u2013 \u201cWhat are <em>you</em> thinking about?\u201d \u2026 \u201cI dunno, what are <em>you </em>thinking about?\u201d \u2013 that the shape of the phone would become imprinted on my face. Quarantine Chat seemed a nostalgic echo of that time, providing a one-on-one human connection during a time of chaos.</p> <p>My first call came Saturday afternoon. I picked up the phone to some jazzy elevator music and a recorded message inviting me to talk to a stranger about my weekend projects. And suddenly I was talking to Antony in Moscow. It was almost midnight there, cold and dark, he said, with just a bit of snow on the ground. I told him about the blue Arizona sky, the smell of orange blossoms wafting through the open windows, the midday sun. We talked to one another as we worked on our projects. Mine involved disinfecting doorknobs. He was building an app. I told him I\u2019d just begun to get concerned about coronavirus. He said he was staying away from his parents because of their age, but that he wasn\u2019t too worried yet. We talked about art \u2013 my writing and his watercolor paintings of mountains and oceans, places he has never been. After 45 minutes, my children began demanding snacks. Before we hung up, Antony told me: \u201cI think, just don\u2019t panic. But if you can write about this time, you should.\u201d</p> <p>The day unrolled like thread. I scrubbed and did laundry and watched the news, which seemed to be constantly breaking. I began to doubt the possibility of additional grocery store runs and took everything out of my pantry to assess my supply. I set a trap for the mouse who had eaten through part of my toilet paper stash overnight.</p> <p>I had just turned off the lights in the house when my phone rang. \u201cHave I got a story for you,\u201d said the woman on the phone, who turned out to be E from California. Weeks ago, E was exposed to Covid-19 at work and became symptomatic. When she went to the hospital for a test, she was escorted into an isolated exam room by nurses in hazmat suits. She could not leave the room even to use the bathroom, so they brought her a toilet seat with a bucket attached. They swabbed her, took chest X-rays, and sent her home to quarantine. After a week and a half in home quarantine, she was still waiting for her test results.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The gift of this time is to really think about what is important, and who is important</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At home, she grew sicker, and there was a moment when she wondered if she would die. \u201cI thought, is this it?\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd then I thought, what the hell am I doing with my life?\u201d</p> <p>In that moment, it was so clear. She didn\u2019t want to spend her life working in an office. She wanted to be outside. She wanted to ride her dirt bike every day. Maybe, she said, when this is all over, she\u2019ll go back to her rural acreage on the east coast, back to her kind neighbors and her rescue horse. We wondered out loud to each other: how many times have we made decisions to follow a lover or a job? What would we choose instead if we listened to the deepest part of ourselves?</p> <p>\u201cThe gift of this time is to really think about what is important, and who is important,\u201d she said. We talked until we were both falling asleep \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s like a remote sleepover,\u201d she laughed \u2013 and then we said goodnight.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>I woke up to a slew of breaking news alerts on my phone, new death tolls, a stock market freefall, the emergence of the hashtag #QuarantineLife. I also woke up sick \u2013 runny nose, sore throat, earache, but not the telltale Covid-19 fever or cough. The world suddenly seemed particularly small. I began thinking of each part of my house as its own tiny country, the hallway with its terrible carpet running like a border between east and west. Panic began: What if long-term quarantine lasts through summer? How will anyone be able to afford rent or food or supplies? What if this is the beginning of a new society? What if we can\u2019t actually go vote?</p> <p>To distract from impending doom, I sat with my kids at the kitchen table and we made a list of activities: Mario Kart tournament. Virtual Trivial Pursuit with my brother and sister-in-law 2,000 miles away. Write a letter. Read a book. Take a walk. Try to break the world record of trampoline bounces. Put on a play over FaceTime. Learn to play the guitar. Bake something.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The thing that feels the strangest is that we are sitting ducks. That this thing is moving toward us, that all we can do is hole up and wait</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At 1.30, I picked up a call from Quarantine Chat. The prompt asked us to think of something that used to scare us but doesn\u2019t any more, and to discuss it with our phone partner. If I\u2019m being honest, I said to a Postmates driver in Chicago, most of the things that used to scare me still do. We talked about what it\u2019s like to stay inside day after day, about being worried about our parents, about incarcerated folks who don\u2019t even have soap or hand sanitizer. \u201cThe thing that feels the strangest is that we are sitting ducks,\u201d I said. \u201cThat this thing is moving toward us, that all we can do is hole up and wait.\u201d</p> <p>Another call came a few hours later: a high school sophomore with a voice like a bird. From her window, she said she could see some cars and the tips of winter trees. Now that school was canceled, she wasn\u2019t sure what the next few weeks would look like. Maybe she\u2019d return to the novel she had been writing. The day before, she took what might be her last outdoor adventure with a friend. They had gone to an abandoned house \u2013 explored the foundation, picked slowly through all the old junk. She wasn\u2019t sure how long she\u2019d be able to go outside. Most of her friends weren\u2019t allowed to go outside at all any more.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>On Tuesday, my cousin brought her kids to the lawn outside our grandpa\u2019s new apartment to wave and blow him kisses. She sent a picture of the kids, pyjama-clad, holding a homemade sign that read \u201cWe [heart] U Grandpa!\u201d Behind them in the photo, a tree was beginning to flower. Through a second-story window, I could just barely make out the lines of my grandpa\u2019s striped shirt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/doctors-coronavirus-pandemic-stories\">Coronavirus heroes: the doctors carrying an immense burden to care for us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wednesday, I was signed up for the poetry call, but it never came.

Instead, I reached out to Lisa, a real-life friend who was also waiting for the poetry call, and we read poems to each other over the phone. I chose one by Minnie Bruce Pratt: <em>I am alone in a solitude that vibrates like the cicada in hot midmorning.</em></p> <p>And Lisa read a Joy Harjo poem: <em>Let the earth stabilize your postcolonial insecure jitters.</em></p> <p><em>Be respectful of the small insects, birds and animal people who accompany you.</em></p> <p><em>Ask their forgiveness for the harm we humans have brought down upon them.</em></p> <p>Outside, the sun went down, and the desert sky faded from pink to pale purple.

  "<p>In Uncorked, an undemanding new Netflix drama, a young man finds himself trapped between his desire to be a sommelier and his father\u2019s wish to have him take over the family barbecue business. It\u2019s a battle between the old and the new and a similar war rages on behind the camera as Insecure writer-producer Prentice Penny, here making his directorial debut, goes through familiar motions while also trying to bring something fresh to a tried-and-tested formula, a challenge he\u2019s not quite up to, the result falling somewhere in the middle \u2026 of the road.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/20/the-platform-review-fiendish-netflix-thriller-about-a-gory-battle-for-food\">The Platform review \u2013 fiendish Netflix thriller about a gory battle for food</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mamoudou Athie, best known for small roles in The Front Runner, The Get Down and Sorry for Your Loss, graduates here to his first lead as Elijah, a man working two jobs in Memphis: serving at his family\u2019s popular BBQ joint and selling at a local wine store. His father (Courtney B Vance) intends for him to take over the business but Elijah\u2019s growing interest in wine has given him other ideas and with the cautious support of his mother (Niecy Nash), he embarks on a quest to become a master sommelier, even if it means problems at home.</p> <p>Uncorked is indicative of the sort of film that Netflix now overflows with: adequate, mid-tempo product that\u2019s hard to hate but even harder to love, a background watch that only <em>sometimes</em> threatens to break through to the foreground. There\u2019s clear talent involved, from Penny who, over at HBO, helped Issa Rae to carve out one of the smartest and funniest comedies of recent years, to hardened, can-take-anything-on character actors like Vance and Nash, but there\u2019s not enough special sauce here to make it linger, it\u2019s a palate cleanser at best.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0sZtjE2MXg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s0sZtjE2MXg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s the age-old tale of the child who doesn\u2019t want to inherit the family business because he has a passion of his own and with these two competing worlds being food and drink, one would expect at the very least to salivate at what\u2019s placed on screen. But despite Penny stuffing his script with terminology, he struggles to make either side truly come alive. The film is in need of both a stronger motivating force and a cannier visual technique that might help us understand and appreciate Elijah\u2019s immersion in wine culture. We see copious glasses of it but we\u2019re never lured into reaching for one of our own at a time when we\u2019re not in short supply of reasons to drink. There\u2019s an aesthetic missing and given the territory, it\u2019s a film that desperately needs one.</p> <p>So much of the film doesn\u2019t feel fleshed out enough, most notably a thin romantic subplot with a character who only exists to ask Elijah questions that advance the narrative. There\u2019s a bit more depth back at home with Elijah\u2019s family but a great deal of that is the result of Vance and Nash, who do a lot with very little, both able to force their vaguely etched characters to life with precious little help from Penny. Nash in particular is so vibrant that one wishes the film was centred around her instead and she tries hard to add poignancy to her arc, delivering perhaps the film\u2019s most human moments. Athie is a likable lead but Elijah is such an underwritten enigma that it becomes hard for him to corral us into caring about his journey, one that\u2019s never quite as involving as it should be, every conflict easily resolved.</p> <p>It\u2019s all just so <em>passable</em>, a film that does enough to warrant a lazy afternoon watch but not enough to stick around in our memory for any longer. The formula is so well-trodden that it needed a sparkling jolt of energy to justify Penny traipsing his way through it again. Uncorked isn\u2019t exactly corked but it\u2019s definitely flat.</p> <ul> <li><p>Uncorked is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

Felled to start the quarter, he is too big for Stephen Hocking and too good above his head and now has two goals.

Here we are again, on this final Saturday in September, readying ourselves for the final game of the decade \u2013 the grand final. The last match to be played under the banner of the Victorian Football League before the brave new world of the AFL arrives in 1990. And what better way to celebrate this golden era of Australian rules than the most dominant team of the decade, Hawthorn, taking on the highest-scoring outfit in the competition, Geelong?</p> <p>For the Hawks, it is their seventh big one in a row. With champions on every line, they know all there is about winning premierships. If they can get the job done today, it will be their fourth of the 1980s and deliver the family club back-to-back success for the first time. If it possible to mean any more, it does because Allan Jeans is at the helm today, the man who coached the 1983 and 1986 triumphs but wasn\u2019t there when they flogged Melbourne in last year\u2019s decider, that season spent recovering from a brain injury. The players love the man they call Yabby.</p> <p>Where all but two Hawthorn players turning out today have been there as winners before, the opposite is true of Geelong \u2013 none of their 20 have played in a grand final. And where Hawthorn breezed through September, taking care of Essendon by six goals in the second semi at VFL Park to qualify after a week off, the Cats are playing in their fourth final in four weeks after a long, wet season. But boy, they know how to kick a score; no team has kicked so many goals in one season. And Gary Ablett, the enigmatic powerhouse, kicked seven against Melbourne to get through the first semi with easy before going one better to annihilate Essendon in the preliminary final last week \u2013 a 94-point victory. </p> <p>Only once before have these clubs played off in the grand final, back in 1963 when Bobby Davis\u2019s men stormed home to claim their sixth cup. They haven\u2019t added to their trophy cabinet since, though \u2013 the Sleepy Hollow faithful have been waiting so patiently for this day. Under Malcolm Blight, who took over as coach for this season, they have played a brilliant brand of high-scoring football. </p> <p>The main question in the build up bas been whether the Cats can roll that out against such a formidable opponent. In addition to all that aforementioned experience \u2013 also having finished two games clear on top of the ladder dropping just three home-and-away games \u2013 they broke Geelong\u2019s heart in round six when coming back from a 49-point deficit to run over them in a Princes Park classic. </p> <p>There was plenty of spite in that affair too, not least when Dermott Brereton made a mess of Mark Yeates\u2019 groin and told him all about it. Don\u2019t doubt for a moment that, in addition to being a high-scoring grand final, this will be a mightily physical encounter as well. I absolutely cannot wait. Welcome to the Melbourne Cricket Ground for our goal-by-goal coverage of the day that matters most.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>If the first casualty of war is truth, the second may very well be something the entire world values highly right now: healthcare.</p> <p>Families fleeing conflict, or currently in its crosshairs, know that medical assistance is a rare and precious privilege in war zones.

  "<p>Of the dozens of places where a coronavirus vaccine might be born, one is DIOSynVax, a small company started by a Canadian pathologist named Jonathan Heeney. In ordinary times, I\u2019d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I\u2019d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I\u2019d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated <a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">containment </a><a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">level 3</a>, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney\u2019s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed; the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be \u201cof the type used in the nuclear industry\u201d; a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/13/its-a-razors-edge-were-walking-inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-podcast\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Heeney couldn\u2019t take the risk. Understandably, he didn\u2019t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don\u2019t know who they\u2019re passing on the bus or the train,\u201d he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to get sick,\u201d Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University\u2019s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He\u2019s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.</p> <p>Since 2016, Heeney has been honing a set of methods \u2013 a platform, in vaccine parlance \u2013 that can be used to fashion vaccines that destroy whole families of viruses. Last year, he won a Gates Foundation grant of $2m (\u00a31.6m) to fund research into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/24/endless-hunt-for-the-perfect-influenza-vaccine-flu-jab\" title=\"\">universal flu vaccine</a> \u2013 one that will prevail against every kind of flu virus. \u201cIt\u2019s the mother of all challenges, the holy grail,\u201d Heeney said. In January, he kept an eye on a new disease that was flying across eastern China. After two weeks, when Chinese scientists published the coronavirus\u2019s genetic sequence, Heeney told me his team decided: \u201cLet\u2019s do with this what we\u2019re doing with the flu.\u201d</p> <p>Defeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines; it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine \u2013 the quintessential silver bullet \u2013 has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\" title=\"\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\" title=\"\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6068963952d884702689af1e873ed51e5604dae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6068963952d884702689af1e873ed51e5604dae/83_0_7834_4700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronaviruses are named after the corona (crown) of surface proteins (outer dots) that are used to penetrate a host cell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronaviruses are named after the corona (crown) of surface proteins (outer dots) that are used to penetrate a host cell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pasieka/Getty/Science Photo Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until this century, crafting a vaccine for even a long-familiar pathogen such as the polio virus, ushering it through trials and bringing it to market could take as long as 10 or 20 years. The first of these three stages is now staggeringly quick; a scientist at one company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, told <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237742-how-soon-will-we-have-a-coronavirus-vaccine-the-race-against-covid-19/\" title=\"\">New Scientist magazine</a> that her team had a preliminary model for a Covid-19 vaccine after just three hours of work.</p> <p>The thrust of this revolution \u2013 the capacity to create an infinitesimal part of an already minute virus, without handling a virus specimen at all \u2013 can seem godlike. But the next two stages \u2013 testing vaccines in humans and then manufacturing them for wide use \u2013 remain mortally slow. This is especially so because these newest types of vaccines \u2013 DNA or RNA vaccines \u2013 have never yet been licensed for use on humans. Outside a lab, they are completely unproven. With Covid-19, both contagion and vaccine are so new that there\u2019s no telling what human trials will reveal, or how long they will take. Every scientist, policymaker and researcher I spoke to said that we\u2019ll be lucky to have a vaccine for use within 12-18 months.</p> <p>If a DNA or RNA vaccine against Covid-19 is ever approved, it will be a watershed moment \u2013 not just because it will bear out the promise of this technology, but also because the technology will fortify us against future pandemics. Over the past few years, epidemiologists, risk analysts and policymakers have made concerted efforts to sharpen research and rethink the industrial model of vaccine production, all in preparation for the hypothetical disaster they call Disease X: any unknown disease that springs suddenly into our species and races ruinously through it. Covid-19 is the first Disease X to arise since the term was invented, but it won\u2019t be the last. The climate is warming, we\u2019re hacking down forests, our population is expanding and our skills at waging biological warfare are improving. The odds that we\u2019ll keep encountering more and more Disease Xs are increasing. We will need all the vaccines we can make.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Heeney was spending part of his winter break with friends in Canada when he first read about an outbreak in China. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t help but follow this kind of news, even on holiday.\u201d Back then, it seemed like a version of flu or pneumonia that might stay in Wuhan. A few days into the new year, though, the disease\u2019s eagerness to travel became evident, and by the time Heeney rejoined his team in Cambridge, the nature of the pathogen had become clear, too. \u201cWe thought: \u2018OK, this is a coronavirus. It\u2019s going to be a tough one.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The first time Heeney encountered coronaviruses was in 1988, as an HIV researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Heeney had initially trained as a vet, so his boss asked him to investigate a flurry of coronavirus cases in an unusual group of patients: a pack of cheetahs. \u201cSome collector out in Oregon was trying to preserve the species by breeding them in a captive colony,\u201d Heeney said. The cheetahs lost weight, their gums swelled and their livers and kidneys struggled to function. They moped about their park, depressed and ill. Later, Heeney found that the feline coronavirus had been passed to the cheetahs by a domestic cat. For the next couple of decades, Heeney remained an HIV scientist. He didn\u2019t work much with animal viruses again until 2007, when he came to Cambridge to study diseases that spilled from animals to humans, and to develop vaccines for them.</p> <p>In its essence, even the most advanced vaccine functions on the same premise as the earliest mode of immunisation: cotton pads soaked in smallpox pus that were stuffed into the nostrils of healthy children in 16th-century China. The principle of vaccination is still to bluff the body: to slip in weakened germs, or even parts of germs, that do no harm but induce the release of antibodies that grant long-lasting immunity. The inducements have grown more sophisticated, but they continue to rely on the body\u2019s biological defences. Humankind has developed no system of immune response more effective than the one that\u2019s been inside us for hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>The latest class of vaccines \u2013 the type that Heeney works on \u2013 hold genetic material such as DNA or RNA; these are the kind that have never yet been licensed for use. They can be developed quickly, and they jog our immunity in distinctly different ways from everything that came before. The oldest method of vaccination involves dosing a person with inactive or enfeebled forms of the pathogen. For most of the past century, sourcing these was a laborious affair. For decades, scientists depleted the strength of viruses by growing them in human cell strains kept in labs at low temperatures; once the virus was sufficiently weak, it was safe to be sent into the human body in a vaccine. One line of lung cells, sourced from an aborted foetus in Sweden and multiplied again and again in lab cultures in the US, helped inoculate 300 million people against rubella, rabies, mumps and several other diseases.</p> <p>In the 1980s, researchers learned to mass-produce sub-units of a virus, each fragment assembled out of proteins and sugars. This might be a toxin or a part of the viral shell \u2013 just a signature whiff of the pathogen that can trigger immune reactions when introduced into the body. These molecular fragments are called antigens, because they generate antibodies that target them. Despite this technological advance, all these antigens still had to be cultivated in labs or factories.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until this century that the real leap occurred, propelling scientists towards DNA and RNA vaccines of the kind that Heeney and others develop. Once computers became powerful enough to sequence the genetic code of a pathogen quickly and cheaply, scientists were able to easily create snippets of its genes, which could then be sent into the human body. These snippets, using our own cells as miniature factories, can manufacture their antigens within us. As soon as a germ\u2019s gene sequence is known, scientists can begin concocting a vaccine for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1dec4b762566ae17faaf4ea53e316eb39c06ff12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dec4b762566ae17faaf4ea53e316eb39c06ff12/0_0_4419_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scientist in a lab in Rockville, Maryland working on a vaccine for Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scientist in a lab in Rockville, Maryland working on a vaccine for Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s what happened with Covid-19. On the last day of 2019, Wuhan\u2019s health authorities reported the strange pneumonia variant to the World Health Organization. By mid-January, Chinese scientists had <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947\" title=\"\">posted</a> online the full, machine-readable genome of the Covid-19 virus: all 29,903 nucleic bases that comprise its sequence of RNA \u2013 ribonucleic acid, its genetic material.</p> <p>For scientists around the world, this was the starter pistol being fired. By studying the published genome, they could single out sets of genes that make specific proteins in the Covid-19 virus: the S-protein making up the spikes on the virus\u2019s outer envelope, for instance, or the phosphorus-laden protein in the walls of an inner capsule, packaging the RNA within.</p> <p>Shortly after the coronavirus\u2019s sequence was published, Heeney\u2019s team set to work. The central question in their research is this: what antigens \u2013 what portions of the virus \u2013 can be found that are similar across a range of coronaviruses? If scientists discover these and, by deploying them in vaccines, drill our immune systems to recognise them, we will have given ourselves a way to fend off several kinds of coronavirus diseases, including Covid-19. The spike proteins jutting out of all these viruses, giving the appearance of a fringed crown, are a prime example of such antigens. Every coronavirus uses its spikes to invade human cells. Once our immune systems engineer antibodies in reaction to a vaccine of spike-protein antigens, they will have not just a method to identify coronaviruses, but also a prospective point of attack to cripple them.</p> <p>The first thing Heeney\u2019s team did was compare the genetic sequences of the Covid-19 virus and other coronavirus strains, to figure out what structural commonalities they might use as antigens. This approach put me in mind of a captain of some medieval army, who had obtained the plans of the castles he planned to attack and was now studying them to see if they all contained the same weak drawbridges, so that he could order up a single siege engine to knock them all down.</p> <p>When, after a few days, they had selected their antigens \u2013 the spike protein, but also some others \u2013 the biologists in Heeney\u2019s lab looked for their \u201cblueprints\u201d: the genes that direct the virus to construct each of these antigens. These lie in the gene sequences of the coronaviruses: one section of genetic code that holds the information to make a spike protein, another section for a different antigen, and so on. In late January, the lab sent these sections of code electronically to a German company, which built them out into synthetic genes \u2013 made artificially, but otherwise consisting of the same sugars and other material as our own DNA.</p> <p>These minuscule lengths of DNA were sent back to Cambridge suspended in vials of colourless, viscous fluid. In any eventual human trials, this DNA will be injected into the body to do what it\u2019s meant to do: construct antigens to prod the immune system into action. This is all meticulous, elaborate work, but the power of modern computing can hurry it along at astonishing speed. By the first week of February, Heeney said, his scientists were carrying out trials in mice.</p> <p>In all of this, no one in Heeney\u2019s team handled the coronavirus itself; in fact, until the synthetic DNA arrived from Germany, most of their work was on computers. This would have been unimaginable for earlier generations of vaccine scientists, who took in full-strength pathogens and then, with immense care, whittled down their potency. Heeney longed to know, first-hand, how the virus behaves in cells and what kinds of antibodies respond to it. For weeks, he said, \u201cno one outside China had isolated the virus\u201d. Then, towards the end of January, scientists at the University of Melbourne announced that they\u2019d grown cultures of the virus.</p> <p>Braving the uncertainties of travel, Heeney flew via Thailand to Australia, arriving in time for the first inoculation of a mouse with the cultured virus on 19 February. \u201cI wanted to establish some collaborations with these teams. They\u2019ll be important for us down the line,\u201d Heeney told me. In a bygone time, he might have brought back a vial of virus with him. \u201cWhen I was a youngster, people would just put samples in their briefcases, or in the breast pockets of their coats. But the biosecurity protocols are intense now, so you can\u2019t do that any more.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Heeney\u2019s project, which takes on a whole family of viruses, most vaccine projects are targeting just the virus causing Covid-19, but they follow the same basic, still-experimental approach: synthesise DNA or RNA, tuck that genetic material into a vaccine and have it build antigens once it\u2019s shot into the body. (I found only a couple of projects that are working the older way, using a weakened form of the whole virus in a vaccine.) Heeney is fully aware that these DNA and RNA vaccines may all still collapse in trials. \u201cThere are graveyards full of failed viral vaccine candidates,\u201d he said. But if even one succeeds, \u201cthen we\u2019ll be entering a brave new world of vaccines\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To an outsider, the design of a DNA or RNA vaccine in a lab seems like cool, ordered science, conducted by computers, technicians in sterile oversuits, and machines that hum quietly. The next stage \u2013 when the vaccine has to negotiate clinical trials \u2013 is rife with all the messy uncertainties of human biology. In other words, while genetic technology has dramatically shrunk the first leg of the process from years to weeks, the second leg remains as long as ever, so that vaccine development now resembles a pair of misshapen trousers.</p> <p>Regulatory trials take months or even years because, for one, they can\u2019t go faster than the rate at which humans metabolise vaccines. But they\u2019re also time-consuming because so much is at stake, and because it\u2019s impossible to predict how our complex physiology will react to a new vaccine. These trials determine if a vaccine is safe, what its dosages should be, how effective it is, and what its side effects are. In the US, 90% of drugs fail to make it past these trials. The overriding purpose of the process is abundant caution; a vaccine that unexpectedly proves harmful is the industry\u2019s worst nightmare.</p> <p>In the literature, past mishaps flash like red warning signals. In 1942, a yellow fever vaccine contaminated with a hepatitis B virus was given to more than 300,000 American troops; nearly 150 of them died. The field\u2019s classic reference text, Plotkin\u2019s Vaccines, by the physician Stanley Plotkin, refers sombrely to \u201cthe Cutter incident\u201d \u2013 a 1955 episode in which a manufacturer named Cutter Laboratories failed to properly deactivate the virus in its polio shot. The faulty vaccine caused roughly 40,000 cases of polio, paralysed 260 people and killed 10.</p> <p>The US\u2019s strict rules to regulate vaccines <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/\" title=\"\">emerged</a>, in part, because of Cutter Laboratories. The company survived, but paid out millions in civil damages. The Cutter incident set a precedent for more lawsuits during the next three decades, in which parents argued that their children had been disabled by malfunctioning vaccines. Some pharma firms, worried about multimillion-dollar claims settlements, abandoned vaccines altogether; others hiked their prices to cover any future legal costs. To keep vaccines cheap and vaccinations regular, the US government had to set up a compensation fund that eased most of the liability on vaccine companies.</p> <p>In the midst of a pandemic, so many forces tug at the vaccine development process \u2013 politics, industry, science, money, fear, hope \u2013 that there\u2019s a perpetual hazard of clinical trials being hurried or of a poorly planned vaccination scheme being rushed out. One historical analogue is found in 1976 \u2013 like 2020, an election year. That February, a bout of swine flu broke out in an army post in New Jersey, and one soldier died. In comparison to Covid-19, the outbreak now seems minor, but it jolted President Ford\u2019s government, which was already suffering from the second-hand shame of Nixon\u2019s resignation just two years earlier. The administration fretted that, in the autumn, at the height of flu season, the virus would exact a huge loss of life; one government estimate figured that 1 million Americans would die.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country, and had the Centers for Disease Control draft a $136m plan to do it. He ignored Albert Sabin, one of the heroes of the polio vaccine, who advised against immunisation, believing that no epidemic was imminent. Ford also ignored the warnings coming out of clinical trials, in which one of the four manufacturers was found to have formulated some unknown number of its 2.6m doses with a different flu virus altogether. Congress exempted all these companies from liabilities if their vaccine harmed anyone. Beginning in October, 40 million Americans were vaccinated, but by mid-December, it emerged that the shot came with a slightly increased risk of contracting Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an immobilising neurological condition.</p> <p>The vaccine campaign was scrapped soon after; by that time, close to 450 people had been afflicted with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9. It was impossible to say how many of these cases were seeded by the vaccine. And if the vaccine really did prevent a swine flu epidemic, there was no way to know; the counterfactual \u2013 no vaccination, a ravaging pandemic \u2013 was hidden from view. This vaccine\u2019s legacy, in public memory, was the paralysis of those hundreds of people.</p> <p>Already, the temptation to accelerate the trials of Covid-19 vaccines is becoming apparent. Earlier this month, Donald Trump suggested using \u201ca solid flu vaccine \u2026 on corona\u201d. Not possible, scientists informed him. When he declared that a vaccine would be available within a few months, he had to be told that, in that time, vaccines would only be ready for testing. Ordinarily, human trials come after many phases of animal testing, but at least two companies \u2013 one of them Moderna \u2013 have decided to do both in parallel. The scientists I spoke to, though, kept telling me that testing couldn\u2019t be rushed. \u201cThere will be many trials, and we need to be ready for some failures,\u201d Heeney said. He leaned in towards his webcam as if to push his point physically through the internet to me. \u201cWe have to avoid overpromising, because if there\u2019s an accident with one of those first vaccines \u2013 if someone gets ill and it gets into the Daily Mail, \u2018New vaccine threatens survival\u2019 or some ridiculous headline \u2013 then people won\u2019t want to take even the later vaccines that do work. It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking here.\u201d</p> <p>Among the peculiarities of this pandemic, moreover, is the fact that we, the general populace, might determine how well human trials go. If huge swathes of society become infected before the vaccine is ready to test on humans, the trials will be difficult to conduct, said Sarah Gilbert, an immunologist at the University of Oxford\u2019s Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. Gilbert\u2019s team also has a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, based on an earlier vaccine it had devised for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, another coronavirus disease. In mid-March, Gilbert had to put an auto-response on her email. When her team was ready to recruit subjects for vaccine trials, it would be advertised on the website, she wrote. \u201cPlease do not contact me about volunteering.\u201d</p> <p>Gilbert\u2019s worry is that, at the peak of infection, the virus will be bouncing so frantically around the population that \u201cyou can\u2019t screen your volunteers. By the time you get their results back, they may have been exposed.\u201d Organising trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have cultivated a natural immunity by then. Transmission will have dropped as well, Gilbert said \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know how well a vaccine trial is going if the subjects aren\u2019t being exposed to the virus at all. \u201cThis is herd immunity \u2013 good for the population, but it makes testing a vaccine more difficult,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>The best possible scenario involves delaying the pandemic\u2019s peak \u2013 pushing it through the summer towards August, to buy scientists a few extra months to run their trials. \u201cSo we\u2019d really be pleased,\u201d Gilbert said sternly, \u201cif everyone will just do what they\u2019re being told and stay at home.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>At some point in March, Heeney\u2019s sense of time started to grow muddled. Things happened so fast, and his weeks were so full, that dates lost their meaning; once, while speaking to me, he had to thumb back through his email to recollect even roughly when a particular step in his research had happened. \u201cThe coronavirus dominates our days,\u201d he said. He wakes before dawn to pore through feeds of scientific data and journal articles. \u201cThere are conference calls, there\u2019s all this paperwork to fill out so we can deal safely with pathogens, there\u2019s the need to scale up the lab to work on the vaccine. There\u2019s just no routine anymore. It feels like the wild west right now.\u201d</p> <p>Like every other scientist, Heeney spends part of his days worrying about funding. All these vaccine projects hurtling towards trials may yet be drawn to a screeching halt by a lack of money. Trials are expensive; so is the outlay on manufacturing and marketing vaccines. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make enough doses for the whole world, you\u2019re going to need billions and billions of dollars,\u201d Heeney said. Earlier this week, the Wellcome Trust put an exact number on it: a further $3bn, across the industry, to fund and produce enough vaccines to beat the pandemic.</p> <p>Most of this money will go towards trials and production, the costs of which are now frequently borne by drug companies. After the 80s, when a series of mergers left the pharma industry in the hands of a few behemoth companies, vaccines fell thoroughly under the sway of market forces, subject to the kind of logic that prompted Goldman Sachs, in a 2018 report, to wonder: \u201cIs curing patients a sustainable business model?\u201d (It isn\u2019t, the analysts <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/curing-disease-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs-analysts-say/\" title=\"\">concluded</a>.)</p> <p>Diseases that are borne out of poverty, and that require cheap vaccines, such as cholera, are largely ignored, says Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So are diseases that are uncommon, or diseases that have come and gone. Taxpayers fund most vaccine research, but the pharma titans that can make them at scale are reluctant to commit to a vaccine if the likelihood of profit is meagre. \u201cWe have a broken ecosystem for making vaccines,\u201d Hotez told me.</p> <p>If the business wasn\u2019t set up this way, Hotez thinks, he\u2019d have a Covid-19 vaccine to offer, based on an earlier project that wilted from lack of funding. The story of Hotez\u2019s vaccine is a parable for this field, and it foretells one highly possible future for all the exciting vaccine work currently underway against Covid-19.</p> <p>When Sars broke out in 2002, scientists and companies rolled up their sleeves to deliver a vaccine. But after 2004, no Sars cases were reported, so research flagged; one vaccine, from Sanofi, never made it past clinical trials. Ideally, Hotez says, vaccines would still have been run through the first few steps of trials and kept in reserve for future emergencies. Between 2011 and 2016, Hotez and his team designed a potential vaccine for Sars, and had the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research make 20,000 doses, to test on humans. But none of Hotez\u2019s usual funders gave him a grant for these trials. \u201cSars dropped off their list of priorities,\u201d Maria Elena Bottazzi, one of Hotez\u2019s collaborators at Baylor, told me. \u201cWe had other situations, like Ebola or Zika.\u201d The industry\u2019s attention is easily diverted, Hotez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like little kids playing a football game. The ball goes in one direction and all the kids run after it. Then it goes in another direction and all the kids run that way.\u201d</p> <p>So much about Covid-19 is still unclear that companies can\u2019t yet gauge the profit margins on a vaccine. Will the disease fade before a vaccine is approved? Will DNA or RNA vaccines even work? Will everyone be inoculated \u2013 a bumper payday from billions of doses \u2013 or will vaccines go to just a few at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers or anyone over 40? \u201cAt some point, there will be a go/no-go decision to make for companies,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy scholar at Yale. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ll have to figure out if it\u2019s worth the risk.\u201d One way to make it worthwhile is to engage in price gouging, which drug companies have always been happy to do. Earlier this month, the US <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/\" title=\"\">passed</a> a coronavirus spending bill that deliberately left out controls on vaccine prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7c7fd093581e39edb35d088209056ac2824f8fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c7fd093581e39edb35d088209056ac2824f8fd/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Equipment in a Biocad lab, a Russian biotechnology company, working on a Covid-19 vaccine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Equipment in a Biocad lab, a Russian biotechnology company, working on a Covid-19 vaccine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Biocad Press Office/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, pharma companies are indispensable, said Charlie Weller, who heads the vaccines programme at the Wellcome Trust. (When Weller spoke to me one evening on the phone, she had to break off for a minute to comfort her little daughter, who\u2019d burst into tears after learning that, as the child of a key worker, she\u2019d have to keep going to school even while her friends stayed home.) Pharma firms pay for most clinical trials, invest in experts and equipment, and bring drugs to market. They assume the right to set prices and decide what vaccines to sell because they claim to bear the most financial risk. \u201cIf we have to be ready for more Disease Xs, we need to rethink this whole underlying structure,\u201d Weller told me. \u201cWe have to do it so that the risk is shared.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) was founded to do just this: to allay some of the financial risk of research, and to keep this research going even in the troughs between epidemics. Cepi\u2019s funding \u2013 about $740m \u2013 comes from a combination of philanthropists and governments. Melanie Saville, its director of vaccine development, told me that they were funding eight ongoing Covid-19 vaccine projects. But Cepi\u2019s own money for Covid-19 was going to run out by the end of March. Without more donations, none of its funded vaccines would progress beyond the first phase of clinical trials.</p> <p>One of Cepi\u2019s ambitions is to create its own \u201cinvestigational stockpile\u201d of vaccines \u2013 vaccines that have passed the first two out of three stages of clinical trials, and that then bide their time in cold storage. Everyone hopes they will never be required, but if necessary, they can be brought forth, hustled through the final clinical trial stage \u2013 which must be conducted in a real outbreak \u2013 and launched into production. Saville said Cepi has no storage or clinical facilities of its own, and that the stockpiles would reside individually with manufacturers. This disappointed me; for a second, I\u2019d dreamed of a vaccine storehouse nestled somewhere in the Arctic \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/20/the-doomsday-vault-seeds-save-post-apocalyptic-world\" title=\"\">a Svalbard</a> against sickness, a vault so titanic that it dwarfed the germs it intended to fight by zillions of orders of magnitude.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A week after I met Heeney on Zoom, I called him again. He gave me a phone number in his Cambridge college; he had decided to self-quarantine himself in a room after all. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been at risk, but if one of us goes down, we all go down like dominoes,\u201d he said. He was full of praise for his team \u2013 \u201call these bright, talented individuals who are still living at home but are otherwise trying to live isolated lives, like monks in a monastery\u201d. When Heeney moved into his room, he wiped down all the surfaces. One day, he went to get a cup of coffee, and when he came back to his room, he saw that two men had come in to change the batteries in the fire alarm. \u201cIt was crazy. I thought: \u2018Here I am trying to keep the risk factor low. Does this have to happen now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His lab is still running trials in mice. It\u2019s a long process, he said. \u201cYou take tissue cultures from the mice and you study them. We\u2019re getting all this data, so that we can see what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell which of the vaccine projects out there will succeed, he said. \u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s pretty amazing that humans have got vaccines in trials already,\u201d Heeney said. \u201cThe trials will tell us what we need to know. My worry is that the devil is in the details with this coronavirus. But I hope I\u2019m wrong. I really hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

Hammond finally cleaned up after an intervention in 2009; a few years before, Casablancas had conquered the alcoholism that left him, in his former manager\u2019s words, \u201ca drunken nightmare to society as a whole\u201d and made interviewing him the kind of event that journalists discussed among themselves in hushed, horrified tones. If you want to know how bad an interview with Casablancas could get, read the US writer Neil Strauss\u2019s collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/15/everyone-loves-you-when-youre-dead-review\">Everyone Loves You When You\u2019re Dead</a>, in which the singer somehow contrives to emerge as by far the most wayward and difficult figure in a book that also features <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/08/jerry-lee-lewis-interview-heaven-hell\">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>, Ike Turner, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and sundry unnamed members of the Calabrian mafia.</p> <p>In fact, these seem to be rather good times for the Strokes, whose fortunes since the release of their multiplatinum 2001 debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/24/how-we-made-is-this-it-the-strokes\">Is This It</a> have been mixed. They say they struggled to take in their initial success: never as famous in the US as they were elsewhere \u2013 \u201cWhen we got home, it was still all about Christina Aguilera or whatever,\u201d says Hammond \u2013 they don\u2019t seem to have fully grasped how big they were. \u201cIt was like, we\u2019re going to do Reading festival and we don\u2019t even really know what a festival is. And then you\u2019re getting moved to a bigger stage and we didn\u2019t know what that meant either: \u2018I don\u2019t even give a shit! Who is Reading anyway?\u2019\u201d He says he didn\u2019t even know what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/07/farewell-to-nme-rocknroll-riot-that-petered-into-silence\">the NME</a> was. \u201cNot to say I took it for granted \u2013 it was exciting. But it was happening in England, we were signed to a small label, it didn\u2019t feel real.\u201d</p> <p>September 11 happened fewer than two months after Is This It came out and \u201ckind of distracted everything\u201d, Hammond says. \u201cSuccess was just like this weird, vague, slow thing. Our second album, it was like: \u2018If we don\u2019t put something out quick enough, then this\u2019ll be over.\u2019 Then our second album didn\u2019t do as good as the first and the third album didn\u2019t do as good as the second, so there was never a feeling of: we fucking made it! Roll credits! It was always this kind of half-anxious, half-exciting \u2018What the hell is happening?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5ad36a90eb2984c4215a1446576af9af9d3ef46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5ad36a90eb2984c4215a1446576af9af9d3ef46/0_0_4596_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Strokes performing at a rally for Bernie Sanders in February\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing at a rally for Bernie Sanders in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, it was better than what happened next, which Casablancas describes \u2013 with what turns out to be characteristic delicacy\u2013 as \u201csome grey areas on control and on quality, fuelled with the traditional, less exciting and more cliched elements of a rock band\u2019s success \u2013 grossness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThose cliches,\u201d nods Hammond. \u201cSo funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut true, though,\u201d says Casablancas, quietly.</p> <p>There were also, by all accounts, terrible intra-band conflicts, perhaps exacerbated by the fact that Casablancas had written the Strokes\u2019 first three albums almost in their entirety (the other band members got one co-writing credit each). \u201cI think wanting to be in charge and wanting something to be good are different things,\u201d he frowns. \u201cOne is about selfishness, the other is about something objective. Is this person just an egomaniac wanting control or is it someone who can actually make it better? And that\u2019s just life.\u201d</p> <p>A low point was reached with 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/17/the-strokes-angles-review\">Angles</a>, a laboured album that sounded as if it was made by a band who did not want to record it at all, which, reading between the lines of what Casablancas says, is not that far from the truth. They declined to tour or promote the release of its successor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/24/the-strokes-comedown-machine-review\">Comedown Machine</a>, at all, \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t in harmony\u201d, he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politics has been the same thing since Nixon, with people getting less aware and less caring</p> <footer> <cite>Julian Casablancas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou know, maybe in a few years it really won\u2019t matter and I\u2019ll just say it \u2026 I could explain it, it\u2019s not a big deal, but \u2026\u201d He tails off, but concedes that they felt the \u201cneed to not be contractually bound\u201d to a band that was now \u201climiting to our personal lives. I guess it\u2019s not that controversial, really. There was conflict and there was fear and we got through it and we made records, but it wasn\u2019t, you know, out of pure brotherly love and musical inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>Like a lot of people, I had assumed they had split up after a 2016 EP, <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21986-future-present-past-ep/\">Future Present Past</a>, quietly slipped out on Casablancas\u2019s own label, Cult. By then, Casablancas was given to comparing the Strokes unfavourably to his work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/30-minutes-with-julian-casablancas-voidz-strokes-interview\">the Voidz</a>, a weirder and more eclectic outfit; Hammond seemed content releasing solo albums; the guitarist Nick Valensi was busying himself with a heavy metal-ish project called <a href=\"https://crxofficial.com/\">CRX</a>; the bassist, Nikolai Fraiture, formed <a href=\"http://www.summermoonband.com/\">Summer Moon</a> with the drummer from Jane\u2019s Addiction; and the drummer, Fabrizio Moretti, was <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/strokes-drummer-fabrizio-moretti-art-dealer-fabrizio-moretti-sothebys-1697349\">working on visual art</a>. But here they are, promoting the release of a sixth album, The New Abnormal, produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/03/rick-rubin-annotation-genius-analyses-kanye-cash-jay-z-james-blake\">Rick Rubin</a>, no less: \u201cI guess he thought: these guys have fallen far enough,\u201d smiles Casablancas.</p> <p>It is the best thing they have done in years, a subtle, smart updating of their original melding of the Velvet Underground, various New York new wave bands, the Cars and Tom Petty, with noticeably more politicised lyrics than previous Strokes albums, unless you count their views on New York City cops. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in politics,\u201d says Casablancas, \u201cbut I can trace the moment I was like: \u2018I have to read books and see what\u2019s happening,\u2019 to the second George W Bush victory: \u2018What, we re-elected this dude?\u2019 That was so baffling to me that I went deep into politics.

Lizzie Goldman\u2019s 2017 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/29/meet-me-in-the-bathroom-lizzy-goodman-review\">Meet Me </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/29/meet-me-in-the-bathroom-lizzy-goodman-review\">in the Bathroom</a> was ostensibly about \u201cRebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011\u201d, but it hinged on the story of the Strokes, turning them into a mythic entity. Critically acclaimed, it is about to be turned into a film.</p> <p>The Strokes\u2019 recent benefit gig at a Bernie Sanders rally was riotously successful: audience members climbed on stage, then the police walked on to try to clear them off, which led to the improbable sight of Julian Casablancas singing New York City Cops \u2013 \u201cthey ain\u2019t too smart\u201d \u2013 while an actual New York City cop stood next to him, attempting to attract his attention.</p> <p>A couple of days before I meet Casablancas and Hammond, the band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/20/the-strokes-review-roundhouse-london\">play a one-off London show</a>: it is sold out, the queue to get in already snaking down the street hours before they are due to play. On stage, they look in remarkably high spirits, eschewing a performance of their debut single, The Modern Age, in favour of making up a song in the middle of their set. \u201cJulian likes to jam,\u201d sighs Hammond, \u201cso he goes up to the guy in the band that does it least and tells me to do it. Kind of like Spinal Tap, where they do their free-jazz odyssey.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are moments when the atmosphere during our interview feels a little strained. Nothing like in the old days, when Casablancas was wont to unexpectedly leap on journalists and kiss them or tell them to fuck off and walk out, but there is no mistaking the slightly agonising way he picks his words, as if he is worried about upsetting someone. A routine inquiry about Rubin\u2019s fabled calm, Buddha-like presence in the studio leads to a deathly silence, punctuated by a series of sighs, and eventually the words: \u201cIt\u2019s Rick Rubin, so \u2026 I don\u2019t want to like, you know \u2026\u201d before his voice trails off entirely. \u201cInterviews are interesting,\u201d he finally decides, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not about honesty, really.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fbZTnZDvPA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5fbZTnZDvPA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Bad Decisions, from the new album, The New Abnormal.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>What do you mean? Are you concerned about being misrepresented? \u201cSure, that\u2019s part of it. On a selfish, personal level, interviews are the opposite of therapy. It\u2019s like unhealthy self-reflection. And it\u2019s just years of people in your life being: \u2018I was really upset about what I read in that thing,\u2019 and I\u2019m just like: what?! It\u2019s very easy to get stuff out of context when it becomes the quote.\u201d</p> <p>And then he brightens, proclaiming the Guardian \u201creally cool\u201d and me \u201csuper-nice\u201d. He talks about the band members\u2019 non-musical activities: Hammond has dabbled in fashion, while Casablancas, more surprisingly, has <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/61261-julian-casablancas-files-patent-for-pedal-free-electric-folding-bicycle/\">designed a folding, pedal-free electric bike</a>, a most un-Strokes-like form of transport about which he is nevertheless enthused. \u201cElectric bikes seem like the future of communal travel to me.\u201d He looks at Hammond. \u201cHe rides motorcycles and I think that\u2019s cool, but the truth is that everyone falls off and hurts themselves. If you ride an electric bike and fall off, it\u2019s like running fast; it\u2019s how our bodies are designed.</p> <p>\u201cI just thought it was interesting making something,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive and time-consuming and the business world is fascinating, because you see the mechanisms of the decision-making process that has led to art, quality and truth being circumvented for, you know, financial ease and sheep-like following of trends.</p> <p>\u201cEven with putting out a record, you know, since the day the Strokes got signed, it was this wrestling match between doing cool creative things and smart marketing things. It\u2019s a dance, and I respect the dance, but that\u2019s why right now pop music is king over art and quality, because it\u2019s all been scientifically worked out. That\u2019s why cars are ugly, because if someone makes a cool car, they\u2019ll make slightly less money. \u2018But think of all the inspiration you\u2019ll cause in the world!\u2019 \u2018No, you\u2019re fired!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Then he stops talking and exhales. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he says.</p> <p><em>The New Abnormal is released on 10 April on Cult and RCA Records</em></p>",
  "<p>We keep hearing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/we-are-at-war-coronavirus-pandemic\">this is a war</a>. Is it really? What helps to give the current crisis its wartime feel is the apparent absence of normal political argument. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">goes on TV</a> to issue a sombre statement to the nation about the curtailment of our liberties and the leader of the opposition offers nothing but support. Parliament, insofar as it is able to operate at all, appears to be merely going through the motions. People are stuck at home, and their fights are limited to the domestic sphere. There is talk of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives\">government of national unity</a>. Politics-as-usual has gone missing.</p> <p>But this is not the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-amid-coronavirus-fears\">suspension of politics</a>. It is the stripping away of one layer of political life to reveal something more raw underneath. In a democracy we tend to think of politics as a contest between different parties for our support. We focus on the who and the what of political life: who is after our votes, what they are offering us, who stands to benefit. We see elections as the way to settle these arguments. But the bigger questions in any democracy are always about the how: how will governments exercise the extraordinary powers we give them? And how will we respond when they do?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, its impact is greatly shaped by decisions taken by individual governments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These are the questions that have always preoccupied political theorists. But now they are not so theoretical. As the current crisis shows, the primary fact that underpins political existence is that some people get to tell others what to do. At the heart of all<strong> </strong>modern politics is a trade-off between personal liberty and collective choice. This is the Faustian bargain identified by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in the middle of the 17th century, when the country was being torn apart by a real civil war.</p> <p>As Hobbes knew, to exercise political rule is to have the power of life and death over citizens. The only reason we would possibly give anyone that power is because we believe it is the price we pay for our collective safety. But it also means that we are entrusting life-and-death decisions to people we cannot ultimately control.</p> <p>The primary risk is that those on the receiving end refuse to do what they are told. At that point, there are only two choices. Either people are forced to obey, using the coercive powers the state has at its disposal. Or politics breaks down altogether, which Hobbes argued was the outcome we should fear most of all.</p> <p>In a democracy, we have the luxury of waiting for the next election to punish political leaders for their mistakes. But that is scant consolation when matters of basic survival are at stake. Anyway, it\u2019s not much of a punishment, relatively speaking. They might <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/12/lost-seat-parliament-westminster-britain-working-class\">lose their jobs</a>, though few politicians wind up destitute. We might lose our lives.</p> <p>The rawness of these choices is usually obscured by the democratic imperative to seek consensus. That has not gone away. The government is doing all it can to dress up its decisions in the language of commonsense advice. It says it is still trusting individuals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/businesses-ask-for-clarity-confusion-uk-lockdown-open-staff\">show sound judgment</a>. But as the experience of other European countries shows, as the crisis deepens the stark realities become clearer. Just watch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/this-is-not-a-film-italian-mayors-rage-coronavirus-lockdown-dodgers\">footage of Italian mayors</a> screaming at their constituents to stay at home. \u201cVote for me or the other lot get in\u201d is routine democratic politics. \u201cDo this or else\u201d is raw democratic politics. At that point it doesn\u2019t look so different from politics of any other kind.</p> <p>This crisis has revealed some other hard truths. National governments really matter, and it really matters which one you happen to find yourself under. Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, and is being experienced similarly in many different places, the impact of the disease is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/trump-accuses-media-of-wanting-to-keep-economy-shut-to-hurt-his-reelection\">greatly shaped by decisions</a> taken by individual governments. Different views about when to act and how far to go still mean that no two nations are having the same experience. At the end of it all we may get to see who was right and what was wrong. But for now, we are at the mercy of our national leaders. That is something else Hobbes warned about: there is no avoiding the element of arbitrariness at the heart of all politics. It is the arbitrariness of individual political judgment.</p> <p>Under a lockdown, democracies reveal what they have in common with other political regimes: here too politics is ultimately about power and order. But we are also getting to see some of the fundamental differences. It is not that democracies are nicer, kinder, gentler places. They<strong> </strong>may<strong> </strong>try to be, but in the end that doesn\u2019t last. Democracies do, though, find it harder to make the really tough choices. Pre-emption \u2013 the ability to tackle a problem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/health-expert-brands-uks-coronavirus-response-pathetic\">before it becomes acute</a> \u2013 has never been a democratic strength. We wait until we have no choice and then we adapt. That means democracies are always going to start off behind the curve of a disease like this one, though some are better at playing catch-up than others.</p> <p>Autocratic regimes such as China also find it hard to face up to crises until they have to \u2013 and, unlike democracies, they can suppress the bad news for longer if it suits them. But when action becomes unavoidable, they can go further. The Chinese lockdown succeeded in containing the disease through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">ruthless pre-emption</a>. Democracies are capable of being equally ruthless \u2013 as they showed when prosecuting the total wars of the 20th century.</p> <p>But in a war, the enemy is right in front of you. During this pandemic the disease reveals where it has got to only in the daily litany of infections and deaths. Democratic politics becomes a kind of shadow boxing: the state doesn\u2019t know which bodies are the really dangerous ones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/parliament-shuts-democracy-suspended-political-scrutiny\">It's right that parliament shuts \u2013 but democracy can't be suspended | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some democracies have managed to adapt faster: in South Korea the disease is being tamed by extensive tracing and widespread surveillance of possible carriers. But in that case, the regime had recent experience to draw on in its handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/south-korea-mers-virus-outbreak-is-over\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/south-korea-mers-virus-outbreak-is-over\">ers outbreak of 2015</a>, which also shaped the collective memory of its citizens. Israel may also be doing a better job than many European countries \u2013 but it is a society already on a permanent warlike footing. It is easier to adapt when you have adapted already. It is much harder when you are making it up as you go along.</p> <p>In recent years, it has sometimes appeared that global politics is simply a choice between rival forms of technocracy. In China, it is a government of engineers backed up by a one-party state. In the west, it is the rule of economists and central bankers, operating within the constraints of a democratic system. This creates the impression that the real choices are technical judgments about how to run vast, complex economic and social systems.</p> <p>But in the last few weeks another reality has pushed through. The ultimate judgments are about how to use coercive power. These aren\u2019t simply technical questions. Some arbitrariness is unavoidable. And the contest in the exercise of that power between democratic adaptability and autocratic ruthlessness will shape all of our futures. We are a long way from the frightening and violent world that Hobbes sought to escape nearly 400 years ago. But our political world is still one Hobbes would recognise.</p> <p>\u2022 David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University</p>",

that.\u201d</p> <p>Non-government hospitals are also beginning to enact their emergency preparedness protocols as Covid-19 presentations increase and are expanding their testing capacity to try to reduce the burden on state-run facilities.</p> <p>Private health insurers have warned that non-government hospitals will need to take spillover from state-run facilities.</p> <p>But a letter seen by the Guardian shows one of the largest grouping of non-government hospitals in the country \u2013 Catholic Healthcare Australia \u2013 has told the health minister it holds \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about convoluted government communications and barriers to accessing stocks of masks and gowns through the national medical stockpile.</p> <p>\u201cWe fear if we continue to face these barriers in access to vital supplies, particularly [personal protective equipment], the result will be reduced access to hospital care for the community at a time when access to medical treatment is most critical,\u201d its chief executive, Pat Garcia, wrote.</p> <p>CHA <a href=\"https://www.cha.org.au/about\">represents 80 non-government hospitals</a> that between them have more than 10,000 beds, including 2,700 public beds.</p> <p>Its own supply chains of PPE are under immense strain amid the global pandemic, and hospitals are now urgently trying to access equipment stored in the national medical stockpile through state and territory governments.</p> <p>That has caused huge difficulties, because a single hospital organisation that spans state boundaries has to deal with multiple governments.</p> <p>It is complicated further still by \u201cunclear and convoluted\u201d information about access, Garcia said.</p> <p>He urged the government to plan its pandemic response in a way that used government-run and non-government hospitals as \u201cone seamless network in the fight against Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou would be aware that PPE is a vital component of infection control, protecting clinicians and patients from transmitting the virus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWithout it, clinical staff will need to make difficult decisions about what services they can provide and which patients they can treat.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

  "<p>An Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US sanctions trial but remains jailed by immigration authorities said the conditions in detention were filthy and overcrowded \u2013 and officials were doing little to prevent a deadly coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor, was <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/2019/11/cleveland-federal-judge-dismisses-trade-secrets-fraud-charges-against-iranian-professor-during-trial.html\">acquitted</a> in November on federal charges of stealing trade secrets related to his academic work with a university in Ohio. Although the US government lost its case on all charges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has kept him indefinitely detained since the trial. Now he\u2019s speaking out about the \u201cinhumane\u201d treatment that could cost him his life.</p> <p>Asgari, 59, told the Guardian that his Ice holding facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, had no basic cleaning practices in place and continued to bring in new detainees from across the country with no strategy to minimize the threat of Covid-19.</p> <p>In a phone call from the Alexandria Staging Facility (ASF), he said he believed the only safe option would be to shut down the facility due to the deplorable conditions. ASF is a 400-bed site where people are supposed to be detained for no more than 72 hours, typically a final stop before they are deported. But with Covid-19 travel restrictions and flight cancellations, Ice has been holding people for days on end in cramped bunkbeds alongside new arrivals who may have been exposed to the virus.</p> <p>Asgari arrived at ASF on 10 March and has been seeking to voluntarily \u201cself deport\u201d to Iran. Ice has refused to let him fly home or be temporarily released with his family in the US. He alleged:</p> <ul> <li><p>Detainees have no hand sanitizer, and the facility is not regularly cleaning bathrooms or sleeping areas. Asgari and a few other detainees have devised a schedule to try to clean surfaces themselves with the minimal soap available.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Detainees lack access to masks. For two weeks, ASF also refused to let Asgari wear his own protective mask, which he brought with him to the facility, and it has refused to supply one, despite his history of serious respiratory problems.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Detainees struggle to stay clean, and the facility has an awful stench. Because the facility is supposed to be temporary, there is no laundry available and detainees are stuck with the clothes they were wearing upon arrival, sometimes after long journeys.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>There are no physical distancing guidelines at the facility. It appears no procedures or practices have changed in response to Covid-19 since Asgari\u2019s arrival, even as Louisiana state and federal officials have urged people to isolate.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe way Ice looks at these people is not like they are human beings, but are objects to get rid of,\u201d said Asgari, a professor at the Sharif University of Technology, a public university in Tehran. \u201cThe way that they have been treating us is absolutely terrifying. I don\u2019t think many people in the US know what is happening inside this black box.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05009d61b31de4718779674479b53b7c6237df32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05009d61b31de4718779674479b53b7c6237df32/0_66_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sirous Asgari, seen here in a family photo, was acquitted of stealing trade secrets but remains in detention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sirous Asgari, seen here in a family photo, was acquitted of stealing trade secrets but remains in detention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Asgari family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The situation is particularly worrying for Asgari, who is at risk of getting pneumonia if an infection like Covid-19 reaches his lungs.

He arrived in the US in 2017 with his wife and with valid passports and visas but upon arrival discovered he was being prosecuted by the US government for alleged violations of sanctions law.</p> <p>Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US. He completed his materials engineering PhD at Drexel University in Pennsylvania, and two of his children live in the US. But the FBI surveilled him and ultimately he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio.</p> <p>During a long trial, Asgari won his case and was acquitted in November 2019, with a judge ruling the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient. But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was then taken into Ice custody and has remained imprisoned since. He has asked Ice to let him buy his own ticket back to Iran, but he has not been able to go before an immigration judge and has not been granted bond to at least wait in the US with his daughter.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so egregious. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney and sanctions law expert who is helping Asgari\u2019s family and facilitated the Guardian\u2019s interview behind bars. \u201cThis is someone who is being unlawfully detained. Now if he gets corona, his chances of survival are slim to none.\u201d</p> <p>The stakes of his case escalated dramatically after he was taken to ASF on 10 March, just as the coronavirus was officially declared a global pandemic. The professor said the conditions at the facility were unbearable for long-term stays. New detainees are brought in at all hours, meaning it\u2019s impossible to get sleep in his pod, where there can be up to 100 people in bunk beds in a single room. He puts toilet paper in his ears but has struggled to get any rest and now has a sleep disorder.</p> <p>Asgari said there was not enough food. There is only one hot meal at 5pm and two smaller meals at breakfast and lunch, and no way to purchase any other food. There are six showers for his pod, and people have a hard time getting clean and can\u2019t access clean clothes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bf75ecc289e013fc544ec9fc188bfb731d99b85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bf75ecc289e013fc544ec9fc188bfb731d99b85/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detainees struggled to stay clean in the Ice facility, Asgari said.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detainees struggled to stay clean in the Ice facility, Asgari said.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregory Bull/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In other detention centers and jails, detainees often have official paid jobs and shifts cleaning the facilities.

When he returned, ASF finally let him use his own mask for the first time, Yazdanyar said.</p> <p>An Ice spokesman did not respond to specific questions about Asgari\u2019s case or allegations but said in an email that no one in custody in Louisiana had tested positive for Covid-19 and that detainees were \u201cprovided appropriate soap and cleaning supplies\u201d.</p> <p>He said Ice was <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/covid19\">conducting</a> testing at Ice facilities and providing personal protective equipment in accordance with US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, and that all individuals were screened upon arrival.</p> <p>Asgari said he was doing his best to help fellow detainees when he could: \u201cI\u2019m trying to comfort others.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-us-immigration-detention-center\">First US immigration agency employees test positive for coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Ice officials were forced to spend a few nights trying to sleep at the facility, \u201cthey would understand what an inhumane situation they have created,\u201d he added.</p> <p>ASF must close to save lives, he said: \u201cInstead of shutting down, they are doing business as usual \u2026 The process is overruling human rights \u201d</p> <p>Asgari said he struggled to comprehend the fact that he remained incarcerated months after his trial ended. \u201cI am deeply hurt by the way I have been treated after I have been exonerated.

There was little or varied communication around cultural facilitation led by service providers or homeless representatives who act as a guide for enumerators, to smooth the process.

The bill would also create a $500bn lending program for businesses, cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses, which would focus on helping small businesses to pay their employees\u2019 salaries through the next weeks of pandemic-related shutdowns, rather than laying them off.</p> \n  <p>The bill\u2019s major benefit to American workers is not that single cash payment, but the sweeping expansion of unemployment benefits, labor experts said. The bill offers laid-off workers an additional $600 a week for four months and extends unemployment benefits to gig workers, independent contractors, and others who have not previously been eligible for unemployment, including people forced to leave their jobs to care for family members with coronavirus, or to care for children whose schools have closed.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-stimulus-bill-worker-relief\">'$1,200 isn't enough': what a $2tn relief bill means for American workers</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7d39128f08af215f6fc1a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T23:22:50.192Z\">11.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Florida poll workers test positive for coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports:</em></p> \n  <p>Two Florida poll workers tested positive for coronavirus after the state\u2019s March 17 primary, the Broward County supervisor of elections announced Thursday.</p> \n  <p>The announcement came after Florida<a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmar%2F15%2Fflorida-primary-tuesday-coronavirus-fears\"> faced criticism</a> for moving ahead in-person voting despite concerns over coronavirus.

Put the people to work. Preserve the elderly, preserve those who have health problems. But nothing more than that,\u201d said Bolsonaro, who in the past has sparked anger by calling the virus a \u201clittle flu\u201d. <br><br>The country\u2019s governors protested on Wednesday that his instructions run counter to health experts\u2019 recommendations and endanger Latin Americas largest population. <br><br>They said they would continue with their strict measures. The rebellion even included traditional allies of Brazil\u2019s far-right president. <br></p> \n  <p>Gov. Carlos Mois\u00e9s of Santa Catarina state, which gave almost 80% of its votes to Bolsonaro in the 2018 presidential runoff, complained he was blown away by the presidents instructions. <br><br>In a videoconference earlier in the day between Bolsonaro and governors from Brazil\u2019s southeast region, Sao Paulo Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria threatened to sue the federal government if it tried to interfere with his efforts to combat the virus.<br><br>The governors weren\u2019t the only defiant ones. Virus plans challenged by Bolsonaro were upheld by the Supreme Court. The heads of both congressional houses criticized his televised speech. Companies donated supplies to state anti-virus efforts.<br><br>Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital, Brasilia, that he has listened to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, and found their perspectives to be rather similar.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c3ef48f08af215f6fb713\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

Colloidal silver, which can lead to skin turning a light bluish-grey, is another treatment being pushed online.</p> \n<p>Dowden, who is also in charge of the country\u2019s digital strategy, said: \u201cI urge the industry to play their part too and act fast to stem the spread of misinformation on coronavirus on their platforms. But we can also all take action now by following these guidelines from the CCDH to tackle fake news in our everyday online lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former health secretary Alan Johnson is also backing the push to counter fake news about the virus online. He said: \u201cAt worst, misinformation can make people try dangerous quack cures that can really damage them, but also take risks that put everyone at risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>The guidelines drawn up by CCDH, called \u201cDon\u2019t Spread The Virus\u201d, advisesocial media users not to share or comment on falsehoods they find online, even if they feel compelled to do so in outrage or anger.</p> \n<p>The body says this simply rebroadcasts the misinformation to other people\u2019s networks and directs social media algorithms to show the misleading content to more users.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They are asking people to block anyone they do not know who is sharing misinformation, to send a private messageto those they know who are sharing misinformation to ask them not to do so, and to report misinformation to social media platforms and group admins.</p> \n<p>People are also being asked to share the official medical advice produced by the NHS and UK government, as well as posts promoting good causes. These adverts are not naturally shared by people online and have less engagement so the government thinks it could be a way of drowning out poor information and conspiracy theories.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Another example of fake information came from one influential YouTube vlogger who told his followers incorrectly that coronavirus tests did not work and advised drinking hot water and taking hot baths to kill the virus.</p> \n<p>A post by a Facebook user in Australia that said China had developed a vaccine and was withholding it from the world was shared 130,000 times in just over 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Phil Hammond, an NHS doctor and broadcaster, who is also backing the scheme, said: \u201cMisinformation is as dangerous as contaminated water.
