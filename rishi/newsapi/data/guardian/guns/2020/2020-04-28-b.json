  "<p>Donald Trump has predicted a \u201cgreat\u201d economic rebound in the fall and claimed the country would soon be performing 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day, as the number of confirmed cases in the US surpassed a million.</p> <p>Some health experts have suggested that the US would have to carry out 5m tests a day by June to reopen its economy safely. Others have suggested as many as <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/20/1000228/the-us-will-need-to-do-20-million-tests-a-day-to-reopen-safely/\">20m</a><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/20/1000228/the-us-will-need-to-do-20-million-tests-a-day-to-reopen-safely/\"> tests a day</a> would ultimately be needed. The US daily rate is currently 200,000.</p> <p>Addressing a news conference on aid to small businesses on Tuesday, Trump appeared unaware of the current figures, suggesting \u201cit could be that we\u2019re getting very close\u201d to 5m daily tests.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be there very soon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The US has carried out 5.6m tests over the past two months, which as Trump pointed out was <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing\">far more than any other country</a>, but represented about 1.6% of the population, a higher percentage than most countries, though significantly below Italy.</p> <p>Trump was also bullish on the prospects for economic recovery in the fall.</p> <p>\u201cNow our country\u2019s opening up again and I think it\u2019s going to be very, very successful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the fourth quarter will be great. And I think next year is going to be a tremendous year for this country.\u201d</p> <p>In what looks almost certain to become another hostage to fortune, the president implied that the pandemic would be largely cleared by the fourth quarter of the year.</p> <p>\u201cI think what happens is it\u2019s going to go away. This is going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we\u2019ll be able to handle it. We\u2019ll be able to put out spurts, and we\u2019re very prepared to handle it.\u201d</p> <p>On a day that cases hit the grim 1m milestone and fatalities overtook the US death toll from the Vietnam war of 58,220, Trump was reminded that in February, he had predicted that infections would soon all but evaporate. The president said on 26 February, when there were only 15 confirmed US cases, that \u201cwithin a couple of days [it\u2019s] going to be down to close to zero, That\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>He replied on Tuesday that it would \u201cultimately\u201d be true.</p> <p>\u201cAt the appropriate time it will be down to zero, like we said,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>The US began wholesale testing weeks later than many other developed countries, a fact Trump hinted was the fault of the previous administration.</p> <p>\u201cWe inherited a very broken test,\u201d he said, although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">faulty test</a> was produced in early February, three years into Trump\u2019s administration. The president also pointed to unnamed experts for the initial complacency of the administration\u2019s response.</p> <p>\u201cMany very good experts, very good people too, said that this would never affect the United States, it wouldn\u2019t affect Europe, it wouldn\u2019t affect anything outside of China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we were listening to experts and we always will listen to experts, but the experts got it wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Global health experts were almost unanimous in raising the alarm over the coronavirus threat in January and February. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/presidents-intelligence-briefing-book-repeatedly-cited-virus-threat/2020/04/27/ca66949a-8885-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html\">US intelligence agencies had also issued warnings</a> about the scale of the coronavirus threats in more than a dozen of the president\u2019s daily classified briefings over the course of January and February.</p> <p>The danger was played down, however, by several television personalities who the president watches regularly, and reportedly by his health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, who according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-chiefs-early-missteps-set-back-coronavirus-response-11587570514\">Wall Street Journal</a> assured Trump on 29 January that the coronavirus was under control in the US.</p>",

Headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30134-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email\">Decolonising Covid-19</a>\u201d, it argues that even before the health impact of the pandemic has been felt in the developing world, it\u2019s economic impact is proving hugely damaging. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10,000 population. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a risk, the Lancet says, that attempts to tackle the pandemic by richer nations could leave the developing world \u201cin the dark\u201d, whilst, at the same time, expertise developed in Africa from dealing with, for example, the Ebola epidemics, is not being respected. </p> \n  <p>And, it adds, \u201ca sinister undercurrent has re-emerged\u201d as teams around the world race to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about Covid-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first \u201cwhere there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation\u201d, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes \u201cbecause we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves\u201d. </p> \n   <p>Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, \u201cTo be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine \u2026 The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2820%2930134-0\">Read the rest of the article here</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:44:46.071Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea83bf48f082c9ba20aa187\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:23:22.004Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <strong>Damien Gayle</strong> taking back control on the live blog now, with thanks to Simon Burnton for covering my break.

This will now be eased and new measures introduced. These include a nationwide night-time curfew, mandatory wearing of facemasks and a ban on \u201cnon-essential\u201d travel between different regions.</p> \n  <p>But a new and immediate two-week lockdown will be imposed in northern Nigeria\u2019s largest city Kano after officials said they were probing reports of \u201cmysterious deaths\u201d that doctors say often involve pneumonia.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>South Africa</strong>, where a strict nationwide lockdown has confined 56 million people to their homes for all but essential journeys since late March, restrictions are being loosened on Friday to allow some people to go back to work in designated industries and basic public transport to function. Schools however remain shut and sales of alcohol banned.</p> \n  <p>South Africa has been lauded for its aggressive effort to root out pockets of infection with screening and testing, as well as its big economic relief package. However there are signs that the lockdown - which has been largely respected - is beginning to fray. </p> \n  <p>In a national address last week, Cyril Ramaphosa described five stages of progressively looser lockdown. But no dates have been given for moving down (or up) the scale beyond May 1st and the shift to phase four, and different phases can be imposed in different parts of the country simultaneously. </p> \n  <p>Strategies have differed across Africa. <strong>Kenya </strong>has imposed a loose lockdown in the capital Nairobi and port city of Mombasa along with a nationwide curfew. <strong>Ghana </strong>recently lifted most of the restrictions placed on inhabitants of major cities but has maintained a ban on social events and public gatherings are still banned. </p> \n  <p>So too has the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, which imposed a loose lockdown on parts of the capital Kinshasa. In <strong>Malawi</strong>, legal action has blocked attempts by the government to impose a lockdown while in <strong>Tanzania</strong>, president John Magufuli has been criticised for not imposing one fast enough. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:57:26.830Z\">at 2.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea8312c8f08103bdf809770\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kim-willsher\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:41:09.496Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Philippe also said there was a risk of France\u2019s economy collapsing if the lockdown was not ended, and that the country\u2019s hospitals had held up well to the challenge posed by the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe risk of a second wave, which might mean another lockdown, is a risk we have to take seriously,\u201d he said, adding France had to \u201cprotect, test and isolate\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The lockdown would be followed by a monitoring phase, which would continue until 2 June, with regulations differing between regions. \u201cOur national strategy has to be adapted to different circumstances,\u201d Philippe said, adding that he would be meeting local officials on Wednesday and unions on Thursday to discuss the end of lockdown measures.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo, we have to live with virus, to end the lockdown progressively and adapt to circumstances; these are the three elements of our strategy,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p>Philippe said the availability of masks had been a subject that angered and upset a lot of French people. \u201cGiving masks to medical workers, necessarily meant depriving others of them,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>He said local authorities that bought masks would be reimbursed by the government for half the price, and that there would be enough masks in the country for the general public by 11 May, the day the lockdown ends, but said it would be some time for masks to be freely and widely available in shops.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:43:53.198Z\">at 2.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea8301f8f082c9ba20aa0f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kim-willsher\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:33:25.592Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">French prime minister outlines schedule for end of lockdown</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The French prime minister, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u00c9douard Philippe,</strong><strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>has begun outlining the schedule for the end of the coronavirus lockdown in France to MPs in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. </p> \n  <p>Philippe began saying the situation was unique. \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadia \u2026 would be closed.

the lowest per capita in the world. </p> \n  <p>The antibody tests taken from blood samples do not always pick up early-stage infections but show whether a person had the virus in the past, even if the person had no symptoms. </p> \n  <p>In comparison, the standard swab test determines whether a person has the virus at that moment by looking for it in secretions. <br></p> \n  <p> Several Indian

unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, told lawmakers. </p> \n  <p>He said at a parliamentary hearing </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is true that

particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on Monday he has a good idea how Kim Jong-un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate. </p> \n  <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was aware of reports on Kim\u2019s health and he was was paying close attention to developments. </p> \n  <p>North Korea had cancelled some large events, and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>But if Kim Jong-un is hiding out due to fears surrounding Covid-19, it would \u201cpuncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed\u201d, said Chad O\u2019Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which

has rejected claims it was the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The head of the lab told Reuters the claims have no basis in fact, adding there were still no conclusive answers as to where the disease started. </p> \n  <p> Conspiracy theorists have claimed Covid-19, now responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide, was synthesised by the <strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology</strong> (WIV), based in the city where the disease was first identified. </p> \n  <p>Though the scientific consensus is that the coronavirus evolved naturally, such claims have gained traction. </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on 15 April that his government was investigating whether it had originated in the Wuhan lab. </p> \n  <p>Yuan Zhiming, professor at WIV and the director of its National Biosafety Laboratory, said \u201cmalicious\u201d claims about the lab had been \u201cpulled out of thin air\u201d and contradicted all available evidence. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe WIV does not have the intention and the ability to design and construct a new coronavirus,\u201d he said in written responses to questions from Reuters. \u201cMoreover, there is no information within the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicating it was manmade.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Some conspiracy theories were fuelled by a widely read scientific paper from the Indian Institute of Technology, since withdrawn, claiming that proteins in the coronavirus shared an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d with those of HIV. </p> \n  <p>However, most scientists now say Covid-19 originated in wildlife, with bats and pangolins identified as possible host species. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMore than 70% of emerging infectious diseases originated from animals, especially wild animals,\u201d Yuan said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn recent years, we have seen increasing risks posed by close contact between humans and wild animals, with global climate change and the continuous expansion of human activities,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>All seven known human coronaviruses have origins in bats, mice or domestic animals, scientists say. </p> \n  <p>Yuan also rejected theories that the lab had accidentally released a coronavirus it had harvested from bats for research purposes, saying the lab\u2019s biosecurity procedures were strictly enforced. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHigh-level biosafety labs have sophisticated protective facilities and strict measures to ensure the safety of laboratory staff and protect the environment from contamination,\u201d he said. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

However, the system is not working as well as it should.</p> <p>\u201cThe reforms that we have recommended will bring real benefits for the courts and tribunals system and its users.

  "<p>The removal of protections in 10 sets of regulations relating to the care of looked-after children in England, with no public consultation or parliamentary debate, must be seen for what it is: an attack on their rights.

A new, serious illness that combines Covid-19 symptoms with others, described as a form of toxic shock syndrome, appears to be mercifully rare, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">about 12 cases</a> in the UK so far. But while attention is rightly focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/prejudice-older-people-coronavirus\" title=\"\">other vulnerable groups</a> (ethnic minorities, older and disabled adults) as well as on the population as a whole, there is a danger not only that children\u2019s interests are neglected, but also that adults are too distracted by other threats to do anything about this.</p> <p>Twice in the past four years, two previous children\u2019s ministers have attempted to roll back protections, including the entitlement of a child placed with new carers to be visited by a social worker within a week and checked on every six weeks. Independent six-monthly reviews of placements have been mandatory since the 1940s. But no longer. Now, following an abbreviated process that involved fielding queries from the Independent Children\u2019s Homes Association, but not discussions with the main adoption and fostering charities or children\u2019s rights groups, not only have visits been replaced with phone or video calls (reasonable in current circumstances), time limits for social worker checks and reviews have been removed.</p> <p>Local authorities\u2019 obligations with regard to children\u2019s social care have evolved gradually and unevenly, with the paroxysms of remorse following disasters such as the torture and murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 leading to big changes. Now, suddenly, long-established practice, such as the reliance on adoption panels to make life-changing decisions and requirements for criminal records checks, is being dissolved. But why? The Guardian has no wish to impugn the motives or capabilities of the children\u2019s minister, <a href=\"https://www.cypnow.co.uk/news/article/vicky-ford-appointed-children-and-families-minister\" title=\"\">Vicky Ford</a>, who made the changes after being in post for nine weeks. Given that they long predate her (identical moves to ditch six-monthly reviews were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/child-protection-law-averted-disaster-justine-greening\" title=\"\">abandoned by Justine Greening</a>), it seems clear that the deregulatory pressure comes from elsewhere.</p> <p>Children in foster placements and children\u2019s homes are already suffering disproportionately under the pandemic. They rely more on input from their teachers and other adults from whom they are now separated. In addition, many are used to regular meetings with birth parents or other relatives, including grandparents. In some cases the stopping of these this will be the cause of extreme distress.</p> <p>Police believe children are at increased risk of harm, including sexual abuse, during lockdown, and that crimes against them are going undetected (in normal times, teachers are the largest source of referrals). So far, child homicides do not appear to have risen in the way that homicides of women have, although in one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/27/neighbours-heard-woman-screaming-as-children-stabbed-in-london\" title=\"\">horrifying case</a>, two siblings aged under five have been killed. But this is the coldest possible comfort. Rarely has the lowly and disjointed nature of policymaking regarding children appeared more glaring. The pandemic must bring change. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 April 2020. A previous version referred to \u201cdiscussions\u201d between the DfE and Independent Children\u2019s Homes Association, but the ICHA has told the Guardian that these exchanges were limited to requests by the association for clarification on specific points. The article has been amended accordingly.</p>",

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After the Plague and the Great Fire, London was rebuilt by [the architect Christopher] Wren. In the decades after the second world war, London\u2019s manufacturing base dwindled to a fraction of its former self, and the Docks, the hub of the world\u2019s goods-trading economy were shuttered. But London was reborn as a city of services \u2013 financial, business, educational, creative, cultural, scientific, technological and more.</p> \n   <p>It seems unlikely that London, and cities like it, are about to disappear. But London may become a very different place from what it is now. A city where creative class or knowledge workers work from home as much as they commute to the office. Where the jostling for the best table in the restaurant takes place when booking online and not in the queue on the street. Where stadiums, art galleries and concert halls are redesigned to ensure public health along with entertainment and high culture. Where delivery vehicles are necessarily electric, and deliveries are grouped by algorithms and priced accordingly. Where pavements and public areas are widened to allow easy transition to social distancing, and where road space is recognised as a precious asset and charged for as such. Where the slow process of reimagining the high street gets speeded up. In this new London, centrality will retain both its allure and its economic benefits \u2013 but they will become relatively more expensive.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Scotland pavement widening is already on the agenda.

So there are a series of protections that allow people to be confident in using it that their privacy is being protected.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But he also said it would be \u201ctough\u201d to get 80% of smartphone users to install the app. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The message needs to be: if you want to keep your family and yourselves safe, if you want to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and at the same time we want get the country back and get the economy moving, the app is going to be an essential part of the strategy for doing that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Prof Christopher Fraser</strong>, senior group leader in pathogen dynamics at the University of Oxford Big Data Institute, told the committee that if roughly 60% of the population used the app, that would be enough to keep the reproduction number (the infectivity rate of the virus) below one, meaning the pandemic could be contained.</p> \n  <p>But he said that number would rely on people paying heed to other warnings about sharing data with the app rather than simply downloading it, and self-isolating when symptoms developed.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T12:10:44.041Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea804b18f086f39b4ca1506\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T10:38:19.099Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The work of postal staff will be marked on Wednesday as they continue to play a huge role during the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>National Postal Workers\u2019 Day is an annual event organised by the Communication Workers Union (CWU) to promote the work its members do year-round, but is particularly pertinent this year.

In the case of anybody who works in the NHS or in social care [who] has died from coronavirus, we look into it in each case to find out the reasons why they might have caught it and what lessons we can learn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked to response to what Hancock said, Chowdhury replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Hancock, the public is not expecting the government to handle this perfectly. None of us are expecting perfection. We are expecting progression. We just want you to openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling the virus, especially for me and so many families that have really lost loved ones as a result of the virus and probably as a result of the government not handling it seriously. Openly acknowledging a mistake is not an admission of guilt. It is genuinely just making you seem more human.

Earlier this month, she warned that domestic abuse killings were up to twice as high as normal since lockdown measures confined millions of people to their homes, although the sample size was small.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was always going to be an epidemic [of domestic violence] inside this pandemic,\u201d Baird said. \u201cIt should have been flagged up a lot earlier. There have been stories from social services of people not being able to obtain admission to [family] homes [to investigate] because they have been told, inappropriately, they haven\u2019t got personal protective equipment (PPE).</p> \n<p>\u201cMinisters are working very hard but they are all working in their own silos. It\u2019s imperative that there be more accommodation made available for victims of domestic violence. Refuges are full, others are in lockdown because of coronavirus [so can\u2019t take in new victims].\u201d</p> \n<p>There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared to 170 on the same day last year. The Women\u2019s Aid Annual Survey 2017, carried out on a single day, found there were 3,557 women with 3,919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s very little accommodation,\u201d Baird said. \u201cUniversities and hotels have been offering help\u201d but they cannot provide the specialist services required, she added.</p> \n<p>An intergovernmental group involving both the Ministry of Justice and Home Office should be established to deal with the problem, Baird urged, with the victims\u2019 commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner also involved.</p> \n<p>A survey published by Women\u2019s Aid on Tuesday found that over two-thirds of survivors contacted this month said that domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown; 72% said their abuser has more control over their life since Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Over three-quarters (78%) of victims, the survey found, reported that Covid-19 has made it harder for them to leave their abuser. One survivor said: \u201cI wanted to leave the relationship. However, since Covid-19 and the lockdown coming into effect, it has made it harder to leave. I am a key worker who is around Covid positive patients, so I don\u2019t feel like I can go home and stay with my parents.\u201d</p> \n<p>Womens\u2019 Aid said there was a severe shortage of refuge places even before the pandemic. There were about 300 refuges in England and Wales in 2017 but funding has been cut.</p> \n<p>Lucy Hadley, campaigns and policy manager at Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cDemand for refuge services far outstripped supply before the Covid-19 crisis. Sixty-four per cent of refuge referrals were declined in 2018-19, and the number of refuge bed spaces in England is 30% below the number recommended by the Council of Europe. These life-saving services are now on the frontline of the response to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are now facing staff shortages, lost income, challenges in managing social distancing within communal accommodation, and restrictions on resettling women and children into long-term housing. This simply means the spaces we have are even less accessible to survivors.\u201d</p> \n<p>Baird also told the justice committee that there is \u201csome suggestion of abuse by older children on parents\u201d during the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cThis is a newer kind of domestic abuse which is probably suggestive of kids wanting to go out and not being allowed to. We are talking teenagers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Calls to domestic violence helplines have rocketed, she said, although complaints to the police have not gone up commensurately. \u201cThere are real worries about access to any help if you are locked down with the perpetrator in the next room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, has criticised the government\u2019s announcement that it is providing just over \u00a33m in emergency aid. \u201cThat is why Labour has set out an urgent \u00a375m plan to fund charities working to protect people suffering from domestic abuse,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In the Commons, the new attorney general, Suella Braverman, said the extra funds being made available would help frontline services.

The majority of healthcare workers dying continue to be from a BAME background.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/why-are-people-from-bame-groups-dying-disproportionately-of-covid-19\">A number of possible reasons</a> have been suggested for the disparities but Warsi and Woolley warned against overplaying genetic and cultural factors at the expense of \u201cinequalities in health, employment, housing, and poverty\u201d.</p> \n<p>PHE has defended Phillips\u2019s involvement, saying his consultancy \u201chas the right skills and experience\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Covid-19 has left many Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities particularly vulnerable: in terms of their lives, and their livelihoods.</p> <p>The immediate cost has been laid bare as day after day we see our frontline workers \u2013 doctors, nurses, care workers and other medical staff \u2013 lose their lives as they try to save others. A staggering <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">63% of all those who have died</a> within the medical profession are ethnic minority. It is desperate beyond belief. For doctors in the UK, that figure could be as high as 80%. Alongside this, emerging data suggests that BAME people in the wider population are falling victim to the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">at a disproportionate rate</a>.</p> <p>And while some of these figures may be explained in part by the fact that among BAME communities a large number have felt a vocational calling to the caring professions, it doesn\u2019t account for the massive disparity in fatalities. Is part of the reason medical, possibly related to higher blood pressure and diabetes rates among ethnic minorities? Just as important, is it partly due to socio-economic reasons, related to poverty and lack of access to healthcare? Whatever the causes, if we are to pay the right tribute to the thousands of people who will have lost their lives \u2013 particularly those on the frontline \u2013 then we must, in an honest and transparent way, better understand why this seems to be happening.</p> <p>An inquiry by Public Health England has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/inquiry-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-bame\">been set up</a> to look into this. Though it is expected to be relatively short, it should in time be able to inform a more extensive Covid-19 public inquiry.</p> <p> And in addition to the fatalities and direct health impacts, researchers BMG have found that BAME groups have already suffered a greater financial hit than the broader white communities \u2013 and have been <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-economic-effect-uk-ethnic-minorities-young-people-a9460511.html\">almost twice as likely</a> to have lost income and jobs. Many fear that after this pandemic things could get even worse.</p> <p>The inquiry therefore should be bold enough to examine inequalities in health, employment, housing and poverty in general. </p> <p>There are a number of traps we should not fall into. First is the growing narrative that Covid-19 discriminates, but that our political, civic and business institutions don\u2019t. We know, for example, that a large number of ethnic minorities work in care homes, where they are low paid and possibly on zero-hours contracts. Many are faced with an impossible decision: do I stay at home to protect myself and my family, and risk having no money to pay the rent or buy food; or do I go to work, probably on public transport, where I have greater exposure to the virus and am least protected?</p> <p> Nor should we overplay cultural and genetic factors, and claim this explains the ethnic variance in death rates.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest challenge for the review will be credibility. Public Health England has given Trevor Phillips and his company, Webber Phillips, a prominent role. Yet a growing number of BAME groups and individuals are struggling to find the trust and confidence in him that is needed for this review to be taken seriously.</p> <p>Although Phillips is a former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, <a href=\"http://influencher.org/index.php/2020/04/26/an-open-letter-to-public-health-england-playing-racial-politics-with-a-pandemic/\">an open letter</a> signed by 100 black British women states: \u201cTrevor Phillips is now probably more famously known by many BAME community groups as having a recent history of discarding the very real issues and consequences of structural racism in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Another letter said to represent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/inzyrashid/status/1254846651472150529/photo/1\">thousands of BAME individuals</a> in the medical profession has been sent to Public Health England. It states: \u201cWe express our concern that Mr Trevor Phillips has been asked to provide expert support to the review \u2026 A suitable candidate who would be trusted by healthcare professionals from a BAME background must be sought.\u201d</p> <p>So Phillips and PHE will have a huge task in building the requisite trust for this review to be accepted by the people it is seeking to serve.</p> <p>Yet none of us should lose sight of what we could achieve with a better understanding of the devastating impact this disease is having on BAME communities. We could use this knowledge to reduce racial inequalities rather than entrench them further.</p> <p>Much has been made of the fact this is the greatest crisis Britain has faced since the second world war. Let\u2019s not forget that perhaps the greatest thing that came in the conflict\u2019s aftermath was the birth of our National Health Service.

  "<p>The White House has released guidance pushing responsibility for Covid-19 testing on to state governments in a political strategy that has been criticised as \u201cterrible\u201d for public health.</p> <p>However, under pressure to ramp up testing as several states make moves to reopen, Donald Trump\u2019s announcement instead continues to send <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-updates.html#link-2531a35c\">mixed messaging</a> around testing targets, with most of the burden falling on states.</p> <p>\u201cThey know that the federal response has been a disaster, and so now their strategy is blame 50 states,\u201d Ashish K Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Jha has spoken to White House officials who acknowledge the need for far more testing, which they understand will be difficult to do \u201cunless the federal government takes direct responsibility\u201d, he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf I know that the only way to fix this is federal, and yet I\u2019m saying I\u2019m gonna make the states responsible, it\u2019s another way of saying I know this isn\u2019t gonna work,\u201d Jha said.</p> <p>Following early setbacks, the US has scrambled to scale up <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html\">diagnostic testing</a> as part of a strategy to safely reopen the country. But current testing levels are still far from where they need to be, experts warn, even as restless Americans crowd <a href=\"https://apnews.com/994c91394e7fdeda403c0e27bb1c5f2d\">beaches</a> and <a href=\"https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/04/25/coronavirus-central-park-long-beach-crowds/\">parks</a> and states such as Texas and Georgia begin to relax their stay-at-home orders.</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert and key member of the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, said on Saturday that the country was performing between 1.5m and 2m diagnostic tests a week.</p> <p>\u201cWe probably should get up to twice that as we get into the next several weeks, and I think we will,\u201d he said, though he added that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/politics/fauci-us-double-diagnostic-testing-coronavirus/index.html\">testing is an important part but it\u2019s not the only part</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump and some of his allies are congratulating themselves for efforts they\u2019ve already made on testing and predict exponential growth in capacity. \u201cWe\u2019re going with maximum testing, because it\u2019s something we\u2019re very capable of doing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-33/\">Trump said Monday</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ll be much more than doubled.\u201d</p> <p>But another administration official has said the federal government actually means for states to test at least 2% of their residents monthly, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-updates.html#link-2531a35c\">New York Times</a>, a rate not dissimilar from the one now.</p> <p>CVS Health and Walgreens, two of the US\u2019s major pharmacy chains, announced they were expanding free testing, with CVS aiming for as many as 1.5m tests each month, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/27/coronavirus-tests-cvs-pharmacy-covid-19-testing-cvs-health/3035524001/\">USA Today</a> reported.</p> <p>More than 190,000 new tests were reported nationwide on Monday, <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">according to the Covid Tracking Project</a>, a gargantuan boost compared with the single digits recorded only two months before. But as the country steamrolls into May, 500,000 diagnostic tests will represent \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d per day to capture most infected people and assuage Americans\u2019 concerns, said Jha, a threshold that still hasn\u2019t been reached on any single day so far.</p> <p>\u201cIdentifying who\u2019s infected, who\u2019s not is like public health, disease control 101. Without that, you\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Jha said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t test people for the virus, you cannot figure out who\u2019s infected, you can\u2019t keep them away from susceptible people, you can\u2019t run your economy.\u201d</p> <p>Not all states will necessarily be equally affected, as an outbreak\u2019s size drives testing needs, Jha said. In an analysis he and his team collaborated on with <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">Stat</a>, projections show that New York will require upwards of 100,000 more tests per day starting in May to catch most infected people in time. This despite the state\u2019s already impressive infrastructure, where <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data\">more people</a> have been tested than anywhere else in the US.</p> <p>Texas, on the other hand, has been disparaged for <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article242250436.html\">its lack of testing</a>. But Jha\u2019s analysis shows the state is actually <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">performing enough tests</a> for early May, if social distancing measures remain in place. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has instead announced that he will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/texas-reopening-may-1-coronavirus/index.html\">allow some businesses </a>to reopen on Friday, a move with unclear consequences.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the key about the virus, is any action you take today, you won\u2019t see the benefits or the costs for several weeks,\u201d Jha said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, antibody tests \u2013 once touted as a potential measurement for who could safely re-enter society after developing immunity to the disease \u2013 have taken on a lesser role as the country actually moves toward reopening. Such a minuscule proportion of the US population has been exposed to the virus, and false positives on immunity tests abound, Jha said. But perhaps even more significantly, there is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">no evidence</a>\u201d that recovered Covid-19 patients cannot get infected again, even if they have antibodies, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">wrote</a> on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us believe that having antibodies should be protective for most people, but that\u2019s a lot of caveats,\u201d said Jha. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we should make policy based on luck.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>More than 8 million people visit York each year, packing cheek-by-jowl into its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snickelways_of_York\">narrow snickelways</a> and labyrinthine lanes.

  "<p>In 2016 Kathryn Wilson was a typical 30-year-old in inner Sydney; she lived in a sharehouse, worked as a graphic designer and had an arts degree gathering dust somewhere. After being diagnosed with a rare and advanced tumour near her pelvis, she endured complex and highly aggressive treatments that meant that for the next two years she was confined to hospital beds or within the four walls of her home. Adapting an outgoing social life into something that would fit inside a two-bedroom terrace was challenging, but narrowing her focus proved crucial to finding satisfaction in a compacted life.</p> <p>\u201cFirstly, you need to make your world smaller,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cYou need to learn to value things and people that are in your immediate field more highly than things that are inaccessible for you right now, so surround yourself with things you care about \u2013 that is your bubble.\u201d For Wilson, that list included houseplants, the full Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson back catalogue and working out which two-minute noodle was superior \u2013 shout out to Gourmet Spicy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/19/super-slow-cooking-nine-recipes-to-spend-all-day-with\">Super-slow cooking: nine recipes to spend all day with</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the majority of people, home is where we are going to be spending all our time until lockdown restrictions are eased, which is why you need to make it somewhere you want to be, she advises. \u201cPut up artwork you like; if you hate your old sheets buy crisp new ones. I\u2019m not saying you can shop your way out of this, but you\u2019re going to be clocking a lot of time on your bed so upgrade anything you use daily that irks you.\u201d</p> <p>Loneliness was an undeniable part of her reality. Keeping her partner and a small handful of close friends in daily contact helped, but distraction was how Wilson got through the moments in between. There\u2019s a lot of reality renovation shows available and other people\u2019s problems, especially design failures, are more fun than your own, she found.</p> <p>But just because your physical world has shrunk doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be a tourist. \u201cThe internet is boundless so now is the time to watch documentaries, play video games, and explore a weird subculture.\u201d Wilson really got into Scandiavian noir (fun fact: they only film on cloudy days) and Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race. She didn\u2019t just watch the shows, she read histories, think pieces and watched commentary. \u201cEmbrace the gravitational force of the click hole and your trivia game will never be stronger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1dc3895ee9d01a2e6720c980c01495788703199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1dc3895ee9d01a2e6720c980c01495788703199/0_230_1150_1310/878.jpg\" alt=\"Kathryn Wilson with her dog Perro.\" width=\"878\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kathryn Wilson with her dog Perro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kathryn Wilson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if you\u2019ve never gamed before, there\u2019s so much more than first-person shooting games out there. Wilson recommends the soothing qualities of programs like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/04/monument-valley-review\">Monument Valley</a>, a puzzle game that involves Escher-like mazes set against beautiful pastels, or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/skyrim\"> Skyrim</a>, an epic, open-world fantasy game where you can choose whether you\u2019re in a monster-slaying mood or just want to stroll the mountains collecting flowers and building a thatched hut.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to readjust your thinking: you don\u2019t want to save time, you want to fill it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have anywhere to be you might as well take your time over a sandwich. Don\u2019t be utilitarian about your lunch, apply relishes, make your own mayo. Meals are an important way of marking the passage of the day so make them something to look forward to.\u201d</p> <p>Having purpose is helpful, and many people find it in reaching out and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/17/self-isolation-survival-guide-relationships-coronavirus\">offering assistance</a> to others, but since staying home is all the help some of us can give our community, Wilson recommends marking one small achievement off each day. Maybe it\u2019s emailing a relative, or soaking a difficult stain, or sewing a button back on. It doesn\u2019t have to be much, but forward momentum is cumulative and it prevents each day slipping into the next in a cloud of Netflix and snacks.</p> <p>A lot of the advice on surviving isolation has focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/stay-active-and-curious-20-tips-to-help-avoid-sadness-in-lockdown\">maintaining routine</a>, especially when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-social-distancing-activities-food-drink-exercise-kids\">exercise and healthy eating</a>, and sure, if you too are suddenly gripped with the urge to bake your own bread, you\u2019ve never had more people with whom to compare crumbs. But Wilson\u2019s daily checklist was more foundational. \u201cIt\u2019s important to distinguish between pyjamas and daywear. I\u2019m not saying wear jeans around the house, but you might like to invest in some quality loungewear.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/17/studio-ghibli-and-beyond-the-best-anime-for-coronavirus-lockdown-days\">Studio Ghibli and beyond: the best anime for coronavirus lockdown days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we head into the winter months Wilson also suggests you consider a pair of slides. Not just for poolside reclining, they allow you to wear socks and keep them clean. Slides are part of her hospital go-bag, which also includes a three-metre phone charging cable, a good pillow, noise-cancelling headphones, a robe and a device pre-loaded with TV and movies.</p> <p>In hospital and at home, delivery services were a lifeline to the outside world. \u201cNow is not the time to balk at shipping and delivery costs. I once got a coffee delivered from McDonald\u2019s at 6am and a lemonade at 10pm. The drinks were $3.35 and delivery was $5, but it gets you what you need.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Wilson is doing well. In remission, she is relearning to ride a bicycle. And although her life is very different now, she\u2019s still eating two-minute noodles. In times of unprecedented crisis, like the one we are now living through, she urges everyone to give themselves a break. \u201cI thought I should use my treatment time to learn German but actually I just watched a lot of TV. It\u2019s OK to be protective of yourself, to live in your bubble and only do the things that make you feel good \u2013 isolation doesn\u2019t have to be part of your side hustle.\u201d</p>",

Be open to speaking with your kids about what\u2019s going on \u2013 respond to their questions and fears. Don\u2019t feel it is best to shelter them completely but do be wise about what and how you share with them. Take their lead and speak about it when they raise the conversation.

How do we avoid conflict?'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here\u2019s the thing about emotions: they are fleeting. Biologically speaking, emotions are actually a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329228/\">little burst of brain chemistry</a> that alter our mood. The healthy brain has evolved so that it <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5289590/\">does not get stuck in one chemical state for a long period of time</a> and this is what makes us human. The emotional tapestry we experience allows us to experience highs and lows \u2013 to be angry one minute and in awe the next. When our kids know that \u201cemotions have motion\u201d and fear moves on, it is easier for them to experience the fear, sit with it and then watch it give way to laughter as their dog comes up to lick their face.</p> \n<p>As parents, we can also take comfort in knowing that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d. The anxiety or frustration you had this morning during family lockdown will give way to a sense of relief that your family is safe, gratitude for the kindness of a friend, pride that your family is adapting and having little wins along the way during this time of crisis. So, feel the feels and allow emotions to rise knowing that they won\u2019t stay.</p> \n<p>For home learning, set a science assignment and ask your child to research the neurochemistry of emotions. Ask them to prepare a presentation on the three neuropeptides that boost positive emotions: serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. These might sound like big words, but your kids might surprise you with the learning on this topic.</p> \n<h2><strong>Make emotions concrete</strong></h2> \n<p>There\u2019s a truism in psychology, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to name it to tame it\u201d. A key part of building emotional intelligence is <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1099-0860.2006.00072.x\">being able to name one\u2019s emotions</a>. You can encourage your child to explore their emotions using the metaphors of weather. Have them name if they are cloudy, stormy, rainy, clear or sunny.

Music taps into our emotions in a way that words alone cannot. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin\u2019s research shows that <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/298964/this-is-your-brain-on-music-by-daniel-j-levitin/\">when we listen to music almost every region and neural subsystem in our brain is activated</a>. Music helps with emotion and with brain development too which is a bonus while we are all home-schooling.</p> \n<p>A fun music lesson to have your kids do during family lockdown is create a positive playlist of songs that boost your mood. Include songs about resilience, triumph and overcoming negative events. Build on this assignment by having your children write an essay about singers who have shown resilience and grit in their career.</p> \n<p>You can then use the playlist to create a new positive family ritual by pumping the music and dancing like crazy each night after dinner. This can be turned into a physical education lesson that will release the pent-up energy of your kids and boost their endorphins and dopamine \u2013 all while you are showing them a technique they can use for the rest of their lives to manage their emotions.</p> \n<p>The added bonus is you are creating a positive memory for the kids and when they look back on this challenging time, they\u2019ll remember the \u201cfamily dance-off\u2019s\u201d that occurred each night.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t control right now but one thing we can turn our attention to is the emotions of our family and how to help our kids cope and grow stronger through this experience. Helping your kids express, understand and grow from their emotions during Covid-19 is a skill that will last into their adult lives.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Lea Waters AM, PhD, is a psychology professor at the University of Melbourne and executive board member of the International Positive Psychology Association</p></li> \n</ul>",

  "<h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning of this crisis, Donald Trump has been saying a lot of not-smart things,\u201d said Trevor Noah on Monday\u2019s episode of The Daily Show, such as that coronavirus would magically disappear with spring weather, or that there was \u201cnothing to lose\u201d by trying hydroxychloroquine. \u201cBut a few days ago, as you\u2019ve probably heard by now, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">created shock waves of stupidity</a> with his latest and probably greatest unlicensed medical opinion yet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1254960915193135105\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump suggests injecting bleach, and now authorities have to respond the same way they do to viral TikTok challenges. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZbF5mW7NcL\">pic.twitter.com/ZbF5mW7NcL</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1254960915193135105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>That would be Trump\u2019s headline-dominating, beyond-the-pale suggestion at a press conference last Thursday that Americans should try blasting themselves with UV rays or injecting disinfectants, such as bleach, to treat the virus. \u201cThis is maybe the first time in documented history that we\u2019ve seen someone not-thinking out loud,\u201d said Noah. \u201cInjecting disinfectants into your body? This is the problem when the dumbest person in the room thinks they\u2019re the smartest person.</p> <p>\u201cI almost don\u2019t even blame Trump, because there\u2019s no way he even understands what bleach is,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cLike, do you think Donald Trump has ever cleaned anything in his life? Do you think he has ever actually used disinfectant? Cleaning supplies might as well be magical potions to him.\u201d Noah broke out his Trump impression: \u201cI dropped a hamburger on the carpet, then some Mexican lady came in with some Clorox, sprayed it on the carpet, said some spell in Spanish, and then it was gone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/24/trevor-noah-trump-coronavirus-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel\">Trevor Noah: Trump 'seems to think of chaos as an essential service'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re some random guy on the internet with 12 followers, you can say shit like this and it really doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cBut Donald Trump is not just some random guy.\u201d And in what Noah is now calling \u201cthe pandumbic\u201d, Trump\u2019s comments have had significant fallout, such as upticks in calls to state poison control hotlines, and the release of warnings from cleaning supply companies to <em>not eat bleach.</em></p> <p>\u201cYep, this is where we are now: authorities have to respond to the president\u2019s ideas the same way they do to viral TikTok challenges,\u201d said Noah. Although he did love that people still called their health departments to ask whether they should consume bleach, because it means \u201cthat even the people who are dumb enough to drink bleach are still smart enough not to trust something that Donald Trump said\u201d.</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFvNLP8li10\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RFvNLP8li10?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed Trump\u2019s endorsement of consuming bleach, since \u201cit\u2019s not enough that his supporters are all white on the outside\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNow, obviously, no one should do that,\u201d Colbert continued. \u201cSo this weekend, people did that.\u201d Calls to poison control forced the president to claim that his comments were merely sarcastic. \u201cOh yeah, Trump is famous for his sarcastic comments,\u201d Colbert deadpanned, then played a clip of Trump\u2019s oath of office. \u201cHilarious!\u201d</p> <p>Trump also lashed out at reporters on Twitter, decrying journalists and demanding they hand back their \u201cNoble prizes\u201d. When the internet pointed out that actually, there are no <em>Nobel</em> prizes for journalism, Trump again invoked sarcasm as an excuse. \u201cDoes sarcasm ever work?\u201d he tweeted. \u201cOh, sarcasm works great,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cSarcasm is absolutely the best thing for a president to do in the middle of a pandemic.

I should have expected it. We should all know by now: Trump will be more outlandish with each passing week because that\u2019s his nature.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Meyers was baffled \u2013 \u201cYou have two renowned scientists working with you. Why are you pitching ideas like a sixth-century druid?\u201d The comments track, though, as \u201cTrump\u2019s ideas for solutions are things that have always been there and require no work or effort from him. He\u2019s like a kid who forgot it was show-and-tell\u201d and points out the sun, Meyers said.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Meyers concluded, \u201cwe just need to be prepared. This is going to keep happening,\u201d since \u201cTrump is a powerful, dumb guy and he is friends with other powerful, dumb guys and they like to call each other up and pitch their dumb ideas to each other. The whole thing is like a lifelong episode of Shark Tank where no one has a good idea and everyone wins.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT73OdFupq0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TT73OdFupq0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel at least found one potential silver lining in Trump\u2019s false dismissal of his dangerous bleach endorsement as sarcasm: \u201cCan we claim we were being sarcastic when we elected him president?\u201d</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s press conference last week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued guidelines for disinfectants with the line: \u201cDo not ingest disinfectant products.\u201d Kimmel said: \u201cUnfortunately, many of those who support Trump are perfectly happy to ingest disinfectant products if the president tells them to do it.\u201d Even the makers of Lysol had to issue a warning. \u201cI think this might be the first president ever to embarrass a cleaning product,\u201d Kimmel said.</p> <p>\u201cUsually, when a human being says something that is dangerous and dumb and gets a ton of backlash for it, they either apologize or at the very least, reel it in,\u201d Kimmel concluded. \u201cBut if you\u2019re Donald Trump, you just don\u2019t do that. You just keep talking and talking and you try to bury it all under a mountain of nonsense.\u201d</p>",

Now, amid pressure for them to resume competition despite Britain being ravaged by a mysterious pox that has killed more people than the government can bring itself to count, Premier League players are being told to act like they exist in a bubble. These, then, are confusing and concerning times for players, far more confusing or concerning than VAR or the time David Moyes said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/30/david-moyes-west-ham-unveiling-manager\">he\u2019s all about winning</a>.</p> \n<p>There has been confusion in other countries too, of course, such as in France. There, the PSG big legume Nasser al-Khela\u00effi have reportedly called on Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and chums to accept big pay cuts to help make ends meet at the modest Qatar-backed public relations limousine.

  "<p>Last week, with the wider world preoccupied with matters of death and survival, the appeal court addressed the unfairness of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d right to rent scheme. The high court last year ruled the scheme \u2013 which obliges private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and prospective tenants, with the risk of five years in prison if they get it wrong \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">to be racially discriminatory</a>.</p> <p>Whatever its intention, what the law did in practice was encourage many landlords to withhold places to live from anyone who carried the potential for trouble under the act. The high court had ruled the measure unfair, saying it had \u201clittle to no effect\u201d on controlling immigration and that it flew in the face of human rights laws guaranteeing freedom from discrimination. That seemed sensible.</p> <p>Enter the appeal court, considering a cry of foul from a government that talks of the hostile environment as if it were a relic of the past while simultaneously keeping its strictures in place. The appeal court accepted that, under this law, some landlords did indeed discriminate against would-be tenants who had no British passport \u2013 as is the case with 17% of British nationals in England and Wales. That in itself was a victory for those such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) who opposed the scheme. But the appeal court judges dismissed the view of the high court and ruled the scheme, for all its problems, \u201cjustified\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d. They used legalese language but, basically, their conclusion was: \u201cHey, bad stuff happens.\u201d</p> <p>No law is perfect. But how can it be right to legally bolster a scheme so palpably open to abuse against such a significant section of lawfully entitled residents and British citizens? Are they, despite human rights law that is supposed to protect them, to be seen as collateral damage by ministers stuck in the mindset that caused the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>? Indeed the very people affected by that scandal, those unable to fully document their legitimate status, are the ones who could be made to suffer all over again when landlords deny them a place to live.</p> <p>The judges took the literal view that the legislation as written does not instruct landlords to discriminate. \u201cDiscrimination is not sanctioned under this scheme,\u201d they said. They were comforted by Home Office assurances that the checks landlords must take \u2013 sight of variables such as passports, ID cards, driving licences and letters from government departments \u2013 were not excessively onerous, and that landlords were told of the \u201cneed to treat all tenants equally\u201d. Meanwhile, they were told, empathetic officials helped vulnerable people meet the requirements. And to all that, the judges nodded agreement.</p> <p>But would any reasonable person, knowing the Home Office\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/home-office-windrush-report-damns-hostile-environment-policy\">hostile environment record</a>, accept these as realistic safeguards against discrimination? </p> <p>In fact the judgment noted evidence provided by the Residential Landords Association indicating that under this law, 5-6% of landlords discriminated against potential tenants who did not have British passports \u2013 and that the \u201cevidence of likely intent produces a figure of over 40%\u201d. But hey, bad stuff happens.</p> <p>Migrants legitimately seeking homes may suffer discrimination, judges said. But the discrimination is \u201centirely coincidental\u201d. The government and its legislation can\u2019t be blamed if people don\u2019t obey. Yet that is, of course, to dismiss the impact of discrimination on those who bear the brunt of it. And, as we know, people will often abuse bad law.</p> <p>And so ministers have their victory. As things stand, a bit of discrimination is acceptable. \u201cI am delighted,\u201d crowed the junior immigration minister Chris Philp.</p> <p>Thankfully, our system still has safeguards. The JCWI says it will refer the matter to the supreme court. So there is still a chance to draw a line in the sand, and to declare there is no level of acceptable discrimination. </p> <p>Yes, bad stuff happens. But it\u2019s no basis for public policy.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hugh Muir is a senior assistant G1 editor</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Frida Kahlo made a dramatic entrance to her only solo show in Mexico City. The artist arrived by ambulance and had to be stretchered into the gallery. Her sick bed, which had preceded her by truck, awaited her. The tequila flowed.</p> <p>The 46-year-old artist, who had less than a year to live, spent many months confined to bed by injury and illness during her short life. But her bedroom in La Casa Azul, the family home in Mexico City that she transformed into a sanctuary and menagerie, was where she blossomed as an artist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0aa579bb9e8811ed2b91ceb040b5f2d90729eb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0aa579bb9e8811ed2b91ceb040b5f2d90729eb0/0_0_2398_3600/666.jpg\" alt=\"Self-Portrait Dedicated to Dr Leo Eloesser, Frida Kahlo, 1940.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-Portrait Dedicated to Dr Leo Eloesser, Frida Kahlo, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 2020 Banco de M\u00e9xico Diego Rivera Frida Kahlo Museums Trust, Mexico, D.F. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe made art out of her pain and her frustration,\u201d says the author <a href=\"https://www.jessieburton.co.uk/index.html\">Jessie Burton</a>, who painted her own writer\u2019s hut blue as a homage to the Mexican artist\u2019s home in Coyoac\u00e1n. \u201cBeing contained not just in her house but in a bed for so long meant her art was almost like a metaphysical resistance. She was going to break out of those four walls, express herself and tell her story through painting.\u201d</p> <p>Kahlo\u2019s life story, a triumph of creativity against the odds, makes her a role model for an artist in quarantine. Most of her paintings are modest in size but pack a powerful punch. While Diego Rivera, her older and more famous husband was painting murals in Detroit in the 1930s, she was painting an early masterwork, the nude-self portrait Henry Ford Hospital, to channel the grief and trauma of losing a child, coupled with the death of her mother. It is the first depiction of a miscarriage in western art history.</p> <p>Back in Mexico, her bedroom was a safe haven but it was also a stage. Burton says that there is always an element of performance in her art and the way she fashioned her image. \u201cAll of these paintings are gestures of keeping up one\u2019s spirit, accepting one\u2019s lots and doing the best with it but there were a lot of complicated things going on.\u201d</p> <p>Kahlo might seem the modern artist most suited to self-isolation but she would have hated not being able to socialise and flirt. One of several lovers, the artist<a href=\"https://www.noguchi.org/isamu-noguchi/biography/biography/\"> Isamu Noguchi</a>, had to flee the Casa Azul when almost caught in bed with Kahlo by a gun-toting Rivera. Noguchi recalled: \u201cEverything that she couldn\u2019t do, she loved to do. It made her absolutely furious to be unable to do things.\u201d That included dancing, despite her disabilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b986bd01f39dc7090322681f87f03036ad095f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b986bd01f39dc7090322681f87f03036ad095f4/0_273_2720_1910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from Henry Ford Hospital by Frida Kahlo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from Henry Ford Hospital by Frida Kahlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianni Dagli Orti/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe worse she felt, the more she would adorn herself,\u201d says Circe Henestrosa, who co-curated the V&amp;A\u2019s Frida Kahlo show in 2018. The artist survived polio as a child but it left her with a withered and shortened right leg. She wore long skirts and three pairs of socks to disguise her disability from a young age. Kahlo\u2019s pelvis was smashed in a bus crash, aged 18. Henestrosa explains that Kahlo used her distinctive style, a blend of traditional Mexican Tehuana dresses, and modern European fashion, to draw focus from the torso up, and so distract attention from her wounded body.</p> <p>In the year she spent bed-bound afterthe crash, Kahlo abandoned her plan to become a doctor and turned to art. The artist\u2019s familiarity with death, which she nicknamed \u201cla pelona,\u201d the bald one, meant she never pulled her punches on canvas. She had no hesitation about portraying blood, her own and other\u2019s. The American playwright and politician <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Clare-Boothe-Luce-American-playwright-and-statesman\">Clare Boothe Luce</a> was shocked to receive a portrait she commissioned from Kahlo of a mutual friend. The Suicide of Dorothy Hale depicts the death of the aspiring actor, who jumped off a skyscraper. It is one of Kahlo\u2019s most surrealist works, a label she rejected. \u201cI never painted my dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cI painted my reality.\u201d</p> <p>Kahlo\u2019s art also continues to resonate today because of her radical politics. An idiosyncratic mix of communism, Mexican pride and lapsed Catholicism, she was a far more outspoken critic of America than her husband. Henestrosa points to a late, unfinished self-portrait of 1954 in which Stalin looms over Kahlo. It is not the kind of image reproduced in Kahlo kitsch and merchandise. Her Marxism recently irked Donald Trump\u2019s US ambassador Christopher Landau, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/frida-kahlo-mexico-christopher-landau-ambassador-twitter-us-trump-a9090126.html\">who tweeted </a>on a visit to Casa Azul that he admired the artist but had problems with her admiration of Stalin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f628faf478d16f19b9c700027bba4b1bc6758b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f628faf478d16f19b9c700027bba4b1bc6758b59/0_0_2527_2999/843.jpg\" alt=\"The Suicide of Dorothy Hale, by Frida Kahlo.\" width=\"843\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Suicide of Dorothy Hale, by Frida Kahlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Smith/Collection of Phoenix Art Museum, gift of an anonymous donor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Henestrosa had just finished installing an exhibition of the artist\u2019s extraordinary wardrobe in San Francisco\u2019s de Young Museum when coronavirus hit. The clothes and paintings now hang in darkened galleries. The museum\u2019s director, Thomas Campbell, who hopes to extend the loans so the show can reopen, says that Kahlo\u2019s words - \u201cFeet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?\u201d - have become an inspirational mantra during the lockdown.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hettie-judah\">Hettie Judah</a> has written a new book about Kahlo, which is due to be published later this year. She describes how, when ill and near death, Kahlo recalled in her diary an earlier period of confinement. As a child, struck down with polio, she would breathe against the window of her bedroom and draw a door through which she escaped in her imagination.</p> <p>Like the elderly Matisse, painting and collaging in the south of France, Kahlo transformed her mundane surroundings into something magical. But unlike the French artist, there was nothing soothing about her art.</p>",
  "<p>Changes to legal protections for children in care, introduced by the UK government as an emergency response to the coronavirus crisis, have been condemned as \u201cderegulation on steroids\u201d by children\u2019s rights campaigners.</p> <p>Activists described the decision to relax 10 key sets of regulations, developed over decades to protect the most vulnerable children in society, as an \u201coutrageous assault on safeguards\u201d and warned that children would be harmed.</p> <p>One of the key relaxations, which came into force last Friday, is the removal of the requirement for a social worker to visit \u2013 or even telephone \u2013 a child in care every six weeks, reducing it to \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d.</p> <p>The requirement for a six-monthly review of a child\u2019s care, introduced following the manslaughter of the 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2007/01/10/what-have-we-learned-child-death-scandals-since-1944/\">Dennis O\u2019Neill </a>by his foster carers in 1944, has been similarly relaxed, and adoption and fostering panels which allow for independent scrutiny have become optional.</p> <p>The government says the measures are temporary \u2013 expiring on 25 September \u2013 and will allow overstretched children\u2019s services greater flexibility, but there are fears that the coronavirus crisis is being used as an excuse to relax children\u2019s social care duties and the expiry date could be revoked.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq has written to the children\u2019s minister Vicky Ford calling on the government to publish data to show the impact on vulnerable children. Her Labour colleague Emma Lewell-Buck has posted a series of <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2020-04-27/40635/\">parliamentary questions</a> to find out more about the process which led to the amendments. \u201cThey are using this pandemic to experiment with vulnerable children,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The measures were introduced by the government as part of emergency coronavirus legislation, via a <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/445/contents/made\">statutory instrument</a>. Campaigners are concerned there was no public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny and they say many of the changes have been proposed by the government before.</p> <p>Carolyne Willow, the director of <a href=\"https://article39.org.uk/news/\">Article 39</a>, a charity that campaigns for the rights of children in institutional settings, said it was \u201cderegulation on steroids\u201d. </p> <p>She said: \u201cThis outright assault on safeguards protecting the most vulnerable children is outrageous. Safeguards are there to protect children from harm, so it goes without saying that these changes forced through without any public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny will harm children.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has produced no evidence to back up its claim that changes to 10 different sets of regulations are in response to the pressures of lockdown. It has also conveniently omitted to mention that this is the fourth time since 2016 that ministers have tried to impose mass deregulation in children\u2019s social care.\u201d</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Just for Kids Law, added: \u201cAt this time of national crisis, in its role as corporate parent the government should be going the extra mile for every child in care. It\u2019s astonishing that isn\u2019t the case and truly shocking that instead government has chosen to weaken the support offered to some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d</p> <p>There is growing concern about vulnerable children during lockdown. Schools have remained open to them, as well as children of key workers, to provide some protection but the numbers attending are small. <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/881662/COVID19_attendance_in_education_settings_240420.pdf\">Latest figures</a> show 10% of children \u201cin need\u201d and those with education, health and care plans are turning up at school \u2013 up from 5% earlier in the pandemic.</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWhile the vast majority of statutory duties remain unchanged, we have reviewed our regulations to allow some temporary flexibility, to be used where absolutely necessary, to help reduce pressure on the system and enable children\u2019s services to continue to support vulnerable children during the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>MPs are to try to outlaw the courtroom murder defence of \u201crough sex gone wrong\u201d during parliamentary debates on the domestic abuse bill, as cases of domestic violence soar during the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>The repeatedly delayed legislation came before MPs on Tuesday amid calls for a specific ban on \u201cnon-fatal strangulation\u201d, and threats of legal action over the provision of accommodation for domestic abuse survivors during the pandemic.</p> <p>The government has promised to look at what has been called the \u201cfifty shades\u201d defence to murder during sex, but has not yet announced any detailed legislative wording to introduce a ban.</p> <p>An amendment backed by the Labour MP Harriet Harman and the Conservative MP Mark Garnier is likely to be the focus of efforts to prevent anyone charged with murder escaping justice by alleging that the victim had consented to sex games.</p> <p>Harman urged MPs in the Commons on Tuesday to \u201cstop this injustice\u201d of the sex game defence, which means a man who admits to causing injuries that kill a woman \u201cliterally gets away with murder\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a double injustice. Not only does he kill her but he drags her name through the mud. It causes indescribable trauma for the bereaved family who \u2026 see the man who killed her describe luridly what he alleges are her sexual proclivities. She of course is not there to speak for herself. He kills her and then he defines her.\u201d</p> <p>The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told MPs the government hoped to present a solution to end the \u201crough sex defence\u201d by the report stage of the bill but did not disclose any details. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/22/concern-over-use-rough-sex-gone-wrong-defence-uk-courts\">campaign to change the law</a> has been led by the organisation <a href=\"https://wecantconsenttothis.uk/\">We Can\u2019t Consent to This</a> which has calculated that more than 20 women a year are injured or killed when it is claimed that sex games have gone wrong.</p> <p>The organisation also supports a call by the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice (CWJ) for MPs to include a new offence of \u201cnon-fatal strangulation\u201d in the domestic abuse bill.</p> <p>Harriet Wistrich, the director of the CWJ, said: \u201cOffenders are getting away with little or no punishment for this terrifying and dangerous offence. Police and prosecutors are not taking this offending sufficiently seriously. A simple amendment to the domestic abuse bill, making non-fatal strangulation a specific serious offence, could provide a remedy and help reduce femicide.\u201d</p> <p>The bill also contains clauses requiring domestic abusers to take polygraph tests \u2013 commonly referred to as lie detector tests \u2013 on release, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/20/ban-on-cross-examination-of-domestic-abuse-victims\">regulations to ban perpetrators from cross-examining </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/20/ban-on-cross-examination-of-domestic-abuse-victims\">victims during family court proceedings</a>.</p> <p>The new attorney general, Suella Braverman, told the Commons extra funds were being made available to frontline services dealing with victims of domestic abuse during the coronavirus crisis. She reminded those in danger that \u201cthey will not be breaking the law if they flee their home [during the lockdown] and seek help outside\u201d. MPs were also told that police in London are making 100 arrests a day in relation to domestic abuse cases.</p> <p>A survey published by Women\u2019s Aid on Tuesday found that more than two-thirds of survivors said domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown, with 72% saying their abuser had more control over their life since the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>More than three-quarters (78%) of survivors, the survey found, reported that Covid-19 had made it harder for them to leave their abuser. </p> <p>In a related development, Southall Black Sisters and the Public Interest Law Centre are launching a legal challenge against Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary, \u2013for the department\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide emergency funding for adequate accommodation for domestic abuse survivors during the Covid-19 crisis\u201d.</p> <p>The organisations said: \u201cBetween 23 March and 12 April 2020, the number of recorded killings of women rose from a weekly average of two deaths per week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">an average of five deaths per week</a>, a total of 16 killings within a three-week period.</p> <p>\u201cDuring lockdown, the Metropolitan police have arrested an average of 100 people a day for domestic abuse-related offences and have received a 30% rise in domestic abuse calls.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur [domestic abuse] bill will better protect victims, making sure they have the support they need whilst more offenders are brought to justice. We have committed to ensuring the law is clear that this [rough sex] \u2018defence\u2019 is unacceptable and are looking at ways to achieve this.\u201d</p> <p>The government has pointed out that those who deliberately cause harm or injury during sex can already be convicted under existing laws.</p>",

  "<p>The government will attempt to push back a legally binding deadline for the completion of an independent review of Prevent, the programme that aims to stop people becoming terrorists, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Communities, activists and civil liberties organisations have been calling for a review of Prevent for years, claiming it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background. Advocates of the strategy reject this and say it has successfully diverted vulnerable individuals from being radicalised.</p> <p>The review was first announced in January 2019 and it was written into the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act along with a statutory requirement for it to report back to parliament by August this year.</p> <p>In December its chair Lord Carlile was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/19/lord-carlile-prevent-review-legal-challenge\">forced to step down</a> from the role amid questions over his impartiality towards the strategy, throwing the future of the review into doubt.</p> <p>On Monday, four months after Carlile\u2019s departure, the Home Office launched a recruitment campaign for a new chair, with applications welcome till 1 June, and the Guardian understands the government intends to extend the deadline for the completion of the review.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis review presents a valuable opportunity and it is important that the new reviewer has sufficient time to complete it. We are aware that this is likely to have implications for the existing timescale and are taking steps to address this. More details will be provided to parliament at the earliest opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>The most controversial element of the Prevent programme is the statutory duty imposed on schools, NHS trusts, prisons, local authorities and other public bodies to report concerns about people they suspect may be at risk of turning to extremism.</p> <p>Muslims groups have made it clear they have little or no confidence in Prevent, which over time has faced claims that it is more concerned with gathering intelligence than supporting communities.</p> <p>Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThe UK government must learn from its past mistakes and ensure that the upcoming review is effective, wide-ranging and transparent, and that the reviewer is an individual who is truly independent.</p> <p>\u201cThis extension request must not be a case of the review being kicked into the long grass to avoid scrutiny. Prevent has caused untold damage, not least to British Muslim communities. A review into Prevent is long overdue already and it is imperative that it takes place as a matter of urgency, and the individual tasked with its implementation has the independence, credibility and trust required to deliver it.\u201d</p> <p>Carlile\u2019s appointment as chair in August 2019 was immediately criticised as it emerged he had previously told parliament he \u201cmay be somewhat biased towards\u201d the strategy and had declared his \u201cconsidered and strong support\u201d for the programme.</p> <p>Rights Watch UK, a human rights charity, filed a legal challenge and Carlile was removed before the case came to court.</p> <p>Launching the recruitment campaign on Monday, the security minister, James Brokenshire, said: \u201cPrevent gives vulnerable people the support they need to protect them from terrorist recruiters. We are always looking at how we can make the programme more effective, which is why we are committed to this independent review. I look forward to the appointment of the reviewer so they can get on with their vital work.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: \u201cThe government is clearly falling behind on the independent review of the Prevent programme, which was supposed to be completed by August 2020. It is disappointing to see yet more time wasted.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must move quickly in appointing a new chair for this important project. Not least because we know there are serious concerns that some will seek to use the current crisis and period of isolation, as an opportunity to promote online violent extremism.\u201d</p> <p>Rosalind Comyn, a policy and campaigns officer at the campaign group Liberty, said: \u201cThe government has had more than a year to organise a review of the Prevent strategy, but stark failings like appointing a biased reviewer have left the process flawed from the start.</p> <p>\u201cPrevent is embedding discrimination in our public services and damaging lives, with Muslims and people of colour bearing the brunt of its impact. The delay and failings surrounding the review have shattered any trust communities had in this process and the government\u2019s commitment to listening to their concerns.

By \u201cold\u201d I mean anything recorded before March 2020, when people were still squeezing past each other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">to get to the bar</a>, exchanging grimy coins and passing drinks back with their dirty bare hands. Did we really <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/26/punters-fear-cheltenham-festival-fall-victim-coronavirus-horse-racing\">throng like that</a>?</p> <p>It is a measure of how well we have internalised the reason for staying apart that casual, pre-coronavirus intimacy looks so alien. When we cringe at an old photo of ourselves with bad hair or clothes (or both, in my case) it is because we apply the lens of new information to judge our naive former selves. And now a whole world of slack hygiene feels remote in that sepia-tinted way; not just in time, but in values.</p> <p>The change is cultural, not political, and will not be undone by government decree. Even when some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/will-shoppers-return-to-the-uk-high-street-after-lockdown\">shops are allowed to trade</a> or schools partially reopen, the duty to be distant will remain for as long as contagion is a risk. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">absence of a vaccine</a>, that risk is open-ended. It will be a while before strangers shake hands again. Maybe the habit will be lost.</p> <p>This is not a superficial aspect of the Covid-19 crisis. Societies are shaped by custom and ritual as much as they are held together by legislation. There is no law against queue-barging, for example, but British people still have a keenly developed sense of justice around the issue.</p> <p>We must not underestimate the aggregate effect of curtailing millions upon millions of micro-niceties, even if we cannot predict what the impact will be. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-distancing-continue-until-2022-lockdown-pandemic\">rules of lockdown are eased</a>, the cordon sanitaire will remain in our minds. Each handshake or shared bag of chips is a little social contract \u2013 a declaration of affinity. And without physical proximity we have to work harder to negotiate those alliances.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t hard to see how our species evolved this way. There is an obvious cost in admitting predators and enemies into our personal space, so we are hard-wired to associate social distance with suspicion. The same applies in the case of hygiene, where we have evolved what the psychologist Mark Schaller has called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_immune_system\">\u201cbehavioural immune system\u201d</a>. At an individual level that is the spasm of recoil from a foul smell. At a more complex level it informs antisocial human characteristics \u2013 wariness of all things unfamiliar, especially people from outside our immediate, trusted circle.</p> <p>Evolutionary biologists have observed a cross-cultural and historical correlation between the prevalence of <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/84qcm/\">infectious disease and authoritarian politics</a>. The theory posits that \u201cpathogen stress\u201d leads to a more aggressive behavioural immune response, making societies less open, less tolerant and readier to sacrifice liberties for collective protection.</p> <p>That might sound like a wild extrapolation from two-metre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/social-distancing-tips-the-rules-of-safe-shopping-under-coronavirus\">gaps at the supermarket check</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/social-distancing-tips-the-rules-of-safe-shopping-under-coronavirus\">out</a>. I don\u2019t think lockdown will activate some dormant genetic predisposition to tyranny. The opposite response feels closer to the surface \u2013 our pent-up social energies one day exploding on to the streets in a licentious touchy-feely carnival.</p> <p>But that release might be further away than we hope. Meanwhile, it doesn\u2019t take an evolutionary biologist to hypothesise that chronic insecurity ploughs fertile ground for toxic politics. That is a lesson from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/02/authoritarian-leaders-people-safe-voters\">rise of xenophobic nationalism</a> across Europe and the Americas in the decade since the last financial crisis, amply corroborated by evidence from the first half of the 20th century.</p> <p>History is not destiny, so it is reasonable to presume that 21st century societies will find innovative ways to manifest the consequences of mass anxiety. For a start, we have the digital infrastructure that means a lot of life in lockdown has migrated online. That journey is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/25/working-from-home-how-to-stay-in-touch-and-stay-secure\">keeping many of us in financial solvency</a> and mental equilibrium, but with an insidious cost in social cohesion. Before coronavirus, people were already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/dec/04/echo-chambers-are-dangerous-we-must-try-to-break-free-of-our-online-bubbles\">burrowing into digital silos</a>, selecting the information that suited their prejudices or having that information selected for them by algorithms that interpreted prejudices from their search history.</p> <p>Social media is a brilliant centrifuge, separating us into discrete cultural channels, and an efficient <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/11/whatsapp-facebook-extreme-polarise-radicalise-mps-politicians\">engine for radicalisation</a>, polarisation and paranoia within those channels. Shared attitudes are refined; the grit of contradictory evidence is expelled; moderates fall silent while members of the group bid each other up towards the most extreme iteration of any opinion.</p> <p>That is how people make a journey at astonishing speed from unfocused alienation to murderous militancy; from vague mistrust of Westminster to deranged conspiracy theory. Politicians are as susceptible as everyone else, whipping each other into factional rages in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/12/whatsapp-the-go-to-tool-for-parliamentary-plotting\">WhatsApp groups</a>.</p> <p>In normal times, that process is slowed by friction from everyday brushes with analogue reality. We might not have seen fleeting conversations at football matches or on the bus as part of our social life, but each interaction with a stranger exercised muscles of empathy and diplomacy that are atrophying. </p> <p>We are now zooming deep into culturally reinforced comfort zones. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. The antidote to polarisation is solidarity and there is heaps of that around. The weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">ritual of doorstep applause for the NHS</a> is rightly cherished as an expression of communal spirit to transcend isolation. Images of those moments will be displayed as icons of national togetherness for generations, like the photos of Londoners <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205194638\">seeking shelter from the blitz </a> in tube stations, except there won\u2019t be so many people jammed together in the frame.</p> <p>That is no minor difference. We know there is a vast reserve of solidarity available and that it could be a healing social balm after years of painful division. But it is also a perishable commodity that degrades if left up on the shelf of abstract rhetoric. It needs to be applied in person and it is hard to bring people together without physically bringing people together.</p> <p>Economic redistribution is the traditional way to put solidarity into political practice, and there might be more public appetite for that than there has been for decades. But it isn\u2019t guaranteed, nor is financial inequality the only gap that will need bridging. The politics of quarantine have focused on the sacrifices involved, on the requirement for discipline and the challenge of repressing our socialising urges. The presumption has been that the springs will uncoil as soon as the pressure is released, and the old ways will bounce back.</p> <p>But not if the virus has corroded the mechanism. Some habits of trust might have to be relearned. It might require effort on a political and individual level to practice social <em>un-distancing</em> \u2013 to reach out of our digital boltholes. Repairing the damage done by this disease will be a project of cultural reconnection, not just economic redistribution. We will need new ways to feel joined for as long as we cannot take each other by the hand.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

It then issues automated alerts to those at risk whenever a fellow user records a positive test for the virus. The alerts will not disclose who has triggered the warning, but will advise contacts to seek a test or self-isolate.</p> \n<p>The app\u2019s developers have built the system around a \u201ccentralised\u201d platform following discussions with advisers including GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre.

The pair have also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/police-investigate-nrl-stars-josh-addo-carr-and-latrell-mitchell-over-social-media-post\">charged with firearms offences</a> after a video showed Addo-Carr shooting a gun.</p> <p>The NRL sanctioned all three on Tuesday, fining Cleary $10,000 for his breach, while Addo-Carr and Mitchell were hit with $50,000 fines. Tyronne Roberts-Davis, who featured in the photos with Addo-Carr and Mitchell, was also fined $10,000. All fines were 60% suspended for the remainder of the season.</p> <p>However, the quartet will not miss any playing time once the season restarts, after receiving suspended one-match bans.</p> <p>According to the Nine report, Cleary said the group of women at his house were his friends and stayed just a short time before leaving. He has since apologised to his teammates and club, the report added.</p> <p>The focus now, however, will be on the sport returning. V\u2019landys said: \u201cIt\u2019s safer now to play than it was in round two when we were playing. The daily infection rate in New South Wales was 25.79% when the last game was played.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been now less than 1% in NSW for the last 18 days and is continuing to drop. There has also been a significant improvement in the recovery rate, being 75% in NSW and 83% in Australia. Our players will be safer under our protocols than they would be as regular members of the community.\u201d</p> <p>Regarding the NRL players who have been punished, V\u2019landys said: \u201cThe players have a responsibility to the game and community. It is important that, in these challenging times, we all have to work together to combat Covid-19 and compliance with public health orders is a critical requirement.</p> <p>\u201cThe players have to understand that they are putting the game and the community at risk by their actions. It\u2019s certainly hard to accept such behaviour when the game is doing everything it can to persuade the community that its players are responsible and behave appropriately.\u201d</p> <p>The latest incident comes at a time when the NRL can least afford to be embroiled in controversy. The league is pushing to become the first major code in Australia to restart the suspended season and is close to finalising details for a return to action on 28 May.</p> <p>To do so would require all players and staff to adhere to strict biosecurity measures set out in a 48-page draft document distributed to clubs on Sunday. The clubs were due to again meet with the players\u2019 union on Tuesday to thrash out final details of the guidelines with a view to players resuming training next week.</p> <p>Measures in the document include strict isolation at home. Players would only be allowed out for training, to play games, receive medical treatment or shop for essential items. It is still to be determined whether hospital visits for players with pregnant partners and dropping children off at school will be allowed.</p> <p>The NRL has said it will try to educate players and staff about the new guidelines, but will apply harsh penalties, including fines and points deductions, for those who do not comply.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/27/rugby-league-clubs-are-the-beating-heart-of-their-community-and-must-survive\">Rugby league clubs are the beating heart of their community and must survive | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Former Panthers general manager Phil Gould, who was instrumental in ensuring Cleary stayed at Penrith when a multimillion-dollar deal was signed in 2018, had called for tough sanctions.</p> <p>Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys said: \u201cIt is important that, in these challenging times, we all have to work together to combat Covid-19 and compliance with public health orders is a critical requirement.</p> <p>\u201cThe players have to understand that they are putting the game and the community at risk by their actions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard to accept such behaviour when the game is doing everything it can to persuade the community that its players are responsible and behave appropriately.</p> <p>\u201cThe penalties have been structured so as to give these players one further opportunity to demonstrate that they can be trusted.

  "<p>\u201cThe garden seduces me,\u201d says Ron Finley, who is known around the world as the \u201cgangsta gardener\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll get out there at 9am and next thing I know it\u2019s 7pm \u2026 gardening takes your mind off things.

  "<p>Victoria Beckham\u2019s clothing brand is being sued by a pattern cutter who claims to have developed a serious hand injury that required surgery after working for up to 15 hours a day in the run-up to New York fashion week.</p> <p>Kristina Kubiliene, 54, worked for Victoria Beckham Ltd at its London studio for nearly eight years and left last year after developing carpal tunnel syndrome, which left her barely able to open her handbag, her lawyer said.</p> <p>She underwent surgery last year which meant she could not do her job and she has been unable to work since, it is claimed.</p> <p>It is alleged that the condition \u2013 which causes tingling, numbness and pain in the hand and fingers \u2013 came on after Kubiliene handled heavy fabrics and equipment as she worked for up to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, in the run-up to fashion week. She did not have regular breaks or rest and had to take painkillers to get through shifts, her lawyer claims.</p> <p>It is alleged that Beckham\u2019s firm \u201cfailed to put measures in place to look after Kristina and prevent this from happening\u201d. The law firm Slater and Gordon is representing Kubiliene in a personal injury claim at the high court. The firm would not disclose the sum Kubiliene is seeking.</p> <p>Natasha Moyeed, an industrial disease lawyer at Slater and Gordon, said her client had \u201cabsolutely loved her job\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a pattern cutter and very good at this job, but because she was good she was tasked with working for long periods and with heavy fabrics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was these repetitive, awkward and sustained movements which cause carpel tunnel syndrome to advance rapidly in hands and wrists.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I last saw her she could barely open her handbag. She is unable to work and has had to undergo surgery to have any kind movement in her hands.\u201d</p> <p>Moyeed added: \u201cNormally she worked 10am to 6pm, but twice a year for two weeks she attended New York fashion week. For a month beforehand her workload increased to up to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, without regular breaks or rest. During these times her hands and wrists were so sore she needed painkillers to work. Victoria Beckham Limited failed to put measures in place to look after Kristina and prevent this from happening.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Victoria Beckham Ltd declined to comment.</p> <p>This month Beckham\u2019s company faced a backlash after it emerged it had used taxpayers\u2019 money to furlough 30 staff during the coronavirus lockdown despite its founder\u2019s vast personal wealth.</p> <p>Though the brand boasts it has won critical acclaim since its launch in 2008, it has struggled to turn a profit. The company\u2019s latest accounts filed at Companies House show it lost more than \u00a312m in 2018.</p>",

Another neighbour rushed out with mattresses to help break her fall but he was too late.

The number of women contacting support services, which have been designated as essential by the government, by email or on social media is said to have increased by as much as 700%.</p> <p>But there has been a sharp drop in complaints being made to the police.</p> <p>Ana Bella, a survivor of abuse who founded the <a href=\"https://www.fundacionanabella.org/en/\">Fundaci\u00f3n Ana Bella </a>to fight gender violence, said that in order to bring a formal complaint, women need the support of family and people around them and isolation is making this more difficult.</p> <p>\u201cBut the greatest barrier to reporting abuse is the emotional ties we have with the perpetrator,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only crime where the victim doesn\u2019t want revenge but just to live in peace. It\u2019s very difficult to report the father of your children to the police.

We\u2019re a model for other countries, some of which don\u2019t even keep official statistics of murdered women.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past couple of years, Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party has led a backlash against women\u2019s rights, calling for laws intended to protect women to be repealed on the grounds that they discriminate against men.</p> <p>\u201cSpain is one of the most advanced countries in gender equality and this is unstoppable, whatever Vox says,\u201d Bella said. \u201cThey want to dilute gender violence into what they call family violence.

  "<p>A major research project into one of the world\u2019s most popular and captivating paintings has revealed new secrets but the most tantalising question remains: just who was the girl with a pearl earring?</p> <p>Researchers at <a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/girl-with-a-pearl-earring-670/\">the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague</a> on Tuesday revealed the results of extensive investigations into its star painting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/02/art\">Johannes Vermeer\u2019s Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>, thought to date from about 1665. </p> <p>The Netherlands\u2019 researchers were stunned to discover, for the first time, delicate eyelashes on the girl\u2019s face and evidence of a green curtain behind her head. They have also gained fresh insights into how Vermeer painted the work, what changes he made and which pigments he used, including discovering that the white for the earring originated in England\u2019s Peak District.</p> <p>But the biggest mystery endures and that is a good thing, said Abbie Vandivere, the head of <a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/restoration-and-research/girl-with-a-blog/\">The Girl in the Spotlight</a> research project.</p> <p>\u201cWe were able to find out so much about Vermeer\u2019s materials and techniques but we still don\u2019t know exactly who the girl is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is good that some mysteries remain and everyone can speculate about her.

It would have been more precious than gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meet Vermeer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vandivere said the two biggest discoveries were finding the girl\u2019s eyelashes and evidence that Vermeer painted a green curtain, which has gradually faded, rather than an empty dark background.</p> <p>Scholars have previously speculated that the girl\u2019s lack of eyelashes might be because Vermeer was painting an idealised or abstract face. A similar argument was made for the formless expanse behind her.</p> <p>Both discoveries \u201cput the girl in a defined space and bring us a lot closer to her\u201d, said Vandivere. They suggest Vermeer was faithfully observing and painting a real person in a real space.</p> <p>Speculating on who the girl was, with her enigmatic expression, wide eyes, unusual blue turban and huge pearl earring, remains part of the fun.</p> <p>The novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/16/tracy-chevalier-vermeer-girl-with-pearl-earring-world-tour\">Tracy Chevalier</a>, in her book Girl with a Pearl Earring, which became a successful film, imagines the character as a maid in Vermeer\u2019s house who is persuaded to secretly pose for him.</p> <p> The Mauritshuis research has also brought us closer to Vermeer\u2019s painting techniques, said Vandivere, showing how he began composing the painting in various shades of brown and black before adding the colours, working systematically from the background to the foreground.</p> <p>The pearl itself is an illusion in that \u201cit has no contour and also no hook to hang it from the girl\u2019s ear\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Researchers also discovered changes Vermeer made, including shifting the position of the ear, the top of the headscarf and the back of the neck.</p> <p>Researchers have been able to pinpoint where the raw materials for the colours came from. Vermeer would have bought them in his home town of Delft, but the lead ore in his white would have come from the Peak District; the cochineal in his red was made from insects that lived on cacti in Mexico and South America; and the blue in the headscarf was made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, from what is now Afghanistan. It is surprising how much he used, said Vandivere, because in the 17th century it would have been more precious than gold.</p> <p>The director of the Mauritshuis, Martine Gosselink, said: \u201cThe girl hasn\u2019t revealed the secret of her identity yet but we got to know her a little better. This is not the end point of our research.\u201d</p>",

A balance of -54 percentage points said they anticipated a fall in annual sales in May \u2013 the weakest expectations in the survey\u2019s history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the survey, which was carried out between 27 March and 15 April:</p> <ul> <li><p>67% of retailers said the Covid-19 outbreak was having a significant negative impact on their sales.</p></li> <li><p>39% of retailers reported a total shutdown of UK activity due to the outbreak.</p></li> <li><p>44% of retailers reported furloughing staff, while 8% reported permanent staff layoffs.</p></li> <li><p>96% of retailers reported cashflow difficulties, with 40% facing difficulties meeting tax liabilities.

Two-fifths have shut up shop completely for now. And sales of groceries and other essentials also fell, suggesting households may have been dipping into stockpiles built up prior to the lockdown or tightening their belts more generally as incomes take a hit.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees in retail remain at risk, there are encouraging signs that the government\u2019s job retention scheme is providing genuine relief, with many opting for temporary rather than permanent layoffs.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The government has capped pay for private hospital bosses and banned bonuses while their facilities are taken over by the NHS to help during the coronavirus crisis, in a rare example of demanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/ftse-100-firms-using-furlough-scheme-pay-ceos-average-of-36m\">executive pay limits </a>in return for emergency state support.</p> <p>Under a deal agreed last month, the government took over 8,000 private hospital beds, 20,000 nurses and 700 doctors \u201cat cost\u201d for at least 14 weeks, in what was described as a de facto bailout for the companies.</p> <p>The temporary takeover was designed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">provide </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">extra healthcare facilities </a>during a time of national crisis, but has also provided financial relief to the private hospital companies and their shareholders. The sector was facing a huge fall in revenues during lockdown, as non-emergency treatments were cancelled and foreign patients \u2013 who account for a significant proportion of private hospital income \u2013 were prevented from travelling to the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/ihpn-partnership-letter-25-march-2020.pdf\">26 companies who signed up to the NHS deal</a> cannot claim back costs for executive salaries higher than the pay of NHS trust bosses for the period that the NHS remains in control of their facilities, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions. The NHS will also not cover dividend payments to shareholders during the takeover period.</p> <p>The median annual pay of the chief executive of a very large acute NHS trust should be about \u00a3225,000, <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/supporting-providers-executive-hr-issues/\">according to NHS guidance</a>. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, was <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Annual-Report-Full-201819.pdf\">entitled </a>to a salary of up to \u00a3240,000 for the 2018-19 financial year.</p> <p>Although the median annual salary of a trust chief executive is almost eight times higher than the UK average, maintaining the pay cap over a 12-month period would represent a significant reduction for many private healthcare bosses whose pay deals are significantly bigger than their public-sector counterparts. Once the initial 14-week period of the deal expires, it can be extended on a weekly basis.</p> <p>For instance, Justin Ash, the chief executive of Spire Healthcare, received <a href=\"https://investors.spirehealthcare.com/media/lpinl0s0/2019-full-annual-report-new.pdf\">\u00a31m in total </a>pay for 2019. Spire said Ash and the chairman and finance director had each agreed a 20% pay cut for April, May and June.</p> <p>The highest-paid director of the UK subsidiary of private hospital owner Ramsay subsidiary received \u00a31.1m in the year to June 2018. The highest-paid director at private equity-backed Circle Health, which is merging with privately held BMI Healthcare, was paid \u00a3561,000 in 2018. US-listed hospitals giant HCA Healthcare has cut pay for senior executives by 30%, while the highest-paid director of the UK subsidiary was paid \u00a3711,000 in 2018.</p> <p>However, the contracts are understood not to contain provisions relating to executive pay or bonuses beyond the period of NHS control, raising the possibility that some private hospital bosses could still receive large rewards during 2020, even though the companies may have struggled to hit targets or even survive without emergency help from the government or investors.</p> <p>There are also understood to be no limits on dividends beyond the period when the NHS has control of the hospitals, potentially allowing payments to shareholders to resume at a later point.

  "<p>A surge in gun-related Google searches and estimated gun sales in the US during the worst public health emergency in modern history could lead to higher suicide rates, experts have warned.</p> <p>From early March to mid-April, when the US began to experience the full force of Covid-19, its residents conducted roughly 2.1m Google searches about buying and cleaning guns, according to <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/covid-search/\">research</a> conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety and shared exclusively with the Guardian. Those numbers signaled a 158% increase from what would have been expected absent the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Estimated gun sales also soared to 2.58m in March, <a href=\"http://smallarmsanalytics.com/v1/pr/2020-04-01.pdf\">Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting</a> reported, an 85.3% jump from the same time last year.</p> <p>\u201cThis unprecedented spike in new guns in people\u2019s homes and this Googling about taking people\u2019s guns out of storage, combined with this drastic increase in unemployment, presents a huge risk for a collateral public health crisis, which is firearm suicide,\u201d said Sarah Burd-Sharps, director of research at Everytown.</p> <p>Suicides already account for almost two-thirds of gun-related fatalities in the US, and <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2756854/suicide-case-fatality-rates-united-states-2007-2014-nationwide-population\">nearly 90%</a> of suicide attempts using firearms end in death, compared with 4% where a gun isn\u2019t used. <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2756854/suicide-case-fatality-rates-united-states-2007-2014-nationwide-population\">Although the lion\u2019s share</a> of suicide attempts don\u2019t include guns, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636#_i10\">research</a> suggests those that do comprise the majority that are ultimately fatal.</p> <p>Now, because of Covid-19, the economy has been devastated, victims of child abuse and domestic violence are trapped at home with their perpetrators and, generally, people are physically distanced and socially isolated. All of these phenomena pose risks for suicide, said Nadine J Kaslow, a professor at the Emory University school of medicine and a former president of the American Psychological Association.</p> <p>Some places are already seeing that the crisis around Covid-19 may be exacerbating suicidal tendencies. In Portland, Oregon, for example, suicidal calls to police jumped 23% in the early days of the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/calls-from-suicidal-people-to-911-are-rising-portland-police-say-coronavirus-could-be-fueling-anxiety.html\">even as call rates dropped overall</a>.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, not everybody who gets a firearm is going to use it to take their own life. People are getting these firearms for lots of different reasons. But it\u2019s [a] subgroup of people, and it\u2019s a subgroup we have to be, in my opinion, very concerned about,\u201d said Kaslow.</p> <p>Burd-Sharps found that when she and her team first pulled Google search data, the states with the greatest surges in gun-related searches were at that time considered to be, or be close to, Covid-19 hotspots. Many of them, including New York, California and Connecticut, usually have <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/gun-ownership-rates-by-state/\">low gun ownership rates</a>, compared with the rest of the nation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/us-gun-purchases-coronavirus-record\">Anecdotal evidence</a> also suggests that many of the buyers were first-time gun owners. That distribution matters because, say, adding a fifth gun to an already armed household isn\u2019t the same as exposing an entire family to a new and potentially deadly weapon, explained Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University.</p> <p>\u201cTo the extent that there are new gun owners, those new gun owners are now putting themselves and everyone in their home at substantially higher risk of dying by suicide,\u201d said Miller.</p> <p>Before the pandemic, roughly <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993703/\">one in three US households </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993703/\">owned a gun</a>, and even exponential spikes in gun sales on a temporary basis would be a \u201cdrop in the ocean with respect to the total number of guns in civilian hands\u201d, Miller countered.</p> <p>\u201cTo look for marginal effects of new guns or other types of exposure changes is sort of to miss the forest for the trees,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others, however, are genuinely alarmed by the trend of people buying guns or bringing them out of storage during a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of domestic violence. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of child abuse occurring. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re going to see people get into socio-economically dire situations,\u201d said Eric Fleegler, a physician and researcher at Boston children\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>\u201cThe presence of guns takes any toxic environment like that and puts a higher risk on things,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Fleegler warned in a recent analysis that the US is \u201c<a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2765237/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-firearms-united-states-epidemic-suicide\">primed for a suicide epidemic triggered by C</a><a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2765237/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-firearms-united-states-epidemic-suicide\">ovid-19</a>\u201d, a tragedy that\u2019s both \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d, partially by limiting gun access. And, he said, the consequences of guns being so readily available during a time of crisis could far outlast a single pandemic, a warning echoed by other experts.</p> <p>\u201cGuns are a durable item,\u201d Fleegler said. \u201cThey last for years, decades.

  "<p>I don\u2019t know what kind of disinfectant Donald Trump has been injecting, but the man does not appear to be well. The president\u2019s lethal medical musing has turned him into (even more of) a global laughing stock and the widespread ridicule has clearly bruised his fragile ego. While Trump has never been a paradigm of calmness or competence, he has become increasingly irate and erratic in recent days. Now even his diehard supporters seem to be cooling towards him. Is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/19/a-very-stable-genius-review-donald-trump-leonnig-rucker-washington-post\">very stable genius</a>\u201d starting to unravel?</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s start with the president\u2019s weekend tweetstorm, which, even by Trumpian standards, was spectacularly unhinged. On Sunday, Trump lashed out at what he called a \u201cphony story\u201d in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html\">New York Times</a> that claimed he spends his days eating junk food and watching TV. \u201cI will often be in the Oval Office late into the night &amp; read &amp; see [in the Times] that I am angrily eating a hamberger &amp; Diet Coke in my bedroom,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cPeople with me are always stunned.\u201d He then deleted the tweet and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1254491971558748160?s=20\">replaced it with one</a> in which hamburger was spelled correctly. (This was clearly a challenge for him: he has previously misspelled hamburgers \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/01/16/burger-king-hamberder-chain-trolls-president-trump-over-tweet/2590994002\">hamberders</a>\u201d.)</p> \n<p>It turned out that the hambergers were just an appetiser. A rant about the \u201c<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/494748-trump-on-noble-prize-tweets-does-sarcasm-ever-work\">Noble</a>\u201d prize, which Trump seems to have confused with the Pulitzer prize, followed. This was subsequently deleted and replaced with a tweet stating it had all been an exercise in sarcasm. He is a master of sarcasm, as we all know.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"29ae219a-db38-4e74-b8e0-effde9cb787b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1bX8kEHTbug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While none of Trump\u2019s aides seem able to shut down his Twitter account, they are trying to tone down his daily press briefings. Trump didn\u2019t hold a briefing over the weekend as he normally does, while Monday\u2019s event was cancelled and then reinstated. \u201cWe like to keep reporters on their toes,\u201d the White House director of strategic communications, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-coronavirus-communications-strategy-off-confusing-start/story?id=70363900\">Alyssa Farah, tweeted</a> with a winking emoji. She then deleted the tweet \u2013 presumably to keep reporters on their toes. Monday\u2019s briefing was notable for the briefness of Trump\u2019s remarks; instead of treating it like a political rally, he ceded the floor to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-us-live-cases-america-trump-cuomo-states-reopen-plans-latest-news-updates\">number of CEOs</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/trump-pandemic-floundering-coronavirus-crisis\">bump</a> in his ratings last month when he stopped downplaying coronavirus and announced a 15-day plan to slow the virus\u2019s spread. During his brief experiment with coherence, 55% of Americans said they approved of the way he was handling the crisis and CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, told viewers Trump \u201cis being <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/dana-bash-praises-trumps-press-conference-the-kind/\">the kind of leader that people need</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>The tide now seems to have turned. <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-largely-unimpressed-with-trumps-handling-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/\">Recent polls</a> show that most Americans are unimpressed with Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis. This includes conservatives: a Siena College poll released on Monday found that <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/ny-republicans-trust-cuomo-more-than-trump-on-virus-rebound-new-poll-shows/2390989/\">56% of Republican voters in New York</a> say they trust Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s Democratic governor, to decide how to reopen the state over Trump.

According to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/27/trump-hope-hicks-coronavirus-crisis-210808\">Politico</a>, Trump is leaning heavily on Hope Hicks, who he reportedly calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hope-hicks-says-goodbye-to-trump-white-house-photos-2018-3\">Hopey</a>\u201d, to steer him through the coronavirus crisis. Hicks, 31, who was formerly the White House communications director, is one of Trump\u2019s most-trusted aides; according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hope-hicks-trump-pants-2017-12\">one tell-all book</a>, her duties used to include steaming his trousers \u2013 while he wore them. It turns out Hopey is the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/hope-hicks-behind-donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings\">mastermind</a> who urged Trump to \u201cact as a frontman\u201d during the crisis instead of deferring to health experts. Now that plan has backfired, Hicks \u2013 who officially works <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/27/cosmetic-surgery-jared-kushner-botox-donald-trump-son-in-law\">under boy genius Jared Kushner</a> \u2013 is apparently developing a new strategy for Trump.

  "<p>One for dreams, one for writing down things you might otherwise forget, one for composing drafts and organising your thoughts: in the end, they all get mixed up, but that\u2019s half the fun of keeping notebooks. You could use your phone, but it isn\u2019t the same. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-a-steamer-at-sea-d41150\">JMW Turner\u2019s sketchbooks</a> or his palette, you can\u2019t stick an iPhone in a vitrine in some Tate archive show \u2013 should you end up there. It might ring. Nor would you pass it on as an heirloom. That would be mad, although I do still have an old answerphone cassette where I could, if I dared, listen to decades-old chivvyings from former editors and messages from the dead. This is a question less of technology and more of feeling haunted.</p> <p>If you are going to the bother of using a notebook, why not a real book? A book will almost always help the time pass more quickly on your travels, even if it takes you back to the 18th century or even further, say to the early <a href=\"https://www.theartstory.org/movement/northern-renaissance/\">northern Renaissance</a>. There\u2019s always a lot of catching up to be done. A book quells anxiety, even if it is one that dwells on the anxiety of others. You can\u2019t open a book without finding something troubling, in my experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c600d5777c299c39a31a3fddf1705170bcf031ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c600d5777c299c39a31a3fddf1705170bcf031ee/0_0_13687_9624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Headspace \u2026 notebooks are invaluable in organising thoughts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headspace \u2026 notebooks are invaluable in organising thoughts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Searle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you don\u2019t have a notebook, you can always write in the margins or the insides of the covers. It would teach brevity. Art catalogues often have wide margins, which gives one a bit more leeway. And isn\u2019t every book a rewriting of someone else\u2019s? And every picture too, come to that. Literature is, after all, meant to be improving. And some people think they can always improve on what someone else has written or painted or drawn. They\u2019re forever looking to pick holes or find mistakes. There are even some critics who think it is their job to swan about the place correcting mistakes and eliminating errors. But the damage has already been done.</p> <p>Going about my researches, I have often taken out library books only to find them spoiled with invasive scribblings, often intended, it seems to me, with the next borrower in mind. Passages of the original work underlined and adumbrated with exclamation marks and double or even treble question marks; phrases scored out and notes running down the margin at right angles to the printed text. We are not just talking about novels here, however elevated they might be, but also works of philosophy, psychology, history and literary criticism, art history and art criticism, including those that are filled with theories and have hardly any pictures in them. Even no pictures at all, but pages of footnotes and a copious index.</p> <p>Whenever I come to sell or donate the art catalogues that pile up during the course of my work, I have to check that I haven\u2019t left any of my own notes scattered within the pages, or defaced the sumptuous coloured images with felt-tipped obscenities and curses, cigarette burns, scribbled-on moustaches or dicks or other impetuous graffiti, somewhat in the manner of <a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/repositories-black-magic-humour-and-horror-antonin-artauds-asylum-notebooks\">Antonin Artaud</a>, which sometimes happens when the urge is upon me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I must admit I can never entirely believe the things I write in notebooks.

They picked my pocket. I was returning home from visiting my aunt, who was in a coma in hospital. I didn\u2019t have a book with me that day and so whiled away the hours drawing her, on what turned out to be her deathbed. She just lay there, breathing heavily. What I really mean is snoring, at a volume quite out of proportion to her still and tiny body. The nurses had left the window open beside her, it was early autumn, and I think they hoped she would catch pneumonia and die. Not that she\u2019d have noticed. They probably needed the bed. Anyhow, I had made several drawings of the unmoving figure of my aunt, and some bastard in the station stole my notebook, probably thinking it was a wallet. Much good may it have done them. As soon as they realised what a worthless object they had in their hands, they probably tossed it in the nearest bin without even glancing at the drawings, much less my notes. And I doubt they spent any time correcting whatever infelicities of my pen they found among my scribbled pages. Perhaps they looked at the drawings and thought the perspective was a bit off. Mine certainly was, that day.</p>",
  "<p>More than any domestic appliance, preserving is the home cook\u2019s secret weapon. If you have a vegetable garden, fruit trees or an allotment, it is the age-old way of making the summer glut and autumn harvest last through the winter dearth when there is nothing to grow or pick. Even with year-round fresh produce in the shops, a gleaming row of gem-hued jars filled to the brim with crunch and spice can brighten up the most lacklustre meal.</p> <p>The idea of making your own kimchi or bottling a batch of chutney might scare you off. But all you need is a few key ingredients and some patience. Here are a few ideas to get you started.</p> <h2><strong>What to preserve</strong></h2> <p>Knowing what is in season wherever you are in the world is key. In the UK now, you will find the last of last year\u2019s apples and pears, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/18/cooking-for-kids-quick-pickle\">cauliflower and cabbage</a> are going strong and a soft-fruit glut is just around the corner. Come springtime in the US, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://sweets.seriouseats.com/preserved\">Serious Eat</a><a href=\"https://sweets.seriouseats.com/preserved\">s\u2019 Preserved column</a> suggests <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/04/rhubarb-strawberry-jam-recipe.html\">rhubarb-strawberry jam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/08/tomato-jam-recipe.html\">tomato jam</a>, among others.</p> <p>It sounds obvious, but be sure to go for something you like the taste of, and in quantities you can reasonably get through. I say this from experience: there is no point in filling a two-litre Kilner jar with pickled, skin-on kiwis if you are the only one who is going to eat them. Use small jars. Use flavours you enjoy. The point is not to waste anything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f97c3fc2a13540b202f4694344d74d0a919724b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f97c3fc2a13540b202f4694344d74d0a919724b5/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sterilising Kilner jars in the oven\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotless ... sterilising Kilner jars in the oven.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CW Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How to stay safe</strong></h2> <p>As Toni Kostian of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/restaurantgron/?hl=en\">Gr\u00f6n restaurant</a> in Helsinki puts it: \u201cPreserving is about having only the right kind of bacteria in your produce and getting rid of any harmful ones.\u201d Pickles, jams and ferments can be safely done at home with basic cooking equipment.</p> <p>Be sure to clean hands, surfaces, utensils and produce thoroughly. Wash all jars, bottles and lids in warm soapy water, and rinse thoroughly. They need to be hot, dry and sterile when you fill them. So, for preserves you intend to use up quickly, place your jars (without any rubber seals) in a 140C (120C fan)/285F/gas mark 1 oven for 20 minutes, timing it so that they are ready when your product is. And top whatever you are storing with a circle of wax paper before sealing.</p> <p>For anything you intend to keep a long time in a store cupboard, use proper canning jars (which close with lids and rings) and, ideally, the <a href=\"https://foodinjars.com/blog/new-to-canning-start-here-boiling-water-bath-canning/\">boiling water-bath processing</a> technique. This is more than any novice needs to attempt on their first go \u2013 but if you want to learn how, check out Marisa McClellan\u2019s tutorials on <a href=\"https://foodinjars.com/\">foodinjars.com</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c52ecf54b79268ac96c2a0a35e1efda489fc384\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c52ecf54b79268ac96c2a0a35e1efda489fc384/0_209_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ingredients for dill pickle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the briny ... ingredients for dill pickle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Fisher/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pickles</strong></h2> <p>Quick \u2013 or refrigerator \u2013 pickles are what the food writer Rachel Roddy calls entry-level pleasers. She uses a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/03/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-pickled-garden-vegetables\">simple pickling brine</a>: 550ml white wine vinegar, 200ml water and a heaped tablespoon each of fine salt and sugar (plus the aromatic of your choosing: chilli, garlic, bay, dill \u2026) for 1kg of chopped-up garden fare (carrot, turnip, red cabbage, beetroot, fennel, red onion). Bring the brine to a boil, add the veg for one minute, then divide among the jars (into which you have spooned one tablespoon of olive oil), cover with the liquid and spices and seal. The pickles can be eaten within 24 hours, and will last for two months in the fridge.</p> <p>Rice wine vinegar makes gentler quickies, although the lower acidity means they have a shorter lifespan. You can go very sweet (<a href=\"https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/heritage-carrot-and-ginger-pickle\">Kylee Newton\u2019s Japanese brine</a> adds 380g of sugar to 450ml rice wine vinegar and 450ml water, with only \u00bc teaspoon of sea salt and a few peppercorns) or not sweet at all (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/15/lemongrass-recipes-pudding-paste-banana-bread-recipe-swap\">Anna Thomson</a> infuses her brine \u2013 350ml rice or white wine vinegar, 800ml water, 4\u00bd teaspoon salt \u2013 with lemongrass, garlic, fresh ginger and red chillies.)</p> <p>Another great thing to have in the fridge is mixed spiced pickles \u2013 half salad, half condiment \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.huangkitchen.com/penang-acar-penang-spicy-pickled-vegetables/\">Malaysian penang acar</a>. The veg here requires a bit more preparation. Huangkitchen.com\u2019s Angie Liew says to mix 200g each of chopped-up cabbage, carrots, green beans and pineapple with 500g cucumber (skinned, soft centre removed, and sliced) with 1 tbsp salt, and leave it for 30 minutes. Squeeze out the liquid then blanch in boiling water and vinegar, before draining and leaving to dry out for an hour. Meanwhile, grind together a mix of 10 fresh and 5 dried chillies (soaked in water until soft), 10 shallots, 5 garlic cloves, 2cm each of turmeric and galangal root (I would substitute these last two with a 4cm piece of ginger if I couldn\u2019t find any), 20g each of coriander seeds and shrimp paste, and a few candlenuts (or use macadamia nuts or cashews instead). Fry this spice paste in oil until fragrant, then stir in 200ml vinegar, 180g sugar and 1 tsp salt, followed by 100g ground peanuts, the vegetables and lastly 100g toasted sesame seeds, mixing well after each addition. Store for at least 24 hours before serving, and up to 2 weeks in the fridge.</p> <p>There are the more pungent varieties that take time to mature. Some version of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/07/12/156619002/three-secrets-to-crispy-pickles-and-a-lost-recipe-found\">cucumber</a> pickle is found in most countries, but everything from <a href=\"https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/pickled-green-beans-recipe\">green beans</a> to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-9IiQipAmQ/\">new peas</a> work too. For Iranian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/oct/22/guide-pickles-kimchi-achar-torshi-recipe\">torshi</a> bademjan, aubergine is first parboiled in equal parts vinegar and water, then squeezed, sliced down the middle and stuffed with garlic cloves, dried mint and a little salt. Pack tightly into a jar small enough that the pickling liquid (125ml fresh cider vinegar to 1 tbsp boiled and cooled water) covers the veg. Seal and store them in a cool dark place for at least a month and keep in the fridge once opened.</p> <p>Fruit, too, loves to be pickled. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall bottles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/26/recipes.foodanddrink\">cherries</a> \u2013 stones, stalks and all \u2013 in a hot syrup (200ml water, 300ml white-wine or cider vinegar, 250g caster sugar, 6 black peppercorns, 3 bay leaves, 2 juniper berries, and 2 cloves) and leaves for a month before using. Nigel Slater uses a similar syrup for stone fruit, but cautions that since no amount of vinegar will soften hard fruit, it\u2019s best that peaches be first stoned and parboiled, then skinned; with apricots, he leaves the skin on. Conversely, these pickles are ready within three days. Which is to say: follow recipes carefully. Don\u2019t skip any steps and stick to all specified timings. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57f7734b0dd40574bd217d14c4f7b060aabdc155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f7734b0dd40574bd217d14c4f7b060aabdc155/0_173_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fermented cauliflower and vegetables\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alive and kicking ... fermenting cauliflower and vegetables.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maryna Mashkina/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ferments</strong></h2> <p>For Kostian, lactic fermentation not only comes with reputed (though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/09/is-kombucha-good-for-you\">unproved</a>) health benefits but flavour-wise is the most interesting place to start. He recommends gooseberries, though any other fruit will do. For quick ferments, your jars don\u2019t need to be sterilised, but they do need to be squeaky clean. And you need to use good filtered water (no chlorine) and good sea salt (no caking agents).</p> <p>Mix 1kg of fresh berries with 30g of salt in a large lidded glass jar, and lay clingfilm over the top of the produce, pressing it down with a small weight. Then put the lid on, loosely. Leave at room temperature (18-22C) for 15 to 30 days. Taste after 15 days, and decide if you want to take the funky flavour further.</p> <p>Yeast or moulds can grow on the surface if whatever you\u2019re fermenting comes into contact with the air, or if your kitchen is too hot. Trust your senses. If anything smells off-putting, start again. If not, remove the top layer and carry on. The food writer Regula Ysewijn recently found two jars of sourdough starter \u2013 essentially, fermented dough \u2013 in a box in her cellar, where they\u2019d sat, forgotten, since she moved house two years ago. One smelled rank, and she binned it. The other smelled sweet, like traditional dark rye bread, so she fed it till it bubbled and is now baking with it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Variations on sauerkraut use celeriac, apple and carrot, as well as cabbage \u2013 and are ready within seven to 15 days</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For something quicker, try the two-day <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-wuoRZhIlZ/\">carrot and cabbage ferment</a> from Danish artist Olafur Eliasson\u2019s studio kitchen in Berlin: mix 2 grated carrots and a small shredded cabbage with 1 tbsp salt and place in a large glass jar with a lid. Leave in the fridge for a couple of days, or longer, for a stronger flavour.</p> <p>Of course, the more time you have to make your preserves the better. For a proper sauerkraut, massage 1 tbsp salt into 1kg shredded cabbage until it releases its juices then pack tightly into a jar, pressing down until the liquid rises above the surface (add a little filtered water if needed). Seal and leave at room temperature for at least four days, until bubbles appear. The chef Tom Hunt says that at this point, you can continue fermenting at room temperature for months or even years. Putting it in the fridge will slow down the process, and temper the flavour. Online you\u2019ll find recipes for kraut variations using celeriac, apple, and grated root veg.</p> <p>Kimchi is another wildly adaptable cabbage-based ferment. Koreanbapsang.com\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.koreanbapsang.com/baechu-kimchi-napa-cabbage-kimchi/\">Hyosun Ro</a> has over 20 different recipes, from easy to vegan to trad. Food52, meanwhile, has an excellent how-to for making any kind of kimchi without a recipe. It is a world unto its own, so do read up. </p> <p>Olia Hercules makes fizzy tomatoes by placing 500g medium-sized fruit in a large sterilised preserving jar and covering with a cooled brine (1 litre water, 7 tsp salt, 5 tsp sugar), along with some allspice berries, black peppercorns, 2 heads of dill, 1 bay leaf and 4 chopped up celery sticks. She leaves the sealed jar in a warm place in her kitchen (25C) for one week, then transfers it to the refrigerator or a cellar, where it can be kept unopened for months.</p> <p>Lastly, for something quite thrillingly slow, make Clare Lattin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/07/pickle-ferment-recipes-six-of-the-best\">lime pickle</a>. Mix the wedges of 2-3 limes (250g) with 1 tbsp salt and 1 tsp sugar. Pack into a sterilised lidded jar and leave to ferment for four weeks (put a note in your diary). When ready, heat 4 tbsp mustard oil in a pan, and fry the spices (1 tbsp turmeric, 3 tsp cayenne, 3 tsp mustard seeds and 1 tsp fenugreek seeds) until the seeds start to pop. Add the limes with all their juice, along with 1 tbsp cider vinegar, and cook for five minutes. Leave to cool, then pack back into the jar and store for another week, so the flavours can combine. No citrus has ever been this rewarding.</p> <h2><strong>Chutneys</strong></h2> <p>Newton likes how you can use anything a bit overripe in a chutney (just remove brown or bruised bits). Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/17/apple-chutney-recipe-rhubarb-and-ginger-shrub-homemade-preserves-jarring-kylee-newton-cook-residency\">apple and ale </a>medley is a good place to start. Put 900g diced onions, 600ml cider vinegar and 400g granulated sugar in a large, wide-rimmed pot and bring to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes, until reduced by one third. Mix in 1.5kg apples (peeled, cored and diced) and the zest of 2 lemons. Fill a little muslin bag with 1 cinnamon stick, 1 star anise, 1 tsp chilli flakes, 1 tsp peppercorns and 1 bay leaf, tie with a string, and add to the pot. Bring to the boil and simmer, stirring occasionally (cover the surface with a pierced round of parchment paper) for 20 minutes. When thickened, stir through 2 tsp salt and 300ml ale and simmer for five more minutes. Fill warmed sterilised jars to 5mm from the rim, seal, label, date and store in the cupboard for up to 12 months. Once open, keep in the fridge for up to three months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09dba53f36dae9fbbea60d2ae8081e7bccb43d62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09dba53f36dae9fbbea60d2ae8081e7bccb43d62/0_0_3034_2010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade raspberry jam with chia seeds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getting stuck in .. homemade raspberry jam with chia seeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NelliSyr/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jams</strong></h2> <p>Sweet preserves range from creamy curds (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/07/nigel-slater-lemon-curd-recipes\">lemon</a>, but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/03/summer-fruit-tart-recipes-blackberry-raspberry-tahini-labneh-fig-peaches-cream\">blackberry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/27/steamed-milk-cakes-raspberry-rose-curd-recipe-ruby-tandoh\">raspberry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/21/preserve-recipes-fearnley-whittingstall\">gooseberry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/20/nigel-slater-recipes-winter-citrus-recipes-grapefruit-cotechino-orange-curd\">orange</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thespruceeats.com/blueberry-lemon-curd-recipe-4056665\">blueberry</a>) to jellies and whole fruit recipes. You name the fruit, sugar will do wonders with it. The Irish chef and founder of Ballymaloe Cookery School <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/10/how-to-make-jam\">Darina Allen</a> points to raspberry jam as a good starting point. To win over panicked students, she sometimes makes some scones, then gets to work on the jam. \u201cBy the time the scones are out of the oven,\u201d she writes, \u201cthe jam is made. It\u2019s that easy!\u201d</p> <p>Mash 900g fresh or frozen berries in a wide, stainless-steel saucepan and cook for three to four minutes over a medium heat until the juice begins to run. Add 900g warmed sugar and stir over a gentle heat until dissolved. Bring to the boil and cook for about five to six minutes, stirring frequently. Test for set by putting about a teaspoonful on a cold plate and leaving it for a few minutes in the fridge. If it wrinkles when you press it, it is set. Remove from the heat immediately. Skim, pour into sterilised jam jars and cover immediately.</p> <p>Infusions and aromatics will embellish the basic idea, from Nigel Slater\u2019s plum with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/nigel-slater-jam-and-pickle-recipes\">almonds and rosewater</a> to Lillie O\u2019Brien\u2019s fig and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/01/four-easy-autumn-jam-recipes\">earl grey tea</a>.

Simply stew some fruit, then mix in a sweetener, some lemon juice and the chia seeds, and leave for five to 10 minutes to thicken.</p> <h2><strong>Finally \u2026</strong></h2> <p>As the Guardian writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/30/fruit-and-veg-preserving-pickling\">Phil Daoust </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/30/fruit-and-veg-preserving-pickling\">put it</a>, if all of this sounds like hard work, make yourself a drink. \u201cA few handfuls of raspberries or blackberries will transform the cheapest vodka,\u201d but the same goes for oranges and rum or sloes and gin. Place 500g fruit in a large jar, and cover with 250g sugar and a litre of alcohol. Seal, shake (continue shaking every day until the sugar is dissolved) and place in a dark cupboard for three months. Strain out the fruit, then bottle and store for at least a year. The longer the better.</p>",

  "<p>Like a lot of people, I\u2019ve spent more time talking on the phone over the past couple of months than I have in years. There\u2019s something about disaster that makes us want to hear voices and see faces, when, under normal circumstances, we\u2019re rather just text.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the conversations I\u2019m having are mostly dire.</p> <p>One of my recent calls was to a friend who lives in a small town in the Rockies. She\u2019s got two kids, and so, in addition to working full time from a hastily constructed living room office, she\u2019s now running a daycare where the clients don\u2019t pay. She got her young son a walkie-talkie, and, on the morning we spoke, she\u2019d overheard him talking with a friend who lives down the street. They were making plans to meet in the neighborhood park after everyone else had gone to sleep. Not even six weeks into quarantine and her five-year-old was already planning his escape.</p> <p>Wrangling children, however, is now the least of her problems. The kids can be locked in at night; what she has no control over now is her finances. Her husband owns a small business: a retail store that sells running shoes, hiking boots, trekking poles and the kind of clothing (bright, water-wicking) that people who live in mountain towns think constitutes everyday fashion. They aren\u2019t wealthy, but they\u2019ve got five employees and, despite Amazon and Zappos, the store has managed to stay open for 15 years. In that time, it\u2019s become more than just a place to buy shoes; they\u2019ve made it into one of those \u201cthird spaces\u201d urban planners talk about \u2013 where people meet up and form community of their own. They organize events and races and group runs where people of all abilities run together and then go out for drinks. In fact, that\u2019s how my friend and her husband met: She was new to town (and running) and he stayed at the back of the pack just to talk.</p> <p>When the pandemic hit, their business, along with so many others, was deemed non-essential by the state government. My friend doesn\u2019t fault state leaders for that \u2013 there was an outbreak a few towns over, and it\u2019s hard to argue that running shorts are \u201cessential\u201d during a pandemic. But despite immediately pivoting to online sales, she does wonder how much longer they\u2019ll be able to stay open. Just before we spoke, they\u2019d had their first zero-dollar day ever.</p> <p>There has been some relief for business owners. My friend and her husband qualified for a payment protection program loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA), which is designed to keep people employed (and off unemployment insurance) during the crisis. The deal is, if you keep your employees on the payroll, you don\u2019t have to pay it back.</p> <p>Getting the loan was not a simple process: the SBA distributed the money to banks, which were then supposed to get it to small businesses. My friends banked at Wells Fargo, and the bank was so late making the application available that by the time it was open, the available PPP money had nearly dried up. Their Wells Fargo banker actually told my friend that they should seek out a different institution before it was too late, which they were, luckily, able to do through a local banker who shops at their store. In the end, they received $34,000 from the PPP, but considering that the store is closed and online sales are slow, the loan doesn\u2019t help the business itself very much. It will help pay a portion of the store\u2019s rent for the next eight weeks, but the major expense isn\u2019t rent or even payroll: it\u2019s their vendors.</p> <p>\u201cWe owe vendors $150,000, which is not a big deal if you can sell your inventory for $300,000,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut if the doors are closed, that plan falls apart, and PPP doesn\u2019t cover any of those expenses.\u201d</p> <p>There are, in theory, other options. They applied for an economic injury disaster loan five weeks ago, but the only response they\u2019ve received is an email telling them to expect another email. Their town is giving out small business loans, but, again, it\u2019s not enough to pay off their vendors and keep the business afloat. Before the pandemic, it seemed like this would probably be the best year for their businesses. Instead, they may go bankrupt.</p> <p>This story is being repeated across the US. Yet while small businesses like my friend\u2019s face bankruptcy, some massive corporations are getting relief. Most PPP loans amounted to less than $250,000, but, according to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/21/839716980/some-not-so-small-companies-are-getting-small-business-loans-under\">report by NPR</a>, the restaurant chains J Alexander\u2019s Holdings (market value: $74m), Potbelly ($85m), and Fiesta Restaurant Group ($189m) received between $10m and $15m of taxpayer-funded relief. Other corporations got just as much. My friend doesn\u2019t want to see these companies go bankrupt or their employees laid off, but she wonders why big businesses are getting so much when small businesses like hers received so little. (Perhaps the answer lies in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/business/sba-loans-ppp-coronavirus.html\">big banks prioritizing their richest clients</a>.)</p> <p>Congress has allocated more funding for the PPP (this time, with fewer loopholes for big business), but that will not be enough to prevent the small-business apocalypse. Rent is still due. Vendors still need to be paid. PPP loans, under current regulations, cannot fix that. So, amid all the panic about the disease itself, there\u2019s well-founded fear about what comes after.</p> <p>I keep wondering what cities and towns across the US will look if the quarantine goes on much longer. Maybe the post-Covid future will look like the present, when you can order nearly anything with two-day delivery but can\u2019t set foot into most shops. In Seattle \u2013 the city where I worked until I, too, was laid off \u2013 normally bustling neighborhoods look almost abandoned. A few eateries are open for takeout, but more are boarded up to keep potential looters out. Some business owners have hired artists to decorate their new plywood fronts with uplifting slogans \u2013 \u201cThis too shall pass,\u201d \u201cAll you need is love \u2026 and toilet paper\u201d \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t do much to alleviate the sense of disaster.</p> <p>Without functional bailouts of small businesses, this pandemic and the resulting economic crash could be the end of cities and towns as we know them. The bars, restaurants, retailers, music venues, art spaces, theatres and coffee shops that make cities feel vibrant will probably go belly-up (though Starbucks will probably be just fine). A few \u201cessential\u201d corporations will prosper but that\u2019s the exception. Even hospitals are now going under. Perhaps Amazon will buy up storefronts and install sterile, cashier-less grocery stores and retailers where no one actually interacts. Post-pandemic, some people might actually prefer it.</p> <p>While most of us humans will survive the virus, without relief, small businesses may very well not. The federal government could, in theory, stop this slide into ruin, but that would require a level of investment and competence not seen in years. In the meantime, as my friend waits for the quarantine to lift, she\u2019s quickly losing hope that they will come out the other side of this crisis intact.</p> <p>\u201cEven when stores are open, why would people come back?\u201d she asked me. \u201cThey\u2019re scared. I heard Jeff Bezos made $24bn since the shutdown started. Maybe he\u2019ll buy us out.\u201d</p>",

facing coronavirus alone</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Now, more than 300 Australians have offered to open their homes to international students struggling during the coronavirus crisis without government support.</p> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Homestay Network</strong> says more than 300 families have signed up in the past two weeks to become hosts of international students following a call-out.</p> \n  <p>Founder <strong>David Bycroft</strong> says Australians have a responsibility to step up and look after the students, who aren\u2019t getting federal government support during the pandemic. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe prime minister has told international students to return home if they can\u2019t afford to support themselves but the reality of the situation is it isn\u2019t that simple,\u201d Bycroft said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor many students, going home is not an option.\u201d </p> \n  <p>There are more than 500,000 international students in Australia and many of them have lost their jobs during the pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Some want to go home but can\u2019t due to the lack of flights, funds or border restrictions, while others have built lives and families in Australia.</p> \n  <p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, international education contributed $37.6bn to the economy in the 2018/19 financial year and employs 240,000 people. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen you hear someone saying Australians need to be looked after first, they don\u2019t understand that international students actually support Australian livelihoods,\u201d Bycroft said.</p> \n  <p>For a weekly fee of $160, students are provided with accommodation and three meals a day as part of the initiative. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe can connect vulnerable international students with Australian families who are willing and able to fulfil those needs, and help them get through these tough times,\u201d he said. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

They have a relationship with the landlord, so I imagine that is a discussion they will have with the landlord to determine how much has the landlord been able to recoup and can that be offset against any loss of rent claim that\u2019s been made.</p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> Are you encouraging your members to pursue tenants? </p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> No, we\u2019re not encouraging them to do so, but it is up to individual insurers to make their own arrangements with their relationship with the landlord. But it\u2019s really again around community expectations as well. But <strong>they are contracts at the end of the day that have been entered into, and the insurers are abiding by those contracts and so too the tenants should be as well. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh: </strong>It hardly seems in the spirit of things though. There\u2019s a range of rent moratoriums that are being put in place as a result of Covid-19. Landlords are suffering some of that pain, and are then turning to their insurer, and you\u2019re telling me you think it would be alright if the insurer then went back and sued the tenant?</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan</strong>: No, what I\u2019m saying is they need to take into account the community expectations and the degree to which they\u2019re able to absorb that is really their own individual decisions. That\u2019s something that the company must take onboard themselves and decide themselves. It is down to the individual companies to make those decisions. We encourage and provide information to them, but at the end of the day it\u2019s an individual company decision to make. </p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> I think we can be pretty sure about what the community sentiment would be on this. I\u2019m just surprised that the Insurance Council doesn\u2019t have an approach to it, that you\u2019re essentially taking this hands off, \u2018it\u2019s up to our members\u2019 approach to what could turn out to be quite a serious problem.</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan: </strong>Well, I wouldn\u2019t quite characterise it like that. We do monitor the situation and feed back what we believe are the issues that insurers should be taking into account when they are making these sorts of decisions. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re absent in this discussion. We are participants in it obviously, because we want to make sure that the industry\u2019s reputation is held high. So that\u2019s an expectation on our behalf. And there\u2019s also a code of practise, which they\u2019re expected to abide by, which goes to issues around financial hardship and people in vulnerable positions. And that has some quite strong requirements on those particular companies to be able to abide by that code of practise.

  "<p>Carl Bergstrom is uniquely suited to understanding the current moment. A professor of biology at the University of Washington, he has spent his career studying two seemingly disparate topics: emerging infectious diseases and networked misinformation. They merged into one the moment reports of a mysterious respiratory illness emerged from China in January.</p> <p>The coronavirus touched off both a pandemic and an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/tech-giants-struggle-stem-infodemic-false-coronavirus-claims\">infodemic</a>\u201d of hoaxes, conspiracy theories, honest misunderstandings and politicized scientific debates. Bergstrom has jumped into the fray, helping the public and the press navigate the world of epidemiological models, statistical uncertainty and the topic of his forthcoming book: bullshit.</p> <p>The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <p> <strong>You\u2019ve been teaching a course and have <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/\">co-written a book</a> about the concept of bullshit. Explain what you mean by bullshit?</strong></p> <p>The formal definition that we use is \u201clanguage, statistical figures, data, graphics and other forms of presentation that are intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener with a blatant disregard for truth or logical coherence\u201d.</p> <p>The idea with bullshit is that it\u2019s trying to appear authoritative and definitive in a way that\u2019s not about communicating accurately and informing a reader, but rather by overwhelming them, persuading them, impressing them. If that\u2019s done without any allegiance to truth, or accuracy, that becomes bullshit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea with bullshit is that it\u2019s trying to appear authoritative and definitive in a way that\u2019s not about communicating accurately and informing a reader</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re all used to verbal bullshit. We\u2019re all used to campaign promises and weasel words, and we\u2019re pretty good at seeing through that because we\u2019ve had a lot of practice. But as the world has become increasingly quantified and the currency of arguments has become statistics, facts and figures and models and such, we\u2019re increasingly confronted, even in the popular press, with numerical and statistical arguments<em>. </em>And this area\u2019s really ripe for bullshit, because people don\u2019t feel qualified to question information that\u2019s given to them in quantitative form.</p> <p><strong>Are there bullshit narratives about the coronavirus that you are concerned about right now?</strong></p> <p>What\u2019s happened with this pandemic that we\u2019re not accustomed to in the epidemiology community is that it\u2019s been really heavily politicized. Even when scientists are very well-intentioned and not trying to support any side of the narrative, when they do work and release a paper it gets picked up by actors with political agendas.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s talking about seroprevalence or estimating the chance that this is even going to come to the United States at all each study gets picked up and placed into this little political box and sort of used as a cudgel to beat the other side with.</p> <p>So even when the material isn\u2019t being produced as bullshit, it\u2019s being picked up and used in the service of that by overstating its claims, by cherry-picking the information that\u2019s out there and so on. And I think that\u2019s kind of the biggest problem that we\u2019re facing.</p> <p>One example [of intentional bullshit] might be this insistence for a while on graphing the number of cases on a per-capita basis, so that people could say the US response is so much better than the rest of the world because we have a slower rate of growth per capita. That was basically graphical malfeasance or bullshit. When a wildfire starts spreading, you\u2019re interested in how it\u2019s spreading now, not whether it\u2019s spreading in a 100-acre wood or millions of square miles of national forest.</p> <p><strong>Is there one big lesson that you think that the media should keep in mind as we communicate science to the public? What mistakes are we making?</strong></p> <p>I think the media has been adjusting really fast and doing really well. When I\u2019m talking about how to avoid misinformation around this I\u2019m constantly telling people to trust the professional fact-based media. Rather than looking for the latest rumor that\u2019s spreading across Facebook or Twitter so that you can have information up to the hour, recognize that it\u2019s much better to have solidly sourced, well-vetted information from yesterday.</p> <p>Hyper-partisan media are making a huge mess of this, but that\u2019s on purpose. They\u2019ve got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">a reason to promote hydroxychloroquine</a> or whatever it is and just run with that. They\u2019re not even trying to be responsible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Hyper-partisan media are making a huge mess of this, but that\u2019s on purpose</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But one of the biggest things that people [in the media]<strong> </strong>could do to improve would be to recognize that scientific studies, especially in a fast-moving situation like this, are provisional. That\u2019s the nature of science. Anything can be corrected. There\u2019s no absolute truth there. Each model, each finding is just adding to a weight of evidence in one direction or another.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the reporting is focusing on models, and most of us probably don\u2019t have any basic training in how </strong><strong>to read </strong><strong>them or what kind of credence </strong><strong>to put in them. What should we know?</strong></p> <p>The key thing, and this goes for scientists as well as non-scientists, is that people are not doing a very good job thinking about what the purpose of different models are, how the purposes of different models vary, and then what the scope of their value is. When these models get treated as if they\u2019re oracles, then people both over-rely on them and treat them too seriously \u2013 and then turn around and slam them too hard for not being perfect at everything.</p> <p><strong>Are there mistakes that are made by people in the scientific community</strong><strong> when it comes to communicating with the public?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019re trying to communicate as a scientific community in a new way, where people are posting their data in real time. But we weren\u2019t ready for the degree to which that stuff would be picked up and assigned meaning in this highly politically polarized environment. Work that might be fairly easy for researchers to contextualize in the field can be portrayed as something very, very different in the popular press.</p> <p>The first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">Imperial College model</a> in March was predicting 1.1 million to 2.2 million American deaths if the pandemic were not controlled. That\u2019s a really scary, dramatic story, and I still think that it\u2019s not unrealistic. That got promoted by one side of the partisan divide. Then Imperial came back and modeled a completely different scenario, where the disease was actually brought under control and suppressed in the US, and they released a subsequent model that said, \u2018If we do this, something like 50,000 deaths will occur.\u2019 That was picked up by the other side and used to try to discredit the Imperial College team entirely by saying, \u2018A couple of weeks ago they said a million now they\u2019re saying 50,000<em>;</em> they can\u2019t get anything right.\u2019 And the answer , of course, is that they were modeling two different scenarios.</p> <p>We\u2019re also not doing enough of deliberately stressing the possible weaknesses of our interpretations. That varies enormously from researcher to researcher and team to team.</p> <p><strong>It requires a lot of discipline to argue really hard for something but also be scrupulously open about all of the weaknesses in your own argument.</strong></p> <p>But it\u2019s more important than ever, right? A really good paper will lay out all the most persuasive evidence it can and then in the conclusion section or the discussion section say, \u2018OK, here are all the reasons that this could be wrong and here are the weaknesses.\u2019</p> <p>When you have something that\u2019s so directly policy relevant, and there\u2019s a lot of lives at stake, we\u2019re learning how to find the right balance.</p> <p><strong>It is a bit of a nightmare to put out data that is truthful, but also be aware that there are bad faith actors at the moment who might pounce on it and use it in a way you didn\u2019t intend.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a spectrum. You have outright bad faith actors \u2013 Russian propaganda picking up on things and bots spreading misinformation \u2013 and then you have someone like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp who I wouldn\u2019t call<em> </em>a bad faith actor. He\u2019s a misinformed actor. </p> <p>There\u2019s so much that goes unsaid in science in terms of context and what findings mean that we don\u2019t usually write in papers. If someone does a mathematical forecasting model, you\u2019re usually not going to have a half-page discussion on the limitations of forecasting. We\u2019re used to writing for an audience of 50 people in the world, if we\u2019re lucky, who have backgrounds that are very similar to our own and have a huge set of shared assumptions and shared knowledge. And it works really well when you\u2019re writing on something that only 50 people in the world care about and all of them have comparable training, but it is a real mess when it becomes pressing, and I don\u2019t think any of us have figured out exactly what to do about that because we\u2019re also trying to work quickly and it\u2019s important to get this information out.</p> <p><strong>One area that has already become contentious and in some ways politicized is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-antibody-studies-california-stanford\">serology surveys</a>, which are supposed to show what percentage of the population has antibodies to the virus. What are some of the big picture contextual caveats and limitations that we should keep in mind as these surveys come out?</strong></p> <p>The seroprevalence in the US is a political issue, and so the first thing is to recognize that when anyone is reporting on that stuff, there\u2019s a political context to it. It may even be that some of the research is being done with an implicitly political context, depending on who the funders are or what the orientations and biases of some of the researchers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It may even be that some of the research is being done with an implicitly political context, depending on who the funders are or what the orientations and biases of some of the researchers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the scientific side, I think there\u2019s really two things to think about. The first one is the issue of selection bias. You\u2019re trying to draw a conclusion about one population by sampling from a subset of that population and you want to know how close to random your subset is with respect to the thing you\u2019re trying to measure. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">Santa Clara study</a> recruited volunteers off of Facebook. The obvious source of sampling bias there is that people desperately want to get tested. The people that want it are, of course, people that think they\u2019ve had it. </p> <p>The other big piece is understanding the notion of positive predictive value and the way false positive and false negative error rates influence the estimate. And that depends on the incidence of infection in the population.</p> <p>If you have a test that has a 3% error rate, and the incidence in the population is below 3%, then most of the positives that you get are going to be false positives. And so you\u2019re not going to get a very tight estimate about how many people have it. This has been a real problem with the Santa Clara study. From my read of the paper, their data is actually consistent with nobody being infected. A New York City<em> </em>study on the other hand showed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html\">21% seropositive</a>, so even if there has a 3% error rate, the majority of those positives have to be true positives.</p> <p><strong>Now that we\u2019ve all had a crash course in models and serosurveys, what are the other areas of science where it makes sense for the public to start getting educated on the terms of the debate?</strong></p> <p>One that I think will come along sooner or later is interpreting studies of treatments. We\u2019ve dealt with that a little bit with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">hydroxychloroquine business</a> but not in any serious way because the hydroxychloroquine work has been pretty weak and the results have not been so positive.</p> <p>But there are ongoing tests of a large range of existing drugs. And these studies are actually pretty hard to do. There\u2019s a lot of subtle technical issues: what are you doing for controls? Is there a control arm at all? If not, how do you interpret the data? If there is a control arm, how is it structured? How do you control for the characteristics of the population on whom you\u2019re using the drug or their selection biases in terms of who\u2019s getting the drug?</p> <p>Unfortunately, given what we\u2019ve already seen with hydroxychloroquine, it\u2019s fairly likely that this will be politicized as well. There\u2019ll be a parallel set of issues that are going to come around with vaccination, but that\u2019s more like a year off.</p> <p><strong>If you had the ability to arm every person with one tool \u2013 a statistical tool or scientific concept \u2013 to help them understand and contextualize scientific information as we look to the future of this pandemic, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>I would like people to understand that there are interactions between the models we make, the science we do and the way that we behave. The models that we make influence the decisions that we take individually and as a society, which then feed back into the models and the models often don\u2019t treat that part explicitly.</p> <p>Once you put a model out there that then creates changes in behavior that pull you out of the domain that the model was trying to model in the first place. We have to be very attuned to that as we try to use the models for guiding policy.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s very interesting, and not what I expected you to say.</strong></p> <p>What did you expect?</p> <p><strong>That correlation </strong><strong>does not imply causation.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s another very good one. Seasonality is a great example there. We\u2019re trying a whole bunch of things at the same time. We\u2019re throwing all kinds of possible solutions at this and lots of things are changing. It\u2019s remarkable to me actually, that so many US states are seeing the epidemic curve decrease. And so there\u2019s a bunch of possibilities there. It could be because people\u2019s behavior is changing. There could be some seasonality there. And there are other possible explanations as well.</p> <p>But what is really important is that just because the trend that you see is consistent with a story that someone\u2019s selling, there may be many other stories that are also consistent, so inferring causality is dangerous.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/\">Calling Bullshit: The Art of Scepticism in a Data-Driven World</a> by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West will be published 4 August 2020 by Penguin.</em></p></li> </ul>",

They\u2019ve found that intervention in the hours and days following a shooting can jumpstart the months, and sometimes years, of mental and physical rehabilitation that lie ahead for victims, and help prevent retaliatory violence in their communities.</p> <p>The Bay Area has been at the forefront of this battle. The violence prevention not-for-profit Youth Alive! brought a hospital-based violence intervention program to Highland hospital in the 1990s. Several other programs have emerged in the region since then, and they have been credited with contributing to the decrease in gun violence in the Bay Area over the past 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are in the hospital and in crisis they need guidance through that moment,\u201d says Kyndra Simmons, the Youth Alive! intervention director. \u201cSome people just want to feel safe again.

The pair had been out clubbing after Posey broke up with his girlfriend earlier in the day, and they were recapping the night when several men walked up and tried to jack the car.</p> <p>As Posey and his friend sped<strong> </strong>off, the would-be robbers opened fire from behind. Bullets pierced the back window.<strong> </strong>Posey ducked to avoid the gunfire, but a bullet hit him in the back.</p> <p>He remained conscious but immediately started losing feeling in his legs. \u201cI\u2019m about to die in the passenger seat of my friend\u2019s car,\u201d he thought.</p> <p>Posey\u2019s friend rushed him to Highland hospital,<strong> </strong>where he stayed in the intensive care unit for two weeks. Doctors told Posey, a 26-year-old athlete and a former clown for his sister\u2019s drill team, that he had a complete T7 spinal cord injury and would probably be permanently paralyzed from the chest down.</p> <p>Once the surgery drugs and pain medicine wore off, Posey started having nightmares that lasted into his stay at the Fairmont rehabilitation and wellness center in San Leandro, right outside of Oakland.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was tough.

The constant pain, the magnitude of losing my ability to walk and having to relearn stuff,\u201d Posey recalls of his time in rehabilitation. \u201cI had to learn how to close my hand so I could write. I had to learn how to get dressed by myself, use the bathroom, shower by myself and take care of myself.\u201d</p> <p>Posey spent six months in Fairmont\u2019s acute rehabilitation and another three months in the facility\u2019s long-term nursing department. Meanwhile, a local not-for-profit that helps people with disabilities found him a wheelchair-accessible apartment where he could live on his own. Eventually he moved into an apartment in San Leandro, where he\u2019s been for the past three years.<strong> </strong>Although he was denied victim\u2019s compensation funds by the state board, he receives social security, and disability benefits from the state.</p> <p>Before the shooting<strong> </strong>that left him paralyzed, Posey envisioned \u201ca life of grandeur\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy expectation was being able to make a lot of money playing sports or being a performer,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really into the materialistic side of what life offers.\u201d</p> <p>After his injury, his first priority was to simply regain independence. He now drives himself around in a car that has been modified with hand controls in lieu of gas and brake pedals. His social life centers around the kickbacks in friends\u2019 homes and events like Golden State Warriors championship parades. Navigating his first parade as a wheelchair user was \u201cridiculous\u201d, he recalled. At one point he found himself stuck on a walking bridge. \u201cYou trying to get out of the crowd bro?\u201d, a<strong> </strong>group of parade-goers asked<strong>,</strong> before lifting him, wheelchair and all, over a railing and out of the thick crowd.</p> <p>\u201cIt was funny for the most part because these people didn\u2019t know me from a can of paint,\u201d Posey recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see that there are people who are willing to help other people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5bda476bc41b8bdd12e923eb939912c21fb8fdd4%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3138_2092&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fac12657e72e020422547daef46847b09e2a20920%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3240_2160&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Jeremy Posey\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5bda476bc41b8bdd12e923eb939912c21fb8fdd4%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3138_2092&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fac12657e72e020422547daef46847b09e2a20920%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3240_2160&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Jeremy Posey</a> <figcaption>Jeremy Posey was left permanently paralyzed after being shot in his friends car.

Even after you\u2019re physically healed, having people that you can talk to and be around for positive vibes is definitely necessary.\u201d</p> <p>But Posey has found that physical therapies, staying social and random acts of kindness can only do so much. \u201cMental health and emotional trauma therapy are two of the biggest things we don\u2019t talk about for people who become paralyzed and experience gun violence,\u201d Posey says.</p> <p>\u201cWe mostly just deal with the physical and move on from it,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut probably the biggest thing is having more resources where people can address the emotional and mental stress that comes with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Seven years and several facial and dental surgeries after her shooting, Caheri Gutierrez has come to the same realization.

Posey says he\u2019s lost friends to gun violence and attended functions that ended in shootouts.</p> <p>And two years before her own injury, Gutierrez\u2019s brother\u2019s head was grazed by a bullet during a Halloween party.

I couldn\u2019t go into my classroom and pay attention to what was happening. I started cutting class and smoking weed to cope.</p> <p>Eventually, Gutierrez, who played for Golden Bear Volleyball Club, UC Berkeley\u2019s youth team, was expelled from school.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the wrong way to respond to the trauma I was displaying,\u201d Gutierrez says of school administrators\u2019 response to her behavior. \u201cThose were very normal behaviors that people experiencing gun violence and trauma begin to take on.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Rochelle Dicker, a University of San Francisco trauma surgeon, has seen countless gunshot wound victims in her almost two-decades-long career.</p> <p>When someone comes into a trauma center after being shot the \u201cair is a lot thicker with tension and anxiety\u201d than it is during other emergencies, Dicker says. Not only is there a patient with life-threatening injuries, but concerned family members are often kept out of the hospital for hours because of a police presence or lockdown protocol for shooting incidents.</p> <p>Dicker founded the Wraparound Project, UCSF\u2019s version of a hospital-based intervention program (HIVP), to help stop the revolving door of gunshot wound injuries and provide care that goes beyond stopping bleeding and stitching open wounds to survivors.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>We need to provide social care to our patients as much as we provide traditional care,\u201d she argues. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re just patching people up and not changing anything about their risk factors.\u201d</p> <p>The Wraparound Project and Caught in the Crossfire, the Highland hospital project started by Youth Alive! in the 1990s, are now two<a href=\"https://www.thehavi.org/directory-by-name\"> of dozens</a> of HVIPs in the US that, in the moments after a shooting, dispatch social workers to help families and patients, and send local violence interrupters to communities and hospital bedsides to stop retaliation.</p> <p>\u201cThese programs are built on the principles that violence is a public health issue,\u201d Dicker said. \u201cWe provide not only mental wellness care but ultimately link people with resources, practical things like good jobs and better education.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd1c176c4cfbca6bba39dcf9e65b86a8fb0b9940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1c176c4cfbca6bba39dcf9e65b86a8fb0b9940/0_0_3240_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caheri Gutierrez now works for Oakland Promise, the city\u2019s youth development program, and leads youth-focused gun violence prevention workshops.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caheri Gutierrez now works for Oakland Promise, the city\u2019s youth development program, and leads youth-focused gun violence prevention workshops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brandon Tauszik/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is limited publicly available or government-sponsored research on the efficacy of HVIPs, but the studies and reports that are available point to positive results. In 2012, the US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/defendingchildhood/cev-rpt-full.pdf\">recommended</a> that more HVIPs should be developed across the country. According to a <a href=\"https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Healing-Communities-in-Crisis-URL.pdf\">2016 report</a> from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, HVIPs combine effective gun violence reduction practices like focused deterrence and connecting people with employment resources.</p> <p>The report argues the programs are ultimately also cost-savers. Hospital treatment for a non-fatal gunshot wound patient typically amounts to around $24,000. The total costs of a single instance of gun violence can be up to six figures, when incarceration and families\u2019 income loss are included. Dicker\u2019s Wraparound Project is credited with saving UCSF an estimated $500,000 a year.</p> <p>Both Gutierrez and Posey received support from Youth Alive!\u2019s HVIP. As survivors, they\u2019re committed to help reduce gun violence in their communities.</p> <p>\u201cI have identified what I want to do for the rest of my life through my journey of gun violence,\u201d Gutierrez says. \u201cIt\u2019s my passion to prevent it by teaching young people that when you\u2019re mad you don\u2019t pull out a gun, there are ways to calm yourself down.

  "<h2><strong>Realistically, when do you think sports will return?</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://goforward.com/doctors\">Dr Nate Favini</a>, medical lead at Forward healthcare services: \u201c</strong>It all comes down to testing. If you have rapid and highly accurate tests, and you have the ability to do enough of them, so you can test people often and quickly, that\u2019s basically the threshold you need to meet to reopen sports. Imagine if you could test every NBA player every day \u2013 and exclude anyone who tests positive \u2013 and let players play in empty stadiums, you could restart today. But you have to have testing available at that scale. It will probably be eight months until we have that.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/expert/douglas-j-wiebe-phd\">Dr Douglas J Wiebe</a>, professor of epidemiology, The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine: </strong>\u201cThat\u2019s a tough one. Not yet. Having testing available will make us all feel better. If [a player tests positive for Covid-19] we clearly have to isolate them and provide them medical care. The other kind of testing will be testing for antibodies, to identify [whether] an athlete been infected in the past. And if they have the antibody that should be a marker that they are now able to fight off new instances of the virus.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/10005456/geoffrey-dreher\">Dr Geoff M Dreher</a>, Johns Hopkins University, expert in sports medicine:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put a timetable on a return. We want to make sure players and staff are safe and make sure if they do get sick or otherwise injured, that there are pathways for safe care without wasting any resources for the general population. When those measures are met, sports should make their comeback.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://theplantfedgut.com/about/\">Dr Will Bulsiewicz</a>, author of Fiber Fueled: </strong>\u201cIt depends. I could see non-contact sports like golf come back very quickly. It becomes a lot more difficult for contact sports. Basketball is designed for the infection, and NFL is the same, they\u2019re climbing all over each other. I would love to see football this fall, what I worry about is not so much if you can test before gameday but that these players have to practice with each other all week. It will be very hard to test players every single day before practice.

I think we may end up having the Olympics postponed again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/holding-tokyo-olympics-in-2021-will-be-difficult-japanese-health-chief-warns\">Holding Tokyo Olympics in 2021 'difficult', Japan medical association chief warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Wiebe:</strong> \u201cBased on where we are now, I think it\u2019s going to be quite some time before we\u2019re in a position to be confident about interacting together in sporting venues, including the Olympics. We aren\u2019t even out of the woods yet on what may be the first wave of Covid infections in the US. People can plan for the future, but I\u2019m not confident the Olympics can happen [in 2021]. I think it will be very hard to have a large sporting event and have fans be a part of it in person\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Dreher: </strong>\u201c[Holding the Olympics] in July 2021, may be difficult, especially with vaccine developments taking from 12 to 18 months or longer. So to plan for hundreds of thousands of people to converge on a few locations at the Games will be difficult in that timeframe.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bulsiewicz: </strong>\u201cI would call it [the Olympics] 50-50. The Olympics are such an international event: how do you control people flying in from around the world? I can\u2019t imagine them having an Olympics without a crowd. I can see where they can stage the competition without crowds, but then you\u2019re undercutting the entire economic element of the Olympics where they spend billions of dollars building stadiums and expecting people to show up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be2864ab2c3473bd523463ecdf17b4d7b6d1452b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be2864ab2c3473bd523463ecdf17b4d7b6d1452b/0_236_3118_1871/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Basketball is designed for the infection, and NFL is the same\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Basketball is designed for the infection, and NFL is the same\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derick E Hingle/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>When is the appropriate time for fans to be let back into stadiums?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Favini: </strong>\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we can do it this year. It may be well until 2021 before we let fans into stadiums. If we can rapidly scale up testing to the degree where everyone in the country can get tested on a weekly basis, we can start allowing people who have proven negative test results into stadiums in smaller groups. That scale of testing could be possible at the end of this year. But in the absence of that, we\u2019ll probably have to wait until a vaccine, which would be the middle of next year.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Dreher: </strong>\u201cA vaccine will have to be available, developed, and proven effective. Hopefully at that point, people can get back close together into the typical sports experience that we\u2019re used to. There are different timelines when that could happen, but for people to be traveling, coming together, and in that kind of close proximity, a vaccine is key.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bulsiewicz: \u201c</strong>To be honest, we\u2019re pretty far away from that. We need to get to a place where the virus is not a threat to our community or you need a system in place to adequately test fans or demonstrate that they are not carriers of the infection. How can you control for the person who doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re sick, and shows up to, say, a Michigan college football game where there are 100,000 people breathing on each other?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Should sports be used as an engine to jumpstart the economy?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Favini: </strong>\u201cLive sporting events with large audiences shouldn\u2019t lead the way for reopening the economy because getting 40,000 people into a stadium is actually one of the more dangerous things to do. I think it will be one of the last things to happen.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Wiebe:</strong> \u201cSo much of the American identity [is linked] with sports, but we need to be very patient when sports come back. We shouldn\u2019t try to give short change to Covid-19 because it will continue to warrant strict social distancing measures. We really have to nip it in the bud now to the best extent we can.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What can fans learn from this pandemic once it is over?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dreher: </strong>\u201cA lot of things will be different especially in the acute period afterwards. Hopefully people will realize the importance of washing your hands. Realizing how fluid our society is from a contact and transportation side, and how linked in sports are with the travel, contact, and outreach.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Wiebe:</strong> \u201cWe may not be able to enjoy the atmosphere of a stadium the way that we used to. We need to have delayed gratification. The good news is that right now people are hungry for some sense of normalcy, so some type of engagement [is] a reason for optimism, which is what sports brings us. Even having fans enjoy sports from their homes could go a long way to making people remaining patient and willing to do social distancing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In cricket as in life, everything is up in the air. For the fans, there\u2019s an unfamiliar emotion: feeling sorry for the administrators as they struggle to squeeze the season into three months from 1 July. One intriguing possibility has been mentioned in passing. Might the England men\u2019s team play two series at the same time?</p> <p>It helps that the fixture list was already looking like a tasting menu \u2013 three Tests against West Indies, three Twenty20s and three one-day internationals against Australia, three Tests and three T20s against Pakistan, and three ODIs against Ireland. There could still be time to fit most of them in but it would plainly be easier if formats were allowed to overlap. Eoin Morgan, the conductor of the white-ball orchestra, says he is open to anything. So let\u2019s see how it might work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/ecb-sticking-with-the-hundred-risks-twisting-cricket-further-into-chaos\">ECB sticking with the Hundred risks twisting cricket further into chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a sport that wears its history on its sleeve, people will wonder if there is a precedent. The Spin consulted the oracle \u2013 Steven Lynch, the international editor of Wisden, whose Ask Steven column on Cricinfo has been sorting factual disputes since 1997.</p> <p>The answer was yes. \u201cEngland had two Test tours going at once in 1929-30,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cTo West Indies and New Zealand. Two England Tests started on 21 February, 1930 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17592/scorecard/62575/new-zealand-vs-england-4th-test-england-tour-of-new-zealand-1929-30\" title=\"\">Auckland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17590/scorecard/62578/west-indies-vs-england-3rd-test-england-tour-of-west-indies-1929-30\" title=\"\">Georgetown</a>.\u201d The one in Georgetown was historic: West Indies\u2019 first Test win, featuring twin hundreds from the great George Headley. Not for the last time England may have underestimated their opponents.</p> <p>England have not played Test and one-day cricket at the same time but Australia very nearly did, quite recently. \u201cFebruary 2017,\u201d Lynch said, crisply. \u201cAustralia played Sri Lanka in a T20 at Adelaide on 22 February. Next day, 15 hours later according to Wisden, they started the first Test v India at Pune.\u201d And Australia won both games. (Quiz question: in India\u2019s second innings, all 10 wickets fell to spin \u2013 four to Nathan Lyon but who took the other six? Answer at the bottom.)</p> <p>Simultaneous series would require some lateral thinking. While England have two captains, Morgan and Joe Root, there is only one head coach, Chris Silverwood. But Paul Collingwood, one of the assistant coaches, was already due to take charge against Ireland, so he could be handed the whole white-ball season. Morgan will still be the real boss.</p> <p>The scheduling would be dictated by coronavirus, plus some common sense. The two formats would be staged at opposite ends of the country, to reduce the chances of both being washed out.</p> <p>If on-site hotels are essential, as has been mooted, the Test might be at Old Trafford and the one-dayers at the Rose Bowl near Southampton. With spectators unlikely to be invited, the one-day series could all be staged at the same ground, with reserve days, because there would be no travelling. A three-match series could be over in six days flat.</p> <p>Now for the most interesting piece of the puzzle: selection. England, like Australia, field different teams in Test and one-day cricket, but not entirely different. The selectors, Ed Smith and James Taylor, could work out what to do with the most versatile players but it would be much more fun if Root and Morgan picked teams, the way we all did in the under-10s. The publicity would be worth something too. Cricket on The One Show!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e03af6f6334d72a3e8fab27286ecf78db1e2e3b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e03af6f6334d72a3e8fab27286ecf78db1e2e3b7/659_169_2290_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jofra Archer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jofra Archer, a natural new-ball partner for Jimmy Anderson, if Joe Root had first dibs?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who would have first pick? Tradition says toss for it, but Morgan may argue it should be him because he would have already lost one regular \u2013 Root, still there in the 50-over side as the designated driver.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Eoin,\u201d says Alex Jones, \u201cwho\u2019s your first pick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStokesy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoe?\u201d There\u2019s a pause, as Root\u2019s familiar smile gives way to a look that could kill. Then he brightens.</p> <p>\u201cJofra.\u201d</p> <p>Jos Buttler, watching at home in London, is wondering which of them to feel more insulted by. Picking teams always did involve some pain and even if Morgan chooses him next, he still has an anxious wait to see who will take the Test place that was still his, just, when the series in Sri Lanka was called off.</p> <p>It could be Jonny Bairstow, in which case Root will be pinching one of Morgan\u2019s barnstorming openers. Or it could be Ben Foakes, who would then play a first home Test, 18 months after making his debut in Sri Lanka and looking like a senior player.</p> <p>\u201cJos,\u201d says Morgan, just about rescuing his relationship with his vice-captain.</p> <p>\u201cJonny,\u201d says Root, replacing one batsman-keeper with another. At home in Kent, Smith raises an eyebrow. Somewhere in Surrey, Foakes wonders if there is another country he can qualify for before he retires.</p> <p>Root may also be tempted to pick Moeen Ali, who took the winter off red-ball cricket. \u201cIf there was a Test match tomorrow and I got the call,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/play-test-cricket-tomorrow-if-i-got-call-says-moeen-ali\" title=\"\">Moeen recently</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/play-test-cricket-tomorrow-if-i-got-call-says-moeen-ali\" title=\"\">said</a>, \u201cI\u2019d say yes.\u201d But if Root sticks with Dom Bess, who shone in South Africa, the tug of love is over. Morgan can summon World Cup winners such as Jason Roy and Adil Rashid, give Tom Banton another try and reveal whether Alex Hales is still in the doghouse. Root can reel off Test regulars such as Ollie Pope and Stuart Broad while handing recalls to Rory Burns and Jimmy Anderson.</p> <p>The two lineups may look like this. For the Tests: Burns, Dom Sibley, Joe Denly or Zak Crawley, Root (capt), Pope, Bairstow (wkt), Sam Curran, Bess, Archer, Broad, Anderson, with Jack Leach as 12th man. For the one-dayers: Roy, Hales, Banton, Morgan (capt), Stokes, Buttler (wkt), Moeen, Chris Woakes, Rashid, Tom Curran, Mark Wood. Two decent teams, and one mouthwatering prospect: Anderson and Archer sharing the new ball, which could be like watching Richard Hadlee team up with Michael Holding.</p> <p>For the cricket-loving public, it may be more straightforward than it looks. Unlike football fans, we\u2019re used to seeing two teams we support play at once. We know that our sport, in Matthew Engel\u2019s memorable phrase, is the background music of an English summer. We\u2019ll tune in and out, quite happily, from 11am till 11pm. After the famine, not even cricket fans will moan about a glut.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\" title=\"\">To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</a>.</p>",

  "<h2>Trump\u2019s focus on judges started back on the 2016 campaign trail</h2> <p>Donald Trump made many promises on the campaign trail in 2016. He promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. He promised to resurrect American industry.</p> <p>And he promised to fill the courts with conservative judges, understood to mean judges who were skeptical of environmental regulations, who were not enthralled with the legacy of the civil rights era and who took a narrow view of a woman\u2019s right to choose.</p> <p>To combat doubts about his conservative credentials, Trump took the unusual step of releasing, while still a candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-conservatives\">a list of his potential picks</a> for the US supreme court. The list was curated by the Federalist Society, the country\u2019s largest organization of conservative legal activists. For evangelical Christians and other groups, the list signaled that Trump was a safe White House pick.</p> <h2>Has Trump delivered on his promises on judges?</h2> <p>As Trump\u2019s first term winds down, there is no great border wall, and no resurgent manufacturing sector. But the highest hopes of Trump\u2019s evangelical supporters have been realized, as the president has made good on his promise to fill the federal bench with a new brand of conservative judge \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">younger</a>, more ideologically committed and <a href=\"https://www.acslaw.org/judicial-nominations/diversity-of-the-federal-bench/\">less diverse</a> than their peers.</p> <p>At the circuit court level, Trump has installed 51 judges, or about 30% of all active judgeships, just one step before the US supreme court. He is preparing to fill dozens of district court vacancies. Most significantly of all, Trump has appointed two justices to the supreme court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, out of nine total.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&amp;description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&links=false\">series linker</a> </figure>  <h2>Are the judges powerful?</h2> <p>Together these judges wield immense power over who gets to vote, who gets to marry, who has access to healthcare, who carries a gun, who is branded a criminal, who may join a union, who is protected from discrimination and who has permission to discriminate on religious grounds.</p> <p>Pervasive influence on the federal judiciary is an immense prize, with implications spanning generations, given that federal judgeships are lifetime appointments. And it is a prize, analysts say, that Trump has handed the conservative movement, creating a powerful bulwark for his own political fortunes.</p> <p>\u201cThese judges have all been vetted in terms of judicial philosophy,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. \u201cAll believe in a bench that is not activist in terms of promoting civil libertarian values. But they\u2019re activist judges in terms of promoting the values that are important to them \u2013 property rights, pro-business, anti-regulation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"998d2b2e2bfc7702c3f35a0db12f8cd0fe4f9bb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/998d2b2e2bfc7702c3f35a0db12f8cd0fe4f9bb3/0_44_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump\u2019s best friend in the effort to appoint judges has been Mitch McConnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump\u2019s best friend in the effort to appoint judges has been Mitch McConnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How did Trump pick the judges?</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s success at installing top-level judges \u2013 he has placed more, faster, than any previous president \u2013 has owed to the preparedness of outside groups in taking advantage of Republican control of both the presidency and the US Senate, which is in charge of confirming judges. Trump also has benefited from dozens of retirements by judges who were appointed by previous Republican presidents.</p> <p>But his best friend in the effort has been Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who by blocking nominees under Barack Obama helped create 17 appeals court vacancies for Trump when he took office, more than any of his recent predecessors. McConnell also held a supreme court seat open for Trump, and he has changed Senate rules to speed the confirmation of Trump judges.</p> <h2>Have Trump\u2019s judges made any impact yet?</h2> <p>While experts advise that it could take five years or more for the full picture to develop of how Trump\u2019s judges are changing the courts, and the country, signs are emerging of a potential phase shift.</p> <p>Formerly reliable progressive benches have issued rulings that threaten access to reproductive healthcare, while others have greenlighted the Trump administration\u2019s most reckless attacks on voting rights and on vulnerable populations, from the disabled to victims of police abuse to asylum seekers.</p> <p>The supreme court, meanwhile, has consistently sided with Trump administration requests for emergency relief from lower court rulings against executive actions by Trump to create a wealth test for green card applicants, divert Pentagon funding for a border wall, ban transgender individuals from the military and more.</p> <h2>What is at stake in these changes?</h2> <p>Goldman expressed general confidence in the health of the judiciary and said many Trump judicial appointees were qualified for their posts. But he warned of dire consequences if Trump\u2019s judges gave in wholly to the president\u2019s desire to prosecute his political enemies and destroy the free press.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a president who has authoritarian instincts,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cWe have a president who is rather vindictive. That\u2019s really the big issue now \u2013 whether the constitution of the United States, the bill of rights, will survive Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Whether or not he is re-elected, Donald Trump will be revered by conservatives for his judicial appointments. As of March, Trump has appointed 193 judges to the federal bench, with another 39 pending on the floor of the Senate or in the Senate judiciary committee. Those nominations will surely be acted on favorably by the Senate before 20 January 2021, when there may be a new president and a new Senate. There are another 38 district court vacancies awaiting nominations. In one presidential term, Trump may appoint up to 270 federal judges, or 31% of the entire federal judiciary. For perspective, Barack Obama appointed 329 in <em>eight</em> years.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, will confirm Trump\u2019s appointments until the very last day of his term. This is of course the same Senate gatekeeper who infamously blocked Obama\u2019s final supreme court nomination, Merrick Garland, <em>for an entire year \u2013 </em>on the ground that in the final year of a presidency, the Senate should await \u201cthe will of the people\u201d in the upcoming general election. But that was then. The rules have apparently changed. McConnell will pack the courts with \u201cright-thinking\u201d ideologues who will carry out Trump\u2019s agenda long after he has been subjected to the scorn of historical scrutiny.</p> <p>We now know a lot about Trump\u2019s judicial appointments. Eighty-five per cent are white and 76% are male. This is a significant step backward. Obama\u2019s judicial appointments were 64% white and 58% male. Today, after more than three years of Trump\u2019s appointments, the federal judiciary is 73% white and 66% male, but it will be even more male and pale by the end of his term. Even more troubling is the average age of the Trump judges. According to Brookings, the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">median age</a> of Trump\u2019s judicial appointments by the beginning of his fourth year in office is 48.2. By the same time in his presidency, the median age of Obama\u2019s appointees was 57.2. This means that Trump judges will serve, on average, for 10 years more than the Obama judges.</p> <p>Statistics only tell part of the story. More important is the impact of these statistics on the critical issues that face the courts now and in the future. Courts should reflect the people they serve. I served as a federal district judge for 22 years. The vast majority of criminal defendants (in non-white-collar cases) were either African American or Hispanic, as were their family members. Plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases were overwhelmingly women, minorities or persons with disabilities. The same was true in actions involving prisoner rights, voting rights, housing discrimination and public benefits. Not all cases involve big corporations and business disputes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&amp;description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&links=false\">series linker</a> </figure>  <p>A diverse bench engenders trust and credibility. Many studies have shown that decision-makers reach better decisions when they bring a variety of experiences to their analysis. A 36-year-old lawyer who has never tried a case, has not represented individual clients, and has not spent years facing life\u2019s challenges is not well-positioned to decide on the length of a prison term, the need for access to healthcare, abortion, food stamps, Medicare or housing, or the impact of pollution or discrimination on working people\u2019s quality of life. It is for this reason the American Bar Association\u2019s standing committee on the federal judiciary insists that a candidate for judicial office have at least 12 years of experience <em>practicing</em> law \u2013 not talking about it as a speech writer, lobbyist or media star.</p> <p>When I was appointed to the bench I was 48. I had been a federal prosecutor, a defense lawyer, and had handled many civil cases in trial and appellate courts. That experience was invaluable. I knew both the substance and procedure of federal practice. The same cannot be said of many of Trump\u2019s nominees, whose only qualifications appear to be their consistently rightwing voting records.</p> <p>Consider the following four Trump judges, all of whom were appointed in their 30s. What they have in common is not their legal experience, but their outspoken support of Trump\u2019s political agenda. All were members of the Federalist Society or other rightwing organizations, clerked for conservative judges, and have written articles or advocated for legal positions that are vastly out of step with most Americans.</p> <p>Allison Rushing was 36 when she was confirmed to a seat on the fourth circuit court of appeals, 11 years after graduating from law school, and Trump\u2019s youngest nominee to a circuit court judgeship. She clerked for then-circuit judge Neil Gorsuch and for Justice Clarence Thomas. Her law practice during the remaining nine years was limited to representing big corporations at one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms.</p> <p>Andrew Brasher was 38 when he was confirmed to a seat on the 11th circuit court of appeals, after serving for only nine months on the district court for the middle district of Alabama. In the years just before his appointment he served as Alabama\u2019s solicitor general, often advocating for rightwing causes.</p> <p>Justin Walker, best known for his full-throated defense of Brett Kavanaugh (for whom he clerked), was appointed as a district judge in the western district of Kentucky, at 37, just 10 years after graduating law school. He is a protege of Mitch McConnell, who held up debate on a Covid-19 relief bill to attend Walker\u2019s induction ceremony. Less than six months after Walker took the bench, Trump announced that he intended to nominate him for an upcoming vacancy on the DC court of appeals.</p> <p>Patrick Wyrick was 38 when he was confirmed as a judge for the western district of Oklahoma. Four years after graduating law school he became the solicitor general of Oklahoma. He is a protege of Scott Pruitt, the disgraced former head of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>One of these judges could easily end up on the supreme court; two are known to be on the shortlist. All will probably still be on the bench 40 years from now. That alone should make voters think hard about the upcoming presidential election. As the saying goes: elections have consequences.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shira A Scheindlin served as a United States district judge for the southern district of New York for 22 years.

  "<p>For all the extravagant projects of the Donald Trump presidency, and for all its flamboyance and bluster, his makeover of the judiciary \u2013 a quieter project that has been ratcheted forward by a network of quieter people \u2013 may prove to have the longest and most far-reaching impacts on the daily lives of Americans.</p> <p>All new presidents change the courts by filling vacancies. But what is only now coming into focus is the impact that Trump\u2019s unprecedented number of judicial appointments is having on the courts, ruling by ruling, and on the day-to-day lives of Americans, in areas such as healthcare, voting rights, criminal justice, anti-discrimination efforts and the climate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=51%20&amp;title=active%20circuit%20court%20judges%20are%20Trump%20picks%2C%20almost%2030%25%20of%20the%20total%20bench\" data-alt=\"judges\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=51%20&title=active%20circuit%20court%20judges%20are%20Trump%20picks%2C%20almost%2030%25%20of%20the%20total%20bench\">judges</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe change is happening. It\u2019s happening before our very eyes,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench.</p> <p>While the US supreme court is the country\u2019s highest judicial authority and attracts most national and international attention, it is the country\u2019s appeals courts that have the last word on justice in the vast majority of cases. They hear thousands of cases each year, compared with the 100-150 the supreme court typically hears. And largely unlike the British court system, federal judges in the United States are selected by politicians in a process that has become an intense area of focus for outside partisans.</p> <p>Trump has notched more confirmations of appeals court judges, faster, than any president at a similar stage in history, a record he frequently gloats about and <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/trumps-exaggerated-judicial-boasts/\">cannot resist inflating</a>.</p> <p>Trump has appointed 51 out of the 179 active circuit court judges, or almost 30% of the entire bench, and next month the total is expected to hit 53. By comparison, Barack Obama appointed 55 circuit court judges and George W Bush appointed 62 \u2013 in eight years each. Trump\u2019s judges, who can serve for life, have a starting <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">median age</a> of 48.2, compared with 52.8 for Obama and 51 for Bush. As the country demographically becomes more diverse, they are <a href=\"https://www.afj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Confirmed-2.13.20.pdf\">predominantly male and white</a>, and ideologically they tend to inhabit deep right field.</p> <p>Together, they are changing America.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My motto for the year is leave no vacancy behind.

District judges in the ninth circuit, historically among the most progressive in the nation, had been fastest to block his travel ban and challenge his incursions on immigration, LGBTQ and voting rights. In 2018, when a district judge in the ninth circuit blocked Trump restrictions on asylum applications, Trump tweet-raged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1065581119242940416\">that</a> \u201cthe 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d with \u201ca horrible reputation\u201d.</p> <p>In the last two years, however, the ninth circuit has changed.</p> <p>Court vacancies and ruthless engineering by McConnell have allowed Trump to install 10 new judges on the ninth circuit, which with 29 active judges total is by far the biggest in the land. When the family planning cases landed before the court last year, two Trump appointees were selected at random to sit on an 11-member ruling panel.</p> <p>In late February, the court handed down its decision. The judges split 7-4 precisely according to the party identities of their appointing presidents. To the shock of longtime observers of the federal courts, the ruling greenlighted Trump\u2019s family planning restrictions \u2013 with the sure result, <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2020/02/24/19-15974_opinion.pdf\">in the words</a> of dissenting Judge Richard Paez, that \u201cwomen and their families will suffer for it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority disregards 20 years of progress, insistent on hauling the paternalism of the past into the present,\u201d Paez wrote. He quoted a district judge in Oregon: \u201cThis is madness.\u201d</p> <p>But as shocking as the ruling might have been, scholars saw in the ninth circuit decision a clear augury, \u201ca precursor for what we\u2019re likely to see in the future,\u201d according to Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a classic case that shows you how much power these new judges have,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concrete example of the changing dynamics of that court.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7362ffe8933902d010b40c05daf9cf66beaca4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7362ffe8933902d010b40c05daf9cf66beaca4a6/0_260_6062_3638/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asylum seekers wait for their turn to cross to the United States at El Chaparral crossing port on the US-Mexico border in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico, on 29 February 2020.

In fact, a 63% majority of Trump judges replaced judges who had been appointed by previous Republican presidents, according to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">analysis by</a> Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s just a little early to begin making determined judgments about how much things have changed on the courts of appeals,\u201d Wheeler said.</p> <p>But the data is beginning to pile up, in rulings starting at the top \u2013 the supreme court, where Trump has installed two justices out of nine, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.

In December, a Trump judge on the court joined a two-to-one majority attacking Obama\u2019s healthcare law, ruling that the former \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to carry health insurance was unconstitutional.

Even while texting with them I\u2019m left with a crushing feeling of flatness. As for more serious films, I\u2019ve managed to watch two by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/aug/08/jean-pierre-melville-cinematic-poet-of-the-lowlife-and-criminal\">Jean-Pierre Melville</a> (for work), a French documentary (for work) and 23 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/14/my-favourite-film-seven-samurai\">Seven Samurai</a> (for pleasure).</p> <p>I miss the cinema.

Outside my window, the tree that was in blossom last week has shed its petals in yesterday\u2019s breeze and coated all of the cars in shimmering pink. Yet I feel the weight of what is going on around us. I can\u2019t stop thinking of the death toll. I fret about my younger child\u2019s ability to socialise once this is over, after weeks spent only with family. I worry about my parents and grandmother.</p> <p>What has been missing from my viewing is any sense of joy or rapture \u2013 the idea of losing myself so completely in a film that I forget my own concerns, carried away by the thrill of it all. I think back to the last films that made my spirits soar like that: my second viewing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-south-korean-satire\">Parasite</a>, marvelling at the sequence where the Kims return to their underworld of penury, back to their basement flat awash in muck; or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma\">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a>, whose subversively warm and intimate abortion scene made me feel a swell of pure love. Those feelings are gone now \u2013 but perhaps I\u2019m not meant to be feeling them right now. Perhaps I just have to sit this out, wait for the passing of this misery before greeting films once more like so many other distant friends.</p>",

  "<p>Our local councils, already hardest hit by austerity, are again taking the fall in this coronavirus crisis, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-crisis-english-councils-funding-shortfall\">potential \u00a35bn funding shortfall </a>over the next year. Beyond the NHS, council social care for adults and children is all that protects fragile people day to day. Local councils with their panoply of road sweepers, bin collectors, libraries, museums, housing services, leisure centres, electoral registers, pot-hole menders, pub licensers, food inspectors, addiction services, youth and day centres, water and air pollution monitors, planners and park keepers \u2013 these, not Whitehall, are the custodians of the places where we live.</p> <p>It was always the Tory chancellor George Osborne\u2019s plan to make councils <a href=\"theguardian.com/society/2015/may/16/tory-councils-osborne-no-further-austerity\">take the pain</a> and the blame for his cuts. I heard a soon-to-be leading minister chuckling at a pre-2010 election event, \u201cWe are all devolutionists now. We will devolve the axe!\u201d And so they did.</p> <p>Much was stripped threadbare in the lost decade since, yet councils remain the bedrock of everyday civilisation.</p> <p>Central government keeps failing in this crisis, preferring to reinvent the wheel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">outsource testing to private companies</a>, ignoring councils\u2019 local capacity and knowledge. Leaders of the big councils, Labour and Tory, are of far higher calibre than most of Boris Johnson\u2019s inept cabinet: they know how things work.</p> <p>Councils are incandescent at their treatment. When it was first clear that care homes \u2013 already short-staffed and underfunded \u2013 were at risk of collapse, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, panicked. He told a virtual meeting of leaders to \u201cspend whatever it takes. <a href=\"https://www.gedlingeye.co.uk/news/read-letter-from-gedling-council-leaders-to-boris-johnson-in-full/\">The government will reimburse you</a>\u201d and \u201cwe will be supporting you and ensuring the money flows to you\u201d.</p> <p>But he backtracked: to listeners\u2019 disbelief, he told a recent leaders\u2019 meeting they would now be \u201csharing the burden\u201d. An explosion of indignant letters to the prime minister followed from council leaders. They had dashed to spend on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/england-care-providers-say-10-council-fee-rise-is-too-little-too-late\">care homes</a>, on staff, on protective equipment, on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\">hotels for the homeless</a>, on food for the 1.4 million shielded people, on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/charges-and-cautions-for-domestic-violence-rise-by-24-in-london\">steep rise in domestic violence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/09/councils-under-huge-pressure-as-number-of-children-in-care-soars-england\">children in care</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-crisis-puts-pressure-on-crematoria-and-morgues-in-uk\">on burials</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/labour-urges-universal-credit-rethink-to-help-low-income-families-coronavirus-lockdown\">million and a half people</a> plunging on to universal credit all need council tax relief.</p> <p>Councils have lost four times more in income than they have spent in those extra costs. Commercial rents, council rents, council tax and business rates have collapsed. Parking and leisure-centre fees have vanished. An emergency bung of \u00a31.6bn from Jenrick barely covered this year\u2019s national living wage rise. After the backlash from leaders, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-uk-english-councils-welcome-extra-16bn-support\">threw in another \u00a31.6bn</a>; but that\u2019s a small sticking plaster, and Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle City council and Labour group leader in the Local Government Association, fears how this allocation will be shared.</p> <p>Council finances have long been in urgent need of reform. Central government grants have just been abolished, leaving them reliant on failing business rates and restricted from raising council tax above 1.99%; there has been no revaluation of property since 1991. While NHS trusts can legally run up debts \u2013 \u00a313bn has just been <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-to-benefit-from-13-4-billion-debt-write-off\">written off</a> \u2013 councils must by law balance the books each year, forcing them to make savage cuts within this year\u2019s budget. Since some 70% of council spending is on social care, many of the care staff who are clapped every Thursday will soon get P45s. Councils are <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/lga-workforce-update-job-retention-scheme\">banned</a> from furloughing staff, while outsourced service companies can claim from the Treasury.</p> <p>That\u2019s all of a piece with Conservative philosophy since Margaret Thatcher forced councils to outsource care homes and much else. Schools were stripped away by Michael Gove\u2019s academisations, yet he left councils responsible for supporting pupils with special educational needs.</p> <p>Remember Eric Pickles? The ex-council leader was brought in to demolish councils in 2010, to smear and abuse them for extravagance as a cover for Osborne\u2019s cuts. Weekly his malevolent press releases accused them of spending too much on coffee and biscuits or on publications to their citizens. Yet public trust in councillors <a href=\"ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/trust-politicians-falls-sending-them-spiralling-back-bottom-ipsos-mori-veracity-index\">remains higher</a> than for Westminster politicians.</p> <p>In \u201cthe new normal\u201d, many hobbled councils will approach bankruptcy, such as Tory Northamptonshire. Worse still, a \u201cfair funding review\u201d is due this year to divert money from poor cities to Tory counties, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/20/ministry-of-housing-plans-to-redirect-inner-city-funds-to-tory-shires-branded-stitch-up\">weighting resources for \u201crurality\u201d more than urban deprivation</a>.</p> <p>This profound disrespect for councils led the government to employ the likes of Deloitte to site coronavirus test centres in places that NHS and care staff couldn\u2019t reach, ignoring councils\u2019 own public health staff. The government calls for 18,000 contact tracers, but every council has professional tracers for sexually transmitted diseases.</p> <p>Why was the French company Edenred <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52283067\">brought in</a> to distribute emergency food vouchers to the 1.3 million children on free school meals? Its errors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10f69aca-b5eb-41ea-b91c-1d9961e609a9\">left many families with nothing</a>, according to the Financial Times. Councils were far better equipped locally. Forbes discovered that the Westminster-run food parcels for the vulnerable contained Angel Delight and Pot Noodles, and he estimates each parcel costs \u201cmore than a Harrods hamper\u201d. He lists all the services done better and cheaper locally. \u201cBut the biggest betrayal will be cuts we must make to key workers who risk their lives in care homes. An outrage!\u201d</p> <p>This time Tory leaders are just as indignant. Ian Hudspeth, the Tory leader of Oxfordshire county council, says: \u201cGive us the money as we have the local experience, local food banks, local testing and tracing. Some councils have lost 50% of their income, and social care is all that can be cut now.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS has a free pass to spend \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d in this crisis, so why not councils too? Hudspeth protests: \u201cThat\u2019s a mystery to all concerned.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s not really a mystery. Westminster is in the grip of ideologues who seek to shrink the state; for them, councils remain invisible, despised and disposable.</p> <ul> <li><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>\u201cMost of the time, you fail; there are many more defeats than victories,\u201d Juan Antonio Pizzi says. He is right, even when it comes to his peer group \u2013 possibly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/11/barcelona-coaching-champions-league\">most successful coaching class in history</a> \u2013 but it is still an unusual reflection for a man who was La Liga\u2019s top scorer and, as a player and manager, won the league in three countries. All the more so when it is a reflection prompted by the time he led Chile to the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica. Minutes after winning the final, Pizzi sat before the press \u2013 and started talking about failure.</p> <p>He laughs now but there was a lesson there. \u201cIt\u2019s true: when you take over a team, most of the objectives you set, you fail to meet,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd however much you try to console yourself with your style, methodology, some improvement, what you want is to win and when you don\u2019t, which is most of the time, disappointment comes. You lose more than you win and your mind is occupied more with defeat than enjoying victory, which is gone very quickly.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/27/cambuur-captain-im-still-angry-its-an-unbelievable-decision\">\u2018This is horrible': Cambuur stunned after dream season turns to dust</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, why do it? Pizzi laughs again. <em>Because</em>. As he looks over his career there is plenty of chance; as he looks at <em>that</em> team, the one that may have been the origin of his coaching career, it can feel like fate. Alongside him as Barcelona kicked off the 1996-97 season were Julen Lopetegui, Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique. In fact, of that XI only two didn\u2019t become coaches \u2013 and both stayed in football \u2013 and only five members of the squad didn\u2019t become managers or sporting directors, and that includes a scout, a president and a candidate to head Fifa. Even the translator became a coach. You\u2019ll have heard of him.</p> <p>\u201cJos\u00e9 Mourinho was very, very intelligent; he absorbed knowledge and methodology very fast,\u201d Pizzi says. \u201cBut no, no one imagined this. In fact, he was very respectful, very aware of his role, although he was astute in learning from both managers.\u201d The first of those was Bobby Robson, the second Louis van Gaal, and Pizzi learned from them too. They all did. So much so that when Pizzi is asked whether there\u2019s an explanation for that team producing so many managers, he responds swiftly: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRobson would get names wrong and we\u2019d be there shooting looks at each other, going along with it. But he was fundamental: he had to lead Barcelona through the hardest era in 20 years, making that post-Cruyff period as trauma-free as possible. That was his great virtue. He was old school, close to the players, and the lessons from him were not just about football, they were human. He was an exceptional person and whenever we meet up, we remember him fondly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b702751c07bea52bae2671ab3a5b1bec41eaf5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b702751c07bea52bae2671ab3a5b1bec41eaf5d2/0_217_2656_1594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Robson with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (left) and Ronaldo after winning the European Cup Winners Cup with Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Robson with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (left) and Ronaldo after winning the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup with Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe and Van Gaal used different means, let\u2019s say. One was emotive, human; the other, Louis, based his work more on tactical knowledge, structure. There was respect but it was ideas and his ideas were genuinely different. Barcelona came from a Dutch footballing culture with Cruyff and Van Gaal shared that but it was very theoretical, very methodical, analytical. I\u2019ve been lucky with the coaches I played for and you take things from all of them.\u201d</p> <p>Not that those things necessarily added up to managerial material. After retiring, Pizzi and his wife opened a shop selling Argentinian polo gear but that didn\u2019t go well. He advised agents on the signing of players. It wasn\u2019t until later that he went on a coaching course with former Spain and Barcelona teammates in Las Rozas, northwest of Madrid.</p> <p>\u201cAt times your personality opens a pathway and, even if you don\u2019t realise it, you end up being what deep down you really want to be without even knowing it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were 20 or so of us \u2013 Pep, Luis Enrique, Nadal, Alkorta, Salinas, Ferrer \u2013 and we went in part because we had time to fill, but you start to feel ideas forming, you learn, begin to wonder if you can do this, if you can sit in a job interview and convince.\u201d</p> <p>One colleague and friend was already convinced. \u201cPep had such conviction in his footballing vision,\u201d Pizzi says. \u201cHe has brought those to England; football there had already evolved a lot but he represented a change and you can see his identity on that team. He doesn\u2019t need to win the Champions League for people to appreciate that. A coach doesn\u2019t need a title, which depends on so many factors, to express his virtues; the analysis has to look beyond that. It\u2019s like Messi: he doesn\u2019t have to win a World Cup to prove he\u2019s the most transcendental player in history.\u201d</p> <p>Pizzi speaks as one who denied Messi an international title. Having coached in Argentina, Peru, Chile, Mexico and Spain, Pizzi got the Chile job in 2016. He was not first choice, he knows, and talks openly of coincidence and chance, of luck, of opportunity arriving out of the blue, but he led them to the final with players such as Claudio Bravo, Eduardo Vargas and Arturo Vidal \u2013 \u201ca completely different person to the perception that many have of him because of the way he looks, the image that he projects: super professional, super respectful, a very good teammate, a man of solidarity\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6535853cfa90d6aa51473566ff897b78da6d752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6535853cfa90d6aa51473566ff897b78da6d752/0_573_3280_4314/760.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Antonio Pizzi speaks to Alexis S\u00e1nchez during Chile training in 2016.\" width=\"760\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Antonio Pizzi speaks to Alexis S\u00e1nchez during Chile training in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexis S\u00e1nchez, too. \u201cAlexis was in a perfect place at Arsenal,\u201d Pizzi says, \u201cand suddenly he changes city, coach, teammates, fans [by joining Manchester United] ... sometimes that adaptation happens quickly, sometimes it takes longer. In Alexis\u2019s case, I think it took too long. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to connect and emotionally he dropped. The consequences of that state of mind were translated in his performances. I don\u2019t know what destiny holds for him but I think this experience in Italy [at Internazionale], away from English football, might be good for him. I really hope so. I\u2019m sure that if he can find tranquillity and his form, he\u2019ll be very important for United.\u201d</p> <p>In the final Chile beat Messi\u2019s Argentina. Pizzi\u2019s Argentina, too. As a player he had made his Spain debut against the country of his birth; now as a manager he had denied them. \u201cThe truth is, I didn\u2019t enjoy it fully. Of course I was happy my team had won but I couldn\u2019t rid myself of my feelings for Argentina. That\u2019s a risk you take on when you work for another national team; It\u2019s not a pleasant situation to play against the country where you were born, where your friends are, your family ...\u201d</p> <p>Maybe that touch of melancholy was there in what he said at the end? Maybe, but Pizzi sees it as realism. As he celebrated, he knew losses had led him there and more would follow. That\u2019s about all he knows for sure, all any of us do. Like everyone, he is in lockdown, back in Argentina. There, he waits. And then, there is no plan. Is England an option? \u201cOf course. It\u2019s a great league, the best in the world, an aspiration for all coaches. But football takes you: it\u2019s the game that decides. Football leads you down the path football wants, not the one you map out.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019d be living my truth.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway is arguably the world\u2019s most infamous influencer. You may recognise her from her disastrous creativity workshops, for which she charged $165 a head and was branded a \u201cscammer\u201d; or from the tell-all <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html\">essay</a> her former friend Natalie wrote about their turbulent relationship \u2013 a she-said/she-said that is still ongoing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\">Who is Caroline Calloway, and why can't the internet stop talking about her?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When both went viral last year, Calloway was transformed from an aspiring memoirist who overshared on Instagram to a one-woman soap opera the entire internet loved to hate-watch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\">Who is Caroline Calloway</a>, went several headlines, and why can\u2019t the internet stop talking about her?</p> <p>There are now 2,250,000 Google results for her name. Even seven months on from the publication of the Cut\u2019s essay about her, the 28-year-old continues to captivate corners of social media.</p> <p>Her critics loathe her for her self-absorption, her privilege, her perceived attention-seeking and questionable cash-grabs. Her fans love her for her willingness to draw them into her intimacy, her prettiness and pluckiness. Neither can look away.</p> <p>If anything, Calloway\u2019s \u201creal life\u201d is on the internet \u2013 especially now, a few weeks into isolating alone in her grandmother\u2019s condo in Sarasota, Florida. Her social media output, always prolific, has reached new heights.</p> <p>When I first reach Calloway by phone, I find her engrossed in making \u201cinternet art\u201d from a snapshot of her and Natalie \u2013 scrambling their faces, she explains breathlessly, for her Instagram grid: \u201cI\u2019m very excited about it!\u201d</p> <p>I am reminded of how Calloway began her long-awaited \u201c<a href=\"https://www.iamcarolinecalloway.com/\">Natalie response</a>\u201d, her own take on the harms done during their friendship which also highlights Natalie\u2019s part in building her public profile.</p> <p>An online publication (she declines to say which) had offered her a \u201creally big sum\u201d for the essay: \u201cIt\u2019s bankable clicks, whatever I wrote.\u201d But in response to the worsening pandemic, she pulled out to self-publish the piece as a fundraiser for charity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb5a2364c385e68655e4f863a8af478773bcab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb5a2364c385e68655e4f863a8af478773bcab9/0_0_3280_4096/801.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Calloway: \u2018People care about such bizarre and specific things about me.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Calloway: \u2018People care about such bizarre and specific things about me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My call finds Calloway ebullient after having raised $20,000 for the frontline medical organisation Direct Relief from the first installment. (Over a month, the total comes close to $50,000.) She tells me she celebrated by putting her phone down, pouring herself a glass of bubbly and eating two entire jars of caviar \u2013 \u201clike a Russian oligarch\u201d.</p> <p>But as she goes on to speak about her experience of cancel culture \u2013 the pain of having her drug addiction turned into popcorn-fodder for the internet by her former friend, the vitriolic trolls she describes as \u201ccrusading for justice\u201d against her \u2013 it becomes clear that her sense of achievement is tempered by frustration. No matter what she does, she can\u2019t win.</p> <p>Take her fundraiser: some on social media have speculated that it was a scam \u2013 and then, after Calloway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinecaloway/status/1245163242353315841\">posted evidence</a> of the donations, a cynical tax break. It reflects the consensus of Calloway\u2019s \u201csnark community\u201d, as she calls those online critics keeping tabs on her every move: she cannot be trusted, and she is only ever out to benefit herself.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about taxes,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking about my own bills.\u201d It was actually \u201csort of a sacrifice\u201d to share the essay now, knowing that it would get less coverage. \u201cI really believe in karma \u2013 I just hope this good will find its way back to me someday,\u201d Calloway sighs.</p> <p>But I wonder if, in focusing on her lost press, Calloway might be selling herself short. In publishing her counter-statement now, as the rest of us have been forced into quarantine \u2013 she has a captive audience.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>True to fragmented internet fame, Calloway still has little name recognition beyond her own following and the small subsection of society who consider themselves \u201cextremely online\u201d. Of them, however, many will know everything there is to know about her.</p> <p>\u201cPeople care about such bizarre and specific things about me,\u201d she says, not without pride. Much of it is vigorously contested, from the mystery fate of <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2019/9/13/20864383/instagram-influencer-caroline-calloway-yale-plates\">the Yale plates</a> given to her by Natalie, to Calloway\u2019s claim to be the youngest-ever person to have their kneecaps removed (the latter was grounds for more than one <a href=\"https://fupaper.blog/2019/10/10/caroline-calloway-gaslit-me-into-believing-she-doesnt-have-kneecaps/\">online investigation</a>, and Calloway\u2019s mother has <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/caroline-calloway-knee-cap-removal-surgery-new-2020-4]\">confirmed</a> the surgery to a reporter).</p> <p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s so, so rich about the kneecaps thing is that I was so fucking mocked for this in middle school,\u201d she says merrily. \u201cIf I could travel back in time I\u2019d tell my heartbroken little third-grader self, \u2018OK, bad news. The teasing is going to get a <em>lot</em> worse.\u2019</p> <p>By her own admission, Calloway stokes those conversations, if only by providing continual fuel. Trying to keep up with her online is like trying to note the particulars of running water.</p> <p>Whenever you look at Twitter, she\u2019s just tweeted. Often it is a retweet of a quote-tweet of her own tweet \u2013 Caroline begetting Caroline like a little nest of Russian dolls, all bearing the beatific expression in her profile picture.</p> <p>On Instagram, her life is serialised for an audience of 700,000 people, both in real time and in the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1HaHWdB1FD/\">long, stylised picture captions</a> she claims to have pioneered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Caroline Calloway's long Instagram post\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

I still want it.\u201d</p> <p>Born Caroline Calloway Gotschall in Falls Church, Virginia, an upper-middle-class suburb of Washington DC, at 17 she changed her name to one that would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1HaHWdB1FD/\">look better on books</a>\u201d.</p> <p>When she joined Instagram in 2012, Calloway began experimenting with growing her following with input (sometimes paid) from her friend Natalie Beach, another creative writing student at NYU. She honed her winning formula of \u201cbeautiful photos with sort of sad or lonely captions\u201d while studying abroad at Cambridge University from 2013 to 2016.</p> <p>Calloway had always aspired to being an Ivy League student, even keeping a \u201cYale box\u201d stuffed with motivational memorabilia. But after she was rejected from Yale four times and then \u201cfor life\u201d, Calloway was accepted into Cambridge on her third attempt.

&lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Had Calloway gone viral as a publishing success story, not a scammer, it is easy to imagine her being praised for her dogged pursuit of her dreams.</p> <p>Back in New York the summer after her first year at Cambridge, her Instagram boosted by 250,000 new followers, Calloway engineered a meeting with star literary agent Byrd Leavell by pretending to his secretary to already be his client. (Leavell <a href=\"https://backmattermag.com/portfolio/printing-clickbait/\">has since called</a> her \u201cdeeply unwell\u201d and dishonest.)</p> <p>With his help, her memoir <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/69340-follow-the-influencers-social-media-stars-2016.html\">sold in 2016</a> for $375,000; foreign deals took the total above $500,000. But at the time 24-year-old Calloway was increasingly addicted to Adderall, an ADHD medication she had started taking recreationally in late 2011.</p> <p>\u201cThey were delicious,\u201d she says breezily now. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, they murdered my life and I\u2019ll never touch it again \u2013 but drugs are fun.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway called on Beach to help co-write the book proposal, as she had her early Instagram posts. These collaborations formed the basis of Beach\u2019s later claim to have been Calloway\u2019s ghostwriter.</p> <p>By spring 2017, Calloway says she was taking Adderall in such quantities as to be at risk of a fatal overdose: \u201cI was really counting my sleeping pills to do the math right.\u201d Later that year she publicly reneged on the deal with Flatiron Books, paid back most of the advance, and began her recovery from addiction.</p> <p>Calloway says Flatiron still owns the rights to her story of her time at Cambridge and that, though that \u201cdark, messy book\u201d is not imminent, they are prepared to wait.</p> <p>About 18 months later, shortly into 2019, she found herself going viral for her disastrous attempt at a global tour of \u201ccreativity workshops\u201d. Venues weren\u2019t booked, promised perks were downgraded or not delivered, and Calloway sought unpaid labour despite charging $165 a head. She became instantly infamous as a \u201cone-woman Fyre festival\u201d and a scammer akin to the socialite con artist <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html\">Anna Delvey</a>.</p> <p>The backlash was the first time Calloway had lost control of the crowd she had courted. In response she cancelled all but two events and refunded all tickets, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ceilidhann/status/1086008906994892800?lang=en\">blaming</a> her \u201ctotal inexperience with event planning and GREED\u201d. She reattempted the workshops in August, billing them as \u201cThe Scam\u201d of which she had been accused.</p> <p>Many attendees said they were satisfied, even for $165; \u201cI would have paid MORE!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/caroline-calloway-instagram-influencer-tour-canceled-scam]\">wrote one</a>. But journalists questioned charging such a sum for a meet-and-greet. The same criticism is made of her charging $140 for <a href=\"https://carolinecalloway.com/collections/dreamer-bbs\">her art</a>, a pastiche of Matisse\u2019s Blue Nude II.</p> <p>There are two persistent complaints, says Calloway, with weary authority. \u201cOne is that I take people\u2019s money, which I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m really on top of making sure everyone\u2019s a satisfied customer. Then there\u2019s the idea that I charge too much, and like I\u2019m somehow tricking people into buying stuff from me.</p> <p>\u201cThose people fundamentally do not understand the business model of an online creator.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>At the heart of what seems to rile many about Calloway is her apparent privilege. Her great-grandfather, a real estate mogul, once owned most of Sarasota; she has described herself as being \u201cborn into material wealth\u201d, but denies being rich herself.</p> <p>Last year a Vice reporter was moved to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7e9k/caroline-calloway-the-scam-event-essay\">investigate</a> how Calloway paid rent and found court evidence that she had often struggled. Between paying for a Greenwich Village apartment, thrice-weekly therapy, and a web developer to manage donations, Calloway says now: \u201cI am so fucked in terms of income flow.\u201d</p> <p>She adds that she eschews sponsored content, many influencers\u2019 bread-and-butter: \u201cSelling my audience\u2019s attention \u2026 it just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d Yet her critics keep score of her purchases (pedigree kittens, a trip to Berlin, an expensive ring) and confront her with them whenever she attempts to monetise her following.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ba0bc71137a791ae1cabbcc827f11e17aee1c1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba0bc71137a791ae1cabbcc827f11e17aee1c1f/0_0_4096_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Calloway poses for a portrait on Thursday, April 16, 2020 in Sarasota, Florida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t really mind if people think I\u2019m a bad writer, if they don\u2019t understand my weird Instagram performance art or they find my long captions annoying.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the world at large, the \u201cScammergate\u201d debacle remains proof of Calloway\u2019s shameless profiteering. Just this morning, she says, she blocked an anonymous Twitter troll for \u201ctweeting at me over and over for not providing food\u201d at the workshops. (She did.)</p> <p>But it was over a year ago, I say, confused \u2013 and unless they attended, why do they care?</p> <p>Calloway explodes. \u201cI KNOW,\u201d she nearly screams, her voice distorting on the line. \u201cOh my God, I am going to go Incredible Hulk on my grandmother\u2019s condo if we keep talking about this. Like, flip the dinner table over.\u201d</p> <p>She takes a deep breath. \u201cI love fame. I love being written about. I don\u2019t really mind if people think I\u2019m a bad writer, if they don\u2019t understand my weird Instagram performance art or they find my long captions annoying. That\u2019s part of the package of being in the public eye, and honestly I find it exhilarating.\u201d</p> <p>What is hard, Calloway says, her voice quavering, is delineating where the standard scrutiny of celebrity should end.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people tell me to shut up, \u2018don\u2019t play the victim\u2019 \u2013 but when you Google my name, the related searches are criminals,\u201d she says, with mounting incredulity. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal to be famous and to be associated with criminals who are <em>literally in jail</em>, when I myself am a law-abiding memoirist!\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It is true that, if the conventional wisdom is \u201cdon\u2019t feed the trolls\u201d, Calloway\u2019s never go wanting. She continues to engage with her critics lustily, and at length.</p> <p>Her tendency to single out individual journalists has led to accusations of bullying; a T-shirt she made targeting one by name (\u201cStop hate-following me\u201d) was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ceilidhann/status/1092410035651657728\">pulled from sale</a> for harassment.</p> <p>Even her supporters can find their goodwill tested \u2013 such as when Calloway likened the backlash against her workshops to being diagnosed with cancer. When a fan said it was insensitive, Calloway defended it as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BordersGirlBlog/status/1162523601528152069\">good art</a>\u201d: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like my free content, you can unfollow me.\u201d</p> <p>Instead many opt to steep themselves in their hatred of her \u2013 and find company in doing so. There are now two groups dedicated to \u201cCaroline snark\u201d in Reddit, each with 5,000 active members, whose conspiracy theories and vitriolic pursuit seem to suggest obsession.</p> <p>They will even rally en masse against journalists they see as being sympathetic to her. The New York Times\u2019 Taylor Lorenz was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1212908773255401473\">inundated with abuse</a> for her assumed association with Calloway, despite having never reported on her.</p> <p>Calloway likens her \u201csnark community\u201d to rightwing trolls \u201cwho feel so passionately, and so righteously, that they\u2019re crusading for justice\u201d. It is hard not to get the sense that not only do they want her to go away \u2013 they want her to suffer.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the hands for a suicidal depressive to have been dealt, having so many people want them to not exist \u2013 the irony almost seems cruel,\u201d says Calloway grimly. \u201cA lot of people do want me to just stop being, period.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Calloway has been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression. She says she inherited mental illness from her father, William Gotschall, who she describes as a bipolar, paranoid agoraphobe. Weathering his bouts of \u201cblack rage\u201d when she was a child led Calloway to believe that \u201cwe should take people seriously when they are host to a brain that wants to kill them\u201d.</p> <p>After her workshops went viral, Calloway started taking antidepressants. Nonetheless, for seven months she was a \u201cwreck\u201d: \u201cNothing had ever hurt that bad.\u201d She read Jon Ronson\u2019s So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed, \u201cone page at a time, having to take breaks to wipe my tears. I didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d get through it.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway continues to take an SSRI daily; \u201cA silver lining to that cancellation: it made me reconsider my approach to pills.\u201d Her experience of addiction had left her leery of prescription drugs. Over about a year from May 2017, she had \u201call but disappeared from Instagram\u201d, working through recovery steps with a therapist.</p> <p>The following March, Calloway sent Beach a heartfelt apology for being a \u201ctrainwreck\u201d during their friendship, and expressed hope that they could begin anew and \u201cmake something beautiful out of the mess\u201d.</p> <p>A month later Beach replied, accepting Calloway\u2019s apology, and kindly but firmly refusing to resurrect their friendship. Calloway remembers sobbing as she read Beach\u2019s email \u2013 but, she says, \u201cI respected that boundary.\u201d</p> <p>When Beach\u2019s essay I Was Caroline Calloway was published 18 months later, it made no mention of Calloway\u2019s apology or their empathetic email exchange. Instead it dwelled on Calloway\u2019s offhand slights, erratic behaviour and broken promises \u2013 culminating in Beach being abandoned by Calloway at a bar in Amsterdam and spending the night on the street.</p> <p>Many readers praised the essay as a relatable account of a lopsided friendship not uncommon in one\u2019s 20s. \u201cIf you can\u2019t identify the Caroline Calloway in all of your female friendships, then you are the Caroline Calloway\u201d was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejdickson/status/1171582480434028545\">one assessment</a>.</p> <p>Only a minority voiced discomfort at the gleeful reception of what seemed to be a voyeuristic account of an unwell young woman.

And rather depressing.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway says Beach reduced her to the stereotypical self-obsessed influencer, the sum of \u201cthe dumbest shit\u201d she had said in sophomore year. \u201cShe really flattens me into a one-dimensional villain. It\u2019s not confusing about who\u2019s the plucky underdog and who\u2019s the maniacal, vapid bitch.</p> <p>\u201cMost of all, when I talk about being stripped of humanity \u2026\u201d Calloway grows somber. \u201cHer essay is over 6,000 words long \u2013 yet she doesn\u2019t use the words \u2018mental illness\u2019 or \u2018addiction\u2019 once.\u201d</p> <p>The only mention of her addiction was forced by Calloway to a factchecker; she also clarified Beach\u2019s passing mention of her threatening suicide.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that my depression or my addiction excuses or undoes or makes up for any of the ways that I hurt Natalie \u2013 her hurt is very real, and my bad decisions were very real. Five years later I am still knitting together the broken pieces of my life,\u201d says Calloway, her voice wobbling.</p> <p>But, she says, she was \u201cfloored with pain\u201d to see her suicidal ideation \u201cscrubbed from the record\u201d: \u201cI was shocked.\u201d</p> <p>(When reached for comment, Natalie Beach said she \u201cchose to tell the story solely through my perspective, feeling that it would be presumptuous and irresponsible to otherwise diagnose or label a person I hadn\u2019t spoken to in two years. She mentioned the suicide threat \u201cbecause it was directed at me personally, and marked the moment I stopped writing her book and the end of our working relationship\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think that my depression or my addiction excuses any of the ways that I hurt Natalie \u2013 her hurt is very real</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The week the essay was published, Calloway\u2019s father died by deliberate overdose of painkillers at their family home. She says he was close to bankruptcy, and had recently been discharged from a psychiatric hospital after having his petition to stay hospitalised denied.</p> <p>In a later installment of her Natalie response, Calloway confronts her father\u2019s suicide in moving but graphic detail, with pictures of the autopsy report and the scene. Though it is affecting writing, one imagines that a compassionate editor would have urged Calloway to reconsider for her own good.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not ready to open something up to the scrutiny of the internet, I don\u2019t write about it,\u201d says Calloway. \u201cNatalie made public, for the first time, the fact that I\u2019d struggled with suicide.

Tweets about her go viral. Stories about her get read. After Beach\u2019s essay was published, Calloway was briefly a bigger search term on Google than the British prime minister, Boris Johnson.</p> <p>This seems to have led to a perception of Calloway as an online commodity, or as fair game. Even Jameela Jamil \u2013 an outspoken campaigner for kindness, and no stranger to online pile-ons \u2013 unthinkingly <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/caroline-calloway-jameela-jamil-scam-goddess-podcast-twitter-controversy-a9444981.html]\">joined in</a> on the Calloway-bashing on a recent podcast. Calloway\u2019s own theory on why she is so polarising is that she is too open about her flaws: \u201cWhen I pretended my life was perfect at Cambridge, I never got any hate. I do think the more vulnerable you are online, the more vulnerable you make yourself to criticism.\u201d It is true that, more than many in the influencer economy, she is less concerned with presenting an aspirational image than the work of maintaining it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes I feel like the best thing I can do for Natalie is to just let her capitalise on me, you know?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI made such smart early investments in Instagram,\u201d she says, describing how she bought fake followers (before it was stigmatised) to boost her profile and advertised on Harry Potter fan communities to attract readers already \u201cpredisposed to become obsessed with what they read\u201d.</p> <p>If she overweights these achievements, it may be because people are so disinclined to give her any credit. Today Instagram is arguably the most influential social media platform in the world; Calloway used it for storytelling when it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2brokegirlsq/status/253318036524765184\">dismissed</a> as \u201cTwitter for people who can\u2019t read\u201d, and understood the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/20/caroline-calloway-writers-journalists-social-media-influencers\">value of commodifying herself</a> long before respected writers followed suit.</p> <p>Calloway says she feels justified in monetising her audience, not least because of all that she gives away for free. \u201cI know all the hours of work that it took to get here. And I don\u2019t mean just writing posts \u2013 I also means the hours I cried myself to sleep, because the literal news was saying what a bad person I am.\u201d</p> <p>Surviving cancellation, Calloway says, \u201cis much like getting caught in a riptide. If you fight against it, you will expend all your energy, and you will drown \u2026 I think it\u2019s so unfair that people look at the ways that I let myself be carried by the current \u2013 the only other choice being to let it break me.\u201d (I later find that her analogy borrows generously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/24/taylor-swift-pop-music-hunger-games-gladiators\">from her idol, Taylor Swift</a>.)</p> <p>She appeals to me directly: \u201cHow would you feel about yourself if we woke up in a world where your name was replaced with my name?\u201d</p> <p>I would get off the internet, I say, truthfully, and she laughs.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In fact, the tide seems to be turning in Calloway\u2019s favour, just as she learned to swim. She tells me excitedly she was texting an ex the other day (\u201cI\u2019m horny as fuck in quarantine, I\u2019m \u2018reaching out\u2019 to everyone\u201d) who told her that it has \u201cnever been more popular\u201d to like her.</p> <p>It is possible that the virulence of her trolls has turned public sentiment towards her \u2013 or, as Calloway suggests, that her return to Twitter has shown people that she is self-aware and funny: \u201cNo one can roast me better than I roast myself.\u201d</p> <p>But it could be that the rest of the world has finally met her on her chaotic terms. From social media it seems that, during lockdown, there is greater appreciation for Calloway\u2019s constant spectacle. The internet has always been her world; now, increasingly, we are living in it.</p> <p>\u201cDuring this quarantine, I feel almost a burden to be entertaining more than ever,\u201d says Calloway. \u201cChaos is a weakness of mine \u2013 but it can also be a strength.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, not 12 hours after our interview, I check Twitter and find it in meltdown: Calloway has posted an uncensored, full-frontal nude of herself <em>and</em> made it her pinned tweet \u2013 equivalent to hanging a framed print on your front door.</p> <p>It was, she wrote, a \u201chumble apology\u201d for those who had paid for her essay expecting it to be 15,000 words and only got 6,000. That was a \u201creally funny joke\u201d, Calloway patiently explains when I call her a few days later. \u201cThe apology part was like when the pizza delivery boy shows up in the first minute of porn \u2013 it had nothing to do with what\u2019s about to happen.\u201d</p> <p>In reality, the nude was her small way of compensating for the loss of a Playboy shoot that she says was slated for this spring: \u201cI\u2019d really adjusted to the idea of the internet seeing my nipples.\u201d (Playboy says no shoot was discussed, or promises made.)</p> <p>So, I persevere \u2013 was the nude to build hype for her essay?</p> <p>I can almost hear Calloway shrug. Then she says something so spectacularly Caroline Calloway, I think maybe she could be a genius. \u201cYou could just as easily say the essay was hype for the nude.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was updated on 29 April 2020 to reflect Playboy\u2019s response to Caroline Calloway\u2019s claim. </p></li> </ul>",

He said $30bn of support would be provided in the next month.</p> \n<p>The government has not asked Treasury for advice on further expansions of the jobkeeper wage subsidy program, nor industry-specific packages for the entertainment and arts sectors.</p> \n<p>Treasury is advising the government about tax and industrial relations changes as a way to boost growth, as well as Virgin\u2019s decision to enter voluntary administration. Kennedy said the commonwealth had a \u201cstrong interest\u201d in Australia being served by two full-service airlines.</p> \n<p>Kennedy praised Australian governments\u2019 handling of the Covid-19 economic contraction, arguing they had \u201csubstantially lessened the impact\u201d by acting early in introducing restrictions and crediting them with a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d that had

access to superannuation, 757,000 had been approved and $6.3bn had been approved for release.</p> \n<p>The figures suggest financially distressed people have so far asked to take an average of $8,322

My deprivation is minimal compared with that of many \u2013 I have had too many conversations now with people who have lost their incomes for the foreseeable future. Yet, as tough as it is, the majority of the population, right across the age groups, continues to support the lockdown, because we are not stupid.</p> <p>In places, patience is fraying, sure, and people are taking more risks, but still we fear death \u2013 not just our own, but that of our loved ones \u2013 more than recession. The sections of the rightwing press urging us to end lockdown, continually telling us the public is restless, always cite anonymous \u201cTory grandees\u201d. These are millionaire donors who lather up discontent by saying long-term economic lockdown will destroy more lives than the virus.

This is not a British quality, but a human one. (Indeed, our lockdown has not been as strict as that of many of our neighbours.)</p> <p>Whenever the lockdown is eased, Covid-19 will still exist and we will live with whatever we deem to be an acceptable level of death and risk. As individuals, we are poor at risk assessment. Adult conversations need to be had by this government. What are the risks for a healthy 25-year-old woman or a 55-year-old man? How many children have been ill?</p> <p>Why should we trust a government the strategy of which has been secretive and mostly too little, too late? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-forecast-to-cut-uk-economic-output-by-15\">The economy has shrunk</a>; we all know that.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/clashes-predicted-over-trillion-euro-covid-19-aid-as-eu-meets-online\">European summit</a> last week was hailed as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-delivers-a-moment-of-truth-on-the-meaning-of-the-eu\">moment of truth</a>. In a recent interview, France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, laid out how European leaders had a rendezvous with history and needed to come together, and show that Europe under duress was able to respond with a common voice and with common means to the Covid-19 crisis. By all measures, this rendezvous with history was missed. European leaders in effect agreed to keep calm and carry on.</p> <p>They endorsed a roadmap to exit lockdown after each country had in fact already decided and announced their own uncoordinated exit plans. In some countries, such as Germany, deconfinement measures are not a prerogative of the federal government and coordinating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/german-states-lifting-lockdowns-too-quickly-warns-merkel-coronavirus\">between states</a> is challenging enough, let alone coordinating with other countries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The eurozone needs to move towards a true form of fiscal federalism, which the current EU budget doesn\u2019t permit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a result of the great disparity in the level of infection in each country, the different endowments in medical supplies and the varying levels of testing capacities (France is close to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/391e9ea6-fb1c-4d95-837f-9495508ed91b\">150,000 per week</a> and Germany has capacity for 700,000), each country is striking its own path. This lack of coordination risks a second wave of reinfection as the virus travels from country to country.</p> <p>The leaders also agreed on an economic recovery plan that is incomplete and unbalanced, and is planting the seed of profound divergence between member states. As it stands, most state aid rules have been lifted, allowing governments to support their corporate sector as they see fit. This is necessary given the circumstances but is only affordable for those countries with the strongest balance sheets.</p> <p>In these countries, equity injections by the government, concessional loans (those granted on more favourable terms than market ones) and guarantees will allow the corporate sector to face the cost of the crisis but it will profoundly and durably undermine the level playing field inside the single market.</p> <p>Similarly, each government\u2019s ability to support economic recovery will be highly constrained by their level of debt. The ability to support households or the unemployed will vary greatly from one country to the next, creating lasting scars on the weakest, such as Italy or Spain, who cannot offer the same level of support as France or Germany.</p> <p>The summit endorsed the instruments proposed by European finance ministers, which rely entirely on the idea that assistance comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/solidarity-members-eurozone-coronavirus-dutch-coronabond\">in the form of loans</a> from the EU to countries when they lose access to financial markets or when their market conditions deteriorate. While this reduces borrowing costs now, it doesn\u2019t change the long-term unsustainable debt burden that the crisis will create<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In the absence of true mutualisation, whereby European governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/eu-coronavirus-relief-deal-enemies-debt-eurozone\">share the cost of the crisis</a> rather than let each member state spend and borrow on its own, and real monetisation, where the Central Bank finances this new debt by issuing money, European countries will either spend the next generation in austerity and depression to try and pay down the debt, or they will go through the socially and politically destructive restructuring of some of it.</p> <p>This is why the idea of using loans from the EU, in particular via the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), created during the eurozone crisis to lend to and discipline euro area countries, has created a violent reaction, in particular in Italy.</p> <p>But behind a political debate that has turned somewhat hysterical in recent weeks lies a set of rather fundamental questions. Are European countries prepared to truly share some of the burden of this crisis? Are they prepared to politically underwrite this burden-sharing or would they rather have it happen by stealth, with technocrats at the European Central Bank purchasing each individual European government debt without an explicit political agreement to do so?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/eu-summits-swap-huddles-and-wine-for-muted-mics-and-pringles-pop-art\">EU summits swap huddles and wine for muted mics and Pringles pop art</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fundamental answer to these questions depends on whether EU governments are prepared to pool taxes, borrowing and spending. Ultimately, this principle matters more than the size of the fund and will be necessary for a common European fiscal response to emerge. It is challenging because, if agreed, it would amount to a rewriting of the principles on which the single currency was built.</p> <p>So far Germany has only allowed solidarity to take place with strict controls over the policies of its recipients. But this integration process is proving both economically and politically destructive for Europe, as it plants the seeds of economic enfeeblement and political bitterness. The eurozone needs to move towards a true form of fiscal federalism under the democratic control of the European parliament with taxing, borrowing and spending powers, which the current EU budget doesn\u2019t permit.<strong> </strong>Short of that, the EU will carry on on its crutches, medically assisted by the drip-feed of a central bank that is forced to provide the vital energy to a political project that has lost its soul.</p> <p>\u2022 Shahin Vall\u00e9e is a French economist, and was an adviser to Emmanuel Macron when he was economy minister</p>",
  "<p>In the autumn of 2001, Paul Mpagi Sepuya was an art student living in downtown New York. He\u2019d just started his second year of university after moving from California when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/12/september11-usa\">9/11 changed life in the city</a> for good. In March this year, the Covid-19 outbreak triggered another seismic change for the photographer: his newly opened exhibition in Los Angeles was forced to close a month before a major book collating his work was released. For Sepuya, this time is harder.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems much worse, in some ways, than September 11,\u201d he says. \u201cI was living downtown, maybe a mile from it, watching the whole thing happen. You didn\u2019t know what was coming next.\u201d</p> <p>But in 2001, Sepuya and his friends could rally round in person after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center \u2013 and later, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/20/september11.globalisation\">meet to protest</a> against the impending wars in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/10/the-afghanistan-war-is-more-than-a-1-trillion-mistake-its-a-travesty\">Afghanistan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/iraq-war-10-years-on\">Iraq</a>. \u201cAt least you could be together,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Sepuya that togetherness is not only crucial for his sense of solidarity during the Covid-19 crisis, it\u2019s one of the key things his photography explores. From 2000 to 2014 Sepuya was in New York where he started his queer zine Shoot, which was described as an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/arts/08iht-gay.1.5613848.html\">autobiographical me-and-my-naked-friends magazine</a>\u201d when it came to the attention of the New York Times. That 2007 review could still be used to describe Sepuya\u2019s work as he carries on mining his social life for his subject matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffe4cd31f2ca265ea0c9517470fa73abc4397456\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffe4cd31f2ca265ea0c9517470fa73abc4397456/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Some of Sepuya's sitters became famous on the internet \u2026 Model Study (0X5A4029), 2017.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Model Study (0X5A4029), 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His sitters are friends, acquaintances and lovers, who peer into the camera or are often in an embrace with their back to the lens. It\u2019s that contact and intimacy which interests him. When he was asked to contribute to a piece about the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, he wrote that if there was any aspect of the event that relates to his work, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/t-magazine/stonewall-artists.html\">it\u2019s what was happening in the bar before the protest, when people were just there encountering one another</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Sepuya has been described as a \u201cpostmodern portrait photographer\u201d who challenges traditional portraiture by filtering it through the black queer gaze. Brazenly self-referential, his early work began around his \u201ckitchen table or downstairs in the living room and then eventually my bedroom\u201d. Since then he has been compared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/09/robert-mapplethorpe-photography-jack-fritscher-look-at-the-pictures\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/wolfgang-tillmans\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/arts/ren-hang-dead-photographer-china.html\">Ren Hang</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/caravaggio\">Caravaggio</a>.</p> <p>Jop van Bennekom \u2013 who co-founded the magazines Butt and Fantastic Man, and was one of Sepuya\u2019s early supporters \u2013 says he was struck by the simplicity of the images and the fact he was tackling portraiture at all. \u201cMy first reaction was how dare you make something so simple: a guy with his shirt off sitting on the end of a bed? They don\u2019t smile or give away too much, there\u2019s just a real tension there.

It\u2019s all of these things but it never leaves Paul\u2019s world: the studio.\u201d</p> <p>The work is laced with homoerotic visual culture, and pulls the curtain back \u2013 often literally \u2013 on the function of the studio. Tripods are often in shot, while orange peel, used coffee cups and Post-it notes add to the mise-en-scene. Black velvet backdrops and mirrors serve as a way to reflect images and bodies at surreal angles, with it often being hard to tell whose limbs belong to whom. \u201cThere is no ambiguity for me,\u201d says Sepuya, who has repeatedly said he\u2019s not trying to make \u201ctricky\u201d pictures. \u201cEverything is very apparent. If you know someone there is no fragment of their body that is ambiguous or unfamiliar, right?\u201d</p> <p>Sepuya says the work can be seen as an ongoing series of \u201cdaily snapshots\u201d of his life. \u201cBut none of it is laid out to tell a narrative,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in making an autobiographical narrative, but it is all tied to me.\u201d The work is also a reaction to the gay photography he saw growing up. \u201cI think it just came out of frustration,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something very limiting in those, I guess I\u2019ll call it \u2018capital G\u2019, gay photo circles, where the conversation never gets past desire.\u201d</p> <p>Some of Sepuya\u2019s early sitters became famous in some corners of the internet after appearing in Shoot or his early portraits that were printed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/3\">Butt magazine</a>, and shared on MySpace and Tumblr. In his new book, he tells a story of a friend who decided to move from New York to Buenos Aires, went into his local coffee shop and was asked if he was \u201cTodd from Paul Sepuya\u2019s portraits?\u201d by a couple.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5415b36f2c31e8509d7c15569393b1742d2c8d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5415b36f2c31e8509d7c15569393b1742d2c8d39/0_0_2370_3000/790.jpg\" alt=\"Self-Portrait Holding Joshua\u2019s Hand, 2006.\" width=\"790\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-Portrait Holding Joshua\u2019s Hand, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and CAM St Louis and Aperture, New York.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the last five years Sepuya has made the leap from zines and \u201calternative spaces\u201d to the most prestigious galleries in the US. He was included in the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-importance-of-the-faces-on-the-walls\">Whitney Biennial in 2019</a>, and the influential <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3886\">Being: New Photography 2018 at MoMA</a>, while in the UK this year he had a solo exhibition at Modern Art in London and was part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/17/masculinities-review-barbican-london-exhibition\">the Barbican\u2019s Masculinities show</a>.</p> <p>That burst of activity has seen his rise dubbed \u201cmeteoric\u201d, but it\u2019s a tag he\u2019s quick to reject. In 2017, three years after he had moved to Los Angeles, he was interviewed by a magazine that described a New York show as his first in the city. \u201cIt was my 11th,\u201d he says, drily. \u201cI think for people who need to present things there\u2019s this desire for everything to be a meteoric event, but there\u2019s no way I could be making the work now without what had come before it.\u201d</p> <p>Talking about his eponymous book, he adds: \u201cI realised at that point I need to take this opportunity to remind people and put all this cumulative work in front of people so they don\u2019t think I\u2019m looking at trends and trying to find this \u2018thing\u2019 to do.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, he says, his early work is important not least because it captures the New York friends for whom he made his pictures in the first place. \u201cI was trying to understand my friendships, relationships and developing social world at that time when I was in these new mostly gay spaces,\u201d he says. \u201cI hadn\u2019t had that type of social support before.\u201d</p> <p>Sepuya grew up in San Bernardino, the first major city east of Los Angeles, infamous for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-bernardino-shooting\">the terrorist attack</a> there in 2015. It was comfortable childhood but he wanted something more exciting and would go to Los Angeles at weekends to buy magazines. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/05/the-face-is-back-in-print-with-dua-lipa-and-harry-styles-among-the-cover-stars\">The Face</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2010/nov/13/id-magazine-covers\">i-D</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/21/andy-warhol-interview-magazine-closes\">Interview</a> were favourites \u2013 at one point he had every single 90s issue of the latter. It was those magazines\u2019 images and articles that made him take up photography.</p> <p>His father, a Ugandan doctor, wasn\u2019t supportive of his artistic exploits, but his African American mother was. A retired physical therapist from Louisiana, who also worked for the US Air Force and had briefly taken a photography course during college, she gave Sepuya her old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/20/japan\">35mm Minolta camera</a> and with some assistance from a neighbour \u2013 who had previously run a photography studio and lent him equipment \u2013 he began to experiment. \u201cShe let me set up a dark room in the garage,\u201d says Sepuya.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abc6090666d691fe28de8b048056c1e781d1a266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abc6090666d691fe28de8b048056c1e781d1a266/0_0_2250_3000/750.jpg\" alt=\"The studio laid bare \u2026 Five Figures (3002), 2016.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The studio laid bare \u2026 Five Figures (3002), 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and CAM St Louis and Aperture, New York.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His pugilistic response to the idea of him being a \u201cnew\u201d artist is also rooted in his understanding of how the art world can and does treat black artists. Sepuya is more than aware that the fact his subjects are interracial and sexually ambiguous is one of the reasons his work has been so successful at a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/identity-politics\">identity politics</a> is \u201cin\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019ll be these moments where people are like \u2018Let\u2019s curate shows about identity\u2019 because right now everyone just loves queer stuff, right?

His more recent work, he says, does just that by deconstructing the idea of portraiture and the photographic studio. \u201cThe work from 2014 onwards is more about the mental elements of the medium and how it works.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a deliberate strategy. \u201cI want to make work so if someone is curating an exhibition about photography itself, it would be included,\u201d he says. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to be black bodies, or depictions of desire or touch. Then regardless of those moments when suddenly the people in power and influence are tired of a conversation on race or gender or whatever, we\u2019ll still be part of the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Sepuya doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do next. Whether the lockdown measures will mean his work will be on hold until he\u2019s about to be in the same room as a portrait subject.

  "<p>Two days before Ireland went into lockdown, David\u2019s wife, Maureen, went into a hospice. He stayed there with her for 10 days until she died on 3 April, ending her seven-year illness with the neurodegenerative disorder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2013/may/07/msa-memories-daughter-video\">multiple system atrophy</a>. Two days later, she was taken to a funeral home and cremated; under the lockdown rules, David was unable to attend the ceremony.</p> <p>\u201cThe hearse simply drove down our road and the neighbours all came out to clap for her,\u201d he says over the phone from his home in Kerry, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cThat was how I said goodbye after 48 years of us being together.\u201d David is now living alone, experiencing both isolation and loneliness for the first time in half a century.</p> <p>As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences, including working from home, home-schooling and online socialising, it has also, unsurprisingly, increased the loneliness of many people. Some may have felt socially isolated before physical distancing began, while others, such as David, are having to cope with life-altering experiences on their own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af75b01f3857abe56f89b0c441e34f2481e6ab6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af75b01f3857abe56f89b0c441e34f2481e6ab6d/0_44_900_1556/578.jpg\" alt=\"Maureen and David Chalmers in September 2018.\" width=\"578\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maureen and David Chalmers in September 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by David Chalmers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pamela Qualter, a professor of psychology for education at the University of Manchester, defines loneliness as \u201cnot necessarily about being on your own, but about feeling a disconnect with other people \u2013 a sense that the relationships you have aren\u2019t satisfying your emotional needs,\u201d she says. \u201cLoneliness is a subjective experience, so it\u2019s not always obvious to us. There are some people who are currently isolated who will not get lonely and there are others who will really struggle.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Qualter led <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study\">a BBC study into loneliness</a> among the British public that found that, out of the 55,000 respondents, a third said they often feel lonely. It is a situation she believes is being exacerbated by the lockdown. \u201cOur isolation is going to trigger loneliness in many people, some who might never have experienced it for extended periods of time before,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might be with your family and feel lonely, since we fall into different roles and hide parts of ourselves with family, or you might feel lonely even if you are video-calling constantly, as that can sometimes emphasise our distance from others.\u201d</p> <p>At 76 years old, David is among those most vulnerable to loneliness and its associated mental health consequences. Calls to the older people\u2019s helpline the Silver Line have increased by 31% since the outbreak of coronavirus in the UK. In the weeks since Maureen\u2019s death, though, he has been finding new ways to cope. \u201cI\u2019ve been tending to the garden and going for walks with our dog, Titch,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve also been chatting to the neighbours over the fence and I\u2019ve taken up painting again \u2013 I used to be a landscape painter, but it felt wrong to be doing it when Maureen was seriously ill. It\u2019s such a wonderful thing to be able to lose myself in now, though.\u201d</p> <p>He has also found a way to memorialise Maureen without having had the chance to spread her ashes. \u201cI keep her on a table in the living room with a picture and every time I go out I touch the box and tell her what I\u2019m up to,\u201d he says. \u201cTowards the end, when she couldn\u2019t speak, she wrote on a beach stone that she loves me; I have that there, too \u2013 it\u2019s one of my most precious possessions.\u201d</p> <p>David was one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/17/have-you-experienced-loneliness-in-coronavirus-lockdown\">more than 100 respondents to a Guardian callout</a> on how readers are coping with loneliness during the lockdown. They ranged from university students struggling to adapt to moving back in with their large families to people who had moved abroad for work and are now stuck isolating in a foreign country alone, from parents feeling lonely while attempting to homeschool their children to newly single people.</p> <p>\u201cI have a four-month-old baby at home and, even though my partner and my parents are here, I\u2019m struggling to cope with the lockdown,\u201d says Nadia (not her real name). \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being around people and I\u2019m so fortunate to have my beautiful baby and such family support, but it\u2019s still so easy to slip into a sense of loneliness.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Turner, a psychotherapist at the Counselling Directory, defines this situation as \u201cemotional loneliness \u2026 This is like the scene you get in a film where someone is singled out in a crowd, held at a standstill when others are moving all around them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows you that loneliness is an emotional disconnect, not merely a physical distance.\u201d</p> <p>Turner recommends trying to connect with at least one other person and making space for privacy if you are living in a shared home. \u201cYou need to both try to keep up your communication, to tell people if you need space and then also have somewhere to withdraw to,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re built on connection as humans, so isolation can be a confusing time, but if you can build a routine into your day and prioritise your mental health, that will be very important.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have already been calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">studies into the mental health effects</a> of coronavirus, which they say is \u201cclearly having a major social and psychological impact on the whole population\u201d. For Nadia, her weekly online therapy sessions have been a much-needed outlet. \u201cI was lucky that, when I signed up for free NHS counselling, it finally came through after the lockdown started,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been finding it really helpful talking to my counsellor about my anxieties. She recommended I use a mindfulness app each day, which has been a godsend.\u201d She has also been listening to podcasts, which help create a sense of conversation around her, and watching lots of TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"76bbf6574c1566dc4a5de37f8724acc4ea16ce50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76bbf6574c1566dc4a5de37f8724acc4ea16ce50/0_97_2316_2895/800.jpg\" alt=\"Capella.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Capella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Capella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the lockdown began, the artist Capella was accustomed to being alone. \u201cI would spend the week painting or making things at home, and then when the weekend came I would be down at the market just chatting with everyone I knew,\u201d she says. But with the lockdown and the beginning of chemotherapy treatment after a breast cancer diagnosis in December 2019, things have changed rapidly. \u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult adapting to the lockdown, because such a big part of my life was just talking to strangers and meeting new people, but now it feels like that has all been put on hold,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve been alone before, but this loneliness is new.\u201d</p> <p>Capella has taken solace in an unlikely place: her chemotherapy nurses. \u201cI have developed a friendship with the nurses at the Royal Marsden when I go once a week to have my catheter flushed,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be remembered by a nurse who has her own busy life is such a gift. It\u2019s so lovely to be thought of by someone else; it makes me feel like more than just my diagnosis.\u201d</p> <p>Another unexpected upside has come from a rekindled relationship with her 16-year-old daughter, who lives with her father in Denmark. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take my cancer diagnosis too well and we found it hard to speak for a while,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now that she\u2019s in lockdown we\u2019re texting and video-calling all the time. It\u2019s so nice that I\u2019m not having to make videos telling her how to live her life after I\u2019m gone, but rather we can have video calls about online shopping and having fun.\u201d</p> <p>For NHS workers such as Charlotte, 28, a physiotherapist, working in a hospital has been a saving grace, even though it might be more fraught than normal. \u201cI live on my own and I quite like it usually, but the lockdown has let loneliness creep in,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has been so useful being able to go to work every day. Even though it\u2019s stressful \u2013 particularly for my colleagues who are on the frontline \u2013 we chat to each other and keep our spirits up knowing that we\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas previously her colleagues might not have spoken so readily about their mental health, Charlotte believes the coronavirus pandemic has led to a need for greater help. \u201cThe chaplaincy team at the hospital has been amazing throughout this and we\u2019ve all been talking quite openly about the support we might require. It\u2019s made us all very empathetic to each other\u2019s needs.\u201d</p> <p>Capella says that this empathy has been a positive side-effect of the lockdown. \u201cWhen I have managed to chat to people on my way into the hospital, I\u2019ve been so pleasantly surprised to hear them talking about their anxieties \u2013 it\u2019s something we\u2019re all so shy about usually,\u201d she says. Kate Shurety, the executive director for <a href=\"https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/\">the Campaign to End Loneliness</a>, agrees. \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing now is what thousands of older people experience all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable lesson that we should all make an effort to help others when they don\u2019t need to be in that situation and we can use this time to try and build links to our community \u2013 something that often gets neglected in big cities.\u201d</p> <p>While the widespread use of video-calling and messaging has been a key feature of lockdown, it can have its pitfalls, even for the younger generation. Jake, 21, is self-isolating alone in his student house in Manchester and using video-calling to stay in touch with friends and family each day. \u201cWe play online quizzes and sometimes even eat our meals together over the screen, but it can be exhausting,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s because there\u2019s no background atmosphere so you\u2019re always trying to fill the silences and also not talk over each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01f22d09b6b847ffeaa316312c4c55bf70846fd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01f22d09b6b847ffeaa316312c4c55bf70846fd4/0_0_3898_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"loneliness illo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Turner says video-calling sometimes has a disassociating effect \u2013 one where you can \u201czone out\u201d of your interaction as your mind becomes confused by the lack of physical connection, despite the visual one. \u201cWe have the most technology at the moment, but possibly also the most loneliness,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep everything in moderation, otherwise you can develop an information overload with too much contact and not enough to say.\u201d</p> <p>For Jake, there are also financial concerns around the related consequences of the pandemic. He experienced coronavirus symptoms as the lockdown began and decided to isolate at university rather than return to his father\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I worked enough last summer to build up savings to keep me here, otherwise I\u2019d have nowhere to go,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest concern among my friends is not really about getting seriously ill, but about how we\u2019ll afford to return to uni or get a job when we graduate, as there\u2019s just no work at the moment. Plus, we\u2019re still spending money on data plans for video-calling and online subscriptions, so I\u2019m not sure how long this can all last.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, returning to an analogue lifestyle has been helping to keep his anxieties at bay. \u201cWeirdly enough, I\u2019ve been getting into quilting and am finding it very therapeutic, adding a bit every day to my wonky design,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been making sure to exercise a little each day to stick to some kind of routine, otherwise the weeks just bleed into each other.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, this is a difficult time for almost everyone \u2013 and acknowledging that is important. \u201cIf you are not struggling a bit at the moment, you possibly haven\u2019t understood the severity of what is going on,\u201d says the life coach Michael Bungay Stanier. \u201cOur brains hate uncertainty \u2013 we associate it with risk \u2013 and now we\u2019re being forced to live it. It\u2019s important to be kind to yourself and not feel like we should fill this time with lists of new year resolutions. Just coping is enough.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps David, for all that he has already been through, has the answer. \u201cLife is for living and you have to keep going,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen Maureen was unable to speak towards the end of her illness, that was real loneliness. But she would still smile and I know that she would want me to keep going now, too. So when this is all over, I\u2019m going to buy a little caravan and do a bit of travelling. It\u2019s important to enjoy things while you can and keep reminding yourself that this, too, shall pass.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Convicted terrorists are extremely unlikely to reoffend compared with other prisoners, research by academics and security services in Europe has found.</p> <p>The research shows that less than 5% of convicted terrorists commit a second terrorist offence after leaving prison.

They concluded that 84% of the male returnees from Syria and 95% of women returnees had distanced themselves from extremism.</p> <p>\u201cThese evaluations, together with the literature on terrorist recidivism, tend to suggest that most terrorist convicts simply do not seek to return to their \u2018old habits,\u2019 contrary to the dominant perception,\u201d said Thomas Renard, a senior research fellow at the Egmont Institute and the author of the new research.</p> <p>The two intelligence service evaluations did, however, find that a minority of released offenders remain \u201cof high concern\u201d, suggesting that \u201ca small number of die-hards will remain active across successive waves of jihadi militancy, and remain a key concern for police and intelligence services\u201d.</p> <p>There are more than 4,000 inmates in western Europe who are either returning foreign fighters, convicted terrorists, radicalised inmates or \u201cvulnerable to radicalisation\u201d. There are about 1,700 in France, of whom 90% will be released within five years, and 700 in the UK.</p> <p>The new research is supported by other academic studies that consistently indicate a very low rate of terrorist recidivism, compared with the average rates of criminal recidivism, which are generally between 40% and 60% worldwide.</p> <p>Even before the 2019 London stabbing attacks, the management of released terrorist offenders had been identified as a political priority.</p> <p>There have been a number of high-profile recidivists, such as Cherif Kouachi, who launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/charlie-hebdo-attack\">an attack</a> against the staff of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of al-Qaida.</p> <p>The fear of recidivism is further reinforced by concerns about prisons, which have been commonly described as \u201cbreeding grounds for radicalisation\u201d or \u201cuniversities of jihad\u201d.</p> <p>In the UK, an independent review of Islamist extremism in prisons concluded in 2016 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-guardian-view-on-islamist-extremism-in-prisons-above-all-dont-make-things-worse\">radicalisation in prison</a> was a growing problem that was poorly handled.</p>",
  "<p>Nightfall during Ramadan in the Middle East is drama time, when Arab soap operas accompany evening feasts with fare of feuds, historical heroes and villains and forbidden love. This year though, programmers have broached new ground using the popular shows to highlight a normalisation with Israel.</p> <p>Two series broadcast across the region in the first three days of the Muslim holy month have stirred both surprise and contention \u2013 one by daring to explore the Jewish history of the Gulf, the other by suggesting that Israel may not be an enemy and that Palestinians have been ungrateful for Saudi Arabia\u2019s support.</p> <p>The unusually pointed messages have both aired on the Saudi-controlled satellite channel MBC, offering little doubt that they had been sanctioned by the country\u2019s leaders. The broadcasts have left some viewers reeling at the spectre of Ramadan becoming a forum to showcase political shifts and others claiming they belatedly addressed issues that had been airbrushed from Saudi culture.</p> <p>When satellite TV took hold across the Middle East from the early 1990s, the appeal of Ramadan TV drama shows as a forum to project soft power soon became apparent. Leaders recognised their potential to shape debate as the popularity of the soaps surged.</p> <p>The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has included the dramas in his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-media-specialreport/special-report-egypts-strongman-extends-crackdown-to-a-new-foe-soap-operas-idUSKBN1YG1BB\">clampdown on free expression</a>, putting pressure on filmmakers to emphasise approved themes such as the glory of the military and perfidy of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. A 2016 series lauded as the first \u201cpolitical drama\u201d produced in the United Arab Emirates also focused on the \u201cevils\u201d of the Brotherhood.</p> <p>Judaism has received warmer treatment in recent years, even as Israel was still portrayed with hostility. A 2015 drama sympathetically depicted Egypt\u2019s Jewish community while emphasising them as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/world/middleeast/for-egypt-tv-shows-shocking-twist-is-its-sympathetic-jews.html\">staunchly opposed</a> to Israel\u2019s creation.</p> <p>If the first days of this year\u2019s Ramadan are any guide, 2020 breaks new ground. The characters in both series, Exit 7 and Umm Haroun, are depicted debating not whether Israel should exist but whether doing business with Israelis should override concerns.</p> <p>The stances taken in both shows are aligned with Saudi government positions, which have drawn the two countries closer than at any time since the state of Israel was formed in 1948. Mutual security concerns about Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood have been instrumental in the shift, which have also led to ties with Saudis Gulf allies thawing to the point that Israelis can now enter the UAE, and previously undisclosed trade ties are public.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister\u2019s approach has been to promote relations with the Gulf and Saudi Arabia, while at the same time marginalising the Palestinians. \u201cWhat is happening with Arab states has never happened in our history, even when we signed peace agreements,\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu has said on more than one occasion. \u201cCooperation in different ways and at different levels isn\u2019t necessarily visible above the surface, but what is below the surface is far greater than at any other period.\u201d</p> <p>Israeli media <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-officially-allows-israelis-to-travel-to-saudi-arabia-1.8445492\">reported in January</a> that Riyadh was formally allowing Israeli citizens to visit the kingdom for the first time, provided they were Muslims performing pilgrimages to Mecca or invited by the government and looking to do business.</p> <p>That month, the US president, Donald Trump, unveiled his peace plan for the region in Washington in front of diplomats from Oman, Bahrain and the UAE. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a friend of the heir to the Saudi throne, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was instrumental in drafting the plan, which offered a markedly reduced deal to the Palestinians than any earlier package and has since gone nowhere. Riyadh was officially non-committal, though some former Saudi officials <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/middle-east-peace-plan-saudi-prince-sharply-criticizes-trump-proposal.html\">sharply criticised</a> the plan\u2019s outline.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2020.

Inpatients have no access to news and only telephone contact with loved ones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In early March, Jack was an inpatient at South Pacific in Curl Curl, a Sydney beachside suburb. Each day was structured: up at 6.30am to walk along the beach, breakfast at 7.30am, group therapy for two and a half hours, intense sessions about trauma, anxiety and depression; \u201cwhat caused you to use, essentially\u201d. There were lessons about basic life skills, setting boundaries, the process of change.</p> <p>Jack was cut off from the outside world. He had just one visitor during his time at South Pacific. There were occasional 10-minute phone calls and no news. The idea was that Jack and other patients focused on their recovery with no distractions.</p> <p>When Jack emerged, he went straight to Beachwood Recovery House next door, where he planned to stay for 10 weeks. A person with serious drug misuse problems can be weaned off the physical addiction fairly quickly, but often needs weeks of gradual transition to normal life. Controls were loosened slowly. Phones were returned, Sundays were free time, and the television set was on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc7d57265346ba43ebe7edbdb6ad7f68d6c0cd63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc7d57265346ba43ebe7edbdb6ad7f68d6c0cd63/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachwood Recovery House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After leaving the rehabilitation centre, Jack spent only a week at Beachwood Recovery House before it was closed due to physical distancing measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI walked straight in and on the news was this big headline saying coronavirus, the borders are gonna shut. I was like, \u2018oh my God\u2019.\u201d Physical distancing measures had already been introduced at Beachwood, reducing numbers in therapy sessions. He spent a week there until its day programs shut down due to coronavirus fears and he was asked to leave.</p> <p>\u201cI was really upset because I didn\u2019t really want to come back to Lakes Entrance because this is where a lot of my shit happened,\u201d says Jack. The closure was abrupt. Jack\u2019s mother, Marie, drove nearly eight hours from Lakes Entrance to Sydney and picked him up on 23 March.</p> <p>\u201cShe was crying, for starters, because I hadn\u2019t seen her in a month,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said she just wanted to bring me home in isolation while this virus dies over. But she noticed a massive change in me \u2013 in the way I spoke and acted \u2013 so she was really happy.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic hasn\u2019t caused people\u2019s existing challenges to disappear. It has just added another layer of complexity for people with drug and alcohol problems. Jack is fortunate. The demand for treatment in Australia far exceeds supply, a commission investigating the rise of ice addition in New South Wales <a href=\"https://www.dpc.nsw.gov.au/assets/dpc-nsw-gov-au/publications/The-Drug-ice-1546/02-Report-Volume-1a.pdf\">found this year</a>. His parents\u2019 health insurance covered most of the $21,000 cost of rehab, although they had borrowed money to pay for the transition program.</p> <p>Isolation can also exacerbate stress and anxiety. A YouGov Galaxy survey commissioned by the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education <a href=\"https://fare.org.au/many-australians-using-more-alcohol-and-worried-about-household-drinking/\">found that 70% of Australians were drinking more alcohol</a> now than usual.</p> <p>So far, Jack is doing well at home. He\u2019s a tall, gentle-faced young man, his charm and self-deprecating humour masking two years of chaos. \u201cI\u2019m 75 days clean and sober,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a95f840515e4c64a64053797eddb9b4e7bd92f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a95f840515e4c64a64053797eddb9b4e7bd92f3e/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pamphlets at the The South Pacific Private rehabilitation centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Although Beachwood Recovery Centre has closed, the South Pacific rehabilitation facility remains open, with a 48-hour quarantine for new patients.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coronavirus has meant his Narcotics Anonymous meetings are now online, a trend experts say is likely to continue post lockdown.

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.

Yet, statistically, the recessions that shatter our dreams also improve health and increase longevity.</p> <p>It sounds crazy but it\u2019s true.</p> <p>In the 1920s, economists William F Ogburn and Dorothy S Thomas first noted mortality rates decreased during recessions. In subsequent research, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/44/5/1484/2594593\">Thomas confirmed their initial findings</a>, writing that \u201cin both England and the USA, a high death rate is associated with periods of prosperity and a low death rate with periods of [economic] depression\u201d.</p> <p>This counterintuitive trend has been noted by researchers ever since.</p> <p>In 1977, for instance, Joseph Eyer published a paper strikingly titled <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/832936\">Prosperity as a Cause of Death</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe general death rate rises during business booms,\u201d he said flatly, \u201cand falls during depressions.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, Veronica Toffolutti and Marc Suhrcke <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261519806_Assessing_the_short_term_health_impact_of_the_Great_Recession_in_the_European_Union_A_cross-country_panel_analysis\">analysed data from 23 countries</a> and concluded that \u201can increase in the unemployment rate during the Great Recession [or GFC] has had a beneficial health effect on average across EU countries\u201d.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2014/10/field-notes/health-and-economic-crises-in-conversation-with-jos-tapia\">interview </a>for the Brooklyn Rail, economist Jos\u00e9 Tapia explains that recessions change how we live. With overtime \u2013 and working hours as a whole \u2013 cut back, people can sleep more and take more exercise. They smoke and drink less; they relax more; they spend less time with dangerous industrial equipment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/a-quick-return-to-normal-in-australia-with-no-covid-19-vaccine-would-risk-lives-and-the-economy\">A quick return to normal in Australia \u2013 with no Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 would risk lives and the economy | Chris Edmond and Richard Holden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reduced numbers of people driving (either to work or for work) lowers the road toll and disperses carcinogenic fumes. Other <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/09/upside-recessions\">researchers</a> have argued that recessions might bring people together to support each other \u2013 creating strong social networks that foster better health.</p> <p>But if booms tend to foster, as Toffolutti and Suhrcke say, \u201cmostly adverse health consequences\u201d, that doesn\u2019t mean we should welcome economic crashes.</p> <p>On the contrary, the equally robust relationship between unemployment and suicide illustrates just how traumatic recessions can be. If we can\u2019t afford alcohol and tobacco we might live longer but poverty-induced restrictions do not bring happiness, any more than the prolonged lifespan of captive animals induces enthusiasm for cages.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the link between recession and longevity should encourage us to think about our economy and its logic.</p> <p>The pioneer sociologist Max Weber pointed out that, until very recently, even the most exploitative labour had been given meaning by complex webs of human relationships. It\u2019s only with capitalism, Weber says, that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic acquisition is no longer subordinated to man as the means for the satisfaction of his material needs. This reversal of what we should call the natural relationship, so irrational from a naive point of view, is evidently as definitely a leading principle of capitalism as it is foreign to all peoples not under capitalistic influence.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>For instance, Indigenous people, who typically devoted no more than three or four hours each day to seeking food, found the European system of wage labour utterly incomprehensible.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t simply the long hours of the British working day that appalled them but also the notion of work stripped of ceremony, meaning and purpose astonished Indigenous people. Henry Reynolds describes how \u201cthe historical record bristles with colonists\u2019 complaints about their problems in trying to get Aborigines to behave as \u2018voluntary labourers for wages\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey do not court a life of labour,\u201d explained a Victorian Justice of the Peace of the Indigenous people he knew in 1849. \u201c[T]hat of our shepherds and hut-keepers \u2013 our splitters or bullock drivers \u2013 appears to them one of unmeaning toil, and they would by no means consent to exchange their free unhoused condition for the monotonous drudgery of such a dreary existence.\u201d</p> <p>That attitude was not a peculiar quirk of Indigenous society.</p> <p>In Europe, too, the normalisation of the wage system depended on massive violence: in essence, the forcible dispossession of people from their traditional holdings, so that they had no choice but to seek an employer. Even then, the early industrialists complained (in a language very similar to that used by white settlers about Indigenous people) of how their new employees still yearned for the old customs that had once given their lives meaning.</p> <p>The factory owner Samuel Greg Junior vented about the \u201crestless and migratory spirit\u201d of his workers; the entrepreneur Thomas Arkwright bemoaned the difficulty in training staff \u201cto renounce their desultory habits of work and identify themselves with the unvarying regularity of the complex automaton\u201d.</p> <p>If Arkwright was indifferent to the human desires of his staff, he also didn\u2019t care about those who bought his products \u2013 except insofar as they paid him. Where feudalism rests on rights and obligations, a capitalist factory relates to the world through money.</p> <p>Furthermore, that money \u2013 or, at least, most of it \u2013 must get ploughed back into the business, since competition means companies that don\u2019t reinvest fall behind their rivals.</p> <p>With every business driven to expand or die, growth becomes the paramount imperative. It\u2019s only under capitalism that indefinite economic increase becomes both conceivable (since money can always grow) and necessary (since without expansion the system begins to fall apart).</p> <p>Experts say the recession associated with Covid-19 might mean the biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/12/global-carbon-emisions-could-fall-by-record-25bn-tonnes-in-2020\">drop in demand for fossil fuels on record</a>, with lockdown conditions drastically slashing air and passenger transport.</p> <p>Yet this significant decline in greenhouse gases does not constitute good environmental news, since the crisis will almost certainly derail what was, until recently, a burgeoning momentum for climate action.</p> <p>Governments previously under pressure to respond to global warming will instead devote themselves single-mindedly to restarting their economies \u2013 and, once the wheels of industry begin spinning, emission levels will recommence their inexorable climb.</p> <p>The degradation of labour and the degradation of the planet emerge from a similar source: an economic system that strips any control of production from ordinary people and instead operates according to a logic of relentless and destructive accumulation.</p> <p>Without constant growth, capitalism descends into crisis. Yet the carcinogenic expansion on which our prosperity depends places more and more strain on our world \u2013 and, indeed, on us.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist</p></li> </ul>"
